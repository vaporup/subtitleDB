1
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,648
This is for plastics,

2
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,501
this is for wood, this is for veneer

3
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:24,398
But use this one for painted veneer

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:28,360
And this is multi-purpose.
Use it for anything, got that?

5
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,339
Can't I just clean everything
with that one?

6
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,833
No

7
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,061
Why not...

8
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:39,114
It's not professional

9
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:40,573
I see

10
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:44,612
Why do we carry it around?

11
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,521
It's for just in case

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,425
Excuse me, we need to clean the restroom

13
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,238
Stay in touch, OK?

14
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:22,117
Yeah

15
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:24,240
And swear to me
you won't get into trouble

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,526
I won't

17
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:27,614
You swear?

18
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:28,823
Yeah

19
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:37,560
Listen

20
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,042
Why don't you divorce him, Mom?

21
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:46,610
Just get a divorce.
You're still totally fine

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,150
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,281
That's the one thing that worries me

24
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:55,030
Who else will play mother in that family?

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,426
What difference does it make?

26
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,771
It's more complicated than that

27
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,823
You sure?

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,339
Playing mother isn't all bad, you know

29
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:15,345
I just don't get it

30
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,688
I'm off

31
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,754
National Border

32
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:28,512
There's no question that
he owes 3 months' worth of lunch money

33
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:33,661
I see.
I give it to him every month

34
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:36,167
Also,

35
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:40,057
he's excused himself early...

36
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:44,202
...countless times

37
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:48,239
Do you know of a reason?

38
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,978
I don't

39
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,996
Is he bullied?

40
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:54,850
If anything, he does the bullying

41
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,617
Which student?

42
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,164
Me

43
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,373
What?

44
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:06,122
I'm an adult so it hardly bothers me,

45
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:09,323
but your son is definitely
out of place here

46
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:10,711
I see

47
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,237
It's something
your family should discuss

48
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,340
Yes

49
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,494
Hey!

50
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,190
You can't just barge in!

51
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:39,904
What is that?

52
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:40,809
It's nothing!

53
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,304
Get out!

54
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,950
What did you do with your lunch money?

55
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,967
You haven't paid in 3 months

56
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,143
I was embarrassed
when your teacher told me

57
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,856
What did you spend that 15,000 Yen on?

58
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:54,795
This?

59
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:58,031
No, I found this on the street

60
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,142
Then what did you spend it on?

61
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,898
And tell me the truth

62
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,738
On piano lessons

63
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,962
I'll get a job and pay back
the 15,000 Yen, OK?

64
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:19,914
You're kidding.
Piano lessons?

65
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:25,168
You should have told me.
I would've paid for them.

66
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,726
But you said, "No piano"

67
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,280
Yes, I did

68
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,295
But pocketing your lunch money is worse

69
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:43,291
Go ahead, learn piano

70
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:47,672
I think men who play
the piano are attractive

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,085
Don't tell Dad

72
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,946
You know he'll never let me

73
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,645
OK

74
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:38,672
Kaneko Piano School

75
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,580
Welcome home

76
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,920
It seems Kenji's been sneaking off
to piano lessons

77
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,346
I see

78
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:49,886
He's been lying to us this whole time

79
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,583
He's a mess

80
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:53,400
Kenji, get down here

81
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,758
I need to talk to you!

82
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,367
Honey, please don't get too mad at him

83
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:01,471
I won't. But he needs to hear
some straight talk

84
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,215
We got a letter from
the Kaneko Music School

85
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:18,590
It says you should apply to
the Jr. High at a Music School

86
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,843
What's going on? Tell me

87
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,769
Tell me!

88
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,908
I just studied a little piano

89
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,161
Behind our backs?

90
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,527
Who cares what I do?

91
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,510
I told you "No piano"

92
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,419
That makes no sense

93
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:51,121
If you think I don't make sense,
come out and say so

94
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:55,017
Don't go behind our backs,
hoping you won't get caught

95
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:59,216
I hate that kind of cowardly attitude
more than anything

96
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:17,075
Honey, this...

97
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,997
The letter from Kaneko

98
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:23,998
It says Kenji's a genius piano player

99
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,323
That he's a rare child prodigy

100
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,062
How can you possibly believe that?

101
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:38,194
How could our child be a prodigy?

102
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:41,533
Who the hell is this Kaneko, anyway?

103
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,934
This guy's a real bullshit artist

104
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,021
My teacher, Kaneko, isn't like that!

105
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:46,682
Besides...

106
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:47,866
What?

107
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,847
She's a she, not a guy

108
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,780
You're a real idiot

109
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,355
These music schools praise everyone

110
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,264
That's how they make a living

111
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:00,878
I'll quit playing piano!

112
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:02,407
So just leave me alone!

113
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,504
This is all
your fault for not telling us

114
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,579
You're lying

115
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,778
What was that?

116
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:23,562
You're lying when you say
you'll listen if I talk

117
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:27,459
No matter how much I talk to you,
you won't change your mind!

118
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,163
Just like Ero-Bayashi

119
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:31,833
All you really want is to lecture me
and act tough!

120
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,110
Honey, stop it!

121
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,377
Are you OK?

122
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,437
You go on upstairs

123
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,603
Don't hit him

124
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,670
Sure

125
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:52,088
Why can't he play piano?

126
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,475
Once I've said "No",
I can't take it back

127
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,667
It affects my authority as a parent

128
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,007
I was too lenient with Takashi

129
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,407
So I'm shoving our parental values down
Kenji's throat, if I have to

130
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,390
You have to help me

131
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,581
He needs a clear message from both of us

132
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,761
What's that look?

133
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,047
I saw you the other day

134
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:31,124
You were standing in the free food line
at the park

135
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:35,367
You're unemployed, right?

136
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,025
You knew?

137
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,660
Yes, all along

138
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,957
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:47,156
Because if I do,
your authority is screwed

140
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,797
Screw your authority

141
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,014
What?

142
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,473
Kenji!

143
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:31,074
Kenji!

144
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,948
Honey, call an ambulance!

145
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,049
I was just trying to catch him...

146
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,302
Shut up and call!

147
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,415
This is the 11 O'clock News

148
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,044
The U.S. Has announced
it is expanding its war

149
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:55,359
in the Middle East and is planning
a military troop surge

150
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:59,151
According to the Dept. Of Defense,

151
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,769
this deployment will include soldiers
of any nationality

152
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,709
This means it is likely
that the 138 soldiers

153
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,397
recently recruited from Japan
will also be deployed

154
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:15,641
A growing number of Japanese youths are
volunteering for the U.S. Military

155
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:19,816
We interviewed youths
in order to find out

156
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,356
what they think about this

157
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:24,165
I support it

158
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:28,271
We have a lot of trade with America,

159
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:31,089
so if American has a problem,

160
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,065
that means Japan's directly affected

161
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:39,892
So I think
it's a good thing to cooperate

162
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:44,379
with America to try to
help solve their problems

163
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,397
I think like...

164
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:52,660
like it's really great
if they're serious about it

165
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,364
I support the troops...

166
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:02,297
The Japanese Constitution explicitly

167
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:05,150
prohibits our country from going to war

168
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,778
So I couldn't believe it...

169
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,084
that our government let them join up

170
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:20,250
Kenji!

171
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,259
How is he?

172
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,242
I detected no brain abnormalities

173
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:26,373
He does have a concussion
but he's fine otherwise

174
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:27,452
Thank goodness

175
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,183
Take care

176
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,780
Thank you

177
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,571
I told you not to do that!

178
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,858
Come

179
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,995
Takashi!

180
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,098
I'm home

181
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,753
I'm exhausted

182
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,372
You should have told us
you were coming home

183
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:32,050
We saw it on the news
and were so worried about you

184
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,045
But I'm glad you're home

185
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,661
I killed so many people

186
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:57,413
I killed too many

187
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,440
Takashi...

188
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:56,074
Excuse me, I need the number
for the Foreign Ministry

189
00:17:57,822 --> 00:18:02,449
My son volunteered for the U.S. Military

190
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,719
I wanted to find out
if there's any way to determine

191
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,558
his safety

192
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:09,608
Yes

193
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,730
Whether he's safe...

194
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,992
Oh, I see

195
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,548
So it's impossible...

196
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:06,618
No!

197
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,812
It's not

198
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,554
like that

199
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:23,177
3 Hours Earlier

200
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,560
You scream, I'll kill you!

201
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,669
The cash! Where is it!

202
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,501
You don't have any?

203
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:17,765
Liar!

204
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:26,738
There's no cash here

205
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,466
Why!

206
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:10,510
That was close

207
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:15,342
She saw my face!

208
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,836
Fuck, she saw my face!

209
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,038
What should I do?

210
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:29,952
Get up!

211
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:33,442
What are you doing?

212
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,838
You're my hostage.
Come with me

213
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:43,211
May I take my jacket and purse?

214
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:03,571
Can you drive?

215
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:04,581
Yes

216
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:07,498
OK, do it!

217
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,498
Oh, right

218
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,925
What are you doing!

219
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,241
Put it back!

220
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,372
What kind of car is this?

221
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:40,729
I don't know

222
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:43,268
I just stole it

223
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:44,727
Drive!

224
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,804
Who's that!

225
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,066
My neighbor, Okada san

226
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,841
Not a cop?

227
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,086
No

228
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:13,955
Just go straight

229
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:14,927
Yes

230
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:17,748
The next left

231
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,684
Yes

232
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:22,340
You forgot to signal

233
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,627
Oh, sorry

234
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:24,531
Not those!

235
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,785
Oh, sorry

236
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:26,829
Watch the road!

237
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,109
Yes

238
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,807
Um...

239
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:54,897
What?

240
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:58,623
Can you put that thing down?

241
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,551
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

242
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,226
A lot?

243
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,501
Are you nuts?

244
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:21,935
Why, then?

245
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:28,402
I was good at picking locks

246
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,909
I could pick any lock in a flash

247
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:35,468
So I decided to go professional

248
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,151
A professional thief?

249
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:39,740
Of course not

250
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:43,497
A locksmith

251
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,291
But I quickly failed

252
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,910
I'm not a good businessman

253
00:25:57,008 --> 00:26:00,070
No matter how many times,
I always failed

254
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,395
I just can't get along with people

255
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:06,012
And now finally...

256
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,480
I even failed at robbery

257
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,857
I understand

258
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:29,597
The hell you do!

259
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:33,360
I can always crash this damned car!

260
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,655
Um, can I use the bathroom?

261
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,252
Running away?

262
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:47,275
No!

263
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,635
Welcome

264
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,378
Why did you come back?

265
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,322
That was the deal, right?

266
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,501
What are you thinking?

267
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,781
Nothing

268
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:32,798
OK

269
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,275
I'll drop you off at some station

270
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,900
I'll go on alone

271
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:43,311
You go home

272
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,663
I can't go home

273
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,022
I've come this far,

274
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,498
I can't go home now

275
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:32,435
Hey, Sasaki

276
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,848
Taguchi, what's up?

277
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:36,857
Running away

278
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:37,935
For real?

279
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:39,710
I'm so sick of it all

280
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,294
School, cram school, family hour

281
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:44,990
Give me a break

282
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:49,969
Hey, thank you

283
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,896
How about your piano lessons?

284
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,427
I quit

285
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,566
Yeah?

286
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:59,017
Grownups just please themselves

287
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:05,247
It's Dad, shit

288
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:06,528
He's chasing me

289
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:22,945
Hey, what's wrong?

290
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:25,734
It's an asthma attack

291
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:27,819
Are you OK?

292
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:36,870
Are you OK!

293
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:25,790
I'll go buy juice

294
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,147
Don't go

295
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:28,570
You'll be fine

296
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:33,469
If they find me, Dad'll beat me up

297
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,530
I'll be right back

298
00:32:24,206 --> 00:32:25,736
A dead end

299
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,101
I don't care what happens anymore

300
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:37,832
How about you?

301
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,540
I'll go see what's up ahead

302
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:30,507
Do you think I can start over?

303
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,220
From this moment on,

304
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:39,145
do you think I can start over?

305
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,008
Is that land over there?

306
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:54,447
Or a boat?

307
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:07,947
I can't see

308
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:13,903
I can't see a thing!

309
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,395
How wonderful it would be,

310
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,013
if my whole life so far, turns out
to have been a dream

311
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:18,540
And suddenly I awaken and
I'm someone else entirely

312
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,586
How can I...

313
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,415
How can I...

314
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,456
Start over...

315
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:33,345
How can I...

316
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:40,580
I want to start over

317
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,854
To start over

318
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:55,342
What am I doing...

319
00:37:57,997 --> 00:38:00,429
I'm nothing more than a string of failures

320
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:05,573
I'm just a total failure

321
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:12,082
Don't hurt yourself, please

322
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:32,435
You're the only person who can be you

323
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:38,284
That's all we have to hold onto

324
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,145
Are you...

325
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,485
actually...

326
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,096
God?

327
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,531
Hey, wake up

328
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,156
What do you think that is over there?

329
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,401
It looks like a star,
but it's so low in the sky

330
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:43,481
Hey, wake up

331
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,684
Wake up, wake up!

332
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,524
Hey!

333
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,191
Gotcha!

334
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:47,936
He was sneaking into
the baggage compartment

335
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:49,596
A fare cheater?

336
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,424
Hey, is that true?

337
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:54,512
He won't say a word

338
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,216
I understand.
I'll take him in.

339
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:03,801
Name, address, phone number, school name

340
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,498
I don't care which, tell me

341
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:13,253
You can't go home if you don't talk

342
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,740
You won't talk?

343
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:30,660
You leave me no choice but to book
you as an adult fare cheater

344
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,013
OK with that?

345
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,969
This way, straight

346
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,646
That way

347
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:22,842
Don't move

348
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:40,287
Hey, get up

349
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:46,198
They dropped your case.
You're free to go.

350
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,270
I'm home

351
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:59,771
Where's your father?

352
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,301
Not home

353
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:04,155
Aren't you hungry?

354
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,127
Yeah

355
00:49:06,973 --> 00:49:08,432
I'll cook something

356
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:41,137
What?

357
00:50:23,793 --> 00:50:27,861
Lost and Found Box

358
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,128
You look strange, Dad

359
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:52,999
This is the 9 O'clock News

360
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:55,609
Since last month,
the U.S. Military has been

361
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:58,322
expanding its war zone
in the Middle East

362
00:51:58,322 --> 00:52:01,106
But the Department of Defense
is expected

363
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:05,141
to announce yet another development
later today

364
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:08,482
According to sources,
they are expected to announce

365
00:52:08,482 --> 00:52:11,682
a pullback in U.S. Troop strength
in the Middle East,

366
00:52:11,682 --> 00:52:14,987
with the result that the 3,000

367
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:19,475
international volunteers,
including the 138 Japanese soldiers,

368
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:21,100
will be returning to
their native countries

369
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:40,966
4 Months Later

370
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,922
It's been a while

371
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,129
I hope you are all well

372
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,405
Recently,

373
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:24,916
I've learned that America isn't
the only one that's right

374
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:29,302
That is why I've decided to stay

375
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:33,303
in this country a while longer,
so I can understand them better

376
00:53:33,303 --> 00:53:37,688
I've come to the conclusion
that the best path for me,

377
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,679
is to fight alongside the people
