1
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:23,502
It's a real storm

2
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:27,947
- Hey, take this
- Yes

3
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,410
Who's in charge of the body-fat scale?

4
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,427
I think it's Shimada san

5
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,833
Right

6
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,747
We're here from Dalian, China

7
00:01:58,747 --> 00:01:59,895
I'm Shao Yen

8
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:02,296
Nice to meet you

9
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,688
Your Japanese is good

10
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,410
We've been studying night and day

11
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,541
As soon as the telephone lines
to Dalian are installed,

12
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,837
you can hire 3 young locals

13
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:16,978
like her for what you pay one
Japanese employee here

14
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,126
I understand

15
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,000
That sounds good

16
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,013
Excuse me

17
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:38,027
We're going forward with the plan to move

18
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,289
the Administration Dept. To Dalian

19
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,888
I see

20
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:48,708
I'm aware of the great job you've done
as the director of Administration

21
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,456
So, Sasaki san,

22
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,682
what will you do after
you leave Administration?

23
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:56,154
What?

24
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,751
What are your skills?

25
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,789
You tell me

26
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:04,530
What can you contribute
to our Tanita Corporation?

27
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,178
It's entirely up to you

28
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:15,567
Either you contribute your fullest here

29
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:19,078
or you leave our company

30
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,048
About that air conditioning estimate

31
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:28,649
- Oh, that
- Yes

32
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:33,102
I think we should accept
Uchida System's bid

33
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,047
What do you think, Director?

34
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:43,539
Can I have that?

35
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,235
What?

36
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,080
That

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,395
Right

38
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,423
Did you visit Hello Work?

39
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:37,815
No

40
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:41,364
You've got to stop by Hello Work
before you come here

41
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,103
Oh, right

42
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:45,365
Go before your luck runs out

43
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:49,707
Otherwise, you'll be stuck here
for life, like me

44
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:17,684
Reception Closed for Today

45
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,419
Hey

46
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,650
It's open

47
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:20,932
You sure carry a lot around

48
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,669
It's too heavy

49
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:39,856
I'm home

50
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,947
Honey!

51
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,826
When did you get home?

52
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,739
Just now

53
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:38,210
Don't surprise me like that

54
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,019
Did you get off work early?

55
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,086
Yeah

56
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,717
What are you doing?

57
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,564
Just making sure
all the doors are locked

58
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:53,545
I see

59
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,526
That's all

60
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:58,041
Anything wrong?

61
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,920
No

62
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,766
But you could use the front door

63
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,416
You're right

64
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,310
Thanks for the food

65
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,555
Sure

66
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm off

67
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,301
- Off you go
- Off you go

68
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,761
Will you be home early again today?

69
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:44,545
No, I've got a busy day

70
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,648
I see

71
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,432
Takashi?

72
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,067
Not yet

73
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,597
He's a mess

74
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,755
I'm off

75
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,143
Off you go

76
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,390
See ya

77
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:44,352
I'm home

78
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,455
Welcome home

79
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:48,944
Hungry?

80
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,224
No thanks

81
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,476
I'm going to bed.
Don't vacuum

82
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,227
So, on to the topic of mastering
honorific diction

83
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:09,680
Keigo diction is the skillful use
of 3 different types

84
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,447
of honorific speech in order to show
respect to the other person

85
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:19,561
We want you to use respectful language
to your elders,

86
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,622
so we'll investigate
the meaning of each...

87
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,983
Sasaki, what is that?

88
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,832
Show me

89
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,455
Ridiculous

90
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:44,710
I profoundly despise anyone
who would sneak this into my classroom

91
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,604
Stand

92
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,264
But...

93
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,567
You have no right to attend my class

94
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,700
Go stand in the back

95
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,405
That's not mine

96
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,388
Is that an excuse?

97
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,572
It's true

98
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,764
I was just passing it on

99
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,607
I told you to stand

100
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:05,445
In the back, hurry

101
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,087
Teacher

102
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,409
What?

103
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,228
I saw you reading porn manga
on the train the other day

104
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,759
I was sitting in front of you

105
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,577
You were trying hard to hide it,

106
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:23,646
but I could see the cover,
"Weekly Eros Mania"

107
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,361
Why do you say that?

108
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,473
Because it's true

109
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:34,113
He's got balls

110
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,277
This is hardly the place

111
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,617
You're right

112
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,242
It's not fair

113
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,371
Quiet!

114
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,520
Back to the lesson

115
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,611
So, honorific diction

116
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:54,368
Let's conjugate standard
diction into honorific

117
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,694
OK? Start with "To see"

118
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,483
Sasaki, you're amazing!

119
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,675
He looked so scared.
What a laugh

120
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,692
Let's call him Ero-Bayashi

121
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:04,493
Excellent

122
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:07,554
Ero-Bayashi! Ero-Bayashi!

123
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:12,347
Ero-Bayashi!

124
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,285
What?

125
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,419
I'm sorry about before

126
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,593
Right

127
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,829
I went too far

128
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,638
I didn't think the other kids

129
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,619
would react like that

130
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,883
You came to say that?

131
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,239
Yes

132
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,769
All this way?

133
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,567
Forget it

134
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,669
You'll graduate in less than a year

135
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,173
It's not going to change
how we get along

136
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:49,542
But that manga really isn't mine

137
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:56,332
So I didn't think it was fair
that I was the only one

138
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:58,277
who had to stand

139
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:04,265
Sasaki, let's stop poking at
each other's wounds

140
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,535
You can ignore me
and I'll ignore you, too

141
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,089
You got that?

142
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,378
Let's stop

143
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,961
More distinction between crescendo
and decrescendo, OK?

144
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,515
Again, from here

145
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,166
That's right, continue

146
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,918
A little stronger here

147
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:02,507
What was that other piece in C Major,

148
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,394
that you learned to play so well?

149
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:07,506
Let's see...

150
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,959
We're sorry to keep you waiting

151
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,195
Will the person holding ticket number 86

152
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:44,493
please proceed to window...

153
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:49,302
Your hours are midnight to 9
in the morning

154
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,319
Security guard at a factory

155
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:54,868
There's never been
a single robbery there

156
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,635
So you don't have to worry

157
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,818
Sasaki san,
how about administrative work?

158
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,419
I'm much more suited to that

159
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,265
Well,

160
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:12,543
maybe this is perfect for you

161
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,039
Please

162
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,221
A manager at a Happy Mart store,

163
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:18,735
Monday through Friday,

164
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:22,075
from 7 AM through 3 PM 850 Yen an hour

165
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,998
I wrote it in the form I gave you,

166
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:29,103
but I used to be Administrative Director
at Tanita

167
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:32,408
It's not easy to say this,

168
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:36,335
but it's 100% impossible you'll match
your former position

169
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:42,324
We're sorry to keep you waiting

170
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,092
Here you go

171
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,280
Here's this month's salary

172
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,311
Thanks

173
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:29,189
I think it's time for a new stove

174
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,505
Yeah

175
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,856
I guess it can wait 'til your Bonus

176
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,394
Where's Takashi?

177
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:51,177
He left this afternoon
for one of his classes

178
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,881
I see

179
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,143
I hope he's not getting into trouble

180
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,388
Right

181
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,199
Your qualifying exams are coming up?

182
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,966
Yeah

183
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,371
Hang in there

184
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,686
Maybe I'll play piano

185
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,117
I want to play piano

186
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:28,397
It's OK, right?

187
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,335
No

188
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:34,075
Why not?

189
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,664
It's just a whim

190
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,261
Maybe you should
play in music class at school

191
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:52,400
No means no

192
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,260
Welcome home

193
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,540
I'm home

194
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,156
I've saved your meal

195
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,959
Yeah, I'll eat it

196
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,029
Look

197
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,051
What?

198
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,616
You got your driver's license

199
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,703
But you won't use it

200
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,206
It's just a form of identification

201
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:55,627
An expensive form of identification

202
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:57,192
Use your insurance card

203
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,817
I like this one better

204
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,664
It's rice porridge today

205
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,017
Hello

206
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,099
Hello

207
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,058
It's cold today, isn't it?

208
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:14,484
Sure is

209
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,082
Please wait a little longer

210
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,607
Hello, hello

211
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,799
Thanks for your patience

212
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,434
Here you are

213
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:27,078
Thanks for your patience

214
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,644
Sorry to keep you waiting

215
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:29,960
Here you are

216
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,120
Hey, Kurosu?

217
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,929
I thought it was you, Sasaki

218
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:54,732
Long time no see

219
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,182
You haven't changed since high school

220
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,950
Neither have you

221
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,046
Sorry

222
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:06,803
Hello

223
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:12,447
Sure, OK

224
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:15,472
I'm meeting with a client right now

225
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,092
I'll talk to the Senior V.P. About
that myself

226
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,745
And don't worry about
the bid on the Municipal Hall

227
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:25,486
Sure, sure, thanks

228
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:27,894
You dropped this

229
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,391
Oh, thanks

230
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,608
You seem busy

231
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,810
You're in construction?

232
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,826
Something like that

233
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,341
What about you?

234
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:41,116
Healthcare equipment

235
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,334
Sounds great

236
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,549
Hey, what's that?

237
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:59,586
I think they're giving away food

238
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,067
You'd be surprised how many guys line up

239
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:07,209
Maybe I'll check it out

240
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,129
It's a rare chance to taste it

241
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,488
Are you by any chance, unemployed?

242
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,416
You can tell?

243
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,982
Yeah

244
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,335
Right

245
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,644
You are, too, right?

246
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,526
Yeah. Got down-sized last week

247
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:47,044
I got downsized 3 months ago

248
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,448
What about that phone call?

249
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,001
That's just for show

250
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:01,830
I do it to calm my nerves

251
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,059
I know it's stupid

252
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,277
No, it was amazing

253
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,800
Aren't you going to eat that?

254
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,471
I already ate

255
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:16,787
Yeah...

256
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,898
It tastes lousy, right?

257
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,487
Yeah...

258
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:24,922
It's lousy

259
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:41,906
You can stay here as long as you want

260
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,453
Excuse me

261
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:17,817
I set up my phone
to ring 5 times an hour

262
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,418
I didn't know you could

263
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:22,131
It's not a very well-known feature,

264
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,463
so it fools most people

265
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,123
Oh, I see

266
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:30,204
Have you told your wife yet?

267
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,873
No

268
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:33,335
You hand her the monthly cash?

269
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:34,169
Yeah

270
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:37,475
That means you'll last for a while

271
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,041
Your severance pay?

272
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,536
Have they paid it all?

273
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,030
Not yet

274
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,999
Set up a separate bank account for it

275
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,782
Any irregular deposits will stand out

276
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:50,139
Unemployment insurance?

277
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,365
I'm just applying now

278
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:56,123
Make sure to submit
all the paperwork on time

279
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,377
One day late and you're disqualified

280
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:02,726
Oops

281
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,192
You're really amazing

282
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:17,231
Ero-Bayashi

283
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,165
Now, Kobayashi's totally lost
his authority over us

284
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:25,196
Yeah

285
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:29,279
This is like a revolution

286
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,984
A revolution!

287
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:32,585
Yeah

288
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:34,428
What's wrong?

289
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,540
You're the one that started it all

290
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,044
Kenji?

291
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,214
Welcome home

292
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,555
Kenji,

293
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:01,825
I'm making donuts.
Why don't you come down?

294
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:03,141
I'm fine

295
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:06,557
Don't you want to eat donuts?

296
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:07,980
No thanks

297
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,812
Thanks for the food

298
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,136
Thanks

299
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:26,452
Hey Kenji

300
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,563
Your monthly lunch money.
Put it in your bag

301
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:32,223
It's due tomorrow, right?

302
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:49,072
In China, a massive natural gas
development project...

303
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:50,804
Want a donut?

304
00:26:55,022 --> 00:27:01,285
Let's examine China's current energy
sources breakdown

305
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:03,233
In fact, China is

306
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:06,086
the largest producer of coal
in the world,

307
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:08,243
and the world's
6th largest oil producer...

308
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:09,796
How about a donut?

309
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:13,810
In 1990,

310
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,636
they depended on coal for 76% of
their energy,

311
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,663
and 17% on oil

312
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:22,786
But by 2002,

313
00:27:22,786 --> 00:27:27,691
their coal dependency was reduced to 65%

314
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:33,741
and their oil dependency rose to 24%...

315
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,483
You were having a nightmare

316
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,759
Kaneko Piano School

317
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,569
I'd like to pay for a month of lessons

318
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,104
Thank you

319
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:18,209
Did you come alone?

320
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:22,802
They said I'm in 6th grade now,
so I'm on my own

321
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,516
OK, we'll start next week

322
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:26,796
OK

323
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,502
Do you have a piano at home?

324
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:41,933
Yes, a small one

325
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,343
Come here

326
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,704
Can you play anything?

327
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:01,659
Try playing

328
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,927
Keep playing

329
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,419
I'm home

330
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,973
Welcome home

331
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:35,968
Takashi, you're home

332
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:37,256
That's rare

333
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:38,370
I don't have work today

334
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,692
Right

335
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,223
Do you want to shower first?

336
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:42,847
No, I'll eat now

337
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,572
Kenji, it's dinnertime

338
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:47,481
Come on down

339
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:55,030
Takashi, your book

340
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,265
I'll have a beer

341
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,854
I'll get it

342
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,273
Sure tasty

343
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:07,680
Let's eat

344
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,925
Let's eat

345
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,726
It's bad

346
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,092
I'm starting to
get home early these days

347
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,824
Yeah?

348
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,729
Think she knows?

349
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:29,947
What?

350
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:31,895
Has my wife figured it out?

351
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:34,748
Just because you get home
a little early? No

352
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:38,470
She stares at me
with eyes full of mistrust

353
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,317
I'm telling you, it's bad

354
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:46,820
I have to find a way to
make her trust me

355
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,274
Let me treat you to dinner

356
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,910
What do you want?

357
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,597
Please, come to my house

358
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:57,949
OK?

359
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:08,322
I'm home

360
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:09,946
Welcome

361
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,906
Hello

362
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:16,255
My daughter, Mika

363
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:16,672
Good evening

364
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:18,098
Good evening

365
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:18,934
Junior High?

366
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,256
I'm in 8th grade

367
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:22,794
You're so tall

368
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,987
Hey, didn't you order sushi?

369
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:41,722
But you said a home cooked meal was fine

370
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:44,319
I guess I did

371
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:49,991
It's a delicious meal

372
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:05,581
Oh, no, a job-related call at this hour

373
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:15,122
Do you put in overtime every day, too?

374
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:16,861
Well, yes

375
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,793
Is the company doing that well?

376
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:23,225
All of us employees are working hard

377
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:28,931
My husband won't tell me
anything about it

378
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:37,562
The company's doing fine.
You don't need to worry

379
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,222
I see

380
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:43,998
Sasaki san,

381
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,106
please look after my husband

382
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,238
I will

383
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,544
That was our president,
calling about that estimate

384
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,534
You're the one that wrote it up,
right, Sasaki?

385
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,581
You need to be more diligent

386
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:18,443
I covered for you this time
as best I could

387
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:20,067
Get it together, OK?

388
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,031
I will

389
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,460
Please, use this

390
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,192
Oh, thank you

391
00:34:57,131 --> 00:35:00,393
You have it rough, don't you?

392
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,791
The Tokyo National Museum was...

393
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,071
I'm home

394
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:07,237
The main building was

395
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:11,365
constructed in 1938

396
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:17,526
It is a magnificent edifice,
exuding authority

397
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:24,628
Stepping inside, visitors are...

398
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:28,390
Welcome home

399
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,671
I'm home

400
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:34,062
Didn't you eat dinner?

401
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,377
No

402
00:36:36,149 --> 00:36:37,366
I thought I'd make tempura

403
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:39,767
It's been a while

404
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,879
You'll eat, right?

405
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,847
No, I already ate

406
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:48,035
I see

407
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:52,702
My boss invited me out after the meeting

408
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:55,945
I'm really wiped

409
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,368
I'm going to bed

410
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,360
I'll go to bed, too

411
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,658
Pull me up

412
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,874
Somebody, please pull me up

413
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:28,441
Sasaki Ryuhei, please

414
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:29,509
Yes

415
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:34,459
You're 46 years old?

416
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,199
Yes

417
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,530
What can you do?

418
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,722
I'm willing to do anything

419
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:43,715
That's too vague

420
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:46,880
We want to know your specific skills

421
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,339
What?

422
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:53,734
We want you to show us what you excel at

423
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,230
Right here?

424
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,901
Yes, right now

425
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:01,278
Do you mean like singing Karaoke?

426
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:08,242
What skills can you contribute
to this company?

427
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,574
That's what we want to see

428
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:11,896
Not right here, now...

429
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:17,175
Then how are we expected to
judge your merits?

430
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:25,221
I've worked in administration

431
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:28,178
so I'm confident of
my interpersonal skills

432
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:30,751
I see, what else?

433
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:35,093
What else...

434
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:38,859
Did you really do nothing to prepare,

435
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,911
figuring you might just get lucky?

436
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:42,441
No

437
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:45,219
I understand

438
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,311
Your Karaoke is fine.
Please sing.

439
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:54,513
Start singing.
What's wrong?

440
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:57,644
You're good at it, right?

441
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,046
Use that pen instead of
a microphone and sing

442
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:48,895
When you think about it,

443
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:51,849
we're like a slowly sinking ship

444
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:59,088
The lifeboats are long gone,

445
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:03,537
the water's up to our mouths

446
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,578
We know it's hopeless,

447
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:10,496
but we're still looking for an exit

448
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:16,067
But then, we don't have the courage to
dive underwater, either

449
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,329
Tell me, Kurosu, why is it?

450
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,277
I'm prepared to accept anything

451
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:23,159
But why aren't
they prepared to accept us?

452
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:32,343
The lifeboats are gone

453
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:37,638
They loaded them up with women,
children and young people

454
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:39,062
They're gone

455
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:55,138
It folds up like this,

456
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:58,408
making a perfect space for bicycles

457
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:01,991
Your whole family could go car camping

458
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:06,689
It's really great.
Get away with just the family

459
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:10,023
That's exactly what this car
is perfect for

460
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:16,570
This car is all the rage now

461
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,518
But most people find it

462
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:24,354
more attractive as a second car,
than as the family car

463
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,189
Check out this handy feature

464
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,582
The roof goes away?

465
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:11,428
Please, please

466
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:16,621
Please

467
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:20,440
Please

468
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:27,395
I can't get rid of any

469
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,202
All gone

470
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:30,338
When's that giant earthquake coming?

471
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,588
The one that'll
turn everything upside down,

472
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:36,885
beat up all those arrogant bastards,

473
00:43:36,885 --> 00:43:38,903
and make me Prime Minister,

474
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:42,023
so I can pass a No Helmet law

475
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,143
Yes, I understand

476
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:51,252
I'll notify my lawyer

477
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,272
Yes

478
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,725
Good bye, then

479
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:59,708
I won't contact you,

480
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:02,104
so please don't call me, either

481
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:03,988
OK

482
00:44:04,857 --> 00:44:06,138
Good bye

483
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:28,725
I'm sorry

484
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:30,492
That's all for today's lesson

485
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:32,759
Thank you

486
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:53,462
Don't worry about me

487
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:54,853
But...

488
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:57,115
You're worried?

489
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:58,704
Sure, you are

490
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:04,665
I went and got a divorce

491
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:09,327
Our marriage was over,
so it doesn't really change anything

492
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:12,250
Once, he was a stranger, and now,

493
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,694
we're back to being strangers again

494
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:19,660
You're not going to see him again?

495
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,257
No, never again

496
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,897
That's what marriage is like

497
00:45:28,636 --> 00:45:29,739
I understand

498
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,602
You do?

499
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:34,342
What do you understand?

500
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:37,332
How you feel

501
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,497
You do, huh?

502
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:47,215
Recently, I feel calmer being alone, too

503
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:52,051
When I'm with someone,
I end up saying the wrong thing

504
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:54,791
and we both get hurt

505
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:59,601
It's time for you to go home and study

506
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:00,881
See ya

507
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,160
Hey

508
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,405
What?

509
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,541
I need to ask you a favor

510
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:24,083
This is the Japanese version

511
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:39,159
You're signing up for
the American military?

512
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,412
Yeah

513
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:44,517
There's a new policy.
You don't have to be an American

514
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:46,426
You saw it on TV, right?

515
00:46:46,953 --> 00:46:48,542
It's news to me

516
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,041
I...

517
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,182
...already passed the paper test

518
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:57,981
Wait a minute

519
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:03,367
I only have to pass the physical exam
and the thought exam and I'm in

520
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:07,167
If you're in the military,

521
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,150
you go to war, right?

522
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,988
It depends

523
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:16,658
But you should have consulted us before

524
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,658
Have you told your father?

525
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:24,938
No

526
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:26,781
I see

527
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:31,973
The thing is, I'm still a minor,

528
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:34,164
so I need a parent to sign

529
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:36,311
Here and here

530
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,498
C'mon, sign

531
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,664
If you won't, forget it

532
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:52,883
There are organizations that'll
sponsor me instead of parents

533
00:47:52,883 --> 00:47:56,675
Don't ask some strange organization
to sign for you

534
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:58,585
Then, sign

535
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:35,953
Kurosu?

536
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:19,120
Kurosu san passed away with his wife

537
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:24,209
The other afternoon.
From gas poisoning

538
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:27,099
Really?

539
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,160
A double suicide,
but one forced the other

540
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:31,255
Welcome home

541
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:32,844
I'm home

542
00:50:56,514 --> 00:51:00,582
Honey, listen to him
and try not to get mad

543
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,669
What is it?

544
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:06,002
I want you to sign these papers

545
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:43,657
I absolutely forbid it

546
00:51:43,657 --> 00:51:44,909
Why?

547
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:48,493
I raised you so you could lead
a happy life

548
00:51:48,493 --> 00:51:50,927
This couldn't be farther from that goal

549
00:51:50,927 --> 00:51:53,537
But in the military,
you can work for peace

550
00:51:53,537 --> 00:51:55,485
That's just rationalizing

551
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:59,173
But it's true.
Why should I alone be happy?

552
00:51:59,173 --> 00:52:01,296
It's better to
make the whole world happy

553
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:02,965
The whole world?

554
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,427
What's that?

555
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:06,167
Who cares about that?

556
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:10,021
I'm not worried about the world,
I'm worried about you

557
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:13,122
Huh

558
00:52:13,681 --> 00:52:16,326
That's why Japan's so hopeless

559
00:52:16,326 --> 00:52:17,961
What?

560
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:20,883
It's the American military
that protects Japan

561
00:52:20,883 --> 00:52:22,935
So what?

562
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:27,424
Think about it, at least a little

563
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:31,321
The reason I want to join
the American military

564
00:52:31,321 --> 00:52:33,547
is to protect you and Mom and Kenji

565
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:35,357
That's how it works

566
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:37,514
Don't be a smartass

567
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:40,298
In this house, I protect you.
That's how it works

568
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:42,837
You can't just do whatever you want

569
00:52:42,837 --> 00:52:46,276
You're the one that needs to
think about it

570
00:52:47,012 --> 00:52:49,300
I don't want your protection

571
00:52:52,648 --> 00:52:54,178
Get out, then

572
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,811
Get out!

573
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:59,006
Get out!

574
00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:11,323
Forget it

575
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,348
I'll ask someone else

576
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,717
Takashi, wait!

577
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:23,787
Can't you figure out a better way
to talk to him!

578
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,909
Takashi, it's fine
if you want to leave us

579
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:29,423
But not for America

580
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:33,350
Stay in Japan and do what you can here,
OK?

581
00:53:36,068 --> 00:53:37,906
What am I supposed to do?

582
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:46,077
You say you're protecting us, Dad

583
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:49,556
But what do you do, every day?

584
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:57,003
You can't even answer me

585
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:05,664
I have to get ready

586
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,809
Can you listen to me?

587
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:51,019
Yes

588
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,567
You're talented

589
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:02,779
Extraordinarily so

590
00:55:03,552 --> 00:55:06,545
Are there any musicians
in your family or relatives?

591
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:07,901
No

592
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:11,415
I see.
You were just born with it.

593
00:55:11,415 --> 00:55:14,094
Once in a while,
there are children like you

594
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:15,790
Is that so?

595
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:22,375
I think you should go to a
Jr. High specializing in music

596
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:25,228
Of course you'll have to take an exam

597
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:29,542
But this is an important discussion
I need to have with your parents

598
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:30,725
lmpossible

599
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:32,639
Why?

600
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:35,212
My father is against my learning piano

601
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:38,623
I didn't realize...

602
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:41,197
And there's stuff going on at home

603
00:55:41,197 --> 00:55:46,033
I don't know what'll happen
if I start talking about piano...

604
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:48,399
I can explain it to them

605
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:50,625
I'll tell them myself

606
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:53,579
Please wait a little longer

607
00:56:15,224 --> 00:56:18,911
It's a cleaning job at a shopping mall.
Is that OK?

608
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:20,164
Yes

609
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:22,286
Any preference for working hours?

610
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:25,000
It's up to you

611
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,992
I see.
When can you start?

612
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:29,451
Anytime
