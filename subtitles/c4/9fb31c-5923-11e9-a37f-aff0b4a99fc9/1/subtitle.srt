1
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:44,895
Look at me.
Calm down. Calm down!

2
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,495
What happened to
the others? Look at me.

3
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,495
Fucking dead!
The whole fucking platoon!

4
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:55,095
- The Sarge totally lost it,
went nuts. Killed everyone!
- What?

5
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,495
Get off me!
Let me go!

6
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,175
They're all dead!
All fucking gone!

7
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:03,015
Ah, you son-of-a-bitch!

8
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:06,135
Let's get the fuck
outta here!

9
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:09,735
Come on, man, let's move.
Move! Come on, man. Come on!

10
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:00,896
Sarge?

11
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,016
What the hell
happened here?

12
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:20,096
They wouldn't listen.

13
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:22,536
The village was cleared.

14
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:25,536
These people are innocent.

15
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,376
They're all
fucking traitors.

16
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:31,416
You turn around and they
stab ya in the back.

17
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,496
Hey, Sarge?

18
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:39,577
My tour's up. I just
want to go home.

19
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,297
Come on. Let's go home.

20
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,457
Let's go.

21
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,777
Just like the others.
You just want to leave.

22
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:51,537
Like none of this shit
ever happened?

23
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:58,497
It happened! And it
doesn't just go away.

24
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:01,617
You just can't walk away,
d'you hear me?

25
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,097
Do you hear me?

26
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:16,297
You're a traitor, too.
Aren't you, farm boy?

27
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,657
No.

28
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:22,777
Prove it.

29
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:28,177
Kill her! Kill that
motherfuckin' traitor.

30
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:30,777
That's an order!

31
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,817
Get up. Come on!

32
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:42,057
Come on!

33
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:47,217
Come on.

34
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,977
Run!

35
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,817
No!

36
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,218
You got four minutes!
Four minutes!

37
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:29,258
- Okay, next.
- Four more.

38
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:32,018
- I mean, I can't find his tags.
- Excuse me, sir.

39
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:34,698
All right, here we go.
What the-

40
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:38,738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

41
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,498
Nice touch. I'd hate to be
the poor schmuck...

42
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:45,618
who has to explain this shit
back home to Ma and Pa, huh?

43
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,098
Sir, how do we write
this one up?

44
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,098
I mean, what do we say
happened here?

45
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,458
Nothin'. Nothin' happened
here at all.

46
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:55,818
MIA. We didn't find anyone.
D'you understand me?

47
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:59,218
What. They're gonna
call this MIA?

48
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:04,178
Lincoln, this is Eagle.
Come in. I've got
a code zebra. Can you copy?

49
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:07,258
Only a few hours ago.
At least ten bodies.

50
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:11,498
- Yes, sir. Pack 'em in ice.
- We're movin' out.

51
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:14,058
Great.

52
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:16,098
Ice.

53
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,619
Let's move it, move it, move it!
Let's go, go, go!

54
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,700
All right.
How's the picture?

55
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,740
- Pretty ugly.
- Very funny. Very funny.

56
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,340
I need a ladder.

57
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,620
Can you see me?
How's my hair?

58
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,900
Let's go.

59
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,980
- Somebody my size. Yeah.
- Systems check.

60
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,020
Next.

61
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,420
- How's the focus?
- Next.

62
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
Good. Let's go.

63
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,900
Okay, brother, go.

64
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,900
All right, so
we got 'em all.

65
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,620
We don't have much time.

66
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,701
- Position seven, status.
- They're bringing
the next one out.

67
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:31,901
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
I'll have a statement for you
later on, okay? Thank you.

68
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:36,621
Colonel, they just
killed another hostage.

69
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,941
- Current status.
- We can't even take
one of them down.

70
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:41,701
They're all linked
to an intercom system.

71
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,141
They're in the water.

72
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:59,621
Colonel. Where'd
you drop 'em off?

73
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:03,861
- About a mile and a half away.
- Mile and a half?
We got 13 minutes.

74
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,261
- Ah, yo!
- Hold on a minute. Hold on.

75
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,821
Hi. I'm with the press, CNA.
Uh. They're waiting for me
right there.

76
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,301
Right through there.

77
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,541
- I'm cancelling the remote.
- Aw, Charles, will you relax?

78
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:22,101
- We're supposed to go
live here in one minute.
- He's gonna kill me.

79
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,901
- He's absolutely gonna kill me.
- Look out.

80
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,021
- Hey, where you goin'?
- See? There she is.

81
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,181
I know. I'm running
a little late.

82
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,501
- A little?
- Well, you know that
traffic killed me.

83
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,581
- Veronica, we're live in 20.
- Twenty?
- Where the hell were you?

84
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,981
- I've been phoning
your hotel for hours.
- Your mark?

85
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,781
- I got my mark.
- Come on, come on, come on.

86
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,381
- We're on the satellite.
- Glasses.
- Glasses.

87
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,101
- Mike.
- Mike. Okay.

88
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,941
- Ten. Nine. Eight, seven-
- Nice shoes.

89
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,341
- No feet.
- Hey, stop screwin' around.
Come on.

90
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,181
- Three, and live.
- Cigarette!

91
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:59,061
With nearly 30 hostages held
inside the power station at
the base of the structure.

92
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:01,781
The gunmen claim that
they will not release
any of their prisoners...

93
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,501
until various of their comrades
are released from federal
penitentiaries...

94
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,181
- across the United States.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

95
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:09,261
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

96
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,662
Keep your eyes open.

97
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,262
Shut up!

98
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,342
I said shut up!

99
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,942
Hey, do as you're told
and you won't get hurt.

100
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,462
Quiet down.

101
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,742
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

102
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:44,502
- Colonel, they're at the tower.
- We need a unit.
- A mile and a half...

103
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,662
under four minutes?

104
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,702
They're eight seconds
behind schedule.

105
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,422
This is Veronica Roberts
reporting live for CNA.

106
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,622
- And we're out.
- See? What'd I tell ya?
No problem.

107
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:58,462
No problem? This network
does not revolve around you.

108
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:01,422
Well, what are you saying,
Charles, I'm not the center
of the universe? Is that it?

109
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,462
- Don't crack wise with me.
- Come on, lighten up, Charles.

110
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,462
I mean, okay, I don't play
the game by your rules, but
I always get you the story.

111
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:11,182
You think just because
you broke a few stories
that you're indispensable.

112
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,342
Well, I had a little chat
with the network today,

113
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:15,982
- and you know what. Ronnie?
- No, what, Chuck?

114
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,222
You're fired.

115
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:29,262
They're entering
the drain-off tunnels.

116
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,862
GR13, take aim
and hold fire.

117
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:42,622
- Checkpoint one, all clear.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

118
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:46,582
GR44 is in position.
Take aim. Fire.

119
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,662
Fire.

120
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,182
Move in and secure
the objective.

121
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,222
Clear that
image up.

122
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:56,222
Clear it.

123
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,262
Got it.

124
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,263
Interceptors are
secured and powered.

125
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:16,943
- Begin playback.
- Playback.

126
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:21,023
- Rolling.
- Checkpoint one, all clear.

127
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:23,143
Checkpoint two, all clear.

128
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:25,783
Checkpoint three, all clear.

129
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,583
They're buying it.

130
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,863
Who the hell
are these guys?

131
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:59,223
- Okay, okay, here we go.
Here we go.
- Terminate objectives.

132
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:01,343
Checkpoint three, all clear.

133
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:09,183
Activate interceptors now.

134
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,943
I think homeboy's startin'
to like this shit.

135
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:16,463
Don't be ridiculous.
Continue playback.

136
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,183
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

137
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,023
- Okay, we're inside.
- Begin phase two.

138
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,903
Phase two initiated.

139
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:48,543
- Look at this guy.
- How the hell did he-

140
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:52,663
- Hold it there, buddy!
- Hey! Hold it, pal!

141
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,103
Two gunmen, semiautomatic,

142
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:58,303
fully loaded,
main target to rear,

143
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:01,183
loaded pistol and
explosives detonator.

144
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,304
Shoot him!

145
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:19,024
You are cleared- I repeat:
You are cleared to proceed.

146
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:41,944
GR13, all clear.

147
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:45,664
No injuries. Gentlemen,
I think everybody's okay.

148
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:05,424
- Arizona team.
- GR44, status report.

149
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:12,184
- GR44, do you read me?
- Problem?

150
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:15,264
- He's- He's not responding.
- Well, try another frequency.

151
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:18,744
GR44, status report, now.

152
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,544
Kill the motherfuckin'
traitor.

153
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:25,304
That's an order!

154
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:30,784
GR44, respond!

155
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:36,144
Colonel Perry, how many
of the UniSols were
injured in the rescue?

156
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:40,064
- Who are these guys, anyway?
- I will address your questions
accordingly.

157
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:44,664
As you all know, this marks
the third successful mission
for the universal soldiers,

158
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:49,104
again without any casualties
and without any injuries.

159
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,064
As to the identity
of the UniSols,

160
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,064
- that still remains classified.
- But, Colonel-

161
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:57,705
These men have families,
and I will not do anything
to jeopardize their lives.

162
00:19:57,825 --> 00:20:00,185
- Now if you'll excuse me. I have
other matters to attend to.
- But, Colonel-

163
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:03,105
- Thank you.
- Lieutenant. Could I
have a statement, please?

164
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:06,145
There will be a complete
briefing this evening.

165
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,785
We can't shoot these guys.
What the hell are we doin' here?
We need pictures.

166
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:12,385
Lieutenant, please, just,
just one statement. Please.

167
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,425
Lieutenant!

168
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:23,745
Huey, I've got an idea.

169
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,745
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

170
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,345
I hate when you do this.

171
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:40,145
Ronnie, what are ya doing?
This is too close!

172
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,185
They're gonna see us.

173
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:52,065
We shouldn't be here.

174
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,945
All these guards. They must
still be in there, huh?

175
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,985
Yeah.

176
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:02,185
- You getting this?
- Those guys got one
hell of a mobile home.

177
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:18,225
They're turning blue.
Lowering to final stage...

178
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,905
at 60 sub-zero.

179
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:23,865
He just froze up. We can't
figure out what happened.

180
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,265
- What do you mean "froze up"?
- At the end of the mission,

181
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,625
he became completely
unresponsive.

182
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,985
- Did he overheat?
- Colonel, he hardly
broke a sweat.

183
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:36,065
GR44.

184
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:39,345
Why did you not respond?

185
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,265
What happened?

186
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,185
- Innocent.
- Innocent?

187
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,785
What do you mean
by "innocent"?

188
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:52,265
The village was cleared.

189
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:54,826
The girl was innocent,
Sarge.

190
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:57,866
Sarge? Wh-wh-who the hell's
he talkin' about?

191
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:01,666
That could be
an old memory.

192
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:04,466
I think we should take him out
of the program until we can run
some tests on him...

193
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,906
and find out what's
going on in his head.

194
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,946
- GR44 stays with the program.
- But, Colonel-

195
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:14,266
He just got a little mixed up.
Just give him the serum.

196
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:26,426
Okay. Guys, memory clearance.
Take your positions.

197
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:30,266
Activate injection.

198
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:52,066
They're moving something
else onto the Tarmac.

199
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:54,626
- We're not gonna get
anything from out here.
- Ronnie, are you nuts?

200
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:57,146
It's a classified
military operation.

201
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:59,426
You're not gonna get within
ten yards of that truck.

202
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,706
I'll be right back.

203
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:12,946
- You were confused.
- I was confused.

204
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:16,666
You must follow orders
at all times.

205
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,306
I must follow my orders.

206
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,266
- He's fine.
- Well. If you say so.

207
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:24,466
You're in charge.

208
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:39,106
Here we go.
Oh, this looks pretty bad.

209
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:44,386
Looks pretty bad.

210
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,626
As soon as the
flotation chamber is filled,
we'll have to put him in.

211
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,027
Great.

212
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,707
I always have to do this part.
I hate this part.

213
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:05,187
Hey, Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!
Can I get a little help on this?

214
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:20,107
Jesus. No casualties
or injuries, huh?

215
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:23,667
Power up the cooling generators
on the flotation chamber.
He's almost ready.

216
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,707
You got it.

217
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,787
- He's ready. Yes, sir.
- Bring him in. Thank you.

218
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,587
Prepare for flotation
chamber entry.

219
00:24:57,387 --> 00:25:00,107
Colonel, we've spotted
an intruder.

220
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,827
Who the fuck is that?
She's takin' pictures.

221
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:13,307
- Huey!
- Oh. Shit. What the hell
has she done this time?

222
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,307
Start the car!

223
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:20,467
I think now would be
a good time to leave, Huey.

224
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,587
- What'd you get?
- Redemption.

225
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,027
Let's get outta here.

226
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,307
- Shit. Watch out!
- Look what you're doin'.

227
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,868
D'you think we lost 'em?

228
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,828
How ya doin'?

229
00:25:57,948 --> 00:26:02,268
Uh, Veronica Roberts,
uh, uh, CNA.

230
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,828
You wanna help me out?

231
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:13,348
Thank you. Thank you very-
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

232
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:16,748
- Take it easy, man.
- Ow! Oh!

233
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:20,588
Let go of me!

234
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,588
- Huey. Hu-
- Okay, okay.

235
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:28,628
You all right?

236
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:31,268
Okay, they got 'em.
Bingo.

237
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,268
I want to speak
to someone in charge.

238
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:40,628
- You guys speak English?
- Awaiting instructions.

239
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:44,508
Tell them to find that film
and bring those civilians
back to base.

240
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:49,468
I'm sure that we can handle this
whole situation, all right? Uh,
if I could make a phone call.

241
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,588
- What's wrong with these guys?
- I don't know.
- GR13.

242
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,588
Get the film
and return to base.

243
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:58,588
- The film.
- Uh, fellas. Look,
I don't know where-

244
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,268
- Hey, hey,
I don't know what you-
- Hey, she didn't do anything.

245
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,228
Christ! GR13, cease fire!
Cease fire!

246
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,748
Do you read me? Cease fire!
Cease fire! I repeat:

247
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:13,268
- Fire. Fire.
- That's an order!

248
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,908
GR86, visual.

249
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,468
What the fuck is he doin'?

250
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:36,108
Stop the girl.
Shoot if you have to.

251
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:44,149
GR44. stop the car.

252
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:48,069
That is an order.

253
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:51,589
- Whaddya doin'? Whaddya doin'?
- He stopped the car.
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

254
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:55,349
What the hell you doing?
Come on! Get out of here!

255
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,349
Hey, go! Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us!

256
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:03,189
- GR44, turn the car around.
- Are you deaf?

257
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:06,029
You are simply confused.

258
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:09,909
- I'm confused.
- What are you talking about,
man? Let's go. Hit it!

259
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:14,589
- Do not listen to her.
- What the hell is that thing?

260
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:19,469
- GR44, can you hear me?
- Will you stop fuckin'-
Stupid piece of shit!

261
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:21,949
Shit! The bitch cut me off.

262
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,789
- Go!
- I must follow orders.

263
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,109
Bull shit.
Hit the road!

264
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,549
Shit!

265
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:33,629
Woodward, do something,
will ya?

266
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:39,229
Traitor.

267
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,909
He didn't do anything.

268
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,109
Well. They're not gonna get away
with this shit. I swear to God,

269
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,629
- they're not gonna
get away with this shit.
- You ready?

270
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,829
- Just about.
- We have to take him
out of the loop.

271
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:57,949
- He shot a man, for God's sake.
- Don't tell me what to do.

272
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,749
Right now I need
every soldier I've got.
We're goin' after them.

273
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:05,709
Colonel Perry.

274
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,389
We killed an innocent man.

275
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,829
What do you suggest
we do, Woodward?

276
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,629
Let that reporter run off
with one of our UniSols?

277
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,989
We can't just cover this up.

278
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:19,349
We have a moral obligation
to tell the truth about this.

279
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:23,149
I thought you were more
clever than that, Woodward.

280
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:26,469
This whole goddamn program
is off the shelf.

281
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:29,589
Do you really think
for one second those
wimps at the Pentagon...

282
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:33,309
would allow the regeneration
of dead soldiers,

283
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,950
American soldiers?

284
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,430
I don't think I can be
a part of this anymore.

285
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,710
If this is uncovered now,
we're all goin' to jail.

286
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,190
Do I make myself clear?

287
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,830
Why did you do that?

288
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,870
Why did you help me out
like that?

289
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,950
My tour's up.
Just want to go home.

290
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,110
But I can't
until you're safe.

291
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,510
Wh-what do you mean?

292
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,670
My God! You've been shot!

293
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,510
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, we
gotta stop the bleeding.

294
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,790
Oh, God.

295
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,150
Jesus Christ, it's gotta
hurt you, man.

296
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,430
The bleeding has stopped.

297
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,270
Get in here.
Secure your positions.

298
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,910
All right,
secure and lock!

299
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,830
What, wh-why are we stopping
now? What happened?

300
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,150
Out of gas.

301
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,590
We're out of gas.
Why not?

302
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,670
Shit! God!

303
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:35,591
- Oh, God.
- Tracking system activated
and we're in business.

304
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:39,311
We've picked 'em up moving due
east seven miles ahead of us.

305
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,311
Estimated time
of interception.

306
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:43,711
- Four minutes.
- Four minutes and marking.

307
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,631
How ya doin'?

308
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:08,671
You must be pretty tired
after all that,
that pushing and stuff.

309
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:12,271
Okay. Well,
I'm gonna go on the-
I'll be right back, all right?

310
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:17,711
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go make
a phone call.

311
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,751
You mind?

312
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,991
Okay? Okay.

313
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:33,471
Okay.

314
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,991
Change.

315
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:40,831
Okay. All right.

316
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:54,231
- I need some gas.
- Oh, ran out of gas yesterday.

317
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,751
Uh, refuelin' truck will
be here in the morning.

318
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:02,391
You wanna rent
a roo- room?

319
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:05,991
Nice outfit.

320
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,311
Shit.

321
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:11,351
Hey, pal, you don't
look so good.

322
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:19,431
- I need to cool down.
- Oh, well, all our rooms...

323
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,431
all have air-conditioning,
you know?

324
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:25,111
Got some with water beds.

325
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:27,312
Hey. The, uh, pay phone's out.
Do you have a phone I can use?

326
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:30,912
All our rooms all
have telephones, too,
only $50 a night.

327
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:33,872
No, no, look, I don't need
a room, I need a phone.

328
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:38,952
- What about this one?
- Oh, uh, sorry, that's, uh,
for employees only. Yeah.

329
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,392
Oh, well. Since there's
the two of you, see, that's
called double occupancy.

330
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,992
That's another ten dollars.
Yeah.

331
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:05,712
Yeah, okay. Great.

332
00:34:05,832 --> 00:34:10,592
And a matter of a small
$20 security deposit.

333
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:12,592
Of course. Twenty dollars.
Here you are.

334
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,752
- Have a nice stay.
- Great.

335
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:31,672
Great. Maybe there's already
something on the news.

336
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:00,072
Commence UniSol
deployment.

337
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:03,072
B and C teams, take
supporting positions.

338
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:09,872
GR13, seek and destroy
local communication lines...

339
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,512
in target area.

340
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:19,312
And one prays for
the expedient. Concise handling
of the terrorist situation.

341
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:23,713
In a related story.
Only hours after the rescue
at McKinley dam,

342
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,233
news reporters become
news makers.

343
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:29,353
Reporting live from
the scene, Chris Garfield.

344
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:32,633
In a surprising development.
A CNA cameraman, Huey Taylor.

345
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,513
Was shot and killed in
a motel room in neighboring
Eagle Rock City.

346
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:40,113
Witnesses allege that Veronica
Roberts, a CNA correspondent,

347
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,273
shot him after
an apparent argument.

348
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,873
- No. I don't believe it.
- Cocaine and other narcotics
were found at the scene.

349
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:47,993
No way.

350
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:52,953
No way.
I don't believe this.

351
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:55,673
They are not gonna get
away with this, man.
I mean, this is crazy.

352
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:59,873
- You must return to your room.
- There isn't- I mean,
for cryin' out loud.

353
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,953
Mother, come here.

354
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,833
There has got to be a phone that
works in this godforsaken place.

355
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,193
- This area is not secure.
- You know, why don't you-

356
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,433
What are you doing?

357
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:15,793
It's not safe for you
out here.

358
00:36:15,953 --> 00:36:17,993
Where're your clothes?

359
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:20,753
I have to-

360
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,913
I have to cool down.

361
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:33,993
My God! You're burning up!

362
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:43,473
I-I-I need i-ice.

363
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,313
Okay, okay.

364
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:50,513
Shame on ya.

365
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:57,833
GR13, continue advance.

366
00:36:57,953 --> 00:36:59,953
Target in center
of structure.

367
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,993
What the devil's she doin'
with all that ice?

368
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:11,233
Maybe I should
call the police.

369
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:15,713
I've heard of cold showers
before, but this is just
ridiculous.

370
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,634
How ya doin'?

371
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:22,234
I got all the ice
that I, I could. Uh,

372
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,834
you okay?

373
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,794
How's your-

374
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,594
Your wound.

375
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:41,234
It's, it's healing.

376
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:45,994
I'm- I'm, uh, gonna make
that phone call and, uh,

377
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,994
I'll, uh, call a doctor...

378
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:51,874
or something.

379
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:53,954
Heat and infrared check.

380
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:57,754
Munitions and firearms
identifier powered and working.

381
00:37:57,914 --> 00:38:00,394
- Don't even start
with me, all right?
- Hey!

382
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:03,274
- And take this lock off.
No, I'll take it off.
- Hey!

383
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:06,874
Hey, lady, what are you
doin' to the phone?

384
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,274
- You know how much
these things cost me?
- Sh-Shut up.

385
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:12,034
- Forget- You got
a lot of nerve.
- Will you shut up?

386
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:14,594
- This one doesn't work either.
- Huh?

387
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:17,274
Women just don't know
how to use phones.

388
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,314
You killed it!

389
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:24,674
Hey, this is coming out
of your security deposit.

390
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:29,314
Goddamn it.
He's got her in sight.

391
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,394
GR13 has a lock on the girl.
What do you want me to do?

392
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:36,154
- Tell him to wait
'til they're together.
- GR13, hold your fire...

393
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:38,794
and maintain surveillance.

394
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:58,514
Now, back to "Nixon and
the War Years, Part Seven."

395
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:01,754
We will keep America the
strongest nation in the world,

396
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:05,914
and we will couple that
strength with firm diplomacy.

397
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:08,994
No apologies,
no regrets.

398
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:11,034
Uh, there was no question
about that...

399
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:14,355
because, as you know,
when I resigned,

400
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,555
uh, later, President Ford
issued a pardon.

401
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:22,595
When I accepted the pardon.
In that I made it very clear...

402
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,075
that I regretted
what had happened.
And to what's, in effect,

403
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:28,595
an apology for what had
happened. There are, however-

404
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:30,675
I want that place
completely surrounded.

405
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:35,955
GR86 and 61, take positions
at the rear of the motel.

406
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:39,035
...on the war in
Vietnam, uh, who-

407
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:41,635
How are you. Uh-
How you feeling?

408
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:44,595
The war is over.

409
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:45,995
Maybe not.

410
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:50,795
All focus to visual. Powering
alternate scanning devices.

411
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:54,195
Motion detectors
locked in.

412
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:56,195
You know, something really weird
is going on around here.

413
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,435
None of the phones in
this entire hotel work.

414
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:01,275
I mean, there
hasn't been a storm.

415
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:27,235
Okay, we got 'em
in the second room now.

416
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,635
You better
duck and cover.

417
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:40,635
- Follow me.
- Okay.

418
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:06,675
The last wall is solid concrete.
He's not goin' anywhere.

419
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:12,436
I think we got him trapped.

420
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:16,436
Well, go ahead.
Knock it down.

421
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:19,996
What?

422
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:22,076
Get down.

423
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:29,796
Soldiers, move in.

424
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:50,556
Where in the hell is he?

425
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:53,596
- I think we lost him.
- That's impossible.

426
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:57,756
Garth, get back to your station
and get me some tracking,
for Christ's sake.

427
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:03,036
- You have a car?
- Uh-huh.

428
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,516
- Give me the keys.
- Hurry up. Tell him to hurry.

429
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:08,316
- Hurry.
- Ya got 'em?

430
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:11,116
- Thank you.
- Oh, good.

431
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,916
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

432
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:19,516
I am so, so sorry. Believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.
Really. I had no idea.

433
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:25,436
- They're leavin' the motel.
- Damn it!

434
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,036
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

435
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:55,876
Come on, Woodward.
I need you out here.

436
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,876
Way to go, Garth.

437
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:07,077
Twenty-dollar
security deposit, huh?

438
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:16,997
Woodward.

439
00:43:28,757 --> 00:43:30,757
He's trying to cool himself.

440
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:38,637
Are you sure they're
not following us?

441
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:40,477
No.

442
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:44,277
- You're such a comfort.
- Buckle up.

443
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:47,677
- I'm fine.
- It's for your safety.

444
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:49,677
How can you be
so damn calm?

445
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:53,237
I mean. Your buddies back there
just shot enough ammo at us
to destroy eastern Europe,

446
00:43:53,317 --> 00:43:57,757
and you're sitting here bitching
at me about a goddamn seat belt?

447
00:43:57,877 --> 00:44:01,517
All right, all right, all right.
Here we go. All right?

448
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:05,957
I'm all buckled up. All right,
look. Mr. Top Secret.

449
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:09,597
I want some answers, okay?

450
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:15,077
I mean, first of all, you know,
you, uh, you push a car faster
than my mother drives, okay?

451
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,917
Uh, uh, you use ice like
other people use band-aids,

452
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:20,797
and, and, and, and then you
just, you run through walls.

453
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:24,397
Now. I'm sorry,
you know. But this is not
normal human behavior.

454
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:27,917
Now just who the hell
are you?

455
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:31,317
Where are you from, anyway? Are
you from France or Canada or-

456
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:35,197
I mean, I figure you
gotta be French or something
because of your accent.

457
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:38,437
What accent?

458
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:41,757
All right, look, you. Um, you
got a family? You got friends?

459
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:45,717
I mean, is there a Mrs. 44
waiting for you someplace? Uh-

460
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:48,917
I mean, are you
avoiding my questions,
or. Or don't you know?

461
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,278
What the hell
did they do to you?

462
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:13,318
I don't know.

463
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,998
But I'm going to find out.

464
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:52,518
- Hey. Lady. No smokin'
around the pumps.
- I'm sorry.

465
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:55,318
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey, come on! Would you
quit pulling on my arm?

466
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:58,158
- It hurts.
- Park the car.

467
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:00,758
- Park the-
- Let's go.

468
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:03,678
- Park the car?
- I need some help.

469
00:46:03,798 --> 00:46:06,478
You need some help?
Oh, hey, come on. Man. I can't
help you with this thing.

470
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,558
- Get in.
- Hey! Come on!

471
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:11,158
What are you doing? Huh?

472
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:16,518
Oh, come on, man,
not this again, huh?

473
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:20,598
Is this necessary? Well,
could you at least leave
your pants on this time?

474
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:24,158
Great. Just great.

475
00:46:24,238 --> 00:46:26,358
There must be
a tracking device on me.

476
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:28,358
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

477
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:30,398
Look for something unusual.

478
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:34,358
Something hard.

479
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:39,438
Okay. All right.

480
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:46,518
Stay in shape, don't ya?

481
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:50,038
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing!

482
00:46:50,158 --> 00:46:52,278
What do you mean
park your car?

483
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:54,399
What, you never heard
of valet parking?

484
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,999
Valet. Do I look
like a valet?

485
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,399
What does this look like.
Beverly Hills?

486
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,839
Is that supposed
to be there?

487
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:06,519
Yes. Ye-yeah, it is. It's,
uh, it's very- very normal.

488
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,559
Keep going.

489
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:12,279
Right.

490
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:17,919
Update informational
computer scanning system.

491
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:21,319
They've stopped
up ahead in front of
a single-story structure.

492
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:25,439
I think I found something. Right
here on the back of your leg.

493
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,439
- Cut it out.
- Cut it out?

494
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,159
Hey, wait a minute. I-l-I
can't- I can't cut it out.
I'm not gonna cut you.

495
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,079
Oh! Oh, God!

496
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,839
Oh, shit! Shit!

497
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:56,119
You best hurry up
and get out of there.
I got a business to run here.

498
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,679
- Take it.
- What?

499
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:04,199
- Take it!
- Take it?

500
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:07,239
We don't have
too much time.

501
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:11,119
Oh, fu-
God, this is so gross!

502
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:18,039
Oh, God,
this is so gross.

503
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,759
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

504
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,919
Good.
I gotta lie down.

505
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,760
I want a complete scan
of the entire area.

506
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,200
Enabling infrared.

507
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,080
- That's his car.
- Scanning for body heat.

508
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,600
- Got it.
- Arms.

509
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,480
Pistol, fully loaded.
Desert Eagle. Semiautomatic.

510
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,000
- That's him.
- Motions and heat scan.

511
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,480
Follow tracking.
Flanking advance pattern.

512
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,880
Three teams,
north, east, south.

513
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,640
- Converge on my command.
- Team, advance.

514
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,680
Surround target.
Teams east and south,

515
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,840
prepare for break and ram.

516
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,840
Prepare for break and ram.
Full charge.

517
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,800
- Okay, guys, move in.
- Full charge.

518
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,800
No, no! He tricked us!
H-hold on!

519
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,080
Move out! Move out! All
UniSols, retreat immediately!

520
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,960
Evacuate! Let's go!
Get out of there!

521
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,600
Take cover!

522
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,040
- Take cover!
- What the hell was that?

523
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh, my God.
They're on fire.

524
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,760
Portable coolant.
Portable coolant, quick!

525
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,280
Sarge!

526
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,600
Get him out! Extinguishers!
Woodward, Garth!

527
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,560
Garth! Get over here!
Get this guy. Get this guy.

528
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,561
- Quick! Quick! Quick!
- GR74. Get GR14.

529
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:48,641
Over here, Woodward!
Get him. Get him down.

530
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,961
Damn you! Put him out,
I said! All right,
get those coolants ready!

531
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:56,001
Get that truck operating!

532
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:00,921
Woodward, get 'em over here!
Get more-

533
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:08,441
Hurry up.

534
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:10,961
- Yes. Sarge.
- God!

535
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:18,681
Whoa.

536
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:24,001
- Huh?
- Get over here!
Get over here! Get GR74!

537
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,041
Get him out!
Put that coolant on him!

538
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:32,721
- We need more extinguishers!
- Got it, got it. Let's go!

539
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,041
- Come on! Hurry!
- Huh?

540
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:38,761
Well, here I go again.
I'm outta here.

541
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:49,841
- Come on. We're gonna
lose these two, Colonel.
- $250 million apiece,

542
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:51,961
- we can't afford
to lose any of 'em.
- Buckle up.

543
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:54,681
Seat belt, right.
Okay, go. Go!

544
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:33,841
Oh, Jesus.
He should've buckled up.

545
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:37,601
He's getting up. Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

546
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:56,162
Shit! They're pullin' the plug.
Pack it up. We're headin' home.

547
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:59,202
- Everybody, back into the truck.
Come on, everybody.
- Let's go! Let's move it!

548
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:01,402
Woodward, what the hell
are you doin'?

549
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:04,242
Yes, it's ice!
Get back in the truck!

550
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,282
Pack it up!

551
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:15,882
Get back into the truck, GR13.
The mission is cancelled.

552
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,002
GR13.

553
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,802
I said it's over.

554
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:30,122
My name is Sergeant
Andrew Scott.

555
00:54:00,962 --> 00:54:04,482
He's just a mess. Lieutenant,
could you contact Colonel Perry?

556
00:54:04,602 --> 00:54:07,602
We'd like to have him
back in here. Thank you.

557
00:54:09,802 --> 00:54:11,882
You're wasting your time.

558
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:17,162
- He can't hear you.
- Jesus!

559
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:20,042
I've relieved Colonel Perry
of his command.

560
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:23,202
GR13, this mission
has been cancelled.

561
00:54:23,282 --> 00:54:26,762
I order you back
to the cooling chamber, now!

562
00:54:26,882 --> 00:54:28,802
Orders?

563
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:33,282
I'm giving the orders
from now on.

564
00:54:34,602 --> 00:54:38,163
We have a mission
to complete.

565
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,883
Any questions?

566
00:54:57,683 --> 00:54:59,123
Uh-oh.

567
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:04,843
- Somethin' to drink?
- Uh. Yeah. I'll just
have coffee.

568
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:06,883
Okay. You?

569
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:14,603
Brenda?

570
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:17,683
Yes, Joe?

571
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:21,643
Hey, uh, you want
something to drink?

572
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:26,283
- Yeah? Okay.
He'll have a soda pop.
- Great.

573
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,003
- He's not gonna make it.
- Will you just shut up?
He'll hear you!

574
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:32,083
- Dr. Haines-
- Look, if he thinks
that we failed,

575
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,123
he's gonna kill us both.

576
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:37,483
You just keep working. If he
asks anything, just stall him.

577
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:44,323
What's he doing?

578
00:55:47,003 --> 00:55:51,723
Overloading on muscle enhancers.
He's making himself stronger.

579
00:55:51,803 --> 00:55:54,843
Oh, great.
That's just what we need.

580
00:55:58,603 --> 00:56:01,683
You know, I feel like I'm
back in high school again.

581
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:05,203
I can't make heads or tails
out of any of this stuff.

582
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:08,083
But apparently, whatever
they've done to you,

583
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:11,843
it's been done
on a genetic level.

584
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:17,443
"The Surgeon General has warned
that cigarettes could be
hazardous to your health."

585
00:56:17,563 --> 00:56:20,403
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you read.

586
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:27,123
- Hey. Hey, hey!
That is my last pack.
- Are you ready to order?

587
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:29,643
Uh, uh. Uh, yeah.
Just, uh-

588
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:32,644
Just bring us
two of your specials.

589
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,124
N-Now look,
they constantly refer to
a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

590
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:38,404
Now, do you recognize
that name?

591
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,724
No?

592
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,084
Nothing. Hmm.

593
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,804
I think I saw a number
in here somewhere.

594
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:48,604
Do you think
you can help me?

595
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:51,324
Well, it's, uh,
definitely worth a shot.

596
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:01,844
- What?
- Why are you doing
all this for me?

597
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:06,844
I'm not. All right?

598
00:57:06,964 --> 00:57:10,564
I'm not doing all this for you.
I'm doing it for me.

599
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:12,684
I mean, you may not
realize this yet, but...

600
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,164
you are one hell of a story.

601
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:19,924
I wouldn't worry, though.
Uh, when the truth comes out,

602
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:22,804
they'll, they'll probably
make you a hero.

603
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:28,404
Ah. Here we go. "CG."
Christopher Gregor.

604
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:34,124
All right, look, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go check this out.
You, uh, you stay here...

605
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:36,804
and wait for
the specials, okay?

606
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:40,204
All right? Oh, uh,
do you have a phone?

607
00:57:40,284 --> 00:57:42,684
Out there.

608
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:44,724
- Thanks.
- Here's the special.

609
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:34,645
Sergeant Scott.

610
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,925
Could I have
a word with you?

611
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:39,085
I'm all ears.

612
00:58:41,445 --> 00:58:45,245
Your thermal monitor.
It's registering hot.

613
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:57,765
Uh-oh. Nap time.

614
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:09,285
Are you nuts?

615
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:11,885
Why'd you tell him that?

616
00:59:12,005 --> 00:59:13,925
Quadruple his serum.

617
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:19,325
What?

618
00:59:19,445 --> 00:59:21,405
I'm going inside.

619
00:59:24,085 --> 00:59:28,165
When he sits down,
I'll give you a signal.

620
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,245
You increase the pressure,

621
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:33,845
and I'll engage the injection
device on the arm of his chair.

622
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:43,765
No, no, no.

623
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,725
It'll look better if I go.

624
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:29,086
Is there a problem. Medic?

625
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:32,646
No, I'm just checking
the, uh, injection device.

626
01:00:32,766 --> 01:00:35,406
- Was it broken?
- It's making some
strange noises.

627
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:37,326
I just wanted to make
an adjustment.

628
01:00:37,446 --> 01:00:40,726
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

629
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:45,006
Let's see if it still works.

630
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:49,646
Dr. Haines!

631
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:52,366
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you ready?

632
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:55,646
- It's memory clearance time.
- Stop it! Get up! No!

633
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:58,326
- Stop it! You're gonna kill him!
- Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!

634
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:01,206
- Let him go!
- No!

635
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:07,166
- Don't. Stop it!
- Get off me! Get off me!

636
01:01:07,286 --> 01:01:09,246
Get off of me!

637
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,926
Shit. A fax.

638
01:01:47,886 --> 01:01:50,926
Hey. You got enough money
to pay for all this?

639
01:01:52,646 --> 01:01:54,926
You know, money? Cash?

640
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:57,406
Dollars? Dinero?

641
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:05,006
Hank!

642
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:08,686
- Yeah.
- We got ourselves
a deadbeat back here.

643
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:13,046
- What?
- He can't pay.

644
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:15,406
Move it, Brenda.

645
01:02:15,526 --> 01:02:19,367
Hey, punk, I been slavin'
all day makin' that slop.

646
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,487
- The food is good.
- Fuckin' A it is.

647
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:28,807
The question is. How are
you going to pay for it?

648
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:33,207
I don't know.

649
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:35,767
You don't know.
Ain't that cute.

650
01:02:35,847 --> 01:02:38,407
I'm gonna bust
your head, punk.

651
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,687
I don't want to hurt you.

652
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:44,687
Me? You don't want
to hurt Hank?

653
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:14,167
I just want to eat.

654
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,687
- Operator.
- Uh, yeah. Operator,
uh, a local number:

655
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:20,127
Prefix KL5,
a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

656
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:28,527
Hey, look, you ugly
son-of-a-bitch!

657
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:48,647
Hey! You better put that down,
you son-of-a-bitch, because now
I'm gonna make you bleed!

658
01:03:48,727 --> 01:03:50,247
- May I help you?
- Uh, Veteran's Hospital?

659
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:52,847
- Yes.
- Great. Operator, can you
tell me exactly where that is?

660
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,847
- 1087 Clinton Avenue.
- Clinton. Wonderful.

661
01:03:55,927 --> 01:03:57,887
Thank you very much.

662
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,167
Oh, shit.

663
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:25,888
How was lunch, huh?

664
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:08,168
I'm lookin' for a deserter.

665
01:05:08,328 --> 01:05:11,288
He's traveling
with a female POW.

666
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:15,488
- Beat it, asshole.
- Hey. Soldier boy.
I'll be your POW.

667
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:18,688
Nice necklace. I got one
just like it made out of noses.

668
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,928
Now, they're in this
white and yellow Buick...

669
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:31,568
with no front or rear window.

670
01:05:31,688 --> 01:05:34,328
Does that refresh your memory?

671
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:49,048
GR74.

672
01:05:49,168 --> 01:05:52,608
Sergeant Scott
has issued an order.

673
01:05:52,728 --> 01:05:54,808
Will you obey that order?

674
01:05:54,928 --> 01:05:58,128
Yes, sir.

675
01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:02,448
He would like for you
to hold this for 30 seconds...

676
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:04,488
and then drop it.

677
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:15,249
One, two, three-

678
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:18,769
- I know which way they went.
You got a pencil?
- Yeah? Sure.

679
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,369
By the way, I like your belt.
Can I have it?

680
01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:25,529
25, 26-

681
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:45,209
Hey! Where's the freezer?

682
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:23,569
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, we would like
to speak with Dr. Gregor?

683
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:26,609
Do you have an appointment?

684
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:28,729
Yes. Yes, we do.

685
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,409
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

686
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:39,649
- Wait in there.
- Okay. Thank you.

687
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,889
Oh. God.

688
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,169
Oh, man, I'd kill for
a cigarette right now.

689
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:58,089
You would kill someone
for a cigarette?

690
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:02,129
No, no. It's an expression.
You know, a figure of speech.

691
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:06,690
I mean, I wouldn't actually
kill someone for a cigarette.

692
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:10,250
I might hurt 'em bad
at this point, but I
don't think I'd kill 'em.

693
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,650
Dr. Gregor,
excuse me.

694
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:19,970
- Yes? What is it?
- There's a young couple
here to see you.

695
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:24,050
- They say they have
an appointment.
- Appointment?

696
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:37,010
- No!
- Clear!

697
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,650
Clear.

698
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,250
It's all right, Luc.

699
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,010
It's all right.
It's over.

700
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:05,170
I-I saw it.

701
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:08,130
I remember h- home.

702
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,010
Is he all right? Let's
get him into the bathroom.

703
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,370
We have to cover him
with ice.

704
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:16,930
I said stand at attention,
private! Stand up!

705
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:30,810
Goddamn it! The whole fuckin'
platoon's droppin' like flies!

706
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,850
What the hell
are you staring at?

707
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:41,650
Do you have any idea what
it's like out there? Do you?

708
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:46,650
Well, I'm fighting this
thing, man. It's like
kick ass or kiss ass.

709
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,890
And I'm bustin' heads.

710
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:52,330
It's the only way
to win this fucking war.

711
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,770
And these shitheads,

712
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:03,931
these yellow, traitoring
motherfuckers,

713
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:08,731
they're everywhere.

714
01:10:14,651 --> 01:10:15,971
And I,

715
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:21,851
Sergeant Andrew Scott
of the U.S. Army,

716
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:29,371
I'm gonna teach 'em all.

717
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,531
- Hey. Freeze!
- Get down!

718
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:37,611
Drop your weapon!

719
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:42,171
See?

720
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:47,891
They're everywhere.

721
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,651
How could you, a doctor,
be a party to this?

722
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:56,331
I've been asking myself
that question for years.

723
01:10:56,451 --> 01:11:00,251
- Tell me how it worked.
- By hyper-accelerating
the bodies,

724
01:11:00,371 --> 01:11:05,251
we discovered that we could turn
dead flesh into living tissue.

725
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:07,251
But to make the process work,

726
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:10,091
the bodies ran at
dangerously high temperatures,

727
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:12,291
needed to be constantly cooled,

728
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:15,811
the brain sedated.
Controlled.

729
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:19,531
Otherwise, it would
eventually stroke.

730
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:22,571
- What are you saying, Doctor?
- Dr. Gregor.

731
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:25,251
Excuse me.
Yes? What is it?

732
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,411
Thanks.

733
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:37,491
Officials believe
Colonel Perry was shot and
killed early this morning.

734
01:11:37,611 --> 01:11:41,011
Authorities are still looking
for reporter Veronica Roberts.

735
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,731
Believed to be linked
to the two deaths.

736
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:47,771
- They've set you up.
- Closer to home. A robbery
at Hayes Supermarket...

737
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:49,891
turned deadly when
three armed men...

738
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:52,331
entered the supermarket
earlier today.

739
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:57,012
- The leader of the gang
was videotaped-
- Regressive traumatic recall.

740
01:11:57,132 --> 01:12:01,492
- What?
- Trauma inflicted
at the time of death.

741
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:04,052
See, in Luc's case.
He wanted to go home.

742
01:12:04,172 --> 01:12:08,172
When he awoke as a UniSol, he
returned to that single emotion.

743
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:13,252
As for Scott. He thinks
he's still in Vietnam
fighting the insurgents.

744
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,612
He doesn't realize
he's alive.

745
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,852
He's not.

746
01:12:17,932 --> 01:12:22,012
He's dead. Just like me.

747
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:26,172
- Be sure to write.
- Now boarding,
Los Angeles Express.

748
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:28,332
Now boarding.

749
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:30,772
This is insane.

750
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:33,732
You heard what the doctor said.
You need medical help.

751
01:12:33,852 --> 01:12:35,772
I think that you should just
turn yourself in...

752
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,012
and, and get started
on your treatments again.

753
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:40,972
- And then?
- Well, then we expose
everything.

754
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:43,572
I mean, Dr. Gregor
will help us.

755
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,412
I just want to go home.

756
01:12:46,532 --> 01:12:50,172
You don't seem to understand.
There's a chance
you won't make it.

757
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:52,932
- I'm already dead.
- No, you're not.

758
01:12:53,092 --> 01:12:55,732
Goddamn it, you are
not dead, all right?

759
01:12:55,852 --> 01:13:00,732
You're alive. And that is
precious. You don't just
throw that away.

760
01:13:00,812 --> 01:13:03,732
Now boarding,
Los Angeles direct line.

761
01:13:11,092 --> 01:13:13,252
A bus ticket? Wh-

762
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:15,532
To Los Angeles.

763
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,852
Well- Wh-wh-what
is this for?

764
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,892
You're safe now.

765
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:29,532
He's only coming after me.

766
01:13:29,692 --> 01:13:32,772
You know, you're, you're
making a big mistake here.

767
01:13:32,932 --> 01:13:36,012
You've got your story.
That's what you wanted.

768
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:38,932
You think-

769
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:43,612
Last call, Los Angeles
Express. Now boarding.

770
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:45,972
Last call.

771
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:50,173
Passengers bound for
Los Angeles, now boarding.

772
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,693
Last call.

773
01:14:49,293 --> 01:14:52,333
You should have left me
while you had a chance.

774
01:14:55,093 --> 01:14:57,853
What,
and miss all the fun?

775
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:29,053
Shit!

776
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:35,453
We're gonna take 'em over
to County right now. Should
get there just after lunch.

777
01:15:43,493 --> 01:15:45,814
Oh, shit!

778
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:55,534
Get rid of 'em.

779
01:15:57,934 --> 01:16:00,014
Oh, shit.

780
01:16:08,654 --> 01:16:12,694
- Got you now. Boy.
- Jesus Christ, he-
He's comin' right for us!

781
01:16:21,254 --> 01:16:23,374
Hey! Driver!

782
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,974
Get us outta here!
Help!

783
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,894
Holy shit!

784
01:16:48,614 --> 01:16:52,574
Excuse me. You should check
on your driver, pal.

785
01:16:52,694 --> 01:16:54,854
He don't look too hot.

786
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:05,254
- What do we do now?
- We have to stop the bus.

787
01:17:05,374 --> 01:17:08,294
Oh. Gee, that's a great idea.
What a concept.

788
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:17,734
What are you doing now?

789
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:19,894
What the hell!

790
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:52,775
Is it working?

791
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:09,415
- Oh, God.
- Do you want to play catch?

792
01:18:09,495 --> 01:18:11,775
What do I do?
What do I do?

793
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:22,735
Oh, shit!

794
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:26,215
Can't find it. Here.
Oh, God.

795
01:18:31,535 --> 01:18:33,775
Are we having fun yet?

796
01:18:53,735 --> 01:18:55,735
Oh, my God!

797
01:18:58,575 --> 01:19:00,855
- You jump.
- W-W-Wait a minute.

798
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:04,015
Wh-What happened to that whole
idea about stopping the bus?
I mean, I liked that idea.

799
01:19:04,175 --> 01:19:08,175
- You jump!
- I'm not goin' anywhere
without you.

800
01:19:18,455 --> 01:19:22,455
- We'll jump together.
- Okay. Together.

801
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:27,495
Okay. Okay.

802
01:19:27,575 --> 01:19:29,935
Oh, shit.

803
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:57,256
Hit him!
Hit him hard!

804
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:19,296
Get the fuck up. Soldier!
Get the fuck up!

805
01:20:25,136 --> 01:20:27,456
Fuck!

806
01:21:08,976 --> 01:21:11,936
Freeze!

807
01:21:12,056 --> 01:21:14,536
Now, hold it right there!

808
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:23,616
Turn around. Get down
on your knees right now.

809
01:21:23,736 --> 01:21:26,416
Put your hands
over your head.

810
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:29,856
Put your hands
over your head!

811
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:39,537
I had three brothers.
Come on. Let's go.

812
01:21:41,937 --> 01:21:44,297
Keys. Come on! Get up!

813
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:47,137
Money. Here. Here we go.

814
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:51,697
Thank you. Come on, here we go.
Let's go, let's go.

815
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:54,937
Get in the car.
I'll drive, I'll drive.

816
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:59,057
Come on. Get in the car.
Hurry up!

817
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:04,817
I'm gonna take you home.

818
01:22:06,937 --> 01:22:08,897
Buckle up.

819
01:22:59,537 --> 01:23:01,977
John, there's somebody
in the driveway. I think.

820
01:23:09,177 --> 01:23:10,617
Mrs. Devreux?

821
01:23:16,977 --> 01:23:21,897
John, come here!
Oh, Luc, mon fils! Luc!

822
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:38,578
Uh, wait a minute. What do
you mean Charles isn't there?

823
01:23:38,658 --> 01:23:41,418
Well, where the hell is he?

824
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:44,898
No, look, I-I don't care
what you've heard, all right?
It's not true.

825
01:23:46,658 --> 01:23:48,618
No, look-

826
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,698
- All right.
- Okay. Uh, yeah, yeah.

827
01:23:52,818 --> 01:23:56,378
- He's alive.
- I'll meet them there.

828
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,898
All right.

829
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,978
Um, I'm gonna
have to get going.

830
01:24:05,098 --> 01:24:09,538
A news van from
the network is gonna meet me
at the Sheriff's station.

831
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:13,978
They still don't believe me,
but, uh, I think we'll be able
to change their minds.

832
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:17,178
You okay?

833
01:24:17,298 --> 01:24:20,218
So many things are missing.

834
01:24:20,298 --> 01:24:22,938
So many things I remember.

835
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,818
So many things I, I can't.

836
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:30,698
Luc, it has been 25 years.

837
01:24:33,138 --> 01:24:35,338
Such a long time, 25 years.

838
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:41,178
I'll never get
those years back.

839
01:24:41,258 --> 01:24:43,218
Look at it this way:

840
01:24:45,618 --> 01:24:47,818
You look great
for a 50-year-old.

841
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:56,138
Care for a cup,
Miss Roberts?

842
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,098
Oh, um.

843
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:02,578
No, no, I, uh,
I better get going, ya know.
They'll be waiting for me.

844
01:25:07,378 --> 01:25:10,938
- Be careful. It's
turning into a downpour.
- Okay.

845
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:13,178
- Thank you. Thank you both.
- You're welcome.

846
01:25:18,818 --> 01:25:21,899
You gonna be all right?

847
01:25:22,019 --> 01:25:23,659
In time.

848
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:30,379
You know something?
I haven't smoked a cigarette
in almost two days.

849
01:25:31,819 --> 01:25:34,299
Maybe I'll quit.

850
01:25:37,339 --> 01:25:39,299
I'll see ya.

851
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:00,139
Shit.

852
01:26:00,259 --> 01:26:02,179
Where's the key?

853
01:26:03,499 --> 01:26:07,379
Oh, come on. Shit!

854
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,699
Lookin' for somethin'?

855
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,059
Ma?

856
01:26:40,979 --> 01:26:42,979
Mom? Are you there?

857
01:26:54,819 --> 01:26:56,619
Devreux!

858
01:26:56,739 --> 01:27:00,219
Devreux, can you hear me?
Nice farm.

859
01:27:00,339 --> 01:27:03,259
Exactly like you
described it back in 'Nam.

860
01:27:03,339 --> 01:27:06,859
Why don't you come out here and
join a little family reunion?

861
01:27:08,859 --> 01:27:12,979
I mean, what the hell
are you waitin' for.
Farm boy? Are you deaf?

862
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,740
Get your ass out here!

863
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,820
We have some
unfinished business. You and me.

864
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:32,940
Wow! She really
has beautiful ears.

865
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,940
Sarge.

866
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:39,460
You want me? I'm here.
Let the girl go.

867
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,740
Don't tell me
what to do, soldier.

868
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:45,780
I give the orders
around here, and you're
gonna have to learn that.

869
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:49,980
She's a fuckin'
gook traitor.

870
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,340
I gave you an order to kill her.
Now you're gonna have to
fulfill that order. Private.

871
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,100
Scott, the war...

872
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,180
is over.

873
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,460
Not for me.

874
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:09,260
Not for her. Not for you.

875
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:52,260
You can't run
from this war, soldier.

876
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,860
Not under my command, huh?

877
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:58,860
You've grown weak.

878
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:02,980
You should've
taken your...

879
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,700
medication.

880
01:29:45,621 --> 01:29:47,861
Come on. Get up and fight.

881
01:29:57,701 --> 01:30:01,261
Now I'm gonna teach you about
the chain of command, private.

882
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:06,021
When I say jump,

883
01:30:06,141 --> 01:30:10,141
you say, "How high?"
Got it? Got it?

884
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:12,981
Why can't you get it
into your fucking head?

885
01:30:20,221 --> 01:30:23,381
I gave you
an order, soldier.

886
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:27,141
Now let me see you
waste that gook traitor.

887
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:35,901
Now where're we gonna
shoot her? In the stomach?

888
01:30:37,421 --> 01:30:39,861
Nah. In the chest?

889
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:46,101
No. I think
we should shoot her...

890
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:49,061
in the head!

891
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:53,101
Ready. Fire!

892
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:59,701
It's empty!

893
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:02,421
It's empty!

894
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:10,582
Luc!

895
01:31:10,702 --> 01:31:12,742
Oh, God!

896
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:15,942
Oh, God, help!

897
01:31:16,662 --> 01:31:18,662
Come on!

898
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,582
- Luc!
- Run!

899
01:31:24,702 --> 01:31:27,022
No!

900
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:29,422
Run!

901
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:36,622
Run.

902
01:31:40,982 --> 01:31:43,462
No!

903
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:23,462
Well, that's
the spirit, soldier.

904
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:41,542
I mean, this is
a serious matter. Private.

905
01:32:41,662 --> 01:32:44,142
I can't believe you got your
poor folks involved in this too.

906
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:50,902
Well, I got
a little secret for you, boy.
You're up for a court-martial.

907
01:32:53,342 --> 01:32:55,942
- You ready to go to trial?
- Give me your best shot.

908
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:19,103
Gee, I'm awful sorry
about this, but you're
all sentenced to death.

909
01:33:24,143 --> 01:33:26,503
Say good night, asshole.

910
01:33:31,903 --> 01:33:33,823
Good night, asshole.

911
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:03,904
You're dead, soldier.

912
01:35:03,984 --> 01:35:07,264
No. I'm alive.

913
01:36:29,704 --> 01:36:33,344
You're discharged, Sarge.

914
01:36:48,304 --> 01:36:52,384
- Luc, son.
- You okay, Dad? Mom?

915
01:36:52,544 --> 01:36:54,465
Don't worry about us.

916
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,345
It's over, dear.

917
01:37:00,425 --> 01:37:02,625
Here, let me help you.

918
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,625
Are you okay?

919
01:37:34,025 --> 01:37:36,785
I have a- I have a little
bit of a headache, but-

920
01:37:43,065 --> 01:37:46,585
- Where is he?
- Around.

921
01:37:48,265 --> 01:37:50,025
How do you feel?

922
01:37:51,905 --> 01:37:54,545
Like a 50-year-old.
