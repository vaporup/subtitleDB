00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,032
No shit?
- No, I'm just kidding.

173
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:30,085
Where the heII have you been?
- Getting something for Rocky. And me.

174
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:34,263
I hope it was worth that 40 bucks
you took out of my jeans.

175
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:40,439
I remember when you weren't above
copping a coupIe bucks for some snort.

176
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,528
Grown up since then.

177
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,149
40 bucks.

178
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,862
Want to take it out in trade?

179
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,251
Are you aIright?

180
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,548
My mama used to say some peopIe
are born with no pIace to go.

181
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:11,013
I don't beIieve that. - How d'you
expIain the rotten things that happen?

182
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,672
I don't know.

183
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:19,605
Lorrie, I hope you don't mind, but
I think you got a shitty attitude.

184
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:23,605
It's pretty negative.
- It is?

185
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,478
Yeah. If you think Iike that
things onIy get worse.

186
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:31,820
When something bad happens
you got to remember a something good.

187
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:36,241
Like what?
- I got a bunch of them I use.

188
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:39,666
Like the time
we aII went down to Mexico.

189
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:43,287
Dr the smeII of my grandma's kitchen.

190
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:48,209
I don't think I have any.
- Everybody's got at Ieast one.

191
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,674
WeII, maybe the time ...

192
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,302
Na, I don't know.

193
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,345
I hope you don't think
I don't Iike you or anything,

194
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:03,720
'cause I do.
You're reaIIy pretty and nice.

195
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,026
It's just that I thought
it wouId be with someone I Iove.

196
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,901
I just thought of one.
- Yeah?

197
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:18,486
Yeah. I was in 5th grade.
You had to paint a pine tree

198
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:22,623
with snow on it.
Mine was the best one.

199
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,998
Teacher, she put it on the waII
where aII the kids couId see it.

200
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:32,003
She put a big goId star on it.

201
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,676
And aII the kids saw it.

202
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,802
You want more toast, Lorrie?

203
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,636
I gotta go to work.
- Can you take her to the bus stop?

204
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,346
Sure. Come on, Lorrie.

205
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,188
Bye.

206
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:42,197
Bye, Rocky.

207
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:10,100
Mom, do I Iook Iike
a freak to you? - No.

208
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:15,113
You aIways teII me my face doesn't
matter. But it does, doesn't it?

209
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:19,612
You think I can't even get a girI
to Iike me unIess you pay for her.

210
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,696
That's not true.
- BuIIshit!

211
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:27,364
BuIIshit yourseIf! Lots of young guys
got probIems getting girIs.

212
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:31,328
What if I was your Dad?
- I'd hate that too!

213
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:35,168
I'm sorry. Maybe I was wrong.
- Goddamn right you were!

214
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:39,840
But it had nothing to do
with your face. - BuIIshit, Mom!

215
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,681
Where are you going?

216
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,441
Hey, Rock, how's it going?

217
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,009
Your mother sometimes does
the wrong thing for the right reason.

218
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,307
You aIways stick up for her, Gar.

219
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,774
Then she pisses you off and you spIit.
Then you come back.

220
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,151
It's aII so nuts.

221
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:44,780
First time I met your mother,
she was workin' at a bar.

222
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,992
She had to wear
this cheesy IittIe two-piece thing.

223
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,574
I couId teII she hated it.

224
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:54,620
Takin' a Iot of shit
from a Iot of asshoIes.

225
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,957
I asked to take her home.

226
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,503
She said she was going to get her kid
and have his picture taken.

227
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,051
At one of those stores.

228
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:08,426
I said I'd ride her and the kid
on the bike. She Iiked that.

229
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,637
She came out of
your grandma's house with you.

230
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,189
You were 5, maybe 6.

231
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,355
WeII, shit. You didn't
Iook Iike your reguIar kid, right?

232
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:24,570
We get down to the store

233
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:27,865
and she's standing in Iine
with the rest of the mothers and kids.

234
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:31,373
AII the mothers and kids
are staring at you.

235
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:35,335
When it's your turn, she puts you
on this big red bIock.

236
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,839
The guy taking the picture
nearIy shits.

237
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:44,968
You're sitting there with your nose
and this big damn smiIe on your face.

238
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,804
I Iooked over at her ...

239
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,343
and I never saw
a woman more beautifuI

240
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:57,101
than the way she was Iooking at you.
Jesus!

241
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,040
Hey, Screech, come here.

242
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,330
Here comes Rocky.

243
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,751
I'm not going.
- Why?

244
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:26,383
I don't have anything to wear.
- I got that probIem aII the time.

245
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,760
Hey, it's my goddamn graduation!

246
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:33,055
You don't care
but it's a big deaI to me.

247
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:37,809
Remember who you are, boy.
You ain't citizen Iike your friend ...

248
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:41,733
What's his name?
With Ietters on his shirt? - Eric.

249
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:46,022
Wear your jeans, for Christ's sake.
- I can't wear jeans to my graduation.

250
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:49,867
BuIIshit!
Get me another beer and we're going.

251
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,825
What?

252
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,536
Get me another beer. Now!

253
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:22,110
We aII chipped in

254
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,399
and Gar picked it out.
- But you gotta wear it.

255
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:27,781
That's a point.

256
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,245
What do you say?

257
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,247
Thank you, everybody.

258
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,502
Go get it on.

259
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,720
Before we send our students
on to senior high, we wouId Iike

260
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:57,140
to acknowIedge some of our stars.
An academic award in EngIish

261
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,146
is presented to CaroIine MiIes.

262
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:16,823
For academic exceIIence
in mathematics:

263
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,240
Rocky Dennis.

264
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,186
Thanks.

265
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,148
Stay here. For achievement

266
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:00,872

267
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,707
for academic exceIIence
in science ...

268
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,673
Rocky Dennis!

269
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,924
That's my famiIy.

270
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,810
Have a nice summer.

271
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:54,800
I'm ...

272
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,134
reaI ...

273
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:04,679
proud ...

274
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:07,901
of ...

275
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:10,351
you ...

276
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:17,530
Rocky.

277
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:21,080
Thanks, Doze.

278
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,184
Grandma! Grandpa!

279
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,489
Mom? - Yeah?
- You up? - Yeah.

280
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,196
Mom, they're here!
- Bring them in.

281
00:27:57,618 --> 00:28:00,074
Morning, Gar.
- Mornin', Rock. - Come on.

282
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,544
Why don't you pIay this one straight?
Give your oId man a chance.

283
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:16,711
What a terrific idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

284
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,676
You go ahead.
I'II put on my wings and haIo.

285
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,341
Gotta get a picture of that.

286
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:35,403
Honey boy! - What are you
gonna do? Try out for the Nicks?

287
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:41,612
Look how taII he's getting, EveIyn!
Come on, fake, fake! That's a boy!

288
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,158
Stop that, say heIIo to the boy.

289
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,996
So, show us the new house.

290
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,716
Abe, don't start anything.
You promised, Abe.

291
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,934
Come on in.

292
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,515
HeIIo, Abe. - Hey, sonofabitch!
Look who's back! - Gar!

293
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:14,354
Let me show you my dog.
- That's aII you need, a damn dog.

294
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,899
Does she have cIeanser?
- That's not your job.

295
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:23,449
I just want to give her a hand.
I'm not going to do anything.

296
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,246
Quite a mutt.

297
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:33,083
Hey, that's terribIe. - What?
- HoIe in your infieId.

298
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,259
That's got to go.
- oh God!

299
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:40,175
oh shit!
I mean, wow! Peewee Reese!

300
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:44,546
Consider it a beIated
graduation present. - It's wonderfuI.

301
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:48,926
Why don't you show the dog to
your grandma. - OK. Come on, Screech!

302
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:02,735
Hi, Pop.

303
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,118
There she is.

304
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:15,922
Looking Iike a miIIion.
- You Iook great too, Pop.

305
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:26,470
Hey, Ma, you wanna do the windows
whiIe you're at it? - Gramps?

306
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,973
Where did you get that Peewee?
I've been Iooking for it for 2 years.

307
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,819
I found it a coupIe of months ago
in a store, just waiting for me.

308
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,276
Abe, how does it feeI to be retired?

309
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,282
It's driving me crazy. A man's onIy
as good as his Iast day of work.

310
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:49,072
How Iong are you staying, Pop?
- Hey, she's trying to get rid of us!

311
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,911
No, I wanted to make some nice Iunch.
- You cooking? No ordering out?

312
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:56,875
No, I got roast.
You Iike roast.

313
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:01,130
Yeah, I couIdn't chew it
the Iast time ...

314
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:03,925
I thought the roast was deIicious.

315
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,594
What are they Iearnin' you at schooI?
- Same oId stuff, math, history ...

316
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:15,224
Yeah? First you get an education
then a job with some security.

317
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,726
I tried to teII that to your mother.

318
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:20,311
She never went for the oId 9 to 5.

319
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:24,403
What was it you said, Rusty?
I'm reaIIy more ...

320
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,281
The freeIance type.

321
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,281
Yeah, the freeIance type!

322
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:35,996
I got her a job interview once at the
gas company. Luca Pezio's brother,

323
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:39,042
what the heII was his name?

324
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:43,463
She shows up in this kooky outfit
with her hair up to here

325
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:48,216
and these Iines painted under here.
Looked Iike she had spiders

326
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,726
under her eyes.
Remember that, Rusty?

327
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:54,849
Yeah, I remember, Pop.
The guy's name was Vinny.

328
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:59,520
He wanted to give me a job.
He aIso wanted to give me a bonus.

329
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:03,776
So, I took the bonus and
toId him to shove the job up his ass.

330
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:06,072
FIorence!

331
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,997
Rocky, find out
what time the game's on the tube.

332
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:17,283
It usuaIIy starts at two thirty
but I'II check.

333
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:31,679
Wow! Grandpa gave me tickets
