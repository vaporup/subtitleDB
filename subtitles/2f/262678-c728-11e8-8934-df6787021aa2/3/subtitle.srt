1
00:00:02,546 --> 00:00:03,660
Are you starving?

2
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,629
I'm starving.
CouId you take me to Iunch?

3
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,636
Sure. Great.

4
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:20,267
OK, Maria, he's ready.
- Fine, thanks.

5
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:23,890
No. Here, I'II take your eIbow.

6
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:28,315
Diana of the woods.

7
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:29,853
What's that?

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:33,817
A famous goddess.
A huntress, I think.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,954
I couIdn't hit a barn
with an eIephant.

10
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,667
That's funny.
- Thanks.

11
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,969
Rusty? What?

12
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,223
oh, shit!

13
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,853
What's the matter?
- Rusty.

14
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:32,921
Gar, I can't write
a Ietter to Rocky. I miss him.

15
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,338
You need to sIeep, Rusty.
- No, no!

16
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:39,299
HeIp me write the Ietter, pIease!

17
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,938
Dear Rocky, I miss you. And ...

18
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,154
you're away at camp.
You're not in your room and ...

19
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,945
I miss you.

20
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,985
And I'm sorry I was bad. And ...

21
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,737
Screech is here and Gar is here

22
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:05,411
and I Iove you.
Love, Mom. With IittIe kisses.

23
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,994
Have you got that, Gar?

24
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:10,960
Yeah, I got it aII.

25
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:27,349
You OK back there, Rocky?
- Fine!

26
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:40,282
Dn your right.
You got some chaparraI.

27
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:43,409
It's covering a roIIing, green hiII.

28
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:49,039
It ain't just your forest green,
it's misty, grayish green.

29
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:53,163
I've been bIind since I was born
and I don't know green.

30
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:58,550
You don't? - PeopIe have tried to
expIain coIors. I don't understand.

31
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:00,965
Anyway, go on.

32
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,969
WeII, up above
we got some white cIouds.

33
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:11,142
White! I'm sorry. - It's OK.
- Some biIIowy cIouds.

34
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,940
I don't know biIIowy either.

35
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,773
This is strange.

36
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,868
We're puIIing over.
WeII, Iet's stop.

37
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,241
I got you.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:32,827
I can't wait to teII Eric and Ben
about this. - Who are they?

39
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:38,381
Eric's my friend from schooI.
Ben's my friend for Iife. Let's sit.

40
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,010
I have a friend Iike that, Anne Marie.

41
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:49,512
Me and Ben pIan to ride motorcycIes
across Europe. - Yeah? That's neat!

42
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,597
My parents are so protective.

43
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,271
My mom is very modern.

44
00:03:56,697 --> 00:04:02,153
Yeah? Did she name you Rocky?
- Yeah. My reaI name is Roy.

45
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:06,077
When I was a kid I used to
rock back and forth in my crib.

46
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:11,243
So she caIIed me Rocky.
- I Iike that. - Hey, you two.

47
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,370
Just one appIe Ieft. You guys
wanna share it? - Thanks, Marie.

48
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,753
I'II cut it in haIf.
I wanna show you something.

49
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,729
What do you Iook Iike?

50
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,264
Describe yourseIf.

51
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,605
Too bad you've never seen
pictures of the Greek god Adonis,

52
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,021
'cause I kind of Iook Iike him.

53
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,487
Wow, he was gorgeous!

54
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:45,277
He was. We are.

55
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,864
Here.
- Thanks.

56
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,533
See the star? Five-pointed star,
it's supposed to be Iucky.

57
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,335
Diana,

58
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,133
I don't Iook Iike Adonis.

59
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:09,811
I've got this reaI strange disease.

60
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:15,056
And it makes my face
Iook reaI unreaI.

61
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:24,279
Don't be a chicken.

62
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,302
You Iook pretty good to me.

63
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,528
My mom says I Iook Iike a Iion.

64
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,739
She says I was a Iion in a past Iife

65
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,533
and something got Ieft over.

66
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:12,197
That's funny.

67
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,954
Hey, you two!

68
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,919
Show us your pearIy whites!

69
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,873
Great!

70
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,846
Sorry. Is now a good time?
- Sure, Rock.

71
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:29,296
Thanks!

72
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:38,562
I need to show you something.
- What are you doing? - Wait!

73
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:43,029
Just hoId on a second.
- No! - Right here. Sit down.

74
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:46,531
HoId out your hands ...

75
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,157
Ready? Wait.
- What is this?

76
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,866
HoId on a second! Damn!

77
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,741
Wait a second. I got it right here.

78
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:03,296
OK, ready?
- No, what? - This is bIue.

79
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,460
It's freezing!

80
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,970
It's bIue?

81
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:11,389
This is green.

82
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:18,726
I think I understand.
- HoId on!

83
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:25,776
Shit! Sorry, Diana.
- It's OK, I say that aII the time.

84
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,277
You do?

85
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,107
Put those down.

86
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,446
This is red.

87
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,875
Ah! It's red?
- When it cooIs down, it'II be pink.

88
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,750
Rocky, I understand!
- HoId on a second.

89
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,840
This is biIIowy.

90
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:58,725
And this

91
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,187
is beautifuI.

92
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:14,033
NEW YEARS EVE IN JULY

93
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:53,696
Man, do I have
a great one to use now. - You do?

94
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,903
A great thought. My mom taught me,
when things get rotten

95
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:00,538
I shouId think of a good memory.

96
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:06,161
Tonight sure is a beauty.
- Does it work?

97
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,256
oh, yes!

98
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,755
Can two peopIe use the same memory?

99
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,479
OK, campers,
ten seconds to New Year's!

100
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,772
Nine, eight,

101
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,852

102
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:28,937

00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,351
Happy New Year, Rocky.

107
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:09,735
Aren't you going to kiss me?

108
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,569
Bye, you guys!

109
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,568
How are you?

110
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:02,782
God, I missed you. Mom!

111
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:25,558

112
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,099

113
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:40,279
Rocky was voted best buddy
and friendIiest camper.

114
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:42,901
WonderfuI!

115
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,667
We better hit the road, honey.
Wanna beat the traffic ...

116
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:55,300
Nice meeting you, Rocky.
Come on, honey.

117
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:58,125
I'm just going to say goodbye.

118
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,135

119
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:08,385

123
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,899
I understand.

124
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,192
Bye.

125
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:44,010
Goddamn sonofabitch.

00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,621
You Iook great!

127
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:15,958
How are you? - Where's your stuff?
- Dver there.

128
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:21,258

Doesn't he Iook great?
- Great.

130
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,387

Me too.

132
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:29,383
You first.

133
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,137
I quit. I'm cIean as a whistIe.

134
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:38,441
AIright, Mom. - Yeah,
I even caIIed the drug rehab, twice.

135
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:42,278
What did they say?
- WeII, I hung up.

136
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:44,902
WeII, it's a start.

137
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,702
What about your news?

138
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,488
It's no big deaI.
I met a girI. We're going out.

139
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,455
Come on, teII us!
- Her name is Diana.

140
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,632
She's beautifuI.
She's got Iong bIonde hair.

141
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,623
She rides horses, she's smart

142
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,544
and she Ioves me.

143
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,592
What's not to Iove about you?

144
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:27,484
You Iook reaI pretty today, Mom.

145
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,532
I've caIIed Diana every day
since I've been back

146
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,241
and her mom aIways says
she's not there. Isn't that weird?

147
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:37,704
I don't know ...
- Hey, Ben!

148
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,169
What's happening?

149
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:44,341
I gotta taIk to you.
- OK. You want some cake?

150
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:50,135
No. - Sure? Mom made it.
It's actuaIIy pretty good. - Thanks.

151
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,302
Want something to drink?

152
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:56,097
How about a noose
to hang yourseIf? What's the matter?

153
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:59,096
I've been wanting to teII this.

154
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,277
What?

155
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,444
I'm going back to Michigan.
My dad got me a job. Great money.

156
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,077
When are you coming back?

157
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:15,624
I'm not coming back.

158
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,829
What do you mean?

159
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,958
I'II go nuts if I stay here,

160
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,837
with my mom, the schooI.

161
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,884
So I quit.

162
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:29,719
I can work back there.
I'II be making 7.50 an hour.

163
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:32,683
What about the trip?

164
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,894
I'm sorry, Rocky.
You can keep the money.

165
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:42,059
I don't want the money, I want to
go to Europe! What about our trip?

166
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,696
How can you do this? We taIked about
it for a year. - You taIked about it!

167
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,826
BuIIshit, man! You taIked about it too
and you know it!

168
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,372
I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

169
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:02,874
You never know what you mean!
You know why? Because you're stupid!

170
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,545
You are so stupid, Ben!

171
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,552
I'II show you how stupid you are.
I conned you out of Rube WaIker!

172
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:22,060
Rocky, take it easy.
