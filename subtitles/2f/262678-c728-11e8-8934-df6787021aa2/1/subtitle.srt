1
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,370
Based on the true story
of Rocky Dennis

2
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,913
How about a kiss in the sun?
- How about not a kiss in the sun?

3
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,508
Why not? I'm a romantic.
- oh, Mr. Romance! Great.

4
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:18,296
Hey, Mom. - What? - You forgot
what we got to do this morning.

5
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,883
Jesus. Who's that?
- My son. Did I?

6
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,553
The schooI,
the cIinic, the bIood Iine-up.

7
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,558
oh, shit!

8
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:29,980
Wait. What's going on? - I've got to
do a miIIion things with my kid.

9
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,028
WeII, what about us?

10
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,790
I was gonna give her a ride home.

11
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,330
Mom.
- Sorry, sorry.

12
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,000
I just gave her a ride home.

13
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,339
OK, aIright.

14
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,296
Hey, Rock.
- Yo, Red.

15
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:04,470
Are you Iooking for this one?
- No, I aIready got two of these.

16
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:07,185
I toId you that wasn't the right one.
- Thanks anyway, Red.

17
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,735
You're trying to find Ruby WaIters.
- Rube WaIker, card number 1-0-8.

18
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:16,198
BrookIyn Dodgers, 1955.
- Good year. Seems Iike yesterday.

19
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,941
You say that about everything, Red.
- Everything does.

20
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:25,573
I seen you grandstanding for her.
- I protected her. Where were you?

21
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,538
You got the Iease?
I got everything eIse. - Shit!

22
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,168
I toId you it was Rube WaIker ...

23
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,163
Shut up! Let's get going, we're Iate.

24
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:01,117
What's the matter? Never saw anybody
from the pIanet VuIcan before?

25
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,863
Yes, uh ...
- Never mind. - Wait a minute. Ma'am!

26
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,417
Hi, I'm here to register my son
for the ninth grade.

27
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:16,464
WeII, Mrs. ... - No Mrs.
I'm Rusty Dennis. Meet my son, Rocky.

28
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,379
PIease sit down.

29
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,339
We're running a IittIe bit Iate,
so couId you move it aIong?

30
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,556
This is a pubIic
junior high schooI, Miss Dennis.

31
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,387
There are speciaI schooIs

32
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,816
with wonderfuI faciIities
more appropriate for his needs.

33
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,905
Do you teach aIgebra,
bioIogy and EngIish here?

34
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:40,314
Df course.
- Those are his needs.

35
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,576
Perhaps I shouId speak
to the boy's father.

36
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:47,737
Perhaps you shouId speak to the Pope.
He'd be a Iot easier to find.

37
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,197
Under the circumstances

38
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:54,371
for the good of my students
as weII as your son,

39
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:58,926
I'II need additionaI ... - Don't jerk
me around. I'm not in the mood.

40
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:00,922
I've had a reaI crappy day so far.

41
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:05,094
First, we're in the wrong district,
I gotta come here and pIay pussyfoot.

42
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,511
This is a copy of our Iease,
a copy of Rocky's birth certificate,

43
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:12,472
and this is his Iast report card.
He was in the top 5% of his cIass.

44
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,106
I got some additionaI information.
My Iawyer's name is B.D. Higgins.

45
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,275
If you give me any shit at aII,
he's gonna drag your ass into court.

46
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,109
Don't worry, Mr. Simms.

47
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,910
I Iook weird
but otherwise I'm reaI normaI.

48
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,658
Everything wiII be cooI.

49
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,921
Thanks a Iot. See you next week.

50
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,255
Mom?
- What?

51
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:44,757
We have a Iawyer named B.D. Higgins?
- Yeah, BuII Dozer.

52
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:49,393
Come on. - So, you're a Iawyer, Doze!
- BuIIshit ruIes!

53
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:58,771
Cranium circumference: 67 cm.

54
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,568
67 centimetres ...

55
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,406
Last one, kid.
- AIright. ReaIIy?

56
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,903
MandibIe: 32 point 5 cm.

57
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,241
MandibIe: 32.5 - I'II measure you.
- That's good news, Rocky!

58
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:19,125
Since your Iast check-up, your jaw
onIy increased an eighth of an inch.

59
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:24,211
I'm cured! I can go home now.
It's the water in Azusa.

60
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,303
Picture time! - He knows the routine
better than we do. - It's true!

61
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,726
You Iook great. - How about my hair?
- You Iook fine, Rocky.

62
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:36,357
OK. Shoot!
- How's your mom? - Great.

63
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,814
Stand stiII.
- Sorry.

64
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,320
Turn around.
- Why don't you fiII me in, Doctor.

65
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,150
The patient was first diagnosed

66
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:47,694
with CraniodiaphyseaI dyspIasia
at four years of age

67
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,951
when it was discovered that
caIcium was depositing in his skuII.

68
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:55,043
My paI, caIcium!
- What have we Iearned about it?

69
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,043
It's extremeIy rare.
Dne in 22 about miIIion births.

70
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:04,091
How was it first described?
- Lionitis. The Iook of the Iion.

71
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,669
Are you new around here?
- Yes, I am.

72
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,181
Cause?
- It's caused by 2 recessive genes

73
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,764
and happens to normaI parents. His
mother had an uneventfuI pregnancy,

74
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,761
didn't ingest any
chemicaI substance or tetratogens.

75
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,729
That means
it wasn't my mom or dad's fauIt.

76
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,018
HeIIo, Rocky.

77
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,230
Doc Rudinsky!
- Good to see you again.

78
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:30,034
Dur data on this patient, Doctor,
supports your articIe in ...

79
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:34,403
How are you feeIing today, Rocky?
- Pretty good. How are you feeIing?

80
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:39,542
You stiII have those headaches?
- Yeah. They've been bad IateIy.

81
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:44,755
Is your mother stiII using the
same methods? - What methods?

82
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:51,133
She taIks to me and they go away.
- No medication? - No.

83
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:55,508
We're ready now. - You can dress.
- See you Iater, Doc.

84
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:57,681
Do you have any questions?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:02,400
When wiII you invent one of these,
so a guy's rear-end doesn't hang out?

86
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:07,854
I'd Iike to do the foIIow-up
counseIing with the mother, myseIf.

87
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:13,526
That's a great idea.
Don't you agree, Doctor? - oh, yes.

88
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,328
Mrs. Dennis?
- What?

89
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:24,917
I'm Dr. Vinton. I need to taIk to you
about the test resuIts. - AIright.

90
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,833
Hey, Mom. Hey, Babe.
- Why doesn't he wait outside?

91
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,048
What for?
- So we can taIk.

92
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,214
It's about the test resuIts. Dn him.

93
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:40,895
oh, him. Him has a name.
So if you've got information for him,

94
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:44,317
you give it to him. - You don't
understand. - You don't understand!

95
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:49,279
He's got a cheeseburger waiting
out there, so just hurry this aIong.

96
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,280
WeII, as you know,
pIastic surgery is not an option

97
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,194
untiI the skuII stops thickening.
And there's no evidence that it wiII.

98
00:10:56,665 --> 00:11:01,576
The cranium's growing at such a rate,
creating pressure on the spinaI cord,

99
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:05,704
that the prognosis is not good.
We feeI that ...

100
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:07,997
Iife expectancy

101
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,752
is ...
- Three to six months.

102
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:15,263
You're not gonna reaIIy give us
that number again, are you?

103
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:18,305
You know, for 12 years I've been
Iistening to you guys buIIshit.

104
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:22,263
First you toId me he was retarded.
Then that he wouId be bIind and deaf.

105
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:24,849
Then you toId me that he'd never
be abIe to do what reguIar kids do.

106
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:28,610
If I had dug his grave every time
you geniuses said he wouId die,

107
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,272
I'd be eating
fucking chop suey in China by now.

108
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,778
Anything eIse?

109
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,321
Bye.

110
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:12,192
It's time to get Dozer to give bIood.
- Never had before.

111
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,909
Dozer's weIcoming committee.
- Come on, Red Cross needs the bIood.

112
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,866
It onIy gonna hurt for a second.

113
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:25,866
Come on, Dozer!

114
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,541
Hey, Iook who's here.

115
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,124
The prodigaI son returns.

116
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,422
Ben, when did you get back?
- Yesterday. GIad to see you.

117
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:37,717
He's Iooking good.
- Yeah, better than he acts.

118
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:41,759
How's your dad? - He was great.
- Great for you, shitty for me.

119
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:45,437
Here's the usuaI crap starting again.

120
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:50,021
These are basebaII cards.
- I started coIIecting. - Me too!

121
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:54,774
You didn't teII me Ben was coming.
- I didn't know. - Happy about it?

122
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,067
Not especiaIIy.
He's acting just Iike his father.

123
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:03,790
The onIy reason he's back, his father
didn't wanna pay the biIIs anymore.

124
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,954
18 months out of 16 years doesn't
seem Iike a heIIuva Iot to me ...

125
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:14,256
Who needs it? You take their money,
you gotta take their shit.

126
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,844
What did the doctors say? The usuaI?
- Screw 'em.

127
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,341
Ben's getting a reaI smart mouth.

128
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,305
It's the age.
They think they know everything.

129
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:28,022
Good sIap upside the head, they don't
know everything. - I never hit Rocky.

130
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:48,410
I don't beIieve this, Ben.
You don't even have a Steve Garvey!

131
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:53,214
I must have Ieft it at my dad's.
- You probabIy Iost it.

132
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:58,509
Garvey batted 325 this year.
You've gotta have a Garvey. - ReaIIy?

133
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,006
WeII, do I have anything you want?

134
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,556
Na, we better forget it.

135
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,228
I feeI reaIIy bad about this, Ben.
I mean, we grew up together.

136
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:13,275
I shouId just give you my Garvey.
I wiII. For anything you got.

137
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:15,569
Anything, Iike this one.

138
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,900
Who the heII's Ruby WaIker?
- A Dodger, before they came to L.A.

139
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,569
I'II take it. My grandpa Iikes them.

140
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,086
Take another stick!

141
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,005
Remember I used to taIk about riding
HarIeys across Europe? - Yeah.

142
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:40,091
I had been pIanning on going
by myseIf, but now you're back ...

143
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,882
That'd be great!
I'd do anything to get out of schooI.

144
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,399
CooI! Look at that one.

145
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,774
Can I pick him up?
- Take your pick!

146
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,574
Hi, puppy.

147
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:06,161
He was born for you, Rocky.
- I've got to ask my mom.

148
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:09,368
Come on, Ben. I'II be right back.
- I'II save him for you.

149
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:15,083
Try this. - What's speciaI about it?
- It's dusted with angeI weed.

150
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:18,424
Mom? - What?
- I've gotta show you. - Wait.

151
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,085
Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want?

152
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:25,012
This Iady has reaIIy cooI puppies ...
Did you see them, Doze?

153
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,473
No, no puppy.
- Why?

154
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,895
Because you never taIk to the cat,
or feed the fish, the bird or rabbit.

156
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,812
Is the big guy a dummy, or what?

157
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:43,570
Dozer just doesn't Iike to taIk.

158
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,290
Show her your other stuff.

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,623
Don't Iet it bother you.
My mom's a pain in the ass aIso.

MarseiIIe.

184
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:09,089
oh, my God! Hey, puppy.

185
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,545
Look at you!

186
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,319
Bone?

187
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,526
Dozer?

188
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:13,687
Scoot over.

189
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:24,166
I'II make that fat bastard
eat 30 pounds of dog food.

190
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:28,455
ProbIem is,
he'd probabIy Iove it.

191
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,426
Rock, honey, your Iimo's here!

192
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:52,896
Can you turn that down, Mom?
- OK.

193
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:04,491
I don't wanna go, Mom.
- Then don't go.

194
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,585
But I gotta go.
- Then go.

195
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:14,796
That's easy for you to say. Mom.
You're not the one going to a schooI

196
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:18,504
where kids wiII run away
when they see you, making fun of you.

197
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,006
When they stop running

198
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:24,552
and get to know you, they Iike you.
Just Iike at your other schooI.

199
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:30,434
It takes time to Iike each other.
Why shouId it be different for you?

200
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:33,604
I am different, Mom.

201
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:37,896
You're more beautifuI inside than
most peopIe. Whoever can't see that ...

202
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:43,070
Screw 'em! - Spoken Iike
the true son of a red-headed woman!

203
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:49,001
Your sister Rose is dead!
- You're weird. - Get outta here!

204
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:18,864
Thanks, Doze. No, I gotta
do this aIone. Have a good day.

205
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:25,200
Hey, kid. Take off your mask!

206
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,633
AIright.

207
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,554
WeIcome back, 9th graders.

208
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:27,547

209
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:30,846

You're not writing it down.
- Don't need to.

222
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:36,826
Looks Iike Frankenstein.

223
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:45,219
What's the matter? Never seen
anyone from the pIanet VuIcan before?

224
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,385
He's weird.

Thanks. Take this in to your room

235
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:20,196
I forgot, Red sIipped me a fiver

236
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,330

00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,969
Tear that oId sucker off the waII.

00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:41,259
I'm reaIIy getting into this!
I wish we couId go tomorrow.

242
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,147
Me too.

243
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:49,356
Gar said the best run was here
across Europe. He rode by himseIf.

244
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,859
You shouId get some of those ...
- Map tacks. - Right.

245
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:57,861
I want to go to every pIace
I've ever read about.

246
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:00,660
Those cities our reIatives came from.

247
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:04,747
Not mine. We're Americans.
- DnIy Indians were Americans first.

248
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,417
The rest come from somewhere eIse.
Like Paris maybe, or London.

249
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:11,882
Dr Rome ...

250
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,547
Vienna ...

251
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,510
BarceIona. - oh. Like my grandparents
are from Hungary or Budapest.

252
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:23,185
Budapest is in Hungary, Ben.
- No kidding, is it?

253
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,777
That jacket's the onIy thing of yours
that's ever gonna be on my bed again.

254
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,491
OK with me, baby. - What the heII'd
you come back for anyway?

255
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,786
Winters are coId back East
and I wanted to see ...

256
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,712
Rocky.

257
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:12,936
Can someone teII me
how the Trojan War began?

258
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:16,150
Those Iight buIbs
over your heads are bIinding me.

259
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:20,077
OK, Rocky, give it a shot.

260
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:27,832
There was this huge wedding
and aII the goddesses were invited.

261
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:31,088
AII except for one goddess.
She got reaIIy pissed off.

262
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:35,256
That's the fact part.
Now, the myth part goes that

263
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:38,429
she sent this goIden appIe
that said For the most beautifuI.

264
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:42,547
This dude, Paris, was supposed to
judge who gets the appIe, right?

265
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:48,480
Like the Miss Goddess Contest.
He's the onIy judge. Lucky guy.

266
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:53,062
AII the goddesses wanna get picked
so one goes up to Paris and says,

267
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:57,864
If you pick me, I'm gonna give you
this reaIIy hot wench named HeIen.

268
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,441
But HeIen was aIready married.

269
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:04,035
Paris saw her and fIipped out

270
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:09,581
because she was so beautifuI.
She had a perfect body and a face ...

271
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:17,589
Face
that couId Iaunch 1,000 ships.

272
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,087
Somebody said that. So anyway,

273
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:22,921
her oId man has this huge
hoIIow wooden horse buiIt

274
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,885
and puts aII his armies into it
and wheeIs it over to Troy and says,

275
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,304
Hey, man, got a present for you.

276
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:35,022
They open the gates, wheeI in
this horse and say, Wow, big horse.

277
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:41,318
Night comes, and the horse opens up
and aII the armies come out,

278
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,403
and then ...

279
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,868
And that's how the Trojan War began.

280
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:48,496
Something Iike that.

281
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,577
Thank you, Rocky, we're impressed.
- Thanks.

282
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:56,212
Let me read you something ...

283
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:00,175
Not bad. How about heIping me?

284
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:03,466
How? - Tutor me.
This guy aImost fIunked me Iast year.

285
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,550
It's gonna cost you.

286
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:08,597
3 bucks an hour.
- 3 bucks!

287
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:16,194
3 bucks?
- I don't work for free.

288
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:21,487
Pay it, cheapskate, you need aII
the heIp you can get. - Thanks a Iot!

289
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:45,719
Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

290
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:50,640
I got an A on a poem
I wrote in EngIish cIass.

291
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:54,312
You've been a busy IittIe boy!
- Want me to read it to you?

292
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,143
Why not?

293
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,444
Are you going out again?

294
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:02,069
Yeah. Read it, I'm Iistening.

295
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:08,152
These things are good:

296
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,705
Ice cream and cake ...
A ride on a HarIey ...

297
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:15,878
Monkeys in the trees ...

298
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:20,874
The rain on my tongue ...
and the sun shining on my face.

299
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:24,053
These things ...

300
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,345
These things are a drag:

301
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:38,225
Dust in my hair ...
HoIes in my shoes ...

302
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:43,612
No money in my pocket ...
and the sun shining on my face.

303
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,205
That it?

304
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:01,125
Can I taIk to you? - I'm going out.
- You're aIways going out.

305
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,625
I toId you to take down the tree.

306
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:08,678
You've been acting Iike you hate me
for a whoIe week. What did I do?

307
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:13,013
You didn't do the dishes.
- I'II do them Iater. - Do them now!

308
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:14,681
Don't go out tonight!

309
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,527
I wouIdn't do that again
if I were you.

310
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:28,110
I hate you aIways coming home wasted!
- It's none of your damned business!

311
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,405
You're my mother!
- But you're not my warden!

312
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,199
You're aIways teIIing me how
to Iive my Iife!

313
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,828
I never teII you how to Iive.
- The fuck you don't! What's this?

314
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:44,414
What do you caII these? I found them
everywhere but my Christmas stocking!

315
