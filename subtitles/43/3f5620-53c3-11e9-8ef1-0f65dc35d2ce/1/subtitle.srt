1
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,996
In the year of King Tai, Ming Dynasty

2
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,163
The eunuches held the real power of
the development

3
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,402
They built up different departments
to reinforce their power

4
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,132
The whole country was under their control

5
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:22,547
East Chamber was the most powerful
and arrogant intelligent bureau

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
In order to get rid of those opposing power

7
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,164
They recruited many heartless
and cruel soldiers with high pay

8
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,836
To form a cold-blooded Black Arrow Troop

9
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,805
They were under severe training secretly

10
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,970
There was an arsenal under the East Chamber

11
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,374
It is responsible to design new
killing weapons

12
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,480
They used the prisoners for test

13
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:13,952
Let me go!

14
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,585
You shameless bastards!

15
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,424
God will punish you

16
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,042
Come out

17
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,209
I'm a government officer
you can't kill me

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,377
And you

19
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,886
Let's go

20
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,993
Plum Blossom Sun Shooting Arrow

21
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,881
Dogs Teeth Arrow

22
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,369
Phoenix Tail Arrow

23
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,313
The head Eunuch Tsao Siu Yan

24
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,014
After appointing himself
the head on the East Chamber

25
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:54,322
He controlled the Emperor
and the whole government

26
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,663
He tried every means to get rid
of those who went against him

27
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,689
What he wanted was a kingdom of himself

28
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:06,165
He set up a court and collected Information
from many different sources

29
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,198
Those who were against Tsao

30
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,835
Would be arrested and executed
with terrible punishment

31
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,447
Everybody was afraid
of the East Chamber

32
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:22,580
The whole country was covered
with frights and anxiety

33
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,559
You Excellency, he is the Military Secretary
Yang Yu-hin

34
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,887
What secret do we know about him?

35
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,298
On the 4th of April
he and the secreataries of 3 other department...

36
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,530
wanted to submit an impeachment against
the East Chamber

37
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,265
He pleaded the Emperor to close
the East Chamber

38
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,830
Your Excellency
please give your judgement

39
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,672
Your Excellency, here is his impeachment

40
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,044
Secretary Yang

41
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,070
Damn

42
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,239
You've misunderstood us

43
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,721
We're faithful to the Emperor

44
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,953
Your frame to us would scare our Majesty

45
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,051
Aren't you afraid of death?

46
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,922
It's a royal order that eunuches
aren't allowed to involve in politics

47
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,130
So as to avoid you freaks
to mess up the country

48
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,570
Now you slaugher the officials

49
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,301
You're the one who should be dead

50
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,608
How dare you?

51
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,540
Execution

52
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,509
Yes

53
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,178
Yang, I don't think you know
the situation well

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,985
Give me the military power

55
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,992
Then I'll let you live

56
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,795
It's so ridiculous that
the government of Ming dynasty

57
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,764
is controlled by you dogs

58
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:45,362
No one can take over military power
without imperial permission

59
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,305
Stop dreaming

60
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,100
Officer

61
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,403
Give Officer Yang a permission as he wanted

62
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,920
Tsao, because of you bastard

63
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,616
Ming Dynasty is hopeless

64
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,494
He committed suicide

65
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,068
Although Yang was dead
I'm afraid his fellows

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,264
would go to his right hand Chow Wai-on

67
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,431
Protect Yang's children to the frontier

68
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,376
I'm sure Chow'd try hard to save them

69
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,074
Yes, sir

70
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,673
This is the Royal Order

71
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:05,007
The traitor Ex-Military Secretary
Yang Yu-hin

72
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:10,017
Is to be executed at noon

73
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,223
Tsao Siu Yan killed
the whole family of Yang

74
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,600
but the son and daughter
of Yang were interitionally left

75
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,909
In the Autumn of the same year
they were exited

76
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:45,108
Tsao orderd the Black Arrow Troop
to tail them secretly

77
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:52,654
What he wanted was to kill
Yang's right hand, Chow Wai-on

78
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,524
So as to terminate
the remained power of Yang

79
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,319
Kiddo, are you fine?

80
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,226
What the hell it is? Not even a tree

81
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,627
It's so hot

82
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,037
My holy God, I, Yau Mo-yin
swear in front of this sword

83
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,409
I must save Yang's children

84
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,381
All is ready, let's go

85
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,683
Go!

86
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,465
To get out of the boundary
we'd pass Tsi, Turk, Hai-ku 3 places

87
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,675
You divide into 3 teams
I will give order in the central

88
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,569
They can never escape from us!

89
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,643
Your Excellency, the troops are all ready

90
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,186
What shall we do now?

91
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,663
From here to the boundary,
we'd pass Tsi Turk, Hai-ku 3 places

92
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,029
There are steep atopes and cliffs!

93
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,104
I think, Tsao must hide his troop here
to trap us

94
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,304
There is a dried river bed at the West

95
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,015
Let's take risk, to give him a raid

96
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,682
OK, let's go this way

97
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,253
President
nothing happened in these 3 days

98
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,889
Chow has been the right hand of Yang

99
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,456
He could be the coach of 800,000
imperial soldiers

100
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,559
Because of Yang's recommendation

101
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,231
Thus, thinking of such relationship

102
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,206
Chow would come to save the kids

103
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,612
I am thirsty

104
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,285
Drink it

105
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,624
Uncle, can you give us
something to drink?

106
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,991
Get lost, get lost

107
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,527
Come over... open your hands

108
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,893
Thank you

109
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,734
No hurry, drink it slowly

110
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:13,836
Sister, drink it!

111
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,574
No, you drink it

112
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,857
The president really knows everything

113
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,225
Set them free, now

114
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,734
No, we can't defy government's order

115
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,134
If not, let's kill him

116
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,501
We come to save

117
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,631
But not to kill

118
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,735
If you want to kill
let's kill the dogs of the East Chamber

119
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,405
Set them free and leave with us

120
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
Otherwise, those bastards won't let you go

121
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,447
Stop puzzling

122
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,582
You've no choice, hurry up

123
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,124
Sister

124
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,956
Kiddo

125
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,453
Enemies

126
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,088
Protect the kids

127
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:59,875
They are small potatos only
our large hasn't shown up yet

128
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,282
Kiddo

129
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,007
Your Excellency, Chow finally comes

130
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,086
The twins Sword

131
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,071
Sister, I'm so scared

132
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,897
The Black Flag Arrow Troop?

133
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,196
Sister, I'm so scared

134
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,399
Sister, where are you?

135
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,734
Just follow me

136
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,822
The arrows are like a storm.
Save the kids and leave at once

137
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,274
Shit! The soldiers are coming towards us

138
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,693
Stay where you are

139
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,477
Your Excellency,
it wasn't Chow who came

140
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,673
They seem to be rascals

141
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,887
Brother, we are safe!

142
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,831
Chow Wai-on is such a wise man

143
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,898
The people come for the children
are trobbers only

144
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,666
Let them go first

145
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,838
I want to make a deed set at them all!

146
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,344
This is the Dragon Gate

147
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,741
I've made a date in the Dragon Inn with Chow

148
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,576
We'll leave the frontier together

149
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,589
We're carrying the kids
and the soldiers are after us

150
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,556
I think

151
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,856
We'd go to the Dragon Gate
along the river bed

152
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,492
Just do what you said

153
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,489
Yang Kwan is a main road

154
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,160
Shang, take 500 soldiers
to guard this gate

155
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,134
Yes

156
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,860
There are many lanes to Yu Mun Kwan

157
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,428
Send the best soldiers to block all exits

158
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,136
Although the Dragon Gate is heavily armed

159
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,510
I think Chow'd take this risk

160
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,947
And leave from the Dragon Gate
with the rascals

161
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,144
Go there by taking the path

162
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,346
I'll follow with the Black Flag Troop

163
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,181
It's wise of you, Your Excellency

164
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,383
Let's go

165
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,551
Yes, sir

166
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,466
Spicy Meat Bun

167
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,697
Three-taels
why don't you send me the wine?

168
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,636
It's coming...

169
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,196
Damn weather, the wind made me so dirty

170
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,764
Good morning, sir

171
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,606
What? You don't want to serve me?

172
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,875
No, if it's not you guarding the border

173
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,939
We can't even do business here

174
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,505
Fetch me some wine

175
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,983
OK, I'll go right now

176
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,789
Sir, here comes the wine

177
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,186
See, your nickname suits you well

178
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,128
Exactly 3 taels of wine per cup.
Not a drop less

179
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,626
My grandpa gave me this name

180
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,654
Spicy Meat Bun

181
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,495
Come here

182
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,659
Where is your boss?

183
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,933
She is dealing some business upstairs

184
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,809
You want to leave the border
through my secret tunnel...

185
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,939
Or want to sleep with me?

186
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,874
Tiger, you can only choose one of them

187
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,149
Choose carefully

188
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,417
I've made it

189
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,591
Men are all sex-oriented

190
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,758
You want it whenever you want it
and leave whenever you finish it

191
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
Cut the crap

192
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,069
Just relax

193
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,301
Come on

194
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,700
I want the answer, tunnel or me?

195
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,766
I want both

196
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,172
It's too greedy of you

197
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,309
I've checked it. I'm not interested at all

198
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,673
The Willow Dart?

199
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,767
I'll get 100 taels by sending you
out of the frontier

200
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,267
But I'll get 400 taels by sending you to hell

201
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,444
I really don't know what to choose

202
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,547
Here is fresh meat for the buns

203
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,481
The boss's coming.
We're waiting for you to extinguish our fire

204
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,985
Eating mutton will make you have more fire

205
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,384
It'll make you hot. Bastard

206
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,184
Maybe you can help us with this?

207
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,417
Damn you

208
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,818
I don't eat mutton

209
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,986
I want to eat you

210
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,254
Go to hell

211
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,064
Why not eat me? I'm bigger in size

212
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,227
Damn you

213
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,095
Who is he?

214
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,704
You're always interested in men

215
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,234
How about me?

216
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,079
I always treat you as well as I can

217
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,982
Good looking

218
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,146
He is Chow, a wanted criminal.
He was a coach of the Imperial Army

219
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,682
He doesn't look like a coach

220
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,784
Yes, he doesn't

221
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,421
He's in big trouble with
the East Chamber

222
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,795
They want his head

223
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,389
East Chamber?

224
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,228
Yes

225
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,392
It's nothing

226
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,133
Mind your tongue

227
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,202
Tiger's head worths 500 taels?

228
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,678
Meaner, ask the chef, Duo
to keep the head of the lamb

229
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,543
You just care about lamp but not me

230
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,280
How dare you do this
in front of your fellows?

231
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,119
You'll give them a bad example

232
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,516
Why is there blood on your dress?

233
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,526
No. There is no blood

234
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,925
Look

235
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,487
Really?

236
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,689
You're having period?

237
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,925
Haven't you seen it before?
Ask your mother then

238
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,456
She passed away long long time ago

239
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,593
Go ask your sister then

240
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,433
Come over here,
I'll teach you a good lesson

241
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,468
Come over here...

242
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,973
Come if you have guts

243
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,200
Damn you

244
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,653
Welcome.
How many rooms do you want?

245
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,220
We want 3 of your best

246
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,959
Okay, take a rest first

247
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,670
Your period doesn't seem to be regular

248
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,139
Tell me earlier next time

249
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,812
Time to go back, we're just here

250
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,354
May I help you, sir?

251
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,485
Thanks, I'll do it myself

252
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,189
This way please, this is clean

253
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,701
With less wind and sand

254
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,328
What do you want to eat?

255
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,998
Give us some bread

256
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,234
Why not some wine?

257
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,940
OK, give us 3 catties

258
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,705
I'll get it now

259
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,546
Listen

260
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,483
This is my place, everything is mine

261
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,509
If you violate the rules

262
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,350
You can never
trade your pilfered goods here again

263
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,378
Damn you

264
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,949
I'll do it

265
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,255
The Dragon Mountain is famous for its rain

266
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,559
Why?

267
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,064
How can it rain in such a sunny day?

268
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,834
I think you're a stranger here

269
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,140
Where are you from?

270
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,837
We came from the south

271
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,147
To the north

272
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,077
How long will you stay?

273
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,609
We'll leave tomorrow

274
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,311
Spicy meat buns...

275
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,749
Beautiful

276
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,319
How sweet of you

277
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,490
We don't know where they are from

278
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,966
Watch out for them

279
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,630
One is soldier, one is wounded

280
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,503
The one in black should be their leader

281
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,935
- She's a woman
- A woman?

282
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,544
I can tell she is female because...

283
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,102
She didn't show interest in me

284
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,374
There is something wrong with the meat

285
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,079
Don't eat

286
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,178
What is it?

287
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,622
There is something wrong anyway

288
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,528
Not showing respect

289
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,352
Go

290
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,382
Let's go

291
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,066
Do you have any medicine?

292
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,161
No

293
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,938
It's getting dark. Light up the candles

294
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,909
Mistress, what meat is it?

295
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,279
Spicy Meat

296
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,840
What is spicy meat?

297
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,876
Haven't you heard of it?

298
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,219
The name of spicy meat appeared in a novel.
Mrs Suen sold it

299
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,226
Mrs Suen opened an inn which robbed

300
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,388
But mine is Dragon Inn

301
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,023
But you don't look like a jinx

302
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,795
Really? My name is Jade King

303
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:08,636
What a pity that it's hard for
a stone to turn to jade

304
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,698
In this world

305
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,540
There're many things unworthy of the name

306
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,843
and many people got empty brains

307
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,579
You're pretty

308
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,367
You too

309
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,100
But I'm sure I know you better

310
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,920
So you should let me know you better

311
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,704
I don't think it's a big deal actually

312
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,677
Why not ask some men here
that'd be fun

313
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,704
What! You think I'm afraid of men?

314
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,149
I've messed with more men than
you've seen

315
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,450
Just look at you, you're still a virgin

316
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,319
Aren't you?

317
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,004
Where is the hen hurrying to?

318
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,529
Let's see how you light up
a candle on the roof

319
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,316
Who are you? Why are you laughing?

320
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,772
May I know where the Dragon Inn is?

321
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,810
Here it is

322
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,914
Are you the boss?

323
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,475
Just call me Jade King

324
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,888
Jade! What a good name

325
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,480
Beautiful name

326
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,491
How about me?

327
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,716
Any room?

328
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,654
Handsome guy

329
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,628
Are you a businessman?

330
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,998
I want a room

331
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,701
How long will you stay?

332
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,365
Do I look like I've no money?

333
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,567
I'm just afraid that
you'll leave without saying goodbye

334
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,539
You know,
Dragon Mountain is famous for its rain

335
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,477
Even the most
vigorous animal scares of it

336
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,647
So we're the same people
we should keep in touch

337
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,522
Glad to make friends with you.
I may need your help some day

338
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,228
It depends on how smart you are

339
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,694
Miss Yau

340
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,571
He is here

341
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,109
This is my inn, please make yourself at home

342
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,545
Wearing foreign dress for
foreign customers tonight?

343
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,209
I've told you to wash that flag

344
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,740
See, I got mud all over me

345
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,912
This must be a woman

346
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,818
How do you know?

347
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,757
As you said
only women won't be interested in you

348
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,193
But he is different

349
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,697
His eyes didn't show interest on me
but his heart did

350
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,201
I don't think his heart
is interested in you

351
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,437
I can listen to your flute again

352
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,602
Go to work

353
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,405
Don't just play that song

354
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,682
Uncle Chow

355
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,451
Poor kids, you suffered a lot

356
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,321
He is Ho Fu

357
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,219
Thank you for your help

358
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,288
I really appreciate for all your kindness

359
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,321
Don't mention it

360
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,389
This is called Dog's teeth Arrow

361
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,762
It's produced by the East Chamber

362
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,597
I'd seen when I worked for the government

363
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,002
So you'd better pay much attention
to it in future

364
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,401
When can we get out of here?

365
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,965
As soon as possible

366
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,574
Chun, take the money

367
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,479
Hide up and meet your family later

368
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,244
Sir, I can't take this

369
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,380
This inn is so complicated

370
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,049
Pack up and leave here
as soon as possible

371
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,036
Mistress

372
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,269
I know you will come

373
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,866
You're really clever

374
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,038
I don't need you to flatter me

375
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,480
I just want to know about the weather here

376
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,948
Come inside

377
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,887
This room is nice and quiet

378
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,862
No room is nice
in a deserted place like this

379
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,788
What tea do you want to have?

380
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,665
Tuckanhoe or something else?

381
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,407
What kind of flower is this?
It's beautiful

382
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,404
You think it's white lotus?
It's turnip flower

383
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,111
White lotus can only be found
on Snow Mountain

384
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,382
Try the tea

385
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,219
When will you leave?

386
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,221
Tonight

387
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,261
I'm afraid you can't

388
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,329
Why?

389
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,890
Don't you know
the weather of the desert?

390
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,368
Please advise me

391
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,334
This's raining season
the weather is unpredictable

392
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:09,142
It'll rain cats and dogs even
the sun is on

393
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,774
This's the only hotel here

394
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,248
You can't reach the gate even
you can leave here

395
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:22,119
I think you know
whether it's sunny or rainy day

396
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,485
It depends on who that asks

397
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:32,135
The rain'll keep you here
just stay for a few more days

398
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:36,305
Though the weather is unpredictable
we can't stay forever

399
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,140
Seems we're connected in some ways

400
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,809
Please help us

401
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,786
You're leaving?

402
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,453
- I've two children with me
- They're hostages?

403
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,262
Mistress, please lead us the way

404
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,163
It depends on which way you want to take

405
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,066
The general of the border is my friend

406
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,437
I think I can help you with my reputation

407
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,939
But if you want to leave secretly...

408
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,158
Let me think...

409
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,598
I'm okay. Weapons are ruthless

410
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:40,061
We're friends now. And I'll repay you

411
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,406
Come again tonight

412
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,610
I have to leave tonight

413
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:55,943
You can't. I'll wait

414
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,025
Block the gate

415
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,898
Damn you. Fool

416
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,632
The latch is useless, move the table

417
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,975
Open the door...

418
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,308
Who is it? We just closed the door

419
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,442
Don't open it, let him die in the rain

420
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,943
Open up, quick

421
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,181
Stop knocking, bastard

422
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,587
If you knock again, I'll...

423
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,359
What's the matter?

424
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,355
Are you deaf?

425
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,097
Why didn't you open the door?

426
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,405
We're in trouble

427
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,498
3 branch heads from
the East Chamber have come

428
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,267
Damn you

429
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,472
My books are all wet!

430
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,814
Are you blind? Just close the door!

431
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,243
Go and shut the door

432
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,480
Boss

433
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,845
He is calling you

434
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,048
Can't you see I'm busy?

435
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,527
Any good room?

436
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,128
No, all full

437
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,595
Please ask them to move out

438
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,569
I just do whatever I like

439
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,573
Not tall enough

440
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,842
I don't do things I don't like

441
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,845
Take it back

442
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,368
You bitch

443
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,744
What did you say?

444
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,242
Money isn't my concern

445
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,618
Most important of all
I want a comfortable accommodation

446
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,015
I'm doing business too

447
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,217
I don't care about the money

448
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,691
You've messed up my place

449
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,988
So what to do then?

450
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,929
Count the loss

451
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,331
And I'll pay you by triple?

452
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,200
Good room? There is one, come on

453
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,676
It is raining cats and dogs
we can't leave now

454
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,407
We'll wait

455
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,346
Take the luggage in

456
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,824
We have limited rooms but numerous guests

457
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,622
How long will you stay?

458
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,419
The weather is unpredictable

459
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,364
See how long can this gold pay for?

460
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,400
You must be tired

461
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,407
Sir, please have some tea

462
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:35,003
Any strangers checked in these days?

463
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,139
Are you looking for someone?

464
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,281
We businessmen should be careful
and get rid of trouble

465
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,885
I just want to know
if there is any trouble around

466
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,213
Have some tea

467
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,423
If there is any, I won't open an inn here

468
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,227
Sorry

469
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,299
This is a very special tea

470
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,870
The taste is nothing special

471
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,805
But you have something special
on your mind

472
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,684
Don't you think Chow Wai On
will take this route?

473
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,589
Go and check

474
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,680
Meaner...

475
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:45,977
Boss

476
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,677
Why you acted before my order?

477
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,083
Shadows are found everywhere

478
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,416
But they're not our men

479
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,285
We haven't taken any action yet

480
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,290
Go and check carefully.
Watch out for the money box

481
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,291
Yes

482
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,389
What a troubled world it is

483
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,486
Thieves'd watch out for other thieves.
Damn it

484
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,107
What is he singing?

485
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,381
He is barbarian.
He is humming barbarian song

486
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,059
I'll dig your eyes out

487
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,693
So you can't see

488
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,934
I'll peel off your skin
so you can't wear

489
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,874
I'll chop your head off
so you can't live

490
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,315
Don't make any trouble

491
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:58,813
Somebody is on the roof

492
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,225
Forget it

493
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,124
We'll leave right after the rain stops

494
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,831
Who was killed by the thunder?

495
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,426
We are all here

496
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,394
Good job! Kill your tribe

497
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,568
Thank god

498
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,003
Where are Bill Chow and Shao Tong?

499
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,539
I'll go and find them

500
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,215
No! It'll alarm our enemies

501
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,653
The rain is so heavy, we can't leave

502
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,746
Neither can they

503
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,779
Right

504
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:46,635
Look at the sword under the lamp
after drunk...

505
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,872
When can we live in peace?

506
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,091
I don't want to wait anymore!

507
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,329
Just stay calm

508
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,625
Anxiety won't help

509
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,653
But waitng won't help either

510
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,257
Lower your voice

511
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,962
If the eunuches come
we'll be in danger

512
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,731
What'll we do
if we are trapped in this inn?

513
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,635
Ho, I didn't pay a penny less

514
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,469
There are rules that
we all should follow

515
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:01,273
Miss Yau, my buddies and I...

516
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,801
make money by risking our lives

517
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,541
To save this two kids...

518
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,549
we've missed many business opportunity

519
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,175
and money

520
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,618
Now the government knows who we are

521
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,582
Damn, we've given all
we have to be a good guy

522
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,622
Well, I'll pay your loss

523
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:17,885
It sounds reasonable

524
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,523
Make it clean

525
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,536
Sir, did you sleep well last night?

526
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,434
Bull shit

527
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,233
Have a seat

528
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,297
- Shun, clean the tables and chairs
- Yes

529
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,732
Give us some tea

530
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,838
Still didn't get any news
from Bill Chow and Shao Tong?

531
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:39,078
It's strange!
We can't even find their bodies

532
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:44,317
There must be something strange

533
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,021
Tony, give them some bread

534
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:49,054
We don't want bread this morning

535
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,459
Give us a roasted lamb

536
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:51,459
Roasted lamb

537
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,487
- Do you have roasted lamb in desert?
- Yes

538
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:57,332
They're fat lambs!
We just killed two last night

539
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,164
Give us one

540
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,295
You too? Ok, coming...

541
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,679
The fight last night was tiring enough

542
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:16,983
And now we've to work this morning

543
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:18,144
Go and get the weapons

544
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,888
You are good looking

545
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:22,951
From your forehead

546
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:25,327
There is florid

547
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:27,628
I can tell you're having good luck

548
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:30,431
Thank you.
Hope your fortune telling comes true

549
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:34,965
If you don't mind,
can I see your hands?

550
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,237
Sure

551
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,503
From your influence line

552
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,947
you were a government officer 2 years ago

553
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,315
What're you working now?

554
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,010
Anywhere! When there is rough road
I'd make it flat

555
00:49:50,222 --> 00:49:53,783
When there is tree blocking the road
I'd remove it

556
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:58,622
That's why
your influence line isn't that smooth

557
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,093
I don't think I've the luck
to be gov't official, but I think you have

558
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,830
Why?

559
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,531
In such a desert

560
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,506
Ordinary citizens won't wear
officer's boots

561
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,748
Don't be nervous! You're an officer

562
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:23,050
So you should know
something happened in town

563
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,848
Which one are you talking about?

564
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:29,082
The Secretary
of the Military Dept. Yang was killed

565
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:34,695
His corpse was hanged and his
whole family was killed too

566
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:39,067
Pal, do you know who did it?

567
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:43,001
I don't know

568
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:44,832
Really?

569
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:49,770
The water is boiling

570
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,818
Sir... oh no...

571
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:57,114
Mister

572
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,952
Can you tell me is he a lady killer?

573
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:04,185
Yes! His eyes attract women

574
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,093
Really?

575
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,129
The ones who killed Yang

576
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:13,365
are some ruthless bastards

577
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:21,405
It's hot, let it cool down

578
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,047
Mistress

579
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:27,415
This is for the broken table.
Buy a new one

580
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,154
I don't think it's enough

581
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:33,021
Give us the food! We're starving!

582
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:44,702
Pal, you are a man
of righteousness and guts

583
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,636
May I know your name?

584
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:50,940
I'm a wanderer, name is meaningless to me

585
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:55,311
Let's cheers for this nameless world

586
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:59,175
OK! I'll drink this wine with you!
Cheers!

587
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,445
- Please
- Please

588
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,689
Here's the roasted lamb

589
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:16,224
Mistress, how about our lamb?

590
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:22,035
It'd be roasted one by one

591
00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:23,541
But first come first serve

592
00:52:25,844 --> 00:52:27,971
Make it half then

593
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,538
Dao

594
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,553
Cut the lamb in half

595
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:41,959
How? Straight or cross?

596
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:44,791
As you like, just make it half

597
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:19,422
I wonder what relationship Chow has
with this inn?

598
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:20,761
I think we'd better take action
as soon as possilble

599
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:24,097
Let's ambush them tonight

600
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:34,544
Bravo! The rain has stopped!
We may go now

601
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,570
Don't panic, they will discover it easily

602
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:39,984
The larget is so great

603
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:42,350
We are not clear about the outside world

604
00:53:42,521 --> 00:53:46,013
We have 2 kids too.
We can't go as fast as they can

605
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:50,758
Once this inn is owned by thieves
there must be some secret tunnel

606
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:53,061
Let's search it tonight

607
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,734
It was dangerous!

608
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:04,239
Quickly I fixed up the mess
otherwise I'd have lost if there're a fight

609
00:54:04,276 --> 00:54:06,574
No, some hocus is put!

610
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:07,771
Drink this

611
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:09,243
Tonight, why no we...

612
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:10,612
What shall we do tonight?

613
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:12,511
What?

614
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:14,917
You are all fools!

615
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,883
If we want to leave here

616
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,357
We must get rid of those bastards first

617
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:27,328
Ho Fu, Iron, you two'll attack
from both sides

618
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,390
Mo-yan will attack in the midle

619
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:33,231
Cha's room is at the corner
and has just one door

620
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,796
Okay, let me do it
