1
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:00,479
Mr Chow, have you fallen asleep?

2
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:03,445
I come to serve you

3
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:16,425
Jade, why do you come here
in the middle of the night?

4
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:19,898
Why do you come here then?

5
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:21,663
Stop bothering my business

6
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,997
This is my inn

7
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:29,372
Who'll responsible for it
if someone get killed here?

8
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:32,238
But there were many people got killed
in this inn before

9
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:38,816
I tell you, I know your story very well

10
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:41,753
Don't push me to make a dead set at you

11
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:47,816
What are you?

12
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:49,726
Officers and thieves have their own ways

13
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:52,458
And our own duties

14
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,726
But I'd ask your help

15
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:57,664
How?

16
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,730
Be frank, they are kidnappers

17
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:03,338
That's none of my business

18
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,033
$1000 taels, deal or not?

19
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,278
To kill him?

20
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:10,312
No, just delay them.
Make them stay one more night

21
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:14,476
And forget everything, what say you?

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,612
Guess

23
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,789
Fantastic

24
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,454
Promised?

25
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:31,362
If you can't sleep, get something to eat

26
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,296
Sister

27
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,393
Take care of the kids

28
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,883
Where is Uncle Chow?

29
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,119
It's fine

30
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,721
Yuk Bo

31
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:50,831
You went for a walk so late?
It's freezing

32
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:53,641
- Here is too hot
- Hot?

33
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,738
But I feel cold! Am I so sick?

34
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,464
The logner we stay
the more danger we'll have

35
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:22,030
We can't wait

36
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:23,670
Let's take a risk! Go!

37
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:27,706
Ho Hu, Iron
I'll stop the enemies with Mo-yan

38
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,941
Just take the kids away

39
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:30,172
We'll meet at the Dragon Gate

40
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:33,117
Wai-on, cover them

41
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:34,119
Leave the inn to me

42
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:34,915
Mo-yan

43
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:35,978
Who is it?

44
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:37,054
Chun

45
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,522
- Brother Ho
- Come in

46
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,091
Miss Yau

47
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,890
Chun, don't worry

48
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,692
We'll protect you

49
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,066
Mo-yan

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,896
Wai-on, take care of Yang's kids

51
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:51,969
Wait

52
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,369
Can I have this flute?

53
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,508
Don't waste time

54
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,608
The rabbit in the trap is always
anxious to escape

55
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,948
But it can never make it

56
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:40,714
Yes

57
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:50,191
We'd move this time!
My inn would be jacked up

58
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,787
Pack up now

59
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,224
No matter how, we'd move

60
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,768
Damn it

61
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:58,565
Why do you shut the door?

62
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,595
Don't you know the wind is killing me?

63
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:01,839
No business today?

64
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,838
Thank god! Our savior comes

65
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:10,446
Don't let them fish in the trouble water

66
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,474
Just tail them

67
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,188
Thank god

68
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:21,125
You bring us peace

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,718
Even fire has to go off

70
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,519
What peace?

71
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:26,191
There is sand-storm outside

72
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:27,722
You said there was a fire?

73
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,359
Here! Here!

74
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,502
Where is it?

75
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:31,230
Here

76
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,827
Where is the fire?

77
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:34,499
What were you doing?
You should smell it!

78
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,199
Damn it! Can you see the fire?

79
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:38,574
I want them to show up

80
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:40,140
What's wrong?

81
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,505
Who are you?

82
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,211
Why do you bring so many weapons?

83
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,852
For business

84
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,252
Trade with knives?

85
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:53,987
Sir, businessmen should be careful

86
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:56,961
In this troubled world
we've to protect ourselves

87
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,427
You look familiar

88
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,129
Who are you?

89
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,737
I'm talking to you

90
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:09,938
Sir

91
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,513
Watch the opera
we don't have to do anything

92
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,276
Just wait and see

93
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,007
Where are you from?

94
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,177
Are you the general guarding the border?

95
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,947
How dare you talk to me like this?

96
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,980
We are...

97
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,090
Secret agents from the East Chamber

98
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,587
This is our identity proof

99
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:31,991
It's confidential

100
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,432
Our identity proof

101
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:37,625
Damn it

102
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,664
We become thieves in return

103
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,534
Where are you going to?

104
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,045
Going out of the border

105
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:51,674
Don't you know the gate is closed?

106
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,981
No one can get out without the order

107
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,511
from the President of the East Chamber

108
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,048
I know

109
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,521
You look like
the wanted criminal Chow Wai-on

110
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:06,325
You look almost the same

111
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,427
You should be him...

112
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:11,330
I don't think so

113
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,999
Look! There is a mold on the man's face

114
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,606
But he hasn't

115
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:21,545
But I don't remember there's any mold

116
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,313
Look at that guy
he has a mold when he came

117
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,683
Now, only a scar is left

118
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:33,022
Look, they pretend to be calm

119
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,118
You can tell there is something wrong
with them

120
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,629
Take them to your camps for questioning

121
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:41,357
Maybe they're the people we want

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,301
If you get any merit from it
don't forget us

123
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,605
Sure

124
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,040
You, come over here

125
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:53,909
The one with a scar

126
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:56,239
Hey, I'm talking to you!

127
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,818
Why do you stare at me?

128
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,219
Not happy with it?

129
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,855
You are just like a thief

130
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,022
And you're a businessman?

131
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,463
You can never cheat me

132
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,566
Don't get angry, it's their trick

133
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:18,997
I don't like you since the first time
I saw you

134
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,171
Take them to the camp

135
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:22,902
Yes, sir

136
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,034
Drink with me

137
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,341
Go

138
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:26,572
You two get up

139
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,204
They are all here

140
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,912
Watch over the general.
I'll look for another exit

141
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,083
Three taels, give me wine

142
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:37,381
Sir, take care...

143
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,490
The reward from
the government is just $1000 taels

144
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,720
See, these cheques cost $1,000 taels each

145
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:46,130
I'm a reasonable man

146
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:48,131
Drop the knife

147
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,895
There is trouble in the frontier.
No one can go in or go out

148
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:54,428
You'd better stay few more days

149
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:57,271
When the order is cancelled
I'll let you go

150
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,469
Thank you, sir

151
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,773
You'll have a share too

152
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:00,779
Let's drink

153
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,506
Chow Wai-on disappeared

154
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,078
Lu Siu Chuen

155
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:01,401
Sir, he doesn't seem to be here

156
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,904
Dao, the stuff is here

157
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:46,645
It is the first time...

158
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,353
you stare at me like this

159
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,376
Boss

160
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,816
Go

161
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:00,221
He came from the secret passage

162
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:06,871
If you are willing to stare at me
because of the passage

163
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,265
How about I open all the passages...

164
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:11,776
So you can stare at me for
the rest of your life

165
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,575
You're in this business for
such a long time

166
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,674
You should know what I want

167
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:22,620
and I like most

168
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,857
I want to buy a road to leave the country

169
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,552
I'll offer $1,000 taels

170
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:28,753
$1,000 taels?

171
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:32,364
If I want $1,000 taels
I wouldn't have added the...

172
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,060
So you don't want money

173
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:37,969
No

174
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,594
I want $2,000 taels

175
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:43,302
and you

176
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:47,604
What? Scared?

177
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:55,377
Hero always goes with beauty

178
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:58,651
But I do want to try...

179
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,414
a special one like you

180
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,657
But on one condition

181
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,524
What is it?

182
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,461
I want a formal wedding

183
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,859
What? Scared?

184
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,562
Forget it!
I just want to have one night stand

185
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:19,411
I'm a righteous man

186
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:20,878
Sleeping with you...

187
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:23,473
may bring me a notorious name

188
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:27,652
OK, let's have formal wedding

189
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:28,880
I'll take this as present

190
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:29,888
Give it back to me

191
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,587
Come on, go ahead

192
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,719
Move your hand downward
then we'll save the wedding

193
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,325
Come on

194
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,393
I'll take it back on our wedding

195
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:03,452
Your Excellency,
we'll be at Dragon Gate soon

196
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,058
A wedding? Do you mean it?

197
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,193
Jade's secret tunnel is
the only way out

198
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,460
Only you believe her

199
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,594
I don't trust that bitch

200
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,266
You are a triad member too

201
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:22,129
We can be brothers

202
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,801
So why can't I trust her?

203
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,404
Dragon Inn is a place
only talks about interests

204
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:29,573
It has its own way to survive in a desert

205
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,914
The wedding is to confuse the East Chamber

206
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,818
I want Cha to be the master of
the wedding so as to hinder their act

207
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:39,722
Then I'll force Jade to tell me
where the tunnel is

208
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,226
When you see I put the candle on the sill

209
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,592
you all rush our from both sides

210
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,392
Mo-yan'll take the kids to Jade's room

211
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,265
Then we'll escort Jade to lead us
out of here

212
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,435
There is no righteousness in politics

213
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,937
Mo-yan, do you understand?

214
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,170
How can a man come out
after entering the bride's room?

215
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,043
Don't you think...

216
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,480
I'll give you all up for having sex?

217
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,251
Just follow his instruction

218
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,118
Even Miss Yau can't understand him

219
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:17,455
The more confused we are,
the easier it goes

220
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:20,521
Dragon Inn

221
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,766
I hope I won't see you here again

222
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,731
How is it going on outside?

223
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:57,895
The set has almost done

224
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,172
Did the geanny promise?

225
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,807
There won't be any problem!

226
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,135
Of course!

227
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:08,540
Just only you stay...

228
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,378
The granny will promise anything

229
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:15,011
How can I be the master of wedding?

230
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,645
If it's not your reminder
on the other day...

231
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,451
I can never marry Jade

232
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:19,624
You deserve it

233
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,225
Right, their parents are not here

234
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,455
and you are old enough...

235
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:24,223
You're the only choice

236
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,301
Okay, I'll do it

237
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,968
Congratulation

238
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,097
Thank you

239
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:35,197
Today is my wedding

240
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,107
Enjoy yourselves and let's get drunk!

241
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:39,440
Make yourselves at home

242
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,342
You men look sad

243
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:47,218
Give a speech

244
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:52,453
I've been a homeless
and lonely businessman before

245
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:57,053
I'm so glad to be a match maker
in a desert

246
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:58,790
I really feel honored

247
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,159
Why are you standing here?

248
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:05,193
Today is Jade's wedding

249
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:06,602
Why don't you congratulate them?

250
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:07,605
Smile

251
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,041
I know it's nosy of me...

252
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,551
but it's hard to find a good man

253
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,148
If you find one...

254
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:25,156
just keep him by any means

255
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,955
Perfect couple

256
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:34,591
They're made for each other

257
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:40,866
Great! Have my toast

258
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,874
Don't get drunk on this big day

259
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,466
But it's a big day! We should get drunk

260
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,374
Sir, don't drink any wine
that is not ours

261
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,605
It may be poisoned

262
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,943
Cheers

263
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:52,882
Fine

264
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,577
Great!

265
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,616
Go to the bride's room.
Don't let them delay us

266
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,301
What are you doing?

267
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,496
Going to bed so early?

268
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:14,266
It's good time

269
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:15,364
We want to play with the couples

270
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,934
If you can defeat me, I'll let you go in

271
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,444
OK! Come on

272
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,738
It's a big day, don't fight

273
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:26,011
Let's drink

274
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:27,477
Give us wine

275
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:31,322
Sir, it doesn't matter

276
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:34,917
We've more men! We are having advantage

277
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,360
Water is filled into these 2 pots

278
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,329
Don't worry, you won't get drunk

279
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,829
Let's make it five

280
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:45,967
Don't waste time.
Tell me where the tunnel is

281
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,902
Light the candle first

282
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,838
But in case you're fooling me...

283
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,240
Here it is

284
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,949
See if you are capable to go in

285
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:01,077
Mr Ngai, the 4th one

286
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:04,182
The last one

287
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:12,896
Tell me now

288
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,532
It's not funny to fool you

289
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,767
Do you have weapons on your wedding?

290
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,402
Where is my flute?

291
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,343
Search it

292
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,942
Baldy, cheers

293
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:33,744
Ok! Let's finish a pot each

294
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,193
Useless! Get lost

295
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:18,561
Come on

296
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:23,928
Be careful

297
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:28,830
Come on

298
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:38,606
I have brought some fruits for you

299
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,017
Thank you

300
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:45,590
Thank you

301
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,927
Isn't it delicious?

302
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,525
The moon is beautiful tonight

303
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:56,898
Sister, tell me why...

304
00:21:56,935 --> 00:22:00,234
it's not the same moon as in our hometown?

305
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:03,299
Mom said the moon
is always more beautiful in hometown

306
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,536
So this is less beautiful than
the one in our hometown

307
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:08,336
But, we have no home now!

308
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,007
We can see the moon here safely

309
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,175
it's the mercy of God indeed

310
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:14,645
How do you feel this place?

311
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,922
Good, cause you are so kind
to treat me fruit!

312
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:20,282
Come and eat together

313
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,088
There may be some changes

314
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,664
If anything goes wrong, I'll drop the cup

315
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:33,069
Once you get this signal, take action

316
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:38,372
Think some ways to send me out

317
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:39,968
Sure

318
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:42,104
But not tonight

319
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,781
This is the only chance, I must go

320
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,721
I tell you, once stepping in my room

321
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:55,021
you have to listen to me

322
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,322
I say yes, then yes

323
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:04,158
Jade, please help me

324
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:05,567
I'll marry you when I return

325
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:06,696
So we won't owe each other

326
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,699
Haven't you fooled me enough?

327
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:27,190
Sir, the President's army will
arrive soon

328
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:39,098
Miss Yau, this is water, not wine

329
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:42,331
Forget me, just watch out for the signal

330
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,835
They seem to be serious

331
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:48,743
I think so

332
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,147
Cut the crap! We've bet our lives on it

333
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:58,120
You're a man of the world

334
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,926
Inform me once you get any news

335
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,830
There is a secret passage in Jade's room

336
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:11,893
Chow'll leave through this tonight

337
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,662
He's smart

338
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,230
No one can leave here

339
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,974
How about going up there and check?

340
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:20,534
Will it help?

341
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,706
Check? Okay

342
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:31,315
Don't waste time

343
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,846
Yes! Time is running short! Come on

344
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,291
Mistress, open up

345
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:37,386
Who is it?

346
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:40,293
It's Cha Ting! Open up please

347
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,963
What's the matter?

348
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:44,734
My servant is hurt

349
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,532
Do you have any medicine?

350
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,865
What's up?

351
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,001
You're trouble

352
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,847
My servant's head is hurt

353
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:58,178
Please have a look

354
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:02,853
Today is my big day.
You should know what to do

355
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:05,253
Give me the medicine

356
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:07,083
Come over here, this way

357
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:08,587
Let's talk

358
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:09,855
What's up?

359
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:15,563
Don't you think you can go that easily?

360
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:19,861
Why do you act in such a hurry?

361
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:21,303
Let's take action after this night

362
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,708
Don't ruin my wedding

363
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:35,709
But I'm afraid you'd ruin my plan

364
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:37,179
What does that mean?

365
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:41,989
I know Chow is planning to leave
through your secret tunnel

366
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:49,362
He gives me much money
and accompanies me

367
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,561
What can you pay?

368
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,871
Give me a price

369
00:26:13,124 --> 00:26:14,523
$100,000 taels

370
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:19,830
Money isn't a problem, we can talk about it

371
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,599
Give me the money, I'll give you the man

372
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:26,496
Be careful that you'll lost
both money and man

373
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,162
You're back

374
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,641
2 more injured?

375
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,873
I tell you, you've to pay for my medicine

376
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:38,781
Have you finished your business?

377
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,544
But our affair is not ended

378
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:48,386
You can't go

379
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:54,329
Mr Ho, where are you going to?

380
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:55,890
Come on! Have some more wine

381
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,425
Get lost! I want to piss

382
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,994
What a coincidence, I want to piss too

383
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:03,499
Then you go first

384
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,008
The candle is blown off

385
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:18,914
Bitch

386
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:22,488
Shall we wait for the signal?

387
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:23,516
He is enjoying himself

388
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:24,858
but forget about our lives

389
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:25,920
Broken cups

390
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:31,100
Nothing... this is for protection only

391
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,461
Let's keep on drinking

392
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:34,738
These bastards are well prepared

393
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,468
We've to fight anyway, let's start now!

394
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,270
I'll help you

395
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:43,941
Take the knife

396
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:24,355
You want to escape?

397
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,500
Go with the kids

398
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,371
Ok

399
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:52,180
Let Chung chase after them

400
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,514
Our target is Chow Wai-on

401
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,550
Shall we wait for Chow?

402
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,188
Stop waiting, let's get out of here

403
00:28:58,223 --> 00:28:59,349
Get up, let's go

404
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:00,185
Where is Uncle Chow?

405
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:01,624
Don't ask, quick!

406
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,255
Let me go, what have you got from
the East Chamber?

407
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,767
They've given me much more than you have

408
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:16,269
Stop him!

409
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:18,499
I won't let you go

410
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:21,376
I can't believe you work for
the East Chamber

411
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:22,939
Damn you

412
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:24,238
Don't frame me

413
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:34,889
Chow, you're going to lose

414
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:44,797
Meaner

415
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:46,064
Who told you to take action?

416
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:49,601
We didn't, that old man...

417
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:50,573
The old bastard?

418
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:53,141
Meaner

419
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:56,105
Damn you

420
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:58,939
Jade, we've paid you

421
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:00,150
Take it back to buy your coffin

422
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:02,918
You're good

423
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,491
There is a sand-storm ahead

424
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:14,928
It isn't sand storm

425
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,365
Someone is riding a horse

426
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:18,769
The troop from East Chamber is coming

427
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,734
Let's go separately, we'll join later

428
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:24,537
Okay

429
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,441
It's Tsao's black Flag Arrow Troop

430
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:30,945
I'm your man

431
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:38,879
I'm your man

432
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,838
Iron, Ho Fu

433
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,298
Yuk Ying, Yuk Bo

434
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,468
Yuk Bo

435
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,536
Sister, I am here

436
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,410
Where is Yuk Bo?

437
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:04,540
Sister

438
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:07,142
Don't be afraid, I will take you away

439
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:19,860
Are you mad, Jade?

440
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,304
Siu Chuen

441
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,713
You two bastards, you are beasts

442
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:45,681
I'll take your skin off!

443
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,333
Sister

444
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,393
Mo-Yan

445
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:08,304
Hold it

446
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,541
Tsao is here

447
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,208
What? Tsao is here?

448
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,242
She fainted, it's useless

449
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:17,819
Take her to my room

450
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:31,830
Dao

451
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:35,103
Tell the general I'm in trouble, go!

452
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,594
The medicine

453
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:51,214
We've been through all adversities...

454
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,809
and we'd escaped from every danger

455
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:57,087
But it's an ever changing world

456
00:33:57,388 --> 00:34:01,085
We can't be sure if we can escape this time

457
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,765
Mo-Yan

458
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,966
Wai-on, I should have faith in you

459
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,434
That flute

460
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:21,267
I didn't mean to give it to jade

461
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,312
I really don't know...

462
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:26,214
you'd be so upset

463
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,582
Luckily I can explain to you

464
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,848
People said: Love is not secured
in a messy world

465
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,687
Actually, love is more valuable in
such a troubled world

466
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:38,594
You can't get the flute back

467
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:42,294
It's nothing

468
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,500
Nothing is more important than our love

469
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:50,841
Damn it

470
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,203
Why don't you leave?

471
00:34:54,712 --> 00:34:57,545
This is my inn, why should I leave?

472
00:34:57,682 --> 00:34:58,580
I've nearly forgotten

473
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:00,174
You're as cool as a desert

474
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:02,015
You're so mean

475
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:04,450
The people in desert are always selfish

476
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:05,455
They only care about themselves

477
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,589
So you open this inn

478
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:11,595
You travellers
leave when you reach your aim

479
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:12,960
I just learn this from you

480
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,488
And I'm cool and mean?

481
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:46,385
Who is it?

482
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,226
Dao

483
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,357
Are the helpers coming?

484
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,333
He's not coming

485
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:53,663
Damn it, they're all heartless beasts

486
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:55,098
After killing those bastards

487
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,629
I'll come back and teach them
a good lesson

488
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:00,437
Why are you back?

489
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:07,409
It's out of my expectation that

490
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:10,249
the one who stays behind with me
is a barbarian

491
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:39,981
Watch out for the arrows

492
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:49,419
Dao, take the kids to the tunnel,

493
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,319
Hurry up

494
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,289
Damn it

495
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:54,086
Hold it

496
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:57,451
Hurry up

497
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:04,456
Your flute

498
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:06,861
I don't want anything that
is given out of pity

499
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:18,073
Your excellency, the inn is surrounded

500
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:23,750
Mo-yan, go down first

501
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:44,238
Hold my hand

502
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:53,614
There are many soldiers

503
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:54,174
Forget it

504
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:54,809
Go

505
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:05,592
There are people behind the hill

506
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:21,507
Still chasing?

507
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:23,103
Go to hell!

508
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,591
Go...

509
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,456
The desert is huge, I'll follow you

510
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,888
I will stop him

511
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:53,477
Jade, take the kids away

512
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:55,942
Wait for me at the Dragon Gate

513
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:57,479
Don't think about it now!

514
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:06,953
Wai-on, we'd live or die together

515
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,253
Me too

516
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:11,089
Why don't you leave?

517
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:28,001
Block his way

518
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:29,143
Are you okay?

519
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:45,817
Wai-on!

520
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:55,334
Get lost!

521
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,941
After killing you

522
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:06,779
my kingdom is as solid as steel

523
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,344
We'll fight you together

524
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,548
But you fight alone

525
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,581
Damn you, we can kill you any time

526
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:21,554
Come on, eunuch

527
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,561
Shit, we are trapped inside
the drift sand

528
00:41:58,769 --> 00:41:59,861
What should we do?

529
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:01,062
We can't move

530
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,833
It's your end

531
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,977
Mo-Yan

532
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:16,418
Mo-Yan

533
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,827
Don't close your eyes

534
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:32,893
I'll help you to chop him

535
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:38,905
The Willow Strike

536
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,405
Destroying stance

537
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:51,715
Mo-Yan

538
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:54,520
Mo-Yan

539
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:04,723
Go to hell

540
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,434
It's useless

541
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:14,244
I will kill you

542
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,269
Stop

543
00:43:21,618 --> 00:43:22,642
Be careful

544
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:37,393
Chow, you are a man

545
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:39,493
You have to take the kids out of here

546
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,136
I'm the most powerful man in the world

547
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:45,607
You choose the way to hell

548
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,229
Oh, my leg

549
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:17,530
My hand

550
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,516
Where else can you go?

551
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:44,660
Wonder sword

552
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:46,936
Push me over there, hurry up

553
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:37,613
Chow, can you hear me?

554
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:43,888
Mo-Yan

555
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:47,120
Mo-Yan

556
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,590
Will you come back to the Dragon Inn?

557
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:28,003
When other guests come

558
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,734
you may have already forgotten me

559
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,208
I can't face the desert as brave as you

560
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:36,501
I want to leave now

561
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:15,110
The Dragon Inn

562
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:16,719
Give me some wine

563
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,903
Let's leave this heartless place

564
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:39,605
to go after Chow
