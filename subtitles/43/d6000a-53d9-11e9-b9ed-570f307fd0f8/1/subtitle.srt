1
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,277
"With pride, I write down."

2
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,114
"The poem of my life."

3
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,352
"Passion and love, tears and follies."

4
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,355
"Honesty an end in itself."

5
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,428
"Life something to gamble with."

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,464
"When epic stories are retold."

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,464
"Hail the hero with will of steel."

8
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,696
"Who watches the world like a lion."

9
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,204
"Forward we go."

10
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:17,639
"As consequences are known
to one's own self"

11
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,245
"On the double."

12
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,713
"I must soar over the clouds."

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,253
"Forward I must go."

14
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,693
"As consequences are known
to one's own self."

15
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,566
"On the double."

16
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,001
"Must soar over the clouds."

17
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,537
"Forward I must go."

18
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,709
"As consequences are known
to one's own self."

19
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,636
"On the double."

20
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:59,445
"Man must stand sky high."

21
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,869
The law has duly punished
the drug king Chu Tao.

22
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,271
But we've paid a heavy price.

23
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,110
Aer you damaged the
squatters' camp,

24
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,842
the government had to
resettle them.

25
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,976
It paid $1 million for one
ceiling lamp,

26
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,953
and the whole shantytown was damaged
by you.

27
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,097
Taxpayers must pay for
social security.

28
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,197
But they shouldn't pay for
individual heroism.

29
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,800
Why the lamp instead of the stairs?

30
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,572
Because you were so nimble.

31
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:08,040
Right, we don't need star policemen.

32
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,106
We only need disciplined policemen.

33
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,510
I never expected promotion
for capturing Chu.

34
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,682
Our success was the result
of everyone's efforts.

35
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,420
Not you alone.

36
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,585
You're lucky not to have
been demoted.

37
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:27,061
Top brass wanted to discipline you
for holding me hostage,

38
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,396
But I talked them out of it.

39
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,300
I should thank you then.

40
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,657
I feel you're too individualistic.

41
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,717
You forgot you're only an
ordinary cop.

42
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,329
As of today, you're back in
uniform again.

43
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,456
Go to help where you're needed.

44
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,364
That means being an
all-round reserve?

45
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,968
You'll be busy as hell.

46
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,663
Thank you, sir.

47
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,979
Issue tickets, yes.
Catch robbers, no.

48
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,697
Attention, all on patrol.

49
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,568
An accident has caused a
big jam at the Crossroads Motel.

50
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,436
Hurry to the scene.

51
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,448
May, you better go.
I'm on duty.

52
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,285
Just regard me as another citizen,
and not your girl friend.

53
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,947
A common citizen who wants to
talk to a policeman.

54
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,048
What is it?

55
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,718
I feel that you make a
dashing traffic cop.

56
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,321
I'm on duty, Miss.

57
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,332
I've brought you some cold drinks

58
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,202
Thank you.

59
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you, Mister policeman.

60
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,487
I don't drink, Miss.

61
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,323
Have a sip. You never know
when you can take a break.

62
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,558
That's why I must avoid
drinking too much.

63
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,929
Don't worry.

64
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,498
Do you want me to be demoted?

65
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,164
Hey, Big Hero! Big Lover!
Still a lowly traffic cop?

66
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,468
You're lucky not to have
gone to jail like Chu.

67
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,771
Jail?

68
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,983
Three Swiss doctors certified
I only have 3 months to live

69
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,345
I've come out to wait for death.

70
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,015
Three months is a short time.

71
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,922
My boss may still be alive after
you're dead.

72
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:48,164
That's a threat against my life.

73
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,635
Is that so? Sue me then.

74
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,763
Take care.

75
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,794
Let's go!

76
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,236
Ka-kui.

77
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,577
That policeman
brought me so much hardship.

78
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:08,950
As long as I live,
I won't forgive him.

79
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,953
Boss, I don't know how to
do any good things,

80
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,518
But I'll stitch up that
policeman good and proper.

81
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,927
I'm very excited tonight.

82
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,558
Of course,
they have a live show and steak.

83
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,195
But I can see you're not happy.

84
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,703
Me? No, I'm looking forward to it.

85
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,035
Wish you were as happy as I am.

86
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,040
Are you afraid of Chu Tao...

87
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,378
No, but I'll be more careful
with him out of jail.

88
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,848
Maybe next week...

89
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,913
Detective.

90
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,424
Finished so soon?

91
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,484
Why are you here?

92
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,863
This is no place for a
traffic cop.

93
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,394
Block B, 1st floor, it must
be comfortable.

94
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,964
You go up first.

95
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,706
How do you know she lives in
block B, 1st floor?

96
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:11,316
With money, you can get
people to do anything.

97
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,147
Let alone getting someone's address

98
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,919
What do you mean?

99
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,390
The staircase of this old
building is very narrow.

100
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,785
If there's a fire in the corner here,

101
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,954
there will be no way out.

102
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:29,799
Fire engines can't get close
as the street's too narrow.

103
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,134
Kid, watch out for this beautiful
lady carefully.

104
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,568
Don't let her get scarred
or scalded.

105
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,976
You bastard!

106
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:57,986
May.

107
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,055
Auntie.

108
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,465
You're on your own?
Why isn't Ka Kui helping you?

109
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,300
He's still on duty.
I can manage.

110
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,035
I'm not against you
dating a policeman.

111
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,511
But he's too dutiful and stubborn.

112
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,103
A man should be committed to his work,

113
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,547
But a dedicated policeman
may have many enemies.

114
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,778
That's why you
have to face all this trouble.

115
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,284
In fact, I'm not worried.

116
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,618
I'm doing it to save him
from worrying.

117
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,518
He has reason to be worried.

118
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,115
Who are they?

119
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,354
Those same rascals.

120
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,895
Why is the detective not here?

121
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,398
Wait for me at the cafe
across the street.

122
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,194
Excuse me.

123
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,165
Why are you here?

124
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,395
I promised to
fix him for good.

125
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,133
I came to check
if you're running away.

126
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,434
It's not her faults.

127
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,168
She must be your mother,
she's so charming.

128
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,472
You scumbag!

129
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,672
Scum? You're wrong.

130
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,047
I'm the scum of the scum.

131
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,576
I'm not afraid of you.

132
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,677
Don't pay any attention to him.
Let's go.

133
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:00,518
Auntie, your daughter's
in love with a policeman.

134
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,959
I really worry about her.

135
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,623
I worry about you too.
You live on a high floor.

136
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,963
You may fall down by accident.

137
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,167
You dare hit me?

138
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,238
Don't!

139
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,274
Take her away.

140
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,208
Let go!

141
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:19,940
Creep!

142
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,947
Don't pull my hair.

143
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:22,880
It hurts!

144
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,078
Stop! It hurts!

145
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,851
Don't get mad, she's only a girl.
Let's go.

146
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,792
If you weren't a woman,
I'd have killed you by now.

147
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,952
Let's go. Forget it.

148
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,292
Take care.

149
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,890
Are you alright?

150
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,039
Auntie.

151
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:53,011
May got beaten because of you.

152
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,306
I told May not to date you

153
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,416
Did that lackey
and his henchmen hit you?

154
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,980
No, I used force first.

155
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,355
So they hit back at me.

156
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,290
They knocked me down.

157
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,156
My bottom hurts.

158
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,890
How did they know you'd be here?

159
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,127
He followed May back.

160
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,760
They're in the cafe over there.

161
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,028
I wonder why else they'll get up to?

162
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,772
Don't do anything foolish.

163
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,688
Kid, you looking for a beating?

164
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,641
You only know how to bully girls.

165
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,851
I have to admit I enjoy doing that.

166
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,644
Sorry.

167
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,040
Kill him and blame it on me!

168
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,708
You've studied the law.

169
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,049
Arrest them
if you've sufficient proof.

170
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,112
I couldn't control myself.

171
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,753
That's not a logical reason.

172
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,284
It was just a natural reaction

173
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,624
A policeman should have more patience.

174
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,289
You're a disgrace to the force.

175
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,127
I don't think so.

176
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,394
If a law enforcer daren't
respond to threats.

177
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,401
That's an insult to law.

178
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,131
You started it all to attract
attention to yourself.

179
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,399
It reminds people of your past.

180
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,498
How am I to answer to my superiors?

181
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,309
I've still a way out.

182
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,500
I quit.

183
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,178
Can your resignation solve the problem?

184
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,589
It's best when there's
no other way out.

185
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:28,986
I'm going.

186
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,329
Thanks for your support.
Goodbye.

187
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,967
Ka-kui.

188
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,005
Okay, if you have to quit,

189
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,676
Find a better job outside.
Bye-bye.

190
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,268
I will.

191
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,781
What's so special about
being a cop?

192
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,375
Don't you know the law?
Can the police use force at will?

193
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,078
Can they kill people?

194
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:56,986
Cut the crap. Sign it.

195
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,388
Damn you, I won't.

196
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,493
I'll sue you 'til you bleed.

197
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,859
I can afford a lawyer.
I'm not afraid.

198
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,331
Hit me! Go on, hit me! I dare you!

199
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:18,071
He hit me, you saw it!
Kill me if you dare!

200
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,406
My eyes are damaged!

201
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,380
I'm blind, pay me back!

202
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,575
Hit me in public if you dare!

203
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,685
Why are you just standing there?
Afraid?

204
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,155
Shoot me dead! I'll sue you!

205
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,527
Youngsters nowadays
have no tolerance.

206
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,003
Uncle Bill, I told you to
dissuade them.

207
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,264
Why didn't you say so before?

208
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,467
I thought you gestured for me to
throw him out.

209
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,242
Next time I know what to do.

210
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,309
What happened?

211
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,146
You don't want me to be a
policeman, do you?

212
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,684
I do, I'm proud of you.

213
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,786
I've got nothing
after all these years.

214
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,592
Just a lot of enemies who put
you in danger.

215
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,891
A good policeman has enemies

216
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,799
If he has none, it means,

217
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,065
he can't catch thieves.

218
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,639
In fact, I'm happy to see you hated.

219
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,903
It shows you're a good policeman.

220
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,274
Don't try to soothe me.

221
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,047
I'm already fed up and
I've quit.

222
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:30,912
Have you?

223
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:31,982
Are you disappointed?

224
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,074
Are you really quitting?

225
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,583
Thank God!

226
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,115
Don't!

227
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,115
What an exaggeration!

228
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,320
It's $5,540. Thank you.

229
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,832
I'll look around outside.

230
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,767
How about my credit card?

231
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:52,601
Sure.

232
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,939
This copy is for your reference.

233
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,240
Thanks.

234
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,785
What clothes should I bring along?

235
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,518
It's Bali,
you don't need any clothing.

236
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,818
That's what you think!

237
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,926
I'm so happy we're going
on this trip.

238
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,019
I hope the travel agency is honest.

239
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,258
It looks decent,
like a proper one.

240
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,562
Registered, paid, and no nonsense.

241
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,701
Ah Fay!

242
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,395
Ka-kui.

243
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,597
Long time, no see.
Is your beat?

244
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,037
Right.

245
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:27,903
What's the matter.

246
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,932
Got a report there's a bomb
in the arcade.

247
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:30,998
A bomb in the arcade?

248
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,135
It's right up your alley. Help us.

249
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,547
I'll try.

250
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:37,881
Ka-kui.

251
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,215
I'll just take a quick look.

252
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:41,850
Ah Sun!

253
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,587
You came at the right time.

254
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,647
Somebody reported
a bomb being planted.

255
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,022
Could it just be an hoax?

256
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,390
No. He told us to
disperse the crowd.

257
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,920
Said it'll explode in ten minutes.

258
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,829
Tell HQS to disperse the crowd.

259
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,595
So many people!
How do we do it?

260
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,501
Now, if it's a hoax,
who's to take the rap?

261
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,336
Facing the music is nothing new.

262
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,672
But a real bomb could prove fatal.

263
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,506
Right.

264
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,442
What should we do?

265
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,035
Treat it as if it were real.

266
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,173
Disperse the crowd.
Report to HQS.

267
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,476
Where's the fire alarm?

268
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,176
Over there.

269
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,377
Ka-kui!

270
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,118
I'll leave after sounding the alarm.

271
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:22,692
Give me something to smash it with.

272
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,626
- Ka-kui, this doesn't seem...
- Let's share the blame.

273
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:28,956
Follow me.

274
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,041
It's nothing!

275
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,809
Don't leave without paying!

276
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,882
Have you paid?

277
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,546
It's nothing at all.
Don't go, Miss.

278
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,658
It's impossible.
They just don't care.

279
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,751
Ka-kui!

280
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,694
Get out! Quickly!

281
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,793
Attention, everyone!
Please leave here at once.

282
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,065
Everybody,
I mean everybody must leave.

283
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,369
Central coding on fire, I guess.

284
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,410
Leave immediately, please.

285
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:17,110
Attention, leave in an orderly
manner, but fast.

286
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,775
Take care.

287
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,657
Why the hell is the alarm ringing?

288
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,820
People have business to do.

289
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,888
Ah Fay.

290
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,996
What's that?

291
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,025
Tell them to beat it, fast.

292
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,169
Please evacuate now,
for your own safety.

293
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,031
What's that?

294
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,668
I'll fix it. You go out first.

295
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,246
See if anybody else is inside.

296
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,009
Yes, sir.

297
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,198
We are done for!

298
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,835
Who's your commander?

299
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,134
You handle them.

300
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:19,043
Evacuate first.
The police will help you.

301
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,804
Ka-kui.

302
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,244
It's nothing. I'll take care of it.

303
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,747
You go home now,

304
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:29,818
Chief.

305
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,453
Who said there was a bomb?

306
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,424
It was phoned in.

307
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,051
Could it be a hoax?

308
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,927
Who sounded the alarm?

309
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,056
Me, sir.

310
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,223
You can go.

311
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:43,567
Yes sir.

312
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,668
Why the dispersal?

313
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,609
I was taught that,
when handling emergencies,

314
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,305
civilian's safety comes first.

315
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,439
So I dispersed them.

316
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,539
So you're indispensable
to the force.

317
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,446
No, sir.

318
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,413
Sir, there's no fire.

319
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,182
Your man suspected a bomb
and dispersed the crowd.

320
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:09,125
The demolition team's here.
Thanks.

321
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,095
Are we being made to look foolish?

322
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:11,960
Uncle Bill.

323
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:12,794
Quite possibly.

324
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,197
They want to see the man in charge.

325
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,259
May I go and pacify them?

326
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,429
Where are the demolition people?

327
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,563
They're coming.

328
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,169
This is getting messier.

329
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,800
Was I right or wrong?

330
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,912
Depends if there's a bomb or not.

331
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:32,183
Right now, we have to wait and see.

332
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,582
Tell them to stand way back.

333
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,210
Yes, sir.

334
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,050
Wait until after
the search is complete.

335
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,055
My ball!

336
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,674
How much longer must we wait?

337
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,703
What's the situation?

338
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:03,771
When it's fixed,
you'll be given the all clear.

339
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:04,805
Here you are.

340
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:05,976
Thank you!

341
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,856
Get set.

342
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,856
The ammunition people are here.

343
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:19,290
If they find nothing,
Raymond will be chewed out.

344
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,432
I didn't mean to embarrass him.

345
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,593
Nobody would cause this
mess on purpose.

346
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,112
Connect the hose over.

347
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,242
Smoke squad, stand by.

348
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,215
Bring in the water jets!

349
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,183
Spray that area!

350
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,690
Luckily no one got hurt.

351
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,994
Have you assessed the loss?

352
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,159
The insurance co will pay
for the loss of goods.

353
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,797
But our company's image
matters most.

354
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:03,806
We've asked the press to
play it down.

355
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,437
Who has a grudge against
our company?

356
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,238
It could be a simple case.

357
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,008
Possibly a mentally disturbed man.

358
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,744
Someone has called and claimed
responsibility for the bombing.

359
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,778
Tell her to put it through.

360
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,980
Put it through.

361
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,259
Speaking.

362
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:26,728
We are responsible
and we want $10 million.

363
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,391
If you don't pay, watch your
other properties go up in smoke.

364
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,664
Let me talk to him.

365
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,033
Let me think it over, sir.

366
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,803
It's a lot of money.
I must meet the board first.

367
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,708
We'll give you 24 hours.
Don't call the police.

368
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,710
Raymond, you're lucky.

369
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,947
It was a miracle no one was
hurt in that complex explosion.

370
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,784
You should thank God.

371
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,790
You did a good job regarding
Chu Tao too.

372
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,883
It was not me alone, sir.

373
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:55,959
Right.

374
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,427
Raymond, don't be too modest.

375
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,455
We leave the case to you.
Do you agree?

376
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,528
Yes.

377
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,159
Uncle Bill.

378
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,193
Morning, sir.

379
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,762
It looks like a tough case.

380
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,931
That's why we've got it.

381
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,968
Who do you think can handle it?

382
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,439
None other than you.

383
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,709
Think it over.

384
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,816
It can't be me.

385
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,517
How about someone who's on leave

386
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,952
You mean Chan Ka-kui?

387
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,321
He's quite competent.

388
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,987
He's too impulsive and unorthodox.

389
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,020
With him involved,
we'll feel the heat for sure.

390
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:35,465
He's rash, but a good cop.

391
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,067
I don't agree.

392
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:40,004
Go and find him, then,
if you feel he's the one.

393
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,312
Want to make fun of me?

394
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,282
Over there.

395
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,121
Which seat?

396
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,052
Did you get your passport
when you were a student?

397
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,765
Please find Chan Ka-kui
among your passengers.

398
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,359
Attention, passengers.

399
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,129
Mr Chan Ka-Kui.

400
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,297
Don't, don't.

401
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:14,871
Let me take a look.

402
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,373
It's ugly, don't look.

403
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,342
Mr Chan Ka-Kui,
please contact information.

404
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,035
You're wanted.

405
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:19,543
Yes.

406
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,236
What is it?

407
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,244
I don't know.

408
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,611
Let me go and see.

409
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,483
Are you Mr Chan?

410
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,008
Yes.

411
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,611
There's something wrong
with your passport.

412
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,884
My passport?

413
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,550
Only routine, it won't take long.

414
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,849
What happened?

415
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,858
I'll be back right away.

416
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,020
Be quick.

417
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,297
Ok.

418
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,466
Bye.

419
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:56,742
Oh, it's you!

420
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,648
Thank you.

421
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,547
Don't mention it.

422
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,882
What is it?
I'm in a hurry for a flight.

423
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,624
That bombing has turned out
to be an extortion case.

424
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:07,989
We've found it rather tough going.

425
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,083
What has that got to do with me?

426
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,028
It's a challenging case.

427
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,620
Raymond feels that...

428
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,857
I hope you'll cancel your leave.

429
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,526
Impossible,
I've already boarded the plane.

430
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,296
Besides,
I've left the police force.

431
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,328
I know how you feel.

432
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,500
I sympathize with you,
being under pressure,

433
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,168
but avoiding responsibility
is no solution.

434
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,303
I am not...

435
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,870
Uncle Bill, he said he's
not avoiding responsibility.

436
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,841
Raymond is impressed
by your performance.

437
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,752
What performance?
All I've got is impulsiveness...

438
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,414
Impulse means vitality.

439
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,893
But I can't control my 'heroics'.

440
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,658
An heroic man is usually
quick-thinking.

441
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,322
But the police need disciplined,

442
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,593
rather than quick-thinking men.

443
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,933
A quick-thinking man is
unconventional...

444
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,962
...to the point of being
irresponsible.

445
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:57,873
Only slow-thinking men have to
respect discipline, right?

446
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,137
Yes.

447
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,802
I must board the plane.

448
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,805
Time's up.

449
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,783
Goodbye.

450
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,155
How much ransom are the
bandits demanding?

451
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,715
$10 million, but the mode of
payment was not mentioned.

452
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,091
Any idea who may be responsible?

453
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:20,224
No clue. Could it be
a psychotic former employee?

454
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,323
Who knows?

455
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,462
Have you tried to locate the source
of the dynamite?

456
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,028
Why?

457
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,195
Why?

458
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,573
Simple.
Dynamite is a controlled item.

459
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,306
Dynamite for the bombs
must either be smuggled in,

460
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,244
or stolen from a local company.

461
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,613
Right, I hadn't thought of this.

462
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,379
We must find their
bomb-making and storage facility,

463
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,717
before payment is made.

464
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,881
Once the bombs are found,
they can do nothing.

465
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,722
So you solve the problem
right away.

466
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,259
Who can handle this case,
apart from you?

467
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,157
You take it over.

468
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:50,923
Do it your own way.

469
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:51,894
Yes, sir.

470
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,724
I must board the plane.

471
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:59,530
You can go to Bali any time.
It won't sink.

472
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,767
But the bomb case can't wait

473
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,440
Take your trip afterwards.

474
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,610
I must tell May about it first.

475
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:07,906
Go on then.

476
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,016
Hurry up.

477
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:15,676
Miss.

478
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:16,449
What is it?

479
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,183
This plane...

480
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,245
It has just taken off.

481
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,551
Taken off?

482
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,361
Well, it's already in mid-air.

483
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,556
Why is it so punctual?

484
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,490
May's passport is still with me.

485
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,527
Shit, now we're in real trouble.

486
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,437
Uncle Bill, it's too late.

487
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,282
What now?

488
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,784
Have I done something wrong?

489
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,286
Over there.

490
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,287
Thank you.

491
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,649
We're from Homicide,
here to see Miss Wong.

492
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,219
30th floor.

493
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,124
Thank you.

494
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:00,759
A bug.

495
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,301
Bugging? It took Nixon out of office.

496
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,769
Want to crack the case?

497
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,830
Know your enemy and you'll win.

498
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,438
Hide it.

499
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,336
Miss Wong, two policemen
here to see you.

500
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,506
Where is the toilet, please?

501
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:17,513
Go straight and turn right.

502
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,412
Thank you.

503
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:21,875
25th, please.

504
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:24,848
24th, please.

505
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,948
Please wait.

506
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,226
Uncle Bill, I'm worried about May.

507
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:36,200
I'll call Jakarta Airport
on my return.

508
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:44,872
Uncle Bill!

509
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,416
It stinks!

510
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,954
You've no manners!

511
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,959
Let me take the other lift.

512
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,471
I'm a policeman.
Miss Wong is expecting me.

513
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,502
Please wait.

514
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,242
Thank you.

515
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,781
You're used to being the scapegoat.

516
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,688
Don't tease me.

517
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:36,750
Two.

518
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,926
I'm Inspector Chang,
he's Sergeant Chan.

519
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:39,725
We've made an appointment.

520
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,129
Please follow me, gentlemen.

521
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:41,927
We are...

522
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,731
Mr Fung's in a meeting.
The power of attorney is ready.

523
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:52,707
Sorry.

524
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,649
Where's the toilet please?

525
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,979
Go straight and turn left.

526
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,345
Thank you.

527
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,082
Sorry.

528
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,025
Never mind. Where's your friend?

529
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,820
He's went off because
he's impatient.

530
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,708
The President is back.

531
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,343
This lot, if bought for under $300M
will be profitable.

532
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:29,870
Mr President.

533
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:30,711
You want me?

534
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,841
Inspector Chang's here.

535
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:32,680
Thank you.

536
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,912
Thank you for your
co-operation with the police

537
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:39,957
Who told you to build the
building so fast?

538
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:51,934
Please sit down.

539
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:58,068
Directors, shareholders and
department heads.

540
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,835
We have called this meeting...

541
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:03,473
to review the past 6
months' property situation,

542
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06,278
before fixing the coming
year's sales policy.

543
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:10,252
As you know, the local stock
has now risen...

544
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:15,886
...two-thirds before last
year's market collapse.

545
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:20,126
Let's see the trends of the
local Blue Chip.

546
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,670
Judging from today's stock market.

547
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,477
Hotels and Manufactures
futures are good.

548
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,882
Good for all of Hong Kong.

549
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,715
Summing up the performance
of Banks & Properties,

550
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:50,092
the chance of rise & fall
for the next half is even.

551
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:56,830
So small investors may
invest in properties.

552
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:13,812
We must finish the new
houses soon.

553
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,687
Miss, you're beautiful.

554
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,828
The boss said when someone
comes for this coat...

555
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,496
...tell him to pay $500 for it.

556
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,299
Really?

557
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,634
Yes. Bye-bye.

558
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,464
How was it just now?

559
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,703
The meeting went ahead.

560
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,176
Did you bug the conference room?

561
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:40,906
Yes.

562
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,002
And the office?

563
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:42,843
Yes.

564
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,609
Did he say "yes"?

565
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,741
He didn't say "no".

566
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:48,975
What else did he say?

567
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,113
Buy flats later in the year.

568
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:50,985
Buy flats?

569
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,886
Where are you going?

570
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:52,822
I'll take the next lift.

571
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,809
Ka-kui, it's May.

572
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,584
May, so you're back.

573
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,018
Oh, you're so great!

574
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,682
May, listen.

575
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,360
Ka-kui, you didn't want me
to return?

576
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,729
You slipped away after
luring me onto the plane.

577
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,130
You even took away my passport.

578
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:40,535
I was expelled on arrival at Bali.

579
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,507
And I was detained for over 10 hours.

580
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,633
I must finish it.

581
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,712
Would you even leave a dog behind?

582
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,112
Wouldn't you take it back home?

583
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,706
I now fare worse than a dog.

584
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,376
They're all staring at you.

585
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,020
I'm only talking to him.

586
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,556
What has it got to do with you?

587
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,889
Tell me in front of everyone,

588
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,191
what are you taking me for?

589
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,094
A girlfriend, ok?

590
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:10,667
Girlfriend?

591
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,273
Girlfriend? Am I your girlfriend?

592
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,174
You're nicer to common citizens!

593
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,576
Listen.

594
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,441
It's all over between us

595
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,854
Chan Ka-Kui, I hate your guts!

596
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,295
Uncle Bill,
did you send the cable for me?

597
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,565
I was going to do it
when I left the toilet.

598
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,833
You've ruined my life!

599
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,282
May!

600
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,015
Don't be so hard-hearted.

601
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,021
Go away!

602
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,150
Calm down.

603
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,493
Don't hold my bag! Scram!

604
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,862
Don't touch me. Out of my way.

605
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,492
May, listen.

606
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,094
I've already finished what
I wanted to say.

607
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:20,968
I won't see you any more.

608
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:21,700
May

609
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,667
May, are you all right?

610
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,574
Keep away,
don't touch my motorcycle.

611
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,311
Keep away.

612
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:34,284
May, listen to my explanation.

613
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,250
Won't you come and help?

614
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:44,394
Keep away,
I won't see you any more.

615
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,629
May

616
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:49,530
Go back to work.
Tell Ka-Kui to come in.

617
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,535
Ka-Kui, he wants you.

618
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,338
Sorry, sir.

619
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,748
Sorry.

620
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:08,547
Calm down.
You want to call May to explain?

621
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,212
No point in explaining now.

622
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,722
Don't explain.
I said the same to my wife.

623
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,659
A man is working
when not at home.

624
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,852
Sorry, I must go to the toilet.

625
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,358
Don't copy Uncle Bill's
male chauvinism.

626
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,864
Go and change now.

627
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,992
Sorry, sir.

628
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,817
May

629
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,488
So you're leaving.

630
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:56,029
A whole day wasted for nothing.
I'm off.

631
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,463
Let me escort you back.

632
00:38:58,937 --> 00:38:59,926
No need.

633
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,441
Don't do anything foolish.

634
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,776
I'm serious.

635
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,571
It's no concern of hers.

636
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:11,604
Don't do anything foolish.

637
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,050
You're both in trouble.

638
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,075
Don't try anything!

639
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,415
I'll kill you.

640
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:25,394
I'll have some fun with you at last!

641
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,497
Ka-Kui!

642
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:40,709
Over here!

643
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,622
Detective, you're so outnumbered.

644
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,322
I shouldn't have brought so
many against you.

645
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,028
You've over-rated me.

646
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,330
My boss did it.
He wants to ruin you.

647
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,462
I took his money
and must do the job.

648
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:10,133
I give the orders and
my men deliver.

649
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,534
Make your move.

650
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,634
We are human too.

651
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,145
If you beg for mercy from John.

652
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,843
We won't shatter your feet.
We'll just break them half-way.

653
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,552
Stop dreaming.
Shoot if you have the guts.

654
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,882
It's a serious offence to
kill a policeman.

655
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,548
My boss wants to ruin you.

656
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,492
Breaking your limbs will be enough.

657
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:37,164
Get him.

658
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,298
Follow him.

659
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,981
He's here. Cripple him.

660
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,573
Beat him to a pulp.

661
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,535
Get up.

662
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,732
Let me do it.

663
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,915
Let me beat you so you're
permanently disabled.

664
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,702
It's not my fault,
I was paid to do it!

665
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:52,125
Keep away! I'll kill you,
I'm serious!

666
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:52,857
Fire at me!

667
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:53,420
I'll shoot!

668
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,363
Fire at my chest!

669
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,160
I'll shoot now!

670
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:05,638
It's not my fault!

671
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,541
Next time, I'll finish you off!

672
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,348
May!

673
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,515
May, are you alright?

674
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:21,814
Yes.

675
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,691
Take care of yourself.

676
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,325
Where are you going?
It's dangerous.

677
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,560
I wanted to even up the
score for you.

678
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,300
What if it was acid, not ink?

679
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,066
My face would have been
scarred for life.

680
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,700
Or, what if he lured you away
to get me.

681
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,143
What should I do then?

682
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:48,513
I want my boyfriend to be
gentle and considerate,

683
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:52,248
not a savage. Please understand.

684
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,789
Come in.

685
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:07,498
Good morning, sir.

686
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:12,900
'Detective on duty involved
in park scuffle'! Who? Look!

687
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,739
I must meet The Dogs first.

688
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:29,351
It's me, sir.

689
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:30,588
Sorry, sir.

690
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,533
YC Chu is vengeful but you
mustn't take it personally.

691
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:38,533
Sorry.

692
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:40,401
Do you need my help?

693
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,938
No, I think they're only
troublemaking.

694
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,032
I don't want it to spread.

695
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,807
Anyway, be alert.

696
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,775
The Dogs have been sent
to help you.

697
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,750
They're highly efficient.
Talk with them.

698
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:57,880
Thank you, sir.

699
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,287
Did he scold you? He must...

700
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,089
Let's go over there.

701
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,770
Any news?

702
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,332
Press said Fung's stock
may rise to $8.40

703
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,507
We've no cash to buy in.

704
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:23,139
And the new Miss Beach is
his girlfriend.

705
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:24,738
Mind your own business.

706
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,574
I'll take it. You call May.

707
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,216
Go on.

708
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,887
Ka-kui, some news.

709
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:43,666
I already reported this
to the board,

710
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:45,530
and they've agreed,
in principle, to pay.

711
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,798
Get to the point.
Is the money ready?

712
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:51,569
Almost. $10 million is not
a small amount.

713
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:52,870
Check the source of the
phone call.

714
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,007
Tai Po District.

715
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,041
Trace it.

716
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,836
Ting Kok Road, Tai Po.

717
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,173
Headquarters calling, any
officers in Ting Kok Road?

718
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,211
Any officers in Ting Kok Road?
Over.

719
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,509
Yes, I'm PC12674.
What do you want? Over.

720
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,442
Listen, PC12674.

721
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,018
Check any man leaving
a phone booth. Over.

722
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:36,850
Roger.

723
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,415
Have you tipped off the cops
Don't stall for time.

724
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,516
No, we won't do anything stupid.

725
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,322
We now want $20 million.

726
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:47,554
$20 million?

727
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:48,791
No bargaining.

728
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,530
PC12674.

729
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:58,471
Speak up.

730
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,175
I've found a suspect.

731
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:03,770
Stay alert. He could be
armed and dangerous.

732
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,312
Don't cause any panic.

733
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:06,778
Roger.

734
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,884
Sir, it's an offence not to
use the zebra crossing.

735
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:19,761
Go on,

736
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,093
Give me a break, sir.

737
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,427
Your ID card, please.

738
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,311
Calling Headquarter.

739
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,363
We need more men at that
phone booth.

740
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:56,094
Officers in the area,
please come to help at once.

741
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:01,161
Sorry, I can't identify.

742
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:05,935
Don't say "sorry",
it's no fault of yours.

743
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,439
How long have you been
in the force?

744
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,241
I left school two months ago.

745
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,774
You're excused, then.

746
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,115
Will I be punished for
having my gun stolen?

747
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,676
Have I lose any chance of
ever being promoted?

748
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,755
Not necessarily. You've learnt
from the experience.

749
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,090
A cop has to have his gun
stolen at least once.

750
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,092
It'll make him more careful in
the future.

751
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,857
Could you identify the suspect if
you saw him again?

752
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,919
Yes, dead or alive.

753
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,090
It's for you, boss.

754
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,290
Join our team and work with us.

755
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:31,767
I've already applied to join you.

756
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,637
Please fix that file for me.

757
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:37,904
Who is it?

758
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:38,907
Joker.

759
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:39,637
Speak up.

760
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:40,268
There's some news.

761
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,072
What news?

762
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,410
A Crazy Fai is dealing in dynamite.

763
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,348
See you at Hoi Wong Bar
at 9 tonight.

764
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,793
You know what to do?

765
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:03,765
No

766
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:04,799
You don't?

767
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,206
Hey, buddy.

768
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,004
Fai, I want to talk to you.

769
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,508
I don't know you.

770
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,271
We'll get on over time.

771
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,746
Well, let's talk over there.

772
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:21,407
Take your time.

773
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:27,947
What's your name?

774
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:28,890
Lo

775
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:29,915
Can I help you?

776
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,656
I want to buy a fish bomb.

777
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,261
Fish bomb?

778
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:34,525
Fai, I was introduced by a friend.

779
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:35,428
What do you need it for?

780
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,329
To catch fish.

781
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,668
You don't look like a fisherman.

782
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,099
Do I have to tell you I need it
for some serious business?

783
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:45,165
The profits are high.
I'll cut you in.

784
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,943
Ok, I'll make enquiries for you.

785
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,005
The goods don't belong to me.
Wait.

786
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:52,810
Thank you.

787
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,498
Sorry, my friend has already quit.

788
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,829
But he's making enquiries
for you. Wait here.

789
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,962
I'll come back when it's finished.
Wait.

790
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:14,970
Ok.

791
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,514
Hey, you. Stand up.

792
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,544
What is it?

793
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:05,049
CID, stand up.

794
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:16,822
Hands up.

795
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,300
Listen,
I've just come here to drink.

796
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,893
Drink? Someone said you
posses contraband.

797
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:24,339
Don't look.

798
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:36,514
Don't move. Throw it with
the holster, quick.

799
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,580
Stand together.

800
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:44,627
Don't do anything foolish.

801
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:57,999
Stand up. You have it?

802
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,301
Come out.

803
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:53,760
Keep away.

804
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,098
Bastard, you don't have to
sell to me.

805
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,301
Help.

806
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:11,144
Please, stop! You may kill me.

807
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,246
Why did you play that trick on me?

808
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,943
I wanted to make sure you're
not a spy.

809
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,781
So I got two CID guys
to check you out.

810
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,578
You can get the stuff easily.

811
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:19,585
Where is it?

812
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:20,822
Have you got the money?

813
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,320
It's cash on delivery.

814
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:32,361
Watch it for me.

815
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:47,945
Is it powerful?

816
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:49,747
Why not?
It's for blowing up rocks.

817
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,248
Any more?

818
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:52,681
Plenty.

819
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,297
Enough to blow up the
Empire State Building.

820
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,491
I don't know him. I just met him
for the first time.

821
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:06,935
I really don't know him!

822
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,736
You think you can get away?

823
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:14,738
Have some coffee.

824
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:16,538
Smoke?

825
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,978
Cooperate, and you'll go free.

826
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,683
Ever you ever got any confession
with this method?

827
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:25,487
It's never failed.

828
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,580
Well, what's the charge?

829
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,454
Come on! I've seen everthing.

830
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,728
But I'd rather play along.

831
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,575
You won't get mad so easily, right?

832
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,814
Have you never seen a girl use force?

833
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:01,915
Stop that!

834
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,591
Stop it!

835
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,362
Have you ever met such ruffians?

836
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,161
You promised to play along.

837
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,934
I'll sue you bitches.

838
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:21,107
Don't talk big. I could kill
you with one shot...

839
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,611
...and claim my gun misfired.

840
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,637
Who'd pity you even if you
were dead?

841
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:27,583
Come on!

842
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,947
I'll talk.

843
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,018
Why didn't you do so earlier?

844
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,250
Come on and have some coffee.

845
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,346
Have a smoke.

846
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,356
No, thanks.

847
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,017
Someone's peeping.

848
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,860
What's there to see?

849
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,764
I sold some sticks of dynamite
to some people recently.

850
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,737
One is a boatman.

851
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,240
He blasts the water to kill fish.

852
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:55,675
The second one picks up
empty shells...

853
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,976
...and he bought our stuff to
make bullets for resale.

854
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:05,185
The third is Polar Bear,
a big dealer.

855
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,657
He usually hangs out
at a Yaumatei poolroom.

856
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,984
Let me go and have a look.

857
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:15,490
Hung

858
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,355
Shopping?

859
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,628
Have you been followed?

860
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:22,097
No. What about you?

861
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,600
Don't look. Open up.

862
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,005
He was seen entering a storehouse.

863
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,635
There's a man waited for them.

864
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:39,943
We're sure there are three inside.

865
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,021
We'll wait here for them.

866
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,217
Keep up the surveillance.

867
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,832
They're coming out.

868
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,081
Check their car licence.
488, follow them.

869
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,381
You stay here.
I'll go down and see.

870
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:24,488
We're setting off now.

871
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:29,391
Ka-Kui, where are you going?

872
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:30,422
I'll go in to have a look.

873
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:31,125
Be alert.

874
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:31,826
I will.

875
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:33,265
Received.

876
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:37,096
They're tricky.
They've shaken off 488.

877
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,938
Don't worry, they'll return for sure.

878
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:39,965
Tell them to come back.

879
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:40,738
Yes sir.

880
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:42,804
Come back, 488.

881
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,576
Don't. It's me.

882
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,444
Quiet!

883
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,912
You scared me!

884
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:58,886
I slipped!

885
01:00:58,956 --> 01:00:59,854
There's somebody else here.

886
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:17,863
Stay where you are!

887
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:22,434
Turn around!

888
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,714
Police, what are you doing?

889
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,147
He must be dumb.

890
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,894
Did you see three men over
here just now?

891
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,330
Question him.

892
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:51,530
Do you work here?

893
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,505
Do you sleep here?

894
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:07,613
He's gesturing
but I can't understand him.

895
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:08,955
You get what you can from him.

896
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:10,616
Take him to the police
station first.

897
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,461
Come along. It's okay!

898
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:16,689
I only want you for questioning.
Come on.

899
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,064
No need to handcuff him.

900
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:22,998
Are all these things yours?

901
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:55,668
Don't go away.

902
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:56,900
He can't hear you. Follow him.

903
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:08,712
Help me get back my gun.

904
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,990
Mr Chan.

905
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,629
Let's scatter! Find that
deaf-mute. Take care.

906
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:24,799
Yes, sir.

907
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,366
I didn't expect that
guy to be such a good fighter.

908
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,804
Neither did I.
Help me find my gun first.

909
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,972
If our plan to acquire
Indian Ocean Bank succeeds.

910
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:40,346
We've a better method to raise
funds from shareholders.

911
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,940
President Fung, it's for you

912
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,010
I told you I won't take any calls.

913
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,516
It was the same man as last time.

914
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,187
Jimmy.

915
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:50,887
Sorry.

916
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:02,664
You lied, you've reported
us to the police.

917
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,639
Don't misunderstand.
We didn't...

918
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:07,302
Stop acting.
We knew you'd call the police.

919
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,341
I knew we couldn't stop you
from doing that.

920
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,915
If you still think it pays to pay
$20 million.

921
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:16,952
Publish an advertisement in
a best-selling paper...

922
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:19,545
...in the name of your group
tomorrow afternoon.

923
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,155
Broadcast it once again.

924
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,488
Where did the call come from?

925
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,357
It can't be traced, maybe a
remodelled radiophone.

926
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:27,161
We knew you'd call the police.

927
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,892
I knew we couldn't stop
you from doing that.

928
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:32,433
We'll show you our power
tomorrow noon.

929
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,937
We won't waste any more time
bargaining with you.

930
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,668
Don't worry,
they're only threatening.

931
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,935
We've sent more men to your premises.

932
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:42,577
It's going to be alright.

933
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,014
Listen, we can't let them
cause any more chaos.

934
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,114
Yes, sir.

935
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:52,754
Honestly, I didn't rat on you.

936
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:53,619
You didn't, eh?

937
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,852
The cops came after they got you.

938
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:58,224
They wouldn't let you go
if you hadn't squealed.

939
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,626
It's a simply lack of evidence.

940
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,889
I didn't squeal on you.

941
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,402
Anyway, we're not afraid of you.

942
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:08,696
Where now?

943
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:09,999
You've no choice.

944
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:11,804
Miss Wong, what's the matter

945
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,374
The letters have been examined.

946
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:14,736
Thanks.

947
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,268
Flowers for you.

948
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:25,043
Plant this and we're even.

949
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,381
You've no choice.
Hold it tight.

950
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:29,824
Where shall I put it?

951
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,121
You'll see later.

952
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,092
Start the car.

953
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,396
Roger, keep the alert going.

954
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,267
Police, what's this?

955
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:57,344
What's that?

956
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,250
Nothing

957
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:00,248
Nothing.

958
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,524
Sorry. CID. May I take a look?

959
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,143
I'm CID. Show me your bag.

960
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:27,675
Looking into the red bag.

961
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,012
Sir, I'm CID.

962
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,092
Come back now.

963
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:48,693
Seems like no problem.

964
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,204
These letters have been examined.

965
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,531
Roger.

966
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,208
Could it be a bluff?

967
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:59,407
I hope so.
But it's better to be cautious.

968
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,212
Good, keep in touch.

969
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:08,685
Tell him to wait.

970
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,257
Roger.

971
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:13,485
May is downstairs.

972
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,225
She has something to tell you.

973
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,289
Thanks.

974
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,935
What's it, May?

975
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:27,332
This letter's for you.
I must leave.

976
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:31,977
You brought me down just for this?

977
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,880
It's important. Keep it safe.

978
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,851
Where's your motorcycle?

979
01:07:39,022 --> 01:07:42,014
As the bike and I are incompatible,
I sold it.

980
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,691
I'll follow that girl.

981
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:03,035
I've got everything prepared

982
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,677
Relax. It's only a bluff.

983
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:06,976
We depend entirely on the police

984
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:07,778
Ok.

985
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,716
What happened?

986
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:29,063
How come?

987
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:37,735
Find out what's happening!
At once!

988
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:38,644
Let's all keep calm.

989
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:39,613
Let's all keep calm.

990
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:40,547
Ka-Kui, let's go down and
take a look!

991
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,548
Get someone to investigate!

992
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:42,242
Yes sir!

993
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:47,913
Bring a fire extinguisher!

994
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,858
Help put out the fire!
Quickly!

995
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,758
Has the ambulance arrived?

996
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,093
Call them at once.

997
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,394
Get more men to help!

998
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:03,698
A call from President Fung.

999
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,332
Uncle Bill,
a call from the developers.

1000
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,504
Ka-Kui, I'll go and deal with it,
you follow.

1001
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,904
What's wrong with you people?

1002
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:19,981
What happened?

1003
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,314
The President's secretary
got her arm blown off.

1004
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:37,898
How's the secretary now?

1005
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:42,274
Surgery went smoothly.
The doc says there's a 95% chance.

1006
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,475
Her facial wound was covered
using skin from her leg.

1007
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,740
We'll know the result later.

1008
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:53,982
They've now decided to pay.
What am I suppose to tell Raymond?

1009
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:58,359
We've no choice, Uncle Bill.

1010
01:09:58,428 --> 01:09:59,827
Obstacles are inevitable in anything.

1011
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,524
Remember, we're facing real bandits.

1012
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,997
I'd rather be blown up myself...

1013
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,525
...to save the lives
of everybody else.

1014
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:08,901
Don't worry,
I've deployed everything.

1015
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,905
If one of them comes to collect,
we'll nab him.

1016
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:14,569
Raymond would complain
if I told him about this.

1017
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:17,076
No point
in saying anything right now.

1018
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,545
Sir

1019
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:25,320
They want to pay. How am I to
tell my superiors?

1020
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,559
No way, we've no choice.

1021
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,925
Obstacles are inevitable in anything.

1022
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:39,868
Remember, we're facing real bandits.

1023
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,564
I would rather be blown up myself.

1024
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,801
To save the lives of everybody else.

1025
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:48,140
Don't worry,
I've deployed everything.

1026
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:50,736
If he comes to collect,
we'll handcuff him.

1027
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:53,748
All words, no action.

1028
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,390
This is bad,
Raymond's going to be in trouble.

1029
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,262
We don't want that to
happen either.

1030
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,269
In fact,
frustrations are inevitable.

1031
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:18,029
Remember, we're facing real bandits.

1032
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,806
I'd rather be blown up myself.

1033
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,436
So that no one else will suffer.

1034
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:25,878
But don't worry.

1035
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:28,778
If they dare try to collect,
I'll arrest them.

1036
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,580
I understand your situation,

1037
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:33,383
and I'll report it accordingly.

1038
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,253
I hope you'll solve it quickly.

1039
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,565
Come with me.

1040
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,862
Why are you depressed?
Quarreled with Ka-Kui again?

1041
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,374
It won't, it won't happen anymore.

1042
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:07,822
Wait.

1043
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:08,755
Hold it.

1044
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:12,322
An important call for you.

1045
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,487
Put it through.

1046
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:15,086
Put it through.

1047
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:17,562
Ka-Kui.

1048
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,065
Yes.

1049
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:19,760
May was abducted.

1050
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:20,665
When was that?

1051
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:23,831
When we returned from
the supermarket.

1052
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:25,465
Do you know who did it?

1053
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:28,841
No, it could be your enemies.

1054
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,903
Those ruffians again?

1055
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:32,646
Chu Tao!

1056
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,645
Ka-Kui

1057
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:39,713
Ka-Kui, what happened?

1058
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,553
You don't need to know.
I going after a real scumbag.

1059
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,580
Ka-Kui

1060
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:44,718
What's he doing?

1061
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:45,750
He left without saying a word.

1062
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:48,625
Don't die yet, sign it first

1063
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:49,461
Our henchmen...

1064
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,329
Don't, sir, he's a patient.
Let me finish first.

1065
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:53,666
Our men deserve credit for
what they did.

1066
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,670
Are you taking the money
into your coffin?

1067
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,077
Chu Tao!

1068
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,515
Chu Tao!

1069
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:56,230
Hand May over to me!

1070
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:57,288
I didn't know he did this!

1071
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:58,857
I didn't do anything!

1072
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,427
Hand May over to me now!

1073
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:06,167
That's no way
to treat a patient, sir!

1074
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,568
Where are you hiding May?
Speak up.

1075
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:09,839
I didn't do it.

1076
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:10,935
Who did it then?

1077
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:14,313
I told him to get out.
I'm now sick and poor.

1078
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,779
How can I make fun of you now?

1079
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:18,844
Any money he has.
He's spend it on treatment.

1080
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,287
It's no concern of ours.

1081
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:23,848
He dictated everything.
We got paid, that's all.

1082
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,755
Who is it?

1083
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,595
There's a phone over there.
Answer it.

1084
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,897
Old man, don't die,
sign this first.

1085
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,902
Is there be anything more between us?

1086
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:36,995
I couldn't care less,
he's dying.

1087
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,404
Maybe there would be,
if he was still alive.

1088
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:51,950
Who's calling 1478?

1089
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:53,044
Ka-kui.

1090
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,612
May.

1091
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,247
You can recognise her voice.

1092
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,554
Come immediately to
Hung Fung Industrial Building.

1093
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:00,425
Who are you? What do you want?

1094
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,328
Come alone, or be ready to
collect her body.

1095
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,264
Sun Fa Road

1096
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:46,901
May, are you alright?

1097
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:50,904
Don't yell.

1098
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,272
Are you alright?

1099
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:53,313
Yes.

1100
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,844
Why have you taken her hostage?

1101
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:59,912
Ka-Kui, when you read this letter,
I've decided to leave you.

1102
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,355
Please don't read it.

1103
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,315
I won't see you any more.

1104
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,157
A love letter.

1105
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:11,332
One loses weight if her
lover leaves her.

1106
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:12,423
There's more, listen.

1107
01:16:12,502 --> 01:16:13,594
You scum!

1108
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,834
At first I thought you were sincere.

1109
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,001
And I could put my life
in your hands.

1110
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:25,845
Now I can't stand your
excessive passion for your work.

1111
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:29,510
I asked myself:
Why has the reason for my loving you...

1112
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:33,481
...turned into reason for leaving you?

1113
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:36,653
How would we part over
something trivial?

1114
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,862
You said you wouldn't
involve me in your work.

1115
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,263
But I don't mind.

1116
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,961
I only mind that you have no
time to spend with me.

1117
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:49,801
I'm happiest in your company

1118
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,830
But waiting alone,
without seeing you.

1119
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:55,035
Becomes the cruelest thing
in the world.

1120
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:56,441
This is your fault.

1121
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:59,073
It means, if I didn't leave you,

1122
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:03,015
I'd be waiting for you all my life.

1123
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,576
Don't read any more.

1124
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,883
She's crying.

1125
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:11,015
Cry!

1126
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,887
Go on.

1127
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:18,132
Because you are a policeman
who never relaxes

1128
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:20,163
You're a policeman
who never relaxes?

1129
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:22,131
We're in trouble then.

1130
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:25,532
Leaving you means suffering
once and for all.

1131
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:30,469
Please forgive my selfish decision,
May.

1132
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:36,081
What do you want?

1133
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:39,043
Nothing but your help
to make us rich.

1134
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:42,218
You know we're blackmailing the group.

1135
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:44,453
Collection is always the
hardest part of a blackmail.

1136
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,959
So I need your help to
collect for us.

1137
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,154
Stop dreaming.

1138
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:48,557
You've no choice.

1139
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,425
He won't help us to collect.

1140
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:00,667
Inflict the Thunder Palm on him.

1141
01:18:03,446 --> 01:18:04,640
Stop!

1142
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:06,278
Don't!

1143
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,777
Don't, I beg you.

1144
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:13,183
Stop!

1145
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:16,050
Don't!

1146
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:18,892
Ka-kui, are you alright?

1147
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,190
Yes.

1148
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,592
Acting like a hero!

1149
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:44,885
It'll be your turn next.

1150
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:57,693
Stop!

1151
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,298
Get the car in right position.

1152
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:11,371
You son-of-a-bitch!

1153
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:14,675
Well done, Dumby!

1154
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:16,309
Kill me if you have the guts

1155
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:17,716
You can bear it.

1156
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:21,382
Is that so? Let me see how
his girl friend does.

1157
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,191
What are you doing?

1158
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:30,996
Can you stand it?

1159
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:36,937
Stop!

1160
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:39,569
Are you going to do it?
Speak up!

1161
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,567
Let her go,
I'll do anything for you.

1162
01:19:42,745 --> 01:19:45,839
You'd do anything for her?
We can't set her free.

1163
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:47,414
What do you want?

1164
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:50,213
Collect the money for us
and we'll release her.

1165
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,243
You've no other choice.

1166
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:02,486
Ok!

1167
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:03,428
Splendid!

1168
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:28,856
Don't try to get out
of your clothes.

1169
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:31,992
Break one wire and it explodes.

1170
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:35,760
The same thing happens
if I press this button.

1171
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,664
Be careful now.

1172
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:01,454
Ka-Kui

1173
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,152
Take care!

1174
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:07,890
I'll come back!

1175
01:21:23,613 --> 01:21:24,409
What now?

1176
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,000
- We've got something!
- Check the source of the call

1177
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:27,741
I'll go and find Uncle Bill!

1178
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,210
Is the money ready?

1179
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,551
I'll get someone to collect
it in 10 minutes.

1180
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:33,885
It's ready!

1181
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,082
Notify the police!

1182
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:35,851
We didn't!

1183
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:44,128
Where's Ka-kui?

1184
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,792
I can't find him.

1185
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:47,868
Impossible. How could he be
so irresponsible?

1186
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:48,800
I won't wait.

1187
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:50,929
Listen, don't move unless
you're 100% sure!

1188
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:51,996
Stand by to move!

1189
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:52,870
Yes, sir!

1190
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:02,641
The trip takes 15 minutes.
Just in time.

1191
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:04,275
Don't play dirty jokes!

1192
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,217
If you don't get the money here,

1193
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:08,152
the bombs on you will blow up.

1194
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:10,855
We'll wait here for you.

1195
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:12,957
Go now.

1196
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,526
Good luck!

1197
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:28,006
Sir, you...

1198
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:29,238
We're here to investigate a case.

1199
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:35,048
The Chief is looking for...

1200
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:36,206
Ka-Kui!

1201
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:37,944
Ka-Kui?

1202
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,051
Ka-Kui, what are you doing?

1203
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:41,555
Keep away!

1204
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,323
Keep away! Don't get in my way!

1205
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:46,653
Don't get in my way!

1206
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,360
Ka-kui!

1207
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:52,697
Sir, you...

1208
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:56,932
Ka-Kui!

1209
01:22:58,174 --> 01:22:59,368
Ka-Kui, where have you been?

1210
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,999
Never mind, I'm here to
collect the money.

1211
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:03,100
Collect the money?

1212
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,168
Your men?

1213
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:05,311
Men?

1214
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,575
Ka-Kui, are you alright?

1215
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:09,879
Time's running out.
Where's the money?

1216
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,215
What are you doing?

1217
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,123
Ka-Kui

1218
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,561
I'll do my duty if you move.

1219
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,087
Don't shoot!

1220
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,122
Raymond, don't!

1221
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,361
I'll shoot!

1222
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:30,235
Shoot, and you and
Uncle Bill will die!

1223
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:32,296
You'll all die!

1224
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,603
Break a wire and
my body explodes!

1225
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,343
Ka-Kui, what on earth has happened?

1226
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:43,375
Calm down, let's team up
and deal with it.

1227
01:23:43,419 --> 01:23:47,116
If I can't get out in 10
minutes, it will explode!

1228
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:00,527
Don't follow him!

1229
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,429
You go back first!

1230
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:08,272
Listen, don't stop Ka-Kui
when you see him.

1231
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:12,780
He's back!

1232
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:14,643
Right!

1233
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,450
He seems to be followed!

1234
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,111
Let's go!

1235
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:19,185
Start the car!

1236
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,460
Get him over!

1237
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,569
Give me the case!

1238
01:24:40,676 --> 01:24:43,873
I'll come back after I shake
off the CID.

1239
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:45,240
Believe me!

1240
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:54,883
The cops are following?

1241
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,497
Stop there. Don't come over!

1242
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:17,907
Why are you stopping here?

1243
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:24,115
What's up? What are you up to?

1244
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,016
What the hell!

1245
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,918
A bomb's exploding. Run!

1246
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:28,818
A bomb. Run!

1247
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:49,734
The cops are following?

1248
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:51,609
Trying to fool us! Blow
him to bits first!

1249
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,807
And the money too?

1250
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,714
Radio signals go dead in the tunnel!

1251
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:57,650
What then?

1252
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,881
Anyway, we've the girl!

1253
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:00,820
Lets go back first!

1254
01:27:20,336 --> 01:27:21,325
So you'll wait him!

1255
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:26,773
Kill her if something goes wrong.

1256
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,064
May!

1257
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:55,526
The car's back!

1258
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,402
He dare not play any tricks.

1259
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:24,156
May!

1260
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:31,464
Quiet!

1261
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,837
Freeze, you're under arrest!

1262
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,209
Why are you arresting me?

1263
01:29:45,247 --> 01:29:47,442
Come over here!

1264
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,743
Don't be foolish!

1265
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,341
I'll shoot you down!

1266
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:54,385
Can you shoot so fast?

1267
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,980
One shot to kill three!

1268
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,252
Think it over. A few years inside

1269
01:29:59,328 --> 01:30:00,727
And you can start over!

1270
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:05,129
Sure, we'd like to try your way,

1271
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:10,168
But, those would be our best years!

1272
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:13,771
Don't force me to shoot!

1273
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:15,739
Don't shoot.
There are explosives all around.

1274
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:32,839
May!

1275
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,212
I'm here!

1276
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:35,841
You're alright, aren't you?

1277
01:32:42,257 --> 01:32:43,554
Ka-Kui, take care!

1278
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:07,279
Good job, Dumby!

1279
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:18,289
Come up here!

1280
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:32,831
There's a conveyor belt.

1281
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:36,636
Don't touch it! It's dangerous.
Go!

1282
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,314
It's so high up here!

1283
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:45,347
High enough for you to jump.

1284
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:07,571
What's happened to you?

1285
01:34:08,276 --> 01:34:10,471
May, go as far as you can!

1286
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:12,035
Take care!

1287
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:23,707
Papa! Papa!

1288
01:36:23,879 --> 01:36:25,073
Beat you up! Papa!

1289
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,850
Papa, papa, still calling for Papa!

1290
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:33,181
Papa, papa. Mama to you!

1291
01:36:34,756 --> 01:36:35,654
Papa!

1292
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:39,123
Papa, Papa, Mama to you!

1293
01:36:39,528 --> 01:36:41,621
Papa? Mama?

1294
01:36:43,532 --> 01:36:44,430
Papa?

1295
01:37:25,974 --> 01:37:27,066
Goddamn!

1296
01:38:12,854 --> 01:38:14,048
Ka-Kui!

1297
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,323
Stop crying!

1298
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,161
Look at the beautiful fireworks!
