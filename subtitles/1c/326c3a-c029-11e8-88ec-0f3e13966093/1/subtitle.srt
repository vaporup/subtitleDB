1
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,340
Come on, Susan.

2
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,709
Think about Daniel.

3
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,171
He wants you to be happy.

4
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:54,852
Come on, Susan.

5
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,756
Give her a hand.

6
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,324
Mrs. Tsui, be brave.

7
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,866
Mrs. Tsui.

8
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:06,164
Come on, Mrs. Tsui.

9
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,899
You got the wrong person.

10
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,972
My daughter-in-law is over there.

11
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:05,956
Cathy, Daniel's Caribbean trip
turned out to be a tragedy.

12
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,496
You met him there and got married.

13
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,337
Then he died unexpectedly.

14
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,900
You're a strong girl, Cathy.

15
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,744
I didn't expect you to hold up.

16
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,810
Grandma, my real name is May.

17
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,614
Daniel said your name was Cathy.

18
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:31,487
Who knew if he was for real?
I made it up.

19
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,182
Why isn't your father here?

20
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,159
Busy in meetings?

21
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,930
He could've come. But his sentence
just got extended.

22
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,429
Sentence? Your father's in jail?

23
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,929
Yes. For smuggling pigs.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,301
Isn't he a diamond tycoon?

25
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:49,973
I lied to Daniel.

26
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,472
Why?

27
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,305
Because he made up stories.

28
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,171
What did he say?

29
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,939
He bragged about himself.

30
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,345
Said he represented top
fashion labels,

31
00:03:58,518 --> 00:03:59,542
went to Stanford,

32
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,313
came from a good family,
started his own business,

33
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,354
and won many honors.

34
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:07,152
They're all true.

35
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,895
I didn't know, so I made up stories.

36
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,664
Did Daniel know before he died?

37
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,467
Yes and no.

38
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,130
I didn't tell everything.

39
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,536
Susan.

40
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,681
Can I look around my house?

41
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,845
Come on, Susan.

42
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,643
I dated Daniel for 7 years.

43
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,683
Took him 7 days to marry this woman.

44
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:08,446
Whisky.

45
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:13,517
3 years. You broke up 4 years ago.

46
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,490
They don't count.

47
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,623
We have this in different colors.

48
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:55,992
Miss.

49
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,226
Please look around.

50
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,156
Are you crazy?
Stealing our own product?

51
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,056
At least it's ours.

52
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:24,422
Don't defend her!

53
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:25,892
Daniel and I spent 7 years

54
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,057
to build this company.

55
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,293
Took Daniel 7 days to marry me.

56
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,005
I just lost it on the spot.

57
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:43,847
This can't go on.

58
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,318
You have to find something to do.

59
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,985
Tell me, what's your ambition?

60
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,620
It's done: To marry a rich man.

61
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,357
And he passed away.

62
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,639
Call me next time if you lose it.

63
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,441
I'll get you any bag you like.

64
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,204
Why help me?

65
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,642
You're my sister-in-law.

66
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:17,974
Daniel loved you. So do I.

67
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,081
Where's my purse?

68
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,119
Did you see it?

69
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,453
No.

70
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,592
It was just here.

71
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,860
Strange.

72
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,965
I had it on me.

73
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,214
Still don't recognized me
after 3 years?

74
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,720
Sorry, Whisky is too old.

75
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,654
The master is dead, Whisky is dead,

76
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,560
you are no good!

77
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,165
Go take a look.

78
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,999
I smell gasoline!

79
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,306
There's a girl. Call the police.

80
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,325
This is Saigon...

81
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:52,494
What street?

82
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:53,704
I'm not sure.

83
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:55,170
The road is under construction.

84
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,638
Miss, wake up.

85
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,309
Am I dead?

86
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,280
Miss...

87
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,851
Call ambulance.

88
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,649
Am I dead?

89
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,591
Not yet! Go back now.

90
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,100
But it's going to hurt.

91
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,293
What if I'm disfigured or crippled?

92
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,835
You'll be fine!

93
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,235
Hurry!

94
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,210
I'm dead. Leave me alone!

95
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:38,343
You better listen to me.

96
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:40,252
Who are you?

97
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,853
Why should I listen to you?

98
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,596
Left arm and left leg are broken.

99
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,525
3 broken ribs on the left.

100
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,031
Left lob is punctured.

101
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,328
A clot is compressing
on the left optic nerve.

102
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:58,504
Everything okay on the right?

103
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,695
Yes.

104
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,238
Let's all move to the left.

105
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,737
Your left or my left?

106
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,207
The patient's left!

107
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:14,984
Why is it taking so long?

108
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,621
Long enough to butcher a pig.

109
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,760
May, you better be all right.

110
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,192
Daddy's too old for this!

111
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,157
I left the triad for you.

112
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,830
Now I go to bed at 10, wake up at 6.

113
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,470
How I can go back to that life?

114
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,740
Who'll pay for the bills?

115
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,135
Or the mortgage?

116
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,636
If May dies, her money will be ours.

117
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,144
Shut up!

118
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,680
Be nice to your stepsister!

119
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,045
May's money came from Daniel.

120
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,449
If she dies, it'll go back
to Grandma.

121
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,249
Shut up!

122
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,324
Be nice to your stepsister!

123
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,171
We're her immediate family.
The money is ours!

124
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:14,811
Grandma

125
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,206
It's okay.

126
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,712
Sit.

127
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,282
Move!

128
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,920
No, you sit.

129
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,578
No, sit.

130
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,650
You were here first.

131
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,191
No. I'm a gentleman.

132
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:29,324
Come on.

133
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,429
Fine. Thanks.

134
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:34,730
It's hot.

135
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,499
Hot? Let me.

136
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,163
It's ready, please.

137
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,740
Thanks.

138
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:45,806
How's May?

139
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,606
Don't know, we've been waiting
for hours.

140
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:50,373
I'm sure she'll be fine.

141
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,518
Thanks for your kind words.

142
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,754
What now?

143
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,582
My shoe.

144
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,490
We'll stand.

145
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,259
- Sit.
- No.

146
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,823
Sorry.

147
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,561
Please sit.

148
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,020
No!

149
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,498
We will not sit. Okay?

150
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,245
Room 3, bed 19. It's this one!

151
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,516
A young beauty. What a shame.

152
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,617
Nobody escapes death.

153
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:00,877
Officer, what are you doing?

154
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,146
We're told she'll die in 5 minutes.

155
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,220
We came to pick her up.

156
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,984
Who are you? What's it to you?

157
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,092
I know her.

158
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,286
So? This is not your business.

159
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,226
No, officer, why her?

160
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:15,162
She just barely escaped death.

161
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,666
So she'll die again.
Don't interfere with us.

162
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:20,567
Leave. Our order says it's her.

163
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,333
Is it possible you made a mistake?

164
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,171
We never make mistakes.

165
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:27,676
This is odd.

166
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,577
Doctors said
she'll make quick recovery.

167
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,218
It's not her time yet.
Anything can happen in 5 minutes.

168
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,319
How?

169
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,651
She's energetic
and is eating a banana.

170
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,353
Eating a banana doesn't mean

171
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,221
she's energetic or she won't die.

172
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,727
Ever heard of "sudden death"?

173
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:47,991
But she doesn't have the look of it.

174
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,964
There's a look of it?

175
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,763
There is! I'm an example.

176
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,337
I looked different right
before I died.

177
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,632
See?

178
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,906
Then we'll wait and see how she dies.

179
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,738
Why not double-check your order?

180
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,743
Right, we don't want any mistakes.

181
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,974
Hurry, check your PDA!

182
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,344
I don't need you to teach me.

183
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,750
Then hurry! So?

184
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:13,981
No looking!

185
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,684
So?

186
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,891
We'll look ourselves.

187
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,230
Correct! She's choked to death.

188
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
It says she'll choke on banana.

189
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,607
No, it says she'll choke on plantain!

190
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,643
But she's eating a banana.

191
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,179
They're the same thing.

192
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,909
Banana and plantain are different.

193
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,416
They are?

194
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:41,518
I think so.

195
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,917
But look at the size of that.
It's a plantain!

196
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,255
Size doesn't matter!
It's still a banana.

197
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,828
It also says your subject is a man.

198
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,829
The name doesn't match.

199
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,228
Really?

200
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,264
May Ho!

201
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:00,766
It's true.

202
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,101
But we have the right room number.

203
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:04,937
Isn't this Kowloon Hospital?

204
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,238
This is Hong Kong Hospital.

205
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:10,940
Told you you were wrong!
You just wouldn't admit it.

206
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,276
Calm down.

207
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:13,816
You could've took her away
by mistake.

208
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,477
I wonder if this is how I died.

209
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,289
We'll be on our way.

210
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,829
Kamen Rider again protects

211
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,261
mankind from the Shocker.

212
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:32,170
Go! Go! Let's go!

213
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,670
To protect the peace of the world!

214
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,081
You can see me.

215
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,268
My left eye sees ghosts!

216
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,647
May, are you allowed to smoke?

217
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,545
Doctors said it's fine.

218
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,913
What's wrong with Daniel's plants?

219
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,920
May is no good

220
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,961
May, are you allowed to drink?

221
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,428
Doctors said it's fine.

222
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,072
What's wrong with Daniel's Whisky?

223
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,402
May is no good.

224
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,377
Susan, we came to visit May.

225
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,542
You shouldn't scream every time.

226
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,345
Whisky's dead!

227
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:39,196
Grandma, I'm still a patient.

228
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,297
What do you usually do in the house?

229
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,403
Smoking, drinking, sleeping,
eating, watching TV!

230
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,173
If you can drink and smoke,

231
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:50,899
it means you can work.

232
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,306
Come to the office on Monday.
Be on time.

233
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,465
May is very devoted.

234
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,002
Daniel's car is a wreck
but she's keeping it.

235
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,021
Forget it...

236
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:28,784
I give up.

237
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,890
Do whatever you want.

238
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:33,655
If it's death then so be it.

239
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:36,630
Just don't make it painful.

240
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:47,271
I took sleeping pills. I'm tired...

241
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:50,036
What happened to you, puppy?

242
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:16,262
Relax.

243
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,232
You forgot to hit the brake
and shut the door.

244
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,166
Hurry! It's dying.

245
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,037
Hurry!

246
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,169
Drive carefully!

247
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,193
We'll do everything we can.

248
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:47,889
Wait outside.

249
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,873
It's the medicine.
I'll go wash my face.

250
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,325
Sorry, I'm really scared.

251
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,065
I'm serious.

252
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,671
I'm awake... I won't sleep...

253
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:04,406
What do you want?

254
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,637
Ask me if I'm a ghost.

255
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:10,145
Ask me...

256
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,380
May Ho!

257
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,951
Are you a ghost?

258
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:20,257
Yes, I'm a ghost.

259
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,753
Ask me...

260
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,523
If we went to school together.

261
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,029
Did we go to school together?

262
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:35,102
Yes, NTK elementary school.

263
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:37,765
I was your classmate.

264
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:42,839
Guess who I am.

265
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,480
Class President.

266
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:50,346
No.

267
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:52,319
Vice President. Wrong again.

268
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,118
Treasurer. No.

269
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,158
Secretary.

270
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,094
I got it.

271
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:03,123
Why don't you ask me if I'm Ken?

272
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,695
Are you Ken?

273
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:07,998
That's right!

274
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:12,507
People knew me as
"Ken The Class Clown"!

275
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:14,902
Ask me how I died.

276
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,516
How did you die?

277
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:20,547
I pulled a great stunt!

278
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,187
When I was 13, it was incredible...

279
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,826
May Ho!

280
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,053
The puppy's fine, Mrs. Tsui.

281
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,821
Left without a word.

282
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:00,822
The puppy stays here tonight.

283
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,688
We'll call her tomorrow.

284
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:05,360
Mrs. Tsui is so irresponsible.

285
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,464
Look at the mess.

286
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,258
Morning, Mrs. Tsui.

287
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,669
Sorry, I saw a ghost last night.

288
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,177
It led me to a sick puppy,

289
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:57,838
which I brought to a vet.

290
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,643
I fell asleep there.

291
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:03,219
The vet didn't see me
and locked the door.

292
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,064
Fine, it was the traffic.

293
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:26,508
Fine, I over-slept.

294
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:36,381
Please excuse us.

295
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:44,390
Where's the ashtray?

296
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,954
No one smokes here.

297
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,308
What is that?

298
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:09,584
A great knock-off from Shenzhen.

299
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,482
We don't even carry this style.

300
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:12,884
Handy compartments.

301
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,356
Good for cell phone and cigarettes.

302
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,091
We represent this brand!

303
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,228
I can't deal with this!

304
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:34,977
You don't want to work?

305
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,172
What's there for me to do?

306
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:40,675
I don't care.

307
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:43,844
You can daydream
or play computer games.

308
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:46,080
But you'll come here everyday
for 8 hours.

309
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,883
Then I'll play computer games.

310
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,220
Fine by me.

311
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:33,568
May.

312
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,504
I got you an ashtray.

313
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,073
How's the game?

314
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,608
Pretty low score.

315
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:48,107
Surfing the web?

316
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,352
Want to fix Daniel's car?

317
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,086
That'd be wonderful!

318
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:59,795
Dad bought Daniel the car
when he was born.

319
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:02,397
They are the same age.

320
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,198
The license number is his birthday.

321
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:10,934
Daniel loved driving it around.

322
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,412
Come with me.

323
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:22,250
Are you afraid of ghost?

324
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,350
Did you really see something?

325
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:29,186
Then...

326
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:30,589
Have you seen Daniel?

327
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:33,558
Has he come back to see you?

328
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,131
He's a ghost too, right?

329
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:39,466
I made it up. There's no ghost.

330
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,601
It doesn't exist.

331
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:43,466
That's a relief.

332
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,808
I'd hate to see Daniel as a ghost.

333
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:48,878
If he were a ghost,

334
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,282
he wouldn't want us
to see him anyway.

335
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,108
It was really a ghost you saw!

336
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:56,447
The kid died when he was 13.

337
00:32:56,688 --> 00:33:00,419
March 4th 1979...

338
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:01,524
Let's see.

339
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:05,925
"Boy suffered nasty fall
using umbrella as parachute"

340
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,990
He fell to death.

341
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,463
Wrong!

342
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,102
He was in the fourth grade that year.

343
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,431
I saw him on TV 3 days later.

344
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,208
May 16h 1980...

345
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:30,078
"Boy strangled himself using curtain
as Tarzan rope"

346
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:31,916
He was strangled to death.

347
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,954
Wrong!

348
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,649
He repeated fourth grade that year.

349
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,454
I saw him on TV 3 days later again.

350
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,835
1981...

351
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,995
Wait dad, there's this much more?

352
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:50,403
Yes, a lot more.

353
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:51,870
"He was stung by bee,"

354
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,034
burned by candle, electrocuted
by wall socket,

355
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,180
bitten by dogs...

356
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,576
Enough... I remember...

357
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:00,343
That year he repeated
fourth grade again.

358
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,144
Skip to the last accident.

359
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,412
The one that killed him.

360
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,350
September 10th 1982...

361
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,756
Right, he was expelled that year.

362
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,487
I never saw him again.

363
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:14,996
"Naughty boy lost in ocean
during typhoon"

364
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,829
"Most likely have drowned"

365
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,168
That's all.

366
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:25,432
No more articles.
The body was never found.

367
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,571
So he was drowned.

368
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:29,644
Who else was drowned?

369
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,213
Your brother-in-law!

370
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:33,510
That's the person who left you
with all the money.

371
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:36,153
He was trapped in algae
while scuba-diving in the Caribbean

372
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,982
and drowned!

373
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:39,585
Don't you forget that!

374
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:50,064
Ken, are you here?

375
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,868
This is May Ho.

376
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,237
Is there anything I can help?

377
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,347
Are you May Ho?

378
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,503
You're Sam Wong?

379
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:40,082
No, I'm his father.

380
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,943
He just left. He's an airline pilot.

381
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,613
Sorry, we've only talked
through e-mail.

382
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:51,590
You want to fix this wreck?

383
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:53,791
It belonged to my late husband.

384
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,227
I see.

385
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,225
I didn't want to trouble Sam,

386
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:00,303
but no one else can help.

387
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:01,996
I found him on the web.

388
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,763
No trouble.

389
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:07,011
Sam is crazy about
fixing classic cars.

390
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:09,870
It's good to keep him busy anyway.

391
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:12,209
It's a good distraction.

392
00:36:12,717 --> 00:36:15,618
He's still upset over

393
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,948
his girlfriend's death.

394
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,297
You should cheer up too.

395
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:36,166
The deceased would want to
see us happy.

396
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,487
Did I take the pills?

397
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,360
One more.

398
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:14,711
May.

399
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,903
What?

400
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,547
I have a friend coming.

401
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:20,650
He's a doctor. A nice guy.

402
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,947
His family is in
the shipping business.

403
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,588
I think he suits you.

404
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:28,889
May.

405
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:33,858
Come on, May.

406
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,166
I'm tired. I should go.

407
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,025
You should date again.

408
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,035
Miss.

409
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:42,898
Your friend?

410
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,041
No.

411
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:45,874
I'm from the other table.

412
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:48,275
I've been watching you.

413
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:51,708
Can we be friends?

414
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,316
I mean it.

415
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,835
I meant what I said.

416
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:17,797
Don't just stand there.

417
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:21,377
Go wash your eyes before
you go blind!

418
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:25,109
May, Daniel's been dead for 3 years.

419
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:31,787
Tina.

420
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:33,822
Your friend?

421
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:35,754
May, this is Ben.

422
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:41,894
Hi.

423
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,095
Give me.

424
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,462
I'll go get drinks.

425
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,400
I asked Tina to introduce us.

426
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,010
I've noticed you for 3 years.

427
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,045
Can we be friends?

428
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:04,610
I mean it.

429
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:07,813
I meant what I said.

430
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,251
I really want to help you.

431
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,257
You're ill. I'm a psychologist...

432
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,270
I'm not after you.

433
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:21,799
I like Tina.

434
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:26,509
I just wanted to please her!

435
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:33,241
Should've said so.

436
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,613
Have a good time, he's not bad.

437
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,913
I know.

438
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,303
The letter is for you.

439
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:56,472
Sorry... Ms. Ghost.

440
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,703
I'm going to be reincarnated.

441
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,543
Congratulations...

442
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,581
Congratulations...

443
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,852
But I can't let go of my boyfriend.

444
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,384
Put him behind you.

445
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,149
Look at me and my husband.

446
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,054
He leaves me alone,
and I don't miss him.

447
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,787
I can do anything I want,
go anywhere I want.

448
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,362
It's so free!

449
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:24,898
Promise me, take care of Sam for me.

450
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:26,969
No... There's nothing between us.

451
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:30,574
I've never met him.
We only used e-mails.

452
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,569
Relax, I want you two
to be together.

453
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:39,016
I know you're destined to.

454
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:42,619
Impossible. Do tease me.

455
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:46,282
Good thing don't come by easy.

456
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,656
Hang on to the letter.

457
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:55,755
Don't open it until June 17th.

458
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,859
It'll help you.

459
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:00,634
Okay.

460
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:10,978
Ms. Ghost?

461
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:16,184
Ms. Ghost.

462
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:24,186
Sorry. I won't open it.

463
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:54,850
"The life of the dead is placed
in the memory of the living."

464
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:51,873
It's me!

465
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:53,098
You scared me!

466
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:55,370
I'm in big trouble.

467
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:57,946
We are facing a great disaster!

468
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:02,079
Are you getting married?

469
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,311
I don't know what happened.

470
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:04,613
I woke up like this.

471
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:06,723
Then Biggie said she was marrying me.

472
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,222
It's "After Death Wedding"!

473
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:09,859
She followed me all day.

474
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:12,825
May...

475
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:15,795
It's done. I got Ken a wife.

476
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:17,564
Why?

477
00:44:17,735 --> 00:44:20,602
I found a priest.
She said Ken likes you.

478
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,432
So I did this to keep him away.

479
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:26,940
"It cost me $38,000!"

480
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,772
Don't hurt my dad!

481
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:31,005
No... Ken?

482
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,479
Don't hurt my dad!

483
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,140
No, Ken!

484
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:35,546
It... It's here?

485
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,187
Leave, dad!

486
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,456
I'm going.

487
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:42,057
Go!

488
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,260
Remember... $38,000...

489
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,058
Don't...

490
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,962
Calm down. I'll handle this.

491
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,330
She won't listen to you.

492
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:54,971
She will.

493
00:44:58,542 --> 00:44:59,907
Ms. Biggie.

494
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,176
No one likes me.

495
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:05,008
It's just a misunderstanding.

496
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,911
No one likes me.

497
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,742
See? She won't listen.

498
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,183
No one likes me.

499
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,184
Why? You're cute.

500
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:15,120
She's cute?

501
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,624
Look at her ugly face,
her flabby arms,

502
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,126
and her big butt!

503
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:21,856
Quiet. Want me to help you?

504
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:26,628
Ms. Biggie, he can't marry you.

505
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:28,533
What else can we help you with?

506
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:29,434
I want to be thin.

507
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:30,801
- Impossible!
- Shut up!

508
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,408
- I want to be pretty.
- Impossible!

509
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:33,600
Shut up!

510
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,939
I want to be like you.

511
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:37,546
I want guys to stare at me.

512
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:38,943
Can I possess you?

513
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:40,378
Impossible. Marry her, Ken.

514
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:41,848
Impossible.

515
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,751
Just once.

516
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,253
Let me be pretty for 1 minute.

517
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:48,152
I'll get Ken to marry you.

518
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:51,453
But I want to possess you.
30 seconds?

519
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:52,891
My lucky break.

520
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,929
I won't let her possess me.

521
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,295
20 seconds? 10 seconds? 1 second?

522
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:01,061
Guys would stare at me in 1 second?

523
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:03,604
I'm not THAT pretty.

524
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:07,807
That's true. How about 1 minute?

525
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:12,108
30 seconds? 20 seconds? 10 seconds?

526
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:16,014
She's just going in circles.

527
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:20,817
1 minute? 30 seconds? 10 seconds?

528
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,686
Enough. Will you leave?

529
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,452
I'll get a priest to put you away.

530
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:25,822
My father knows many

531
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:27,725
with great powers.

532
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,841
I've never been thin.

533
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,447
I've never been pretty.

534
00:46:45,683 --> 00:46:48,618
It's my final wish...

535
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,351
It'll really just be a minute?

536
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:15,811
It's been more than an hour.

537
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,345
You should come out.

538
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:20,348
I want men to yearn for my affection.

539
00:47:32,396 --> 00:47:33,454
Darling.

540
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:36,755
Honey.

541
00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,985
I want men to go crazy for me.

542
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,717
To fight each other...

543
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:05,154
FOR ME!

544
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,438
Have you had enough? Come out!

545
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:19,098
No, I want to flirt with men
and party with them!

546
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:22,111
Go for it, darling.

547
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,751
What monster dares to come here!

548
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:18,363
It's powerful!

549
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:21,231
Please take care of him, Buddha.

550
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:36,214
I'm possessed...

551
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:39,111
Stop running!

552
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,648
I'm possessed!

553
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,452
Stop screaming!

554
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:49,128
Ken...

555
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,665
Ken...

556
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,324
Help!

557
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:56,269
Somebody help...

558
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,082
I'll be back!

559
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,588
Ken...

560
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,200
Ken, are you all right?

561
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,198
Take me home.

562
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:34,906
He wants to go home.

563
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,410
Then take him.

564
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,685
I can't reach him.

565
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:47,751
Umbrella...

566
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:49,420
He wants an umbrella.

567
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,857
Yes, he'll use it as a medium.

568
00:50:54,765 --> 00:50:55,732
This is all I have.

569
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:59,499
Ken, we're home.

570
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,703
Ken...

571
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,504
Answer me, Ken!

572
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:36,535
Help!

573
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,572
Any ghosts here?

574
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:42,001
"Kowloon Funeral Parlour"

575
00:52:28,459 --> 00:52:30,359
My friend is hurt. He's a ghost too.

576
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,791
He went into a temple to save me.

577
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:35,693
I don't know what to do.
Can you help?

578
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:39,768
Too late. They got away...

579
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:42,437
He'll dehydrate.

580
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:44,267
Please think of something.

581
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:45,931
Experience tells us it's too late.

582
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:47,940
He needs to go back to water
if he was drowned.

583
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,738
You're too young to know.

584
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,312
How long did you live?

585
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:52,642
How long have you been a ghost?

586
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:53,339
3 years.

587
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:54,347
4 years.

588
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,076
90 years!

589
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,210
Why didn't you grow?

590
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:00,083
Want to see my aged look?

591
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:00,985
You want to?

592
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:03,126
No...

593
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:04,351
Put him into water!

594
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:21,442
He's still unconscious.

595
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:24,376
It'll have to depend on his will.

596
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:32,716
A priest is here.

597
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,723
She's powerful. Let's go!

598
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:42,726
May...

599
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,424
Don't worry,
I brought the priest here.

600
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,193
May...

601
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,668
Too late. They got away.

602
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,207
There's one more.

603
00:53:53,277 --> 00:53:55,837
No...

604
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:00,406
You're a liar just like your dad.

605
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,780
May...

606
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,286
I paid, come over.

607
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:08,981
Cost me $58,000...

608
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:15,328
Don't get in the priest's way. Come.

609
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:16,329
Bring me salt.

610
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,524
Understood!

611
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:20,602
He died in the ocean, he needs
to be soaked in salt water.

612
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:21,968
You won't take him in?

613
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:23,731
- How are you two related?
- Classmates.

614
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:24,896
There's more.

615
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,737
I think you two are lovers.

616
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,539
He didn't reincarnate
so he can protect you.

617
00:54:30,714 --> 00:54:33,512
But we're really just classmates.

618
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:34,912
Did he date you after you grew up?

619
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:37,019
How? He died at 13.

620
00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:38,779
He's been dead this long?

621
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:41,023
How did I miss that?

622
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,850
The beef I ate earlier must've reduced
my power.

623
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:46,925
Salt's here.

624
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:51,325
Done!

625
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:52,496
It's done?

626
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:55,035
It's a symbolic ritual. Let's go!

627
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:56,365
The salt is expensive.

628
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,441
May, the total is... $96,000.

629
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:01,240
$96,000!

630
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:53,660
Don't give up

631
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:22,548
Madam...

632
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:33,134
It's okay... I know him.

633
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,505
Wait... I'll break it!

634
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:49,474
1, 2...

635
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,619
Kamen Rider comes back to life.

636
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:58,361
He defeated the evil Pot Monster.

637
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,163
Rice will be available to all people.

638
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:02,528
Yes!

639
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:10,534
So how do I contact you?

640
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:11,867
"Easy, like this."

641
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,002
Ken!

642
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:16,873
I'll appear right away. Try it.

643
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,173
Try it.

644
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:21,112
Ken...

645
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:22,012
No, it's cheesy.

646
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:23,948
Cheesy? It's cool!

647
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,679
Ken!

648
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,048
- I'll snap my finger.
- No.

649
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:28,248
Ken.

650
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:29,050
A finger snap.

651
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:30,420
No. Ken.

652
00:57:30,594 --> 00:57:31,618
- A finger snap.
- Ken.

653
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,228
A finger snap!

654
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,421
Fine... Have it your way.

655
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:36,824
Why?

656
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,194
Don't know.

657
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:39,733
Why aren't you reincarnated?

658
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:43,533
"It's my treat tonight."

659
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:46,471
"Have a good time with Mao Tai Wine."

660
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:47,974
Something you can't let go?

661
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:53,540
"Sorry, my athlete foot itches."

662
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:57,849
"Then use Tinaction!"

663
00:57:58,021 --> 00:57:59,215
Are you in love with me?

664
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,315
I know, you saved me
from the accident.

665
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:04,619
What accident?

666
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,194
It was suicide!

667
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,603
Believe it or not,

668
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,570
I love my husband deeply.

669
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,371
I don't bother telling people that.

670
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:25,971
Who would believe it?

671
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,108
They'll just say:

672
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:30,185
"7 days is not love."

673
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:32,150
"She only loved his money!"

674
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,187
Even if they don't say it,
that's what they'll think:

675
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,225
"7 days is not love."

676
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:40,158
"She only loved his money!"

677
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:43,863
Sometimes even I ask myself:

678
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,367
"7 days is not love."

679
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:49,266
"I only loved his money!"

680
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:54,172
"So why get so upset?"

681
00:58:57,614 --> 00:59:00,549
But who knew
I would miss him this much?

682
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:06,880
I really... really miss Daniel.

683
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:19,492
I've seen many ghosts
with my left eye,

684
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:21,933
but I never saw my husband.

685
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:30,578
Maybe he's thinking the same thing:

686
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:34,544
"7 days is not love."

687
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,079
"She only loved my money..."

688
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:55,794
Ken...

689
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,601
Where are you? Come on.

690
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:04,809
Cheer up...

691
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,845
Ken...

692
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:09,307
What?

693
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,311
Well anyway,

694
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,184
thanks for the puppy.

695
01:00:14,357 --> 01:00:16,154
I like it very much.

696
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:31,298
Wake up... Get up...

697
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:33,666
It's blind... Poor thing.

698
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,105
It's blind.

699
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:51,386
It's mad... Poor Thing.

700
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:53,094
It's mad.

701
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:05,900
Don't bring me more puppies.

702
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:07,668
I thought you like them.

703
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:09,502
I like flowers now.

704
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:18,084
Like them?

705
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:19,482
Yes!

706
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:17,741
How can you pee here?

707
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,116
You'll drown the plants!

708
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:22,975
Let's give them names...

709
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:24,347
Okay.

710
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:25,886
President, Vice President,

711
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:28,183
Treasurer, Secretary...

712
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:29,858
How about the last one?

713
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:30,788
We'll call it May Ho.

714
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,224
- Ken!
- May!

715
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:34,954
It's a male!

716
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:37,928
How did I miss that?

717
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:52,945
You blinked!

718
01:02:53,116 --> 01:02:54,606
Not fair.

719
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,378
A fly got into my eye. Again!

720
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:05,553
You scared me!

721
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:09,925
Let's play hide and seek...

722
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,498
I want to watch TV.

723
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,236
I hate you!

724
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,191
I know you forwarded
Sam's message to me.

725
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:14,728
Don't deny it, I saw Daniel's car.

726
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,801
"But anyway, thank you."

727
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:46,594
It's not right playing
video games everyday.

728
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:48,355
Give me something to do.

729
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,393
I'll think about it.

730
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,404
Anyway, thank you.

731
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:00,834
Here you are!

732
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,001
We're worried about Tina!

733
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:03,941
What's wrong?

734
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:06,172
Tina has changed into another person.

735
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:08,681
She has lousy taste in clothes,

736
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:11,342
and would beat me up
when she loses temper.

737
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,955
Her appetite also grew.

738
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,647
She wouldn't stop eating!

739
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,059
What do you think is wrong, Susan?

740
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:21,163
Grandma, I think Tina's got...

741
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:24,156
Bulimia!

742
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:27,335
How come? There weren't any signs.

743
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:29,971
Grandma, Tina doesn't have Bulimia.

744
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:32,832
Then why can't she stop eating?

745
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:34,542
She's possessed.

746
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:36,502
That increases your appetite?

747
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,670
It's Biggie!

748
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:07,839
Tina, you'll eat yourself to death.

749
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:13,276
Tina, what's wrong? Don't scare me!

750
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:14,643
I'm not Tina.

751
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,648
Why are they here?

752
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:19,117
You won't stop me from eating.

753
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:32,891
Stay there!

754
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:37,998
Stay there!

755
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:40,106
What are you holding?

756
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,310
Let's be friends.

757
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:46,971
What are you holding?

758
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:49,842
Is it the red chopsticks?

759
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:55,952
It's nothing. She's just possessed.

760
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,627
Drop the chopsticks!

761
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:04,961
Drop the fork!

762
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:06,192
Drop the chopsticks!

763
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:07,267
Drop the fork!

764
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:08,802
Drop the chopsticks!

765
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,864
Okay, calm down.

766
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,634
Break it! Toss it over!

767
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,715
Here comes Ken! Where's the monster?

768
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:33,157
I'll protect the peace of the world!

769
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:34,261
Yes!

770
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:40,930
Biggie Monster?

771
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:46,031
Ken.

772
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:49,372
Leave me alone. I'm afraid of Biggie.

773
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:52,241
You'll protect the peace of the world
for me.

774
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,442
Ken!

775
01:07:58,921 --> 01:07:59,853
Jerk!

776
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:05,016
She's full. She never eats much.

777
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:06,786
You'll stuff her to death!

778
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:10,228
I mean no harm. I just want to eat.

779
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:16,462
It's the only thing
I want to do right now...

780
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,905
For 10 years I starved myself trying
to look pretty.

781
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:22,601
I regret doing that...

782
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:25,577
Every woman does the same thing.

783
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:28,212
I'll be reincarnated to Ethiopia.

784
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,415
There'll be no more food.

785
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,485
I just want to eat a big meal,
rub my tummy,

786
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:38,554
and let out a burp.

787
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:42,489
A satisfying burp.

788
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:58,974
If that's all you want, possess me.

789
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,147
Hurry before I change my mind.

790
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:18,299
Tina...

791
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:21,269
What happened?

792
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:23,462
A fat ghost possessed you.
You ate a lot.

793
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:24,900
Will I be fat?

794
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,172
These pills will help.

795
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:34,511
What's May doing?

796
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:36,549
She's helping you.

797
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:56,632
Go for it...

798
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,202
I burped!

799
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:04,905
That's two...

800
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,183
That's three.

801
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:11,215
Congratulations!

802
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:14,117
It's time to go.

803
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,922
To Ethiopia. The baby's due.

804
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:20,693
Did she burp?

805
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,660
Yes. Three in a row!

806
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:24,424
Thank you.

807
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,860
Thank you, May.

808
01:10:29,038 --> 01:10:29,834
How much did I eat?

809
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,564
Everything on the table.

810
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:32,935
How many calories is that?

811
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:35,077
Spaghetti is 500, Chicken is 700.

812
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:36,370
Spaghetti is 900.

813
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:37,808
Chicken is 1200. It's fried.

814
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,537
And the soda.

815
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,238
It's okay, exercise will help.

816
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:53,092
You bailed out on me!
Lucky I took care of it.

817
01:10:54,196 --> 01:10:56,061
What? Why staring at me?

818
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:58,792
A staring contest? Let's go!

819
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:00,968
I'm so happy today.

820
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:02,604
Grandma and Tina thanked me.

821
01:11:02,772 --> 01:11:03,796
We went to Karaoke together.

822
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:05,736
I and Tina played drinking games.

823
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,934
Tina even accompanied me
to the bathroom.

824
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,847
Where did you learn that?

825
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,050
You're over-reacting.

826
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:19,847
I didn't touch you. I just slipped.

827
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:21,554
But it isn't right!

828
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:24,124
I have a husband.
How can you kiss me?

829
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:25,726
We are friends!

830
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,166
Elementary school friends!

831
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,398
I thought you knew that!

832
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:53,115
I'm going to be reincarnated.

833
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,411
So you really can see ghosts?

834
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:30,391
Ever since the car accident.

835
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,952
What are they like?

836
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:35,956
They wonder about...

837
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:38,692
There are many things they can't do.

838
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:44,971
I have cancer. I have 3 months left.

839
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:49,110
The company is up to you and Tina.

840
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:50,945
I'm not good enough.

841
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,114
You just have to. There's no choice.

842
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:57,485
I had my doubts about you.

843
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:00,045
But after what happened to Tina,

844
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:02,524
I think you have what it takes.

845
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:05,724
You can do it.

846
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:08,591
Does Tina know?

847
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:12,597
I told her last night.
She cried all night.

848
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,258
And hasn't stopped.

849
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:43,625
Come on... Baby...

850
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:07,617
Hand...

851
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:27,104
May Ho, I'm leaving. Good-bye!

852
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,306
Ken...

853
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,378
I said good-bye already. What now?

854
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:39,051
You always come and go so suddenly.

855
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:40,153
I bid you farewell.

856
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:42,256
Are you in a rush? Grandma is dying.

857
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:44,517
I'm a ghost. What can I do?

858
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,092
It's fate.

859
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:47,092
I want to see Daniel.

860
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:49,254
He's a ghost too.
There's nothing he can do.

861
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,922
I want to see Daniel!

862
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:56,032
Why didn't you ask me until now?

863
01:14:56,872 --> 01:14:57,861
Fine.

864
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:02,471
Daniel drowned in ocean,
so talk to the ocean.

865
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:04,168
Go ahead.

866
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:07,573
What do I say?

867
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,618
Tell him the exact opposite of
what you're thinking.

868
01:15:11,787 --> 01:15:13,049
Why?

869
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:16,587
How would I know?
That's the tradition.

870
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,192
It's okay. Go ahead.

871
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:23,829
Daniel!

872
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:29,564
I don't miss you! Don't come back!

873
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:33,038
Will it work?

874
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:41,683
Whisky?

875
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:43,584
What's this?

876
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:45,811
It's Daniel's dog!

877
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:48,319
It's really working!

878
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:52,650
Daniel, I've lived happily
in the last few years.

879
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:55,193
Don't worry about me.

880
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:59,591
I'll take care of Grandma, Tina,
and the company.

881
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:10,940
Daniel, I don't want
to see you anymore.

882
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:13,877
Not one more look. Not one more hug.

883
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,945
Can you hear me?

884
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:25,592
Can you hear me? I don't love you!

885
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:28,194
I don't love you!

886
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:46,439
I just want to see you and hold you.

887
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:49,215
Why won't you come?

888
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,517
He probably crossed
the Twilight Junction.

889
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:55,418
His memory is erased.

890
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:57,055
It's too late to turn back.

891
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:59,724
Does this mean I'll never see him?

892
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,995
What you said to him was great.

893
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,661
It's probably
what Daniel would've wanted.

894
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,402
Take good care of yourself from now on.

895
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,636
Because very soon...

896
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:20,779
I'll cross the Twilight
Junction too...

897
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:24,116
You'll forget me too?

898
01:17:25,054 --> 01:17:29,286
I don't want to just leave.

899
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,291
But I worry...

900
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,258
the longer I stay...

901
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:41,332
the harder it is to let go.

902
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:55,514
Before I go...

903
01:17:56,952 --> 01:17:58,783
Can you give me a hug?

904
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:01,047
How? I can't even touch you.

905
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:03,382
Just pretend I'm Daniel.

906
01:18:03,792 --> 01:18:05,089
How?

907
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:08,295
Close your eyes, and think I'm him.

908
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,497
Close your eyes.

909
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,066
Didn't you always want to see me?

910
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:14,801
You said you missed me.

911
01:18:17,639 --> 01:18:19,004
I feel the same way too.

912
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:22,740
I never left you, I was always here.

913
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:25,942
I know you love me.

914
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:27,579
People may say:

915
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,810
"She only loved him for his money!"

916
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,050
I know that's not true.

917
01:18:39,728 --> 01:18:41,059
I really do.

918
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:18,857
"Twilight Junction"

919
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:30,840
I have to go.

920
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:55,497
Don't be a naughty boy
in your next life!

921
01:19:55,671 --> 01:20:00,267
Don't play with window curtain
or umbrella!

922
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:04,208
And stay home during typhoon!

923
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,006
You hear me?

924
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:12,077
What?

925
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,728
Good-bye, Ken!

926
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,143
It's beautiful!

927
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:52,282
It's beautiful!

928
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:53,493
Your boyfriend is something!

929
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:54,993
It's too soon...

930
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:57,689
It's beautiful...
Your son is something!

931
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:59,663
It's not done yet...

932
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:04,037
He's back.

933
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,467
Son, May Ho is here.

934
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:30,662
May Ho!

935
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:36,669
You haven't changed, just got bigger.

936
01:21:37,005 --> 01:21:38,597
I'm Sam Wong!

937
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:42,265
People knew me
as "Ken the class clown"!

938
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:44,910
Remember? We went to the same school

939
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,810
I repeated the fourth grade
for 3 years.

940
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:50,042
After that I was expelled.

941
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:53,215
Didn't you drown when you were 13?

942
01:21:53,388 --> 01:21:55,879
Almost! But I hung onto
a piece of wood.

943
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:57,548
I swam as hard as I could.

944
01:21:57,726 --> 01:22:00,456
I had the will to live.

945
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:01,890
I wanted to take care of dad!

946
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:05,830
Liar! He lost his tuition
playing Mahjong,

947
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:09,437
Had his friend calling me
to say he was drowned.

948
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:11,505
I was so scared.

949
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:14,699
So I called the police.

950
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:51,238
Why didn't I know?

951
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:54,304
Why didn't I know?

952
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,955
Something's wrong...

953
01:23:14,503 --> 01:23:18,200
Sam has had on crush on May
since childhood.

954
01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:21,631
Stop screaming.

955
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,971
Sam never said he liked you.

956
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:26,307
Damn it!

957
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:32,146
I think you two are lovers.

958
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:34,619
He didn't reincarnate
so he can protect you.

959
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:38,625
People may say:

960
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:41,695
"She only loved him for his money!"

961
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:43,289
I know that's not true.

962
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:45,360
I really do.

963
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:51,330
Good-bye, May.

964
01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:55,402
Daniel!

965
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,878
Daniel!

966
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:07,279
Daniel!

967
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:18,292
Who are you?

968
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:20,298
I'll call the police!

969
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:23,896
Be my guest.

970
01:24:32,414 --> 01:24:33,608
Daniel!

971
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:56,265
Daniel...

972
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:54,852
You see the old man
in the white jacket?

973
01:25:56,965 --> 01:25:58,023
Yes.

974
01:25:58,567 --> 01:25:59,966
He's not a ghost.

975
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:04,937
You see the longhaired girl
in white robe?

976
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:08,473
It's her pajama. She's buying supper.

977
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:12,869
I lost my vision.

978
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:15,640
What more can we ask for?

979
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:17,882
We have someone who loved us,

980
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:20,085
and protected us after death.

981
01:26:21,122 --> 01:26:23,056
We should do something for them.

982
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,988
Let him go, May.

983
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:36,463
Mrs. Tsui died peacefully.

984
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:38,269
I'm sorry for your loss.

985
01:26:39,841 --> 01:26:41,433
May...

986
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:47,710
There's only you left...

987
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:55,884
No!

988
01:26:56,057 --> 01:26:57,388
Please...

989
01:26:57,559 --> 01:26:58,184
No!

990
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,088
Please...

991
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:01,092
Don't be stubborn, May!

992
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:03,595
I want to open up my third eye
to see Daniel!

993
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,097
You saw him! For an entire year!

994
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:08,133
I didn't know it was him.

995
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:09,770
He chose a different appearance

996
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:11,735
so you won't miss him more.

997
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:12,805
He chose Sam because

998
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:14,373
he is destined for you.

999
01:27:14,543 --> 01:27:16,443
Open yourself up!

1000
01:27:20,582 --> 01:27:23,881
I want to open up my third eye!

1001
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:26,418
Told you it's not possible.

1002
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:28,852
Listen to her.
Why can't you understand?

1003
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,888
I'll pay any price

1004
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:31,491
I'll give all my fortune!

1005
01:27:40,936 --> 01:27:41,698
Fifty, Fifty!

1006
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,235
She's your daughter!

1007
01:27:50,345 --> 01:27:51,835
I really can't help.

1008
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:54,413
Think I don't want your money?

1009
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:57,313
Your husband wanted you see him
crossing the Twilight Junction,

1010
01:27:57,485 --> 01:28:01,046
because he wants you to forget him.

1011
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:03,315
It's good-bye forever!

1012
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:05,686
Do you understand?

1013
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:46,457
Let him go?

1014
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:51,839
Let him go?

1015
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:39,137
Keep on living

1016
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:37,763
Thank you, Daniel.

1017
01:32:44,505 --> 01:32:45,631
May Ho!

1018
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:09,888
It's beautiful!

1019
01:33:10,064 --> 01:33:12,862
Sure! I replaced the gearbox, the engine,

1020
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:14,433
even the hood.

1021
01:33:14,602 --> 01:33:16,536
Is this still Daniel's car?

1022
01:33:16,704 --> 01:33:19,832
My girlfriend had liver, kidney
and lung transplants,

1023
01:33:20,174 --> 01:33:21,766
but she's still my girlfriend.

1024
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:27,708
You believed that? I was kidding.

1025
01:33:28,316 --> 01:33:29,874
Your girlfriend gave me a letter.

1026
01:33:30,051 --> 01:33:31,075
Before or after her death?

1027
01:33:31,252 --> 01:33:34,016
After... What's the date today?

1028
01:33:34,188 --> 01:33:35,177
June 17th.

1029
01:33:35,623 --> 01:33:37,022
June 17th.

1030
01:33:37,191 --> 01:33:39,182
Just in time... It's today!

1031
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:52,332
What?

1032
01:33:59,747 --> 01:34:01,681
You were at the Caribbean
4 years ago?

1033
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:03,510
I met Daniel that day.

1034
01:34:05,586 --> 01:34:06,814
What were you doing?

1035
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:09,286
Sand got into my eyes. He helped me.

1036
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:11,124
Which eye?

1037
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:12,619
My left eye.

1038
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:17,891
What does it mean?

1039
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:22,893
Was everything pre-destined?

1040
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:26,799
Sorry.

1041
01:34:28,943 --> 01:34:30,376
It's okay.

1042
01:34:31,446 --> 01:34:32,811
It's too soon for me too.

1043
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:36,473
I'm going. Bye.

1044
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:38,482
Bye.

1045
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:48,919
What are you doing here, President?

1046
01:34:49,597 --> 01:34:50,791
How do you know its name?

1047
01:34:50,965 --> 01:34:52,762
It's mine. It was missing.

1048
01:34:52,934 --> 01:34:54,299
Yours?

1049
01:34:54,469 --> 01:34:56,528
Yes. It's a little crazy.

1050
01:34:56,704 --> 01:34:59,366
I'm also missing a blind
and a cripple.

1051
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:04,110
They're all here!

1052
01:35:04,278 --> 01:35:06,746
Vice President, Treasurer,
Secretary...

1053
01:35:06,914 --> 01:35:10,611
Your husband was a thief!
Where's the other one?

1054
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:12,511
May!

1055
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:13,949
Here you are, May.

1056
01:35:14,122 --> 01:35:15,282
It's called Ken.

1057
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,354
May.

1058
01:35:16,524 --> 01:35:17,286
Ken.

1059
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:19,585
- May
- Ken

1060
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:20,887
It's called May!

1061
01:35:21,062 --> 01:35:22,654
It's a male!

1062
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:25,628
We can still call her May.

1063
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:26,994
See? It's responding to the name.

1064
01:35:27,168 --> 01:35:28,362
May...

1065
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:31,198
It's not listening to you. Ken...

1066
01:35:31,372 --> 01:35:33,840
Put it down...

1067
01:35:34,008 --> 01:35:35,270
See who it'll follow.
