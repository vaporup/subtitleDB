1
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,591
BOY: I want to get a good picture,

2
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:29,881
some more pictures.

3
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,045
This is Carey's room, her bed.

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,257
This is the birthday girl's mattress
and everything else.

5
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:45,678
She's even got a TV

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,999
in her room.

7
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,332
Ain't she lucky?

8
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:51,632
That's my sister.

9
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,052
The birthday girl.

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,967
Ain't she beautiful?

11
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:02,343
And here is her brother.

12
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,795
Nick.

13
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:21,916
WOMAN: The thought of what somebody
could have done to him...

14
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,337
It gives you nightmares.

15
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,175
It really does.

16
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,092
ANOTHER WOMAN:
His disappearance never made the news.

17
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:39,211
It wasn't news to them,

18
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,966
it was just news to us.

19
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:58,461
It came to the point where, you know,
you're not gonna find him alive,

20
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,757
but you just want to
find what happened to him.

21
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,589
(Pouring rain)

22
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:53,256
MOTHER:
They called me at work when I wasn't there

23
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:59,298
and they wrote a message and said,
"Someone from Spain has Nicholas."

24
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,171
He wants to come home.

25
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:03,543
My mom called me.

26
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,417
I was at work.

27
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,711
And she says, "Sitting down?

28
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,300
You're not going to believe this."

29
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:11,542
Course. It was mysterious,

30
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,915
it was er...exciting,

31
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,417
it was worrisome,

32
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:18,834
er, it was all mixed emotions, you know?

33
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,543
Ecstatic.

34
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,335
Bewildered.

35
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,546
You know, Spain!

36
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,297
Isn't that like across the country?

37
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,627
Um, how did he get there?

38
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,757
You want...
you have like a hundred thousand questions

39
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:32,582
that you want answered immediately.

40
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,424
I felt wonderful,

41
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,041
you know, excited.

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,336
You wanna see him, touch him,
you know what I mean?

43
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:46,416
And you want it all to happen now.

44
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,668
(Pouring rain)

45
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:10,588
From as long as I remember,
I wanted to be someone else.

46
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,120
Someone who was acceptable.

47
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,463
(Siren)

48
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:31,243
The most important thing for me and what
I learned very fast was to be convincing.

49
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:38,588
When the police arrive,

50
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,705
I have immediately to put into their mind

51
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,125
they have a kid in front of them,
not an adult.

52
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:46,206
So it was very important for me
to behave like one.

53
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,460
(Communications over police radio)

54
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,964
(Speaks Spanish)

55
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,119
(Continues to speak Spanish)

56
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:14,119
They would see me with...
in a big coat with younger clothes.

57
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:18,879
And they would see a kid with a hat,
which is very low in the eyes.

58
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,200
They couldn't see my eyes.

59
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,833
(Speaks Spanish)

60
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,588
I wanted to provoke on them
a sense of guilt...

61
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,999
(Speaks Spanish)

62
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:37,503
..of being adults and to be close to a kid
which is dead scared.

63
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:41,955
When you see a kid that,
you know, got nervous reflexes,

64
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:44,837
that you can't touch them,
you can't approach them,

65
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,292
then you understand, you understand
that something is wrong.

66
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:50,493
(Speaks Spanish)

67
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:55,957
(Speaks Spanish)

68
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:08,659
I wasn't the one who was telling them
I've been sexually abused.

69
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,960
I made them ask me that by my attitude,

70
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:13,876
by my way of doing things.

71
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:17,168
They were the one thinking about it
and that gave me power.

72
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,287
I didn't speak much.

73
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,290
(Woman speaks Spanish)

74
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:50,533
It's very hard to read a kid
that doesn't speak a word sometime.

75
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,620
(Speaks Spanish)

76
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,869
(Speaks Spanish)

77
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,586
If a cop don't know who a kid is
and where he comes from,

78
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,914
he just can't keep him
in the police station.

79
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:11,286
And I knew that eventually they would
have to put me into a children's home...

80
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,078
(Speaks Spanish)

81
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,875
..and that's all I wanted.

82
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,539
Nobody ever gave a damn about me

83
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:41,242
and to know that if I change my identity

84
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:43,865
the reward was eventually
to be put in a place

85
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,288
where actually
they really cared about me...

86
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:50,331
then, hell, yeah.
I mean, I was reborn.

87
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,367
I mean... (Laughs) ..I was born again.

88
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:58,168
Nobody ever gave me a childhood,

89
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:01,658
because to give a kid a childhood
you need to, to love that kid.

90
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:10,660
I felt like I belonged there.

91
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,450
(Speaks Spanish)

92
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:22,206
They didn't know
that I was 23, 23 years old.

93
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,783
I was considered like one of them.

94
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,658
BEVERLY: I told him to be home by dinner

95
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,288
and gave him five bucks
to go play basketball,

96
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,490
and... he took off.

97
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:59,830
He called home, asking for a ride, er...

98
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,665
which was probably, I don't know,

99
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,161
he's within a couple of miles
from his house

100
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:09,080
and his mother works late
and sleeps during the day

101
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:14,494
and his older brother Jason
answered the phone.

102
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:20,538
When I woke up Jason was there and said
that he had called and wanted a ride home,

103
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,739
but Jason didn't want to wake me up,

104
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,115
so told him he had to walk home.

105
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:34,371
And that's...was the day,
the last time we heard from him.

106
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:42,071
You spend 24 hours crying, sick, worried,

107
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:45,790
then you get mad, then you get scared,

108
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,658
and then you try to get empowered.
You know, "OK, what can we do?

109
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,781
We have to do flyers,
we'll do this, we'll..."

110
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:52,202
You know, so instead of...

111
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:57,535
you don't cry, you do something positive

112
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,078
and try to work towards, I guess,
a solution of finding him.

113
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,571
BEVERLY: I thought somebody offered him
a ride, and he got in the car.

114
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:14,077
I dunno, I think he would have got in a car
with someone that he didn't know.

115
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,079
What are you looking at?

116
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,988
I could see the worry and the pain
they were going through,

117
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,903
so I always said, you know,
"He's out there," you know.

118
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,664
"He'll resurface," you know.

119
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:54,946
Unfortunately for me, it was one of
those places which is very rare in Spain

120
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,530
where actually they can't stand
having a kid with no identity card,

121
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,738
er, no proof of who he is.

122
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,994
(Woman speaks Spanish)

123
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:12,657
They wanted absolutely to know who I was,
where do I come from,

124
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,324
erm, they needed to know precise.

125
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,156
(Woman continues in Spanish)

126
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,870
"If you don't tell us,
if can't prove us who you are,

127
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:25,698
I'm gonna have you fingerprinted
and your pictures taken."

128
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,611
I couldn't allow that to happen.

129
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,199
I had to find a way out of that.

130
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,494
So the only, only thing left there was

131
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,694
was 1) go to prison

132
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:42,080
2) prove to them that I'm someone.

133
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,027
I said that I was American.

134
00:12:54,872 --> 00:13:00,703
That er...I ran away and I was
willing to contact my family for them

135
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,987
but I wanted to do it myself.

136
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:09,493
I didn't want my family to receive a phone call
from the police or the persecutor

137
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,244
or the judge in Spain.

138
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,745
I wanted to do it myself.

139
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,411
And I said I would need to be
in the office for the night

140
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:17,947
because I live in the States.

141
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:21,693
The States is, you know,
the times is different, it's er...

142
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:25,112
So erm, you know,
just leave me in the office

143
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,154
and tomorrow you will have all you need.

144
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:39,744
(Speaks Spanish)

145
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,069
In this office nobody could hear me.

146
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:55,614
I knew that I could pass myself
for anyone on the phone,

147
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,286
could convince anyone of anything.

148
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,242
So I call the American Police.

149
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,743
(Phone rings)

150
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,575
County South, Detective Fowler.

151
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,697
The New York Police.

152
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,078
Lieutenant Kojak's office.

153
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,905
Different police stations in the States.

154
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,069
- Dobie here.
- Who is this, please?

155
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,787
I told them every time
that I was a policeman from Spain

156
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,074
called Jonathan Dorian,

157
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,910
that we had found a kid,

158
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:34,944
we are sure he's from the States
but we don't know where.

159
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,191
How long ago was this?

160
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:40,866
He's been maybe missing for a few years,
that someone must be looking for him.

161
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,489
So the police say, well, you know,

162
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,867
we got hundreds of posters
of missing persons on the wall

163
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:50,197
and we just can't go through each of them.

164
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:51,986
But what we can do for you

165
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:55,864
is to give you the number of the centre
for missing and exploited children

166
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,451
of Arlington, Virginia.

167
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,696
Centre for missing and exploited children.
Lorraine speaking. How may I help you?

168
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,608
Er, we have a kid in a shelter,
certainly is American,

169
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,652
who is about 14, 15 years old

170
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:19,107
but the problem is
we don't know who he is...

171
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,570
I describe myself.

172
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,280
Every detail I gave was details
that I know that I could handle.

173
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:28,613
I wanted to be vague enough for her
to look at many different things.

174
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,230
I wanted her to have many possibilities.

175
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,563
Let me just take a look here.

176
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:34,526
"I got maybe something," she said.

177
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:38,736
"Maybe, you know,
we got a kid from San Antonio

178
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,984
missing since June 13 1994.

179
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,323
His name is Nicholas Barclay."

180
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,531
I said, "Could you send me a fax
of what he looks like?"

181
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:54,529
In my head, I was just a police officer
with, with Nicholas Barclay next to me,

182
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:59,364
trying to confirm his identity
and like any other policeman would do.

183
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,155
Let's see if it's him.

184
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,530
I thought, let's see if it's him.

185
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,653
I look at it, black and white picture,
old picture.

186
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,359
Well, missing for three or four years,

187
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:27,609
guarantee one thing,
there will be a change.

188
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,440
If there is a change, there will be doubt.

189
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:33,063
If there is doubt, then I got a chance.

190
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:41,614
Something in my head decided
I could do it, that I had to try.

191
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:52,612
I took the phone and I told her
that this is Nicholas.

192
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,565
We got him, it's him.

193
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:56,654
It's incredible, it's him.

194
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,693
My mom called me
and she says, "Are you sitting down?

195
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,778
You're not gonna believe this."

196
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,029
And I said, "What, Mom?" She goes,
"The police department called me

197
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:22,238
and they think they found Nicholas
in Linares."

198
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:25,400
So I'm like, "OK,
where in Texas is Linares?"

199
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,653
Because Texas has a lot of small towns.

200
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,736
And then she was like, "No, Spain."

201
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,109
I'm like, "Spain?"

202
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,730
Oh, God, how to explain the emotions.

203
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:41,190
It's like all these different emotions,
from excitement to bewilderment,

204
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,195
to what do we do?

205
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,186
What's the next step? How do we get him?
When do we get to talk to him?

206
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:52,442
I knew that after that
they would contact me.

207
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:57,111
They would try to verify, to call,
to see, to... Is it true? Is it here?

208
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,396
Is it, you know...
Carey, the family and all that.

209
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:02,354
(Ringing tone)

210
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,529
Well, when I first got, you know,
got a hold of the shelter,

211
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,654
they put me on the phone
with Jonathan Dorian

212
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:18,780
who said that he worked
for the, a shelter,

213
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:22,361
and that he was the one
who was talking with Nicholas

214
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:26,102
and had got the information from Nicholas
on who he really was.

215
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:33,109
When she called, I said that Nicholas
was seated next to me.

216
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:36,687
But he was very scared,
he was very traumatised

217
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,482
and he didn't want to talk to no-one.

218
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,197
He sounded very responsible,
very concerned.

219
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,935
Er, he claims that he has been abused,
that he's been hurt,

220
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:48,236
that erm...certainly he's been abducted.

221
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:52,061
I kind of thought he was like
a social worker type of person.

222
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,685
Um, very reassuring.

223
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:57,277
She said, "Is he saying anything?

224
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,527
Is he talking about us? Does he remember?"

225
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,019
Well, actually, I think he forgot
about everything, you know.

226
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,943
He doesn't remember very much.

227
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:07,277
He remember you but not very much.

228
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:12,690
We were told he was held by
some kind of like a sex slave kind of ring,

229
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:18,320
and that he had escaped from there and
that he was found wandering the streets.

230
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,481
She was heartbroken
but at the same time she was very happy.

231
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:23,188
I wanted to hear his voice.

232
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,611
No!

233
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:29,277
Absolutely, there was no way I was going
to talk to her pretending to be Nicholas

234
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:32,983
because I wasn't Nicholas
and she was his sister,

235
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,527
so er...it would have been a risk,

236
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,444
too big a risk for me,

237
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,360
but I did say a few words.

238
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:44,569
She said: "Hello, Nicholas.
You hear me, Nicholas?"

239
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,187
Nothing.

240
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,937
"I love you, Nicholas.
I want to take you back home with me.

241
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:54,266
I'm gonna take you, baby.

242
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,396
I'm gonna come and get you and..."

243
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:04,185
And maybe you hear "Love you"
or something like that, you know.

244
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:06,238
Very far away. It, it...

245
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,234
And then she say: "Was it him?"

246
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,150
I said, "Yeah. He said 'I love you."'

247
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:12,567
Oh. And then she started crying
on the phone.

248
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:18,526
You start crying, you tell him, "We're
going to come and get you, bring you home.

249
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,983
We'll get there, we're going to bring
you home, and I love you too."

250
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,688
I erm... I washed her brain.

251
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:48,193
I didn't stop,
because I didn't think of stopping.

252
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:53,480
I didn't watch myself in the mirror
and say, "What the fuck are you doing?

253
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,602
Stop that immediately."

254
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:04,061
(Footsteps)

255
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:08,266
I realised that I've crossed the line.

256
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:15,320
I wasn't pretending no more
to have another identity. I stole one.

257
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,474
(Phone rings)

258
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:34,523
I got a phone call: "Would you please
call a Carey Gibson?"

259
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,183
Well, I was astounded by what Carey said,

260
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:45,146
so one of the first things I said to her was,

261
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:49,731
when the FBI
and the US State Department assist you

262
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:55,192
and uh...get you and your brother back here,
I have to interview him immediately.

263
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,068
When the welfare of a minor,

264
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,732
er...is in jeopardy,

265
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:09,854
our reaction has to be very quick,

266
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:11,525
er...very responsive.

267
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:12,812
We have to put ourselves

268
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,103
in the position of the child

269
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,225
or the child's parents or guardians.

270
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,183
Generally when a child is missing for years,

271
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:25,437
either the child is dead or the child is not found

272
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:30,438
and to find that child in another country
is extremely rare.

273
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:34,017
That made it all the more compelling for us

274
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:37,896
to make sure that we did everything right
in terms of er...

275
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:41,107
establishing who he was
and getting him back to his family.

276
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,106
My main concern was getting him back,

277
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,848
so that my part could start,
the investigation could start...

278
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,390
we could find out
what had happened to this child.

279
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:51,598
I sent somebody out there
as quickly as possible.

280
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,929
The next day...
The next day, it got beyond my control.

281
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,431
The centre for missing
and exploited children sent me a flyer.

282
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:14,598
There was the picture of Nicholas
at the time of his disappearance...

283
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,272
And I saw what real Nicholas looked like,
really with colours and everything.

284
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,515
He was very blond, very...

285
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,891
He had blue eyes.

286
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,980
He looked nothing like me!

287
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:34,722
Nothing!

288
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:37,892
There's, you know, the only thing
he had in common with me

289
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:40,312
was that he had five fingers
at each hands.

290
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,389
Then I said, fuck, let's burn myself.

291
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:47,138
You know, I burned the flyer.

292
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:49,347
If I could have burned the identity that I said

293
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,148
and every word that had been
out of my mouth for the past few days,

294
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,932
I would have burned them too!

295
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,767
When everyone tells me
that the American Embassy is coming

296
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,518
and er...everybody's, you know...

297
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:10,137
and don't worry, Nicholas,
we're gonna take care of you.

298
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:15,427
Well, yeah, OK,
you know, I... I couldn't do nothing.

299
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:17,225
The only thing I could do

300
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:20,555
was think of how was going to be the prison
where I was going to be.

301
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:31,730
I didn't know what to do.

302
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,810
I really didn't know what to do.

303
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:38,016
When the Vice Consul
first arrived in Linares,

304
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:41,147
he got to the centre and found
Nicholas Barclay had disappeared.

305
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,014
I said, you've got to find him.

306
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:54,724
So he essentially,
with somebody from the Linares Centre,

307
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,894
went around looking for him.

308
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:02,397
Our priority was his safety and to make sure
he was reunited with the family.

309
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:09,811
I tried to run away
like I would do anywhere else.

310
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,605
Nicholas Barclay?

311
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,471
God didn't want me to leave this place.

312
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:25,016
I spoke with the vice consul and asked him
about his interactions with Nicholas.

313
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,058
He reported at the time
that he spoke English,

314
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:34,429
that he, he was,
he was at least at that moment

315
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,222
convinced that this was an American.

316
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:47,764
When I woke up the next morning,
everything was normal.

317
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,603
(Knock at door)

318
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:56,062
Then I saw the director of the shelter
that said,

319
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:59,552
"Well, you know, you must be happy,
your sister is on the way."

320
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,517
So I said, "What do you mean?"

321
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:07,055
He say, "Well, your sister,
you know, from San Antonio,

322
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,640
she's on the plane,
she's coming to get you."

323
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,014
Fuck, you know. Fuck! Fuck!

324
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:15,260
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

325
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:16,935
I'd never left the country.

326
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,550
I didn't know even what it entailed.

327
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,102
I knew Mom couldn't handle the flight.

328
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:27,639
She can't, she couldn't do it.

329
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,097
I have to do this.

330
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:32,429
I just gotta go get him
and get him back here where he's safe.

331
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:37,809
I should have thought of that.

332
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,306
I should have thought of the consequences.

333
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:43,427
If you do that, imagine for a second

334
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:48,017
that you're the father of a kid that's
been missing for three years, four months,

335
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:51,476
and that they find him in Columbia,
er...what would you do?

336
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,512
What would be the first thing you'd do?

337
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:56,095
I would jump on a fucking plane.

338
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,768
I didn't sleep for two days
before I got on the plane.

339
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,928
Fear, but also anticipation,

340
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:07,018
cos you want to get there, get there.

341
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:10,807
You want to see him, hold him,
smell him, just get there.

342
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,223
You can't prepare to play a role
of a person that you don't know.

343
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,266
I couldn't be Nicholas Barclay
because I didn't know Nicholas Barclay.

344
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:24,969
I didn't even know at that moment
if he was left or right-handed.

345
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:28,635
So, er, that was a problem.

346
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,926
I got on the plane and tried to sleep.

347
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:34,684
Didn't work.

348
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,634
(Nick's voice)

349
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,760
The director...

350
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,804
This is Nick, mwhah.

351
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,926
BEVERLY: He thought he was an adult.

352
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:16,094
We called him 13 going on 30.

353
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:19,389
Very difficult to discipline him.

354
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,433
If he made up his mind
he was gonna do something,

355
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,557
pretty much there wasn't a lot you could do.

356
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,051
Put the lighter down.

357
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:34,350
CAREY: He'd run away before
for a night or two, mad at Mom.

358
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:36,798
"I'm leaving, I'll find a new mom, a new home.

359
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:38,635
Kiss my ass," kind of thing.

360
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:42,595
And he, you know... would leave
and she would hunt him down

361
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,758
and find out where he is
and he'd show up the next day.

362
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:52,800
He was not, um, you know,
this perfect nice sweet innocent,

363
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:56,389
he was a very street-smart city boy.

364
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:04,590
- It's nice to meet ya. I am the director.
- In here, Nick.

365
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,715
See, ain't I beautiful?

366
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,767
He had beautiful blond hair.

367
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,592
Kind of looked like, erm, a little pixie.

368
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:16,390
He had blond hair and blue eyes
and a bit of a gap between his teeth.

369
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,508
When he smiled, you could see it.

370
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:46,971
Finally I'm on the ground.
"Who, who, who am I looking for?

371
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,971
What do they look like? Are they in suits?

372
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:50,972
Oh, damn, you can smoke here. Thank God!"

373
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,552
The air smelt different.

374
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,765
Erm,
it was a lot less crowded than I thought.

375
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:12,008
I did everything I could
to give myself a chance.

376
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:20,383
I bought product to colour my hair totally blond.

377
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,555
The gentlemen and a lady approached me,

378
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,970
cos I wasn't sure where to go

379
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:30,587
and we went straight into a car
and started driving.

380
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,587
On the flyers it said that Nicholas Barclay
had three tattoos.

381
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,764
There was a girl inside the shelter
that did small tattoos just like that.

382
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:48,798
She was no pro, she was just a kid.

383
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,965
And I asked her to put those tattoos

384
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,923
that were on the flyers on me.

385
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:06,261
I was quiet and that's when
the lady started talking to me.

386
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:12,799
She kept my mind busy
with explaining the countryside to me

387
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:14,965
the whole way down there on the drive.

388
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:25,385
I took big sunglasses, I took a hat,
I took a scarf, I took a glove.

389
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:27,679
I thought that if she couldn't see me,

390
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:30,505
then she wouldn't be able to say
I'm not her brother.

391
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:35,762
We stopped for a Coca-Cola,
which I thought was really cool.

392
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:40,428
They had coke there and it was
the anxiety of how long it was taking.

393
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,424
Minutes before she arrived
I was convinced it was finished.

394
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,962
That I was gonna get arrested
and maybe beat up also

395
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:53,254
because they were
not going to be happy about it.

396
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,300
I remember going into like a waiting area.

397
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,510
I'm speaking with a couple of people from
the home saying that he was in his room.

398
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:05,387
He'd been locked in his room all day.
He wouldn't let anyone go in.

399
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,877
Finally when I heard someone
knocking at the door and saying,

400
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:13,174
"Hey, Nicholas, your sister is downstairs,

401
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,426
er...she's waiting for you, she's there..."

402
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:19,378
CAREY: I went downstairs
and into like a courtyard.

403
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,264
There were some kids playing
like ball against a wall

404
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:25,469
and looked up at the window
and told him,

405
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:28,464
"I'm here, come here. I want to see you,
I want to hold you."

406
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,174
I remember seeing him look out the window.

407
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:37,214
I was sure that as soon as the sister
was gonna see me,

408
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:40,595
she was going to say
"What the fuck is that?" You know.

409
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,713
That's not...that's not Nicholas.

410
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:49,629
I waited maybe 10 minutes.

411
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,261
I knew I was about to lose everything.

412
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,630
I knew I couldn't wait no more,

413
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,172
that I couldn't go away,

414
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:59,092
that I couldn't just disappear,

415
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:01,508
so I opened the door and I went down.

416
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,176
It was just this sense of immense relief.

417
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:15,380
Just seeing, touching,
kissing, holding him.

418
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,800
I said, "What the hell?" You know.

419
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:21,671
He's here, we're here, I have him.

420
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,592
She didn't even wait a second
or two seconds.

421
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,877
She jump on me, she jump on me,

422
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,552
she took me in her arms

423
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:33,966
and she said, "Nicholas, oh, and you
were afraid I wouldn't recognise you.

424
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,883
I would remember that nose."

425
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:40,551
So I just... I remember touching his nose
and telling him, um,

426
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:44,007
"I remember that nose,
you kind of look like your Uncle Pat."

427
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:49,425
She said, "Don't worry," like she always say,
"everything is going to be fine.

428
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,296
Everything is going to be perfect.

429
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:53,253
I know it's you."

430
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:56,676
He was just...just basically
told me he loved me,

431
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:01,709
and he didn't say a whole lot
until all the people left.

432
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:07,379
Only God know why she would
do something like that,

433
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:15,249
but...but I know one thing for sure
is there was no other way.

434
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:18,006
She came for me and she wanted me back.

435
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,340
We went to the visit room
and she showed me dozens of pictures.

436
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:29,167
Pictures, pictures, pictures.

437
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:33,748
You remember, this was with Mom
at the, at the house we were living in

438
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,796
before you, you went missing.

439
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:39,501
Remember this was
when you were playing with Scotty.

440
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:41,627
Remember this was...

441
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:47,592
And he was like, "Jason looks the same,
Codey's gotten pretty big, huh?

442
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:51,464
Mom, God, Mom looks exactly the same.
Has she put on weight?

443
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:55,082
Wanted to know if Grandpa
was still an asshole,

444
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,501
um, told me how much he loved Grandma
and he missed her.

445
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:02,918
I remember seeing the tattoo,
the cross between his, you know,

446
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,343
right here on his hand.

447
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:07,549
I just kept thinking
how much he looks like Uncle Pat

448
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:10,923
and how mom was going to be
really surprised how tall he was.

449
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:16,213
She said that he looked very different,

450
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,381
that he had, you know, grown up...

451
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:22,629
..and erm...

452
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:28,459
he's very quiet,
you know, kinda held back.

453
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,341
He talked with a funny accent.

454
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:35,462
But it was always a whisper and very quiet
like he was hiding from something.

455
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:41,788
I mean, God,
look what he had been through.

456
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,000
He wasn't the same person.

457
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:47,049
He wasn't the same Nicholas
that disappeared four years before.

458
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:50,209
He had been held and tortured
and God knows what else.

459
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:52,332
He wasn't that same person.

460
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:03,417
The judge in Linares wanted to make sure
that there was in fact some legal basis

461
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:08,539
for Nicholas claiming to be er...
Carey Gibson's lost brother.

462
00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:16,173
So now the problem was that they
had the sister and the embassy official

463
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,250
that were swearing
that I was Nicholas Barclay

464
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,382
and there was the police
and the prosecutor

465
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:25,375
and the judge
who were not convinced at all.

466
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,795
The judge insisted on separate interviews

467
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:35,166
and part of the evidence that was in those
interviews was a family photo album.

468
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:39,880
And the judge said, "Listen,
the only way for you to prove

469
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:43,042
that you're really Nicholas
is we got pictures here

470
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,963
that you've never seen before.

471
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:50,331
I'm gonna show you five of them."

472
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,790
Number one, OK.

473
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,957
Number two, OK.

474
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,630
Number three, OK.

475
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,379
Number four, OK.

476
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:00,834
On the five one I made a mistake,

477
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,131
but it was too late.

478
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:07,544
She was already convinced
I was Nicholas Barclay.

479
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,798
(Speaks Spanish)

480
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:20,088
At that point I didn't see how I could
not document him as a US citizen.

481
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:29,830
I would not have been able to do anything
if Carey didn't show me those pictures.

482
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:36,249
They took picture of me,
with no hat, with nothing.

483
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,042
Which was, you know, they saw my eyes.

484
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:44,706
Erm, the constitution of the United States.
I swear to be a US citizen.

485
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:48,415
You know, it wasn't real but I did it.

486
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:17,663
CAREY: We didn't do a whole lot of talking
the night before we got on the plane.

487
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:22,659
Not uncomfortable, just silence,
and it was almost like a peaceful silence.

488
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:32,206
You know, I could hear him breathing
and I just felt pretty peaceful.

489
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:43,002
I'd been thinking about running away
even before I met her.

490
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:55,167
All I got to do was take a taxi cab
and, going to a train station,

491
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,122
buy myself a ticket out of Spain.

492
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:00,752
I could have done that
in a couple of minutes.

493
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,082
Nothing was stopping me, nothing.

494
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,798
I went down a few times in the hallway,

495
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,246
always wondering if I was doing
the right thing, the wrong thing.

496
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,623
Should I go, shouldn't I go,
should I go, shouldn't I go?

497
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:22,786
(Distant shouting)

498
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:31,915
When I was born,
I don't think there was much love.

499
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:39,535
My mother was very, very young at the time
and she was, she was only 17 years old,

500
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:44,658
met er...older man, which was my father,
from Algeria.

501
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,666
My grandfather was a very racist person

502
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:55,336
and knowing that the man my mother
spent the night with is an Algerian,

503
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:58,959
he wanted absolutely my mother
to have an abortion.

504
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,167
Er, to get rid of me
even before I was born.

505
00:40:04,504 --> 00:40:08,332
For him an Arab should be
dealt with a nuclear weapon

506
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,452
and a black man is a monkey.

507
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:14,958
Before I was born,
I definitely I had the wrong identity.

508
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:20,994
Er, I already didn't know...I was already
prepared not to know who I really was.

509
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,077
A new identity with a real passport,
an American passport.

510
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:31,331
I could go to the US, go to school there.

511
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:35,624
Live with that family
and just being someone.

512
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,410
And don't have never again
to worry about being identified.

513
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:43,619
I saw the opportunity.

514
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:52,205
A woman that could go through so much
to get me with her back in a family

515
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:56,413
which got kids, which seem a fam...
a loving family,

516
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:59,082
gotta be some...somebody good,

517
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,701
You know, I had conflicting rules
inside my own head.

518
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,119
Carey want me to be Nicholas
but what about the others?

519
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,207
Are they going to want me
to be Nicholas too?

520
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:45,291
I didn't understand why he was so...
like, nervous, you know what I mean?

521
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:48,831
He was like, you know,
constantly moving and to the bathroom,

522
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,410
and watching people,

523
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:52,784
watching me,
he was always watching me.

524
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:55,119
She was always looking at me.

525
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,829
I attested it to him just being scared.

526
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:00,910
You know, he's going back home

527
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,073
and we don't know what's happened to him,

528
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:06,034
how his mind's working.

529
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:08,371
Um, but he was just...
maybe he was afraid

530
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:12,542
that, that he wouldn't be recognised
or, or Mom wouldn't love him any more.

531
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,789
I'm gonna get killed.

532
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,540
And I want...

533
00:42:17,584 --> 00:42:20,335
And I say,
well, maybe the plane better crash.

534
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:25,827
When they said it was time for us
to board, I...nudged Nick and I said,

535
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,915
"You ready? You ready to go home?"
He said, "I'm ready to go home."

536
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,160
"Let's get the fuck out of here, and go home."

537
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,616
(Laughs) And we got on the plane.

538
00:42:54,541 --> 00:43:00,409
I was really nervous,
anticipation, pretty happy.

539
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:05,038
You know, we had made it...
It was a family thing, we all went together.

540
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,077
MAN:
I remember that night, minute by minute.

541
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:16,073
It was me, my grandma,

542
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:18,496
my sister and my dad, I believe.

543
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:20,663
We all loaded up in my Lincoln

544
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:22,367
to go get my mom and Nicholas.

545
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:29,656
It was a wait and see
but everybody was excited, you know.

546
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,783
We didn't know what to expect...

547
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:45,406
I didn't want to go out of the plane.

548
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,745
I wanted to wait.

549
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,249
I wanted to prepare myself.

550
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,243
I didn't have no plan.
I didn't have no strategy.

551
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,780
I knew there was no way out.

552
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:10,329
I could not turn back.

553
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:25,072
We had no idea what kind of person
we were getting, who was coming back.

554
00:44:48,915 --> 00:44:51,534
I wanted to run and grab and hold him
but he held back.

555
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:56,660
So I walked down and grabbed his hand
and hugged him and told him I missed him.

556
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:10,990
He had changed so much.

557
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,617
It was like mind-boggling.

558
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:15,991
But then I realised, you know,

559
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,369
you tell yourself, well, he's been
through all this horrendous stuff,

560
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,530
so he's absolutely gonna be different.

561
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:29,529
CAREY: I just remember my kids
and my mom and erm, my husband

562
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,618
and just, God, we were so happy.

563
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:38,152
BEVERLY:
He was like totally covered up,

564
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:43,158
so then I got scared, thinking
that this kid's really messed up,

565
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:47,155
just by his appearance.

566
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:59,736
He was very quiet and erm, standoffish.

567
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:07,320
I never liked people to touch me.

568
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,361
And I can't change that.

569
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:13,163
So when she put her hands around me,

570
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:17,197
she must have felt
that I wasn't enjoying it at all.

571
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:26,364
I was very cold, very closed.
I didn't speak to people.

572
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:34,651
As much as I was happy...I didn't show it.

573
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,408
I had a border in front of me.

574
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:48,159
I didn't want to screw up.

575
00:46:54,162 --> 00:47:02,409
Of course, it was welcome with open arms
and let's get you home attitude.

576
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:07,325
Talk about the rest later, you know,
let's just go home.

577
00:47:24,662 --> 00:47:27,493
BEVERLY: I just watched him
all the way home in the car

578
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,483
and you could tell he was uneasy.

579
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:34,990

as comfortable as possible.

When I woke up in Texas country...

The States for me was big city, it was
big buildings and, and people everywhere.

598
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:34,860
The first thing
when you open your eyes is official,

599
00:49:34,907 --> 00:49:37,030
your name is Nicholas Patrick Barclay,

600
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:39,564
that you're born December 31st 1980,

601
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:42,735
and that every family member
is calling me Nicholas

602
00:49:42,782 --> 00:49:45,699
and not "Nicholas,
but what is your real name?"

603
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:47,817
No! Nicholas.

604
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:50,402
"OK, we're going to go shopping, Nicholas."

605
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,148
They drove me around,

606
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:02,613
and, you know,
I knew I had to recognise something,

607
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:07,114
so...and I also knew that I couldn't
because I'd never been there before.

608
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:10,155
Hey, Kirk, how are you doin'?

609
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,611
We met some people that knew Nicholas
before he disappeared.

610
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:18,030
I told them I didn't remember them, there
was something but I didn't remember them.

611
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:21,237
Like I had lost my memory,
which is what I told them.

612
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:25,230
He's traumatised.

613
00:50:25,616 --> 00:50:27,606
That's why he wasn't remembering anything,

614
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,271
because of all, all of the things
that had happened to him.

615
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:35,109
I remember a sign.

616
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:40,571
I saw Nicholas in the picture doing this
with his fingers, you know,

617
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,688
his, his way to say "hello", you know,

618
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:45,190
and I did it a few times with them.

619
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,654
When I was there. That was one of
the only things I knew what to do.

620
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,654
I was thinking to myself

621
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:56,029
that Nicholas Barclay could come back
at his house any day.

622
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:58,362
That was my first worry.

623
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:00,480
I was really worried about that.

624
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:04,358
I couldn't help it.
I said, "Man, what if he show up?"

625
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,069
What if you opened the door
and say, "Hey, I'm back."

626
00:51:07,116 --> 00:51:08,655
(Laughs) You know.

627
00:51:10,656 --> 00:51:15,443
We thought the best thing for him
was just to have a normal routine.

628
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,356
You get up, you eat breakfast,
you do this, you eat lunch,

629
00:51:19,406 --> 00:51:23,613
you eat dinner, we'd watch a movie,
just the normal family atmosphere.

630
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:25,938
Me and him hung out.

631
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:30,560
I’d just take him for drives and talk to him
and turn up the music and stuff.

He'd hang out with Codey and his friends

635
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:41,147
and after school
they'd go to the park and play,

636
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:44,113
and, I mean, they would do
what teenagers do.

637
00:51:44,406 --> 00:51:47,854
He actually kinda started liking a girl
in the neighbourhood, Amy.

638
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,029
They would hang out, talk on the phone

639
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,105
and he'd kinda get blushy-red
when we talked about her.

640
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,274
The only person I hadn't met
in the Barclays' family

641
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,565
was, erm, Jason, his other brother,
the brother of, erm, Carey.

642
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:06,059
And finally he came to see me.

643
00:52:06,113 --> 00:52:11,814
He didn't look at me like Nicholas and he
didn't pretend to look at me like Nicholas

644
00:52:11,864 --> 00:52:15,396

00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:32,937
because we felt, like, when the time was right
he would open up to us.

649
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,777
I did not receive any telephone calls
from the family

650
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:44,735
saying, you know, "Nicholas is back.

651
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:47,185
Please come over and talk to us.
We need help."

652
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,109
And I felt like it was imperative

653
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:51,563
that he be interviewed quickly.

654
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:58,144
So I'd agreed to meet Nicholas
at the San Antonio missing children's centre

655
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:00,068
to conduct our first interview.

656
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:04,560
I introduced myself to Nicholas
and then told him why I was there,

657
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:09,649
and that the purpose of this interview
was to get his account of his kidnapping

658
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:12,777
and for his assistance
in locating his abductors.

659
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:15,440
All I knew about Nicholas

660
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:18,271
was what I had read
on some of the missing posters.

661
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,104
Not that people
can't change in three years,

662
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:25,483
but this person in general
did not appear to be 16.

663
00:53:26,444 --> 00:53:29,859
He had a shadow of a beard,
a dark beard,

664
00:53:30,113 --> 00:53:35,444
that I doubt if Nicholas would have had
a shadow of a dark beard at the age of 16

665
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:37,312
since he had blond hair.

666
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:39,483
He appeared to be quite nervous

667
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:43,688
and he just seemed very uncomfortable
this entire time.

668
00:53:48,944 --> 00:53:54,442
I told them that, um,
I was taken by military overseas

669
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:56,810
and I was abducted and put in a van,

670
00:53:56,862 --> 00:54:00,441
then fly over to some places
that I never knew where it was.

671
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:06,064
That, er, we were kept in a room
with different kids.

672
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,308
They'd get chloroformed,

673
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:10,727
and, er, they wake up and they're, er...

674
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:14,557
you know, in a place
they don't know where they're at.

675
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:22,398
They were subjected by
high-ranking military to sexual abuse.

676
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:25,818
Every night all of the kids were raped
and molested by men.

677
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:28,814
These men were American,
Mexican and European.

678
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:34,526
They broke my hands, especially
my right hand, with a baseball bat.

679
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:37,401
They kept burning him
and giving him insects to eat.

680
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,648
- We were tortured.
- They broke his fingers.

681
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,562
- His left foot was broken with a crowbar.
- I was raped.

682
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:48,275
They keep these kids in line
by doing military scare tactics.

683
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,692
We were experimented on.

684
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:51,975
They would put needles in his eyes.

685
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:57,360
Headphones on their heads screaming
and yelling, er, different languages.

686
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:01,561
Spanish kept playing over and over
and a voice kept saying, "You are not you."

687
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,648
If he spoke English, he was beaten.

688
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:07,936
They moved these kids around
in military planes.

689
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:10,022
We never saw where we were going.

690
00:55:10,068 --> 00:55:13,682
The boys' identities were changed
by either changing their hair colour,

691
00:55:13,734 --> 00:55:16,021
eye colour or other ways.

692
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,477
They were always in uniform.

693
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,268
A solution was put in his eyes.

694
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,308
They would sell him for money for sex.

695
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,188
His eye colour was changed from blue
to brown by the use of this solution.

696
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:28,187
The door wasn't shut and I left by that door.

697
00:55:28,235 --> 00:55:31,314
I ran in the big hallway
and there was another door.

698
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:34,225
Somehow I managed to go outside

699
00:55:34,276 --> 00:55:36,646
and outside I ran, I ran, I ran

700
00:55:36,693 --> 00:55:40,769
and hours after that
l, I discovered that I was in Spain.

701
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:01,849
(Ringing tone)

702
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:16,264
We've got a kid here
which is about 14, 15 years old.

703
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:17,690
He doesn't have no ID.

704
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:20,683
He's no documents on him
but you can see he's very young.

705
00:56:20,732 --> 00:56:22,725
And he's very scared.

706
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,397
She was professional
but you could see that she was horrified.

707
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:36,523
This was a horrendous interview
and when I left I was shaken by it

708
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:40,512
because it had all the horrific,
emotional side effects

709
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:43,054
that go with listening to such a story.

710
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:46,722
He knew about this type of activity.

711
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:50,139
I mean, a normal person
doesn't sit down with a story

712
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:52,265
and make up horrendous...

713
00:56:52,816 --> 00:56:54,438
that's not what you lie about.

714
00:56:54,482 --> 00:56:59,269
You don't go into detail about torture
and the murdering of children or whatever.

715
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,595
None of that seemed normal.

716
00:57:00,649 --> 00:57:02,390
He was tortured.

717
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,230
I mean, he had torture written all...

718
00:57:04,273 --> 00:57:08,730
He had a broken hand
that was never medically attended to,

719
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:10,431
he walked with a limp,

720
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:16,596
erm, he had cigarette burns down the back
of his head to the back of his ankles.

721
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:21,851
This person is either, erm,
had been the victim himself

722
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,554
or he was a fantastic actor

723
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:28,639
and I didn't
know which of those titles applied to him.

724
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:33,188
I let them know that I was very sorry
about what had happened

725
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,766
and we were going to locate
the people who had done this

726
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:38,766
and put an end to the trauma
that he had been through.

727
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:45,809
This was the last border.

728
00:57:46,273 --> 00:57:48,975
It's like you...

729
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:51,477
I won. You know, the game is over.

730
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:56,636
I had passports, everybody in the family
say I am Nicholas Barclay.

731
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:59,264
Nobody was investigating me.

732
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,313
Nobody was suspicious that I know.

733
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:09,059
Hell, I was happy.

734
00:58:09,105 --> 00:58:11,725
I was, you know...
I couldn't believe my luck.

735
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:21,313
My name is Charlie Parker.
I'm a private investigator.

736
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:23,477
Hey, how are you doin'?

737
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:26,093
Say, I want you...
I want you to do something for me.

738
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,432
♪ I know dark clouds
are gonna gather around me

739
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,723
♪ I know my way'll be rough and steep

740
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:39,599
♪ Yet beautiful fields lie just before me...

741
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:46,354
I got a call back in November and, erm,
from a television producer for Hard Copy

742
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,471
and he said that a boy

743
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:52,561
who had been missing earlier for four years
had turned up

744
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:56,515
and he wanted me to track him down
so they could get an interview with him.

745
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:01,803
First I had to find out where his mother lived.

746
00:59:01,856 --> 00:59:07,638
Found her and then we drove out to
the north of San Antonio to do the interview.

747
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:18,728
I had repeatedly asked him,
please do not contact the media.

748
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:21,803
If anything that Nicholas was telling us was true,

749
00:59:21,853 --> 00:59:23,974
if any of it had any accuracy,

750
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,103
and if there was any military officer
possibly involved,

751
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,717
the last thing that we wanted it to be put

752
00:59:29,771 --> 00:59:32,438
was on the front page of the newspaper
or on television

753
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,259
so that that abductor would know
something about our investigation.

754
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:40,932
This is Eyewitness News at 10.

755
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,222
He disappeared without a trace three years ago.

756
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,726
Tonight a San Antonio boy is back home.

757
00:59:46,772 --> 00:59:49,473
Nicholas Barclay is now 16 years old.

758
00:59:49,522 --> 00:59:51,096
He vanished when he was 13...

759
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:52,601
Nicholas says he was kidnapped

760
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:53,842
and taken to Spain.

761
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:57,432
He says for three years he was repeatedly
drugged, beaten and raped,

762
00:59:57,479 --> 01:00:01,389
all part of a sex slave operation
involving dozens of missing children.

763
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:04,268
Well, Bob, the FBI is not taking this case lightly...

764
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:05,389
The reason?

765
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,102
Somehow a 13-year-old boy from San Antonio

766
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:11,177
ended up in Spain without a passport.

767
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:15,140
June 19th 1994,
Nicholas got into a fight with his family,

768
01:00:15,188 --> 01:00:18,138
so he came here to Fort Sam Houston
to play basketball.

769
01:00:18,187 --> 01:00:20,674
Two young boys approached him,
they started talking.

770
01:00:20,728 --> 01:00:24,769
The next thing he knew, there was a cloth
over his mouth and Nicholas passed out.

771
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:28,016
He claims his captors
changed his appearance

772
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:29,850
to make him unrecognisable.

773
01:00:29,935 --> 01:00:32,222
He was no longer allowed to speak English.

774
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:34,343
Did they rape you all every night?

775
01:00:35,186 --> 01:00:36,560
Me? No.

776
01:00:36,602 --> 01:00:40,181
Because they didn't rape me every night.

777
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,383
Some of them, they liked more.

778
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:43,978
Some of the kids they liked more.

779
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:48,226
They rape them
usually two or three times a week.

780
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:53,426
I wanted the media's attention, so that
I would make Nicholas even more real,

781
01:00:53,478 --> 01:00:57,008
that people would really believe
that I'm Nicholas

782
01:00:57,685 --> 01:01:00,636
and they would love me even more for that.

783
01:01:02,311 --> 01:01:06,255
They set him up, put a microphone on him
and had the cameras on him

784
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:09,177
and I moved over behind a booth.

785
01:01:09,226 --> 01:01:11,300
And it was almost fate.

786
01:01:11,685 --> 01:01:14,471
Behind that booth was a picture

787
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:16,593
of the actual Nicholas Barclay.

788
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:21,434
And I could look at that picture
and look at him at the same time.

789
01:01:21,726 --> 01:01:26,716
And as I looked at the picture, I noticed
that the boy had blue-grey-looking eyes

790
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,759
and this man had brown eyes.

791
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:33,932
Here was a moment where the hair
stood up on the back of your neck,

792
01:01:33,975 --> 01:01:37,010
and, and er...there was
just something wrong about it.

793
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:39,596
I did what they wanted me to do.

794
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,056
Something was wrong. I said,
"Can you get me a picture of his ears?"

795
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:44,808
I need to get...get that.

796
01:01:44,852 --> 01:01:52,009
And I had read about Scotland Yard
using that method to trace down a man,

797
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:55,509
James Earl Ray,
that had killed Martin Luther King.

798
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,972
They had caught him in Heathrow Airport
by identifying his ears.

799
01:01:59,017 --> 01:02:05,547
And I knew the ears were a means of identity,
almost like fingerprints.

800
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,054
I put the picture in my pocket and took it...

801
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,310
When I got back to the office,

802
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:15,756
I put the pictures in Adobe Photoshop.

803
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,557
They, they were different ears.

804
01:02:26,601 --> 01:02:28,258
And so I knew right away

805
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:31,804
that absolutely he was not Nicholas Barclay.

806
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:35,303
I thought I had a spy.

807
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:37,968
I thought I had real, honest to God spy.

808
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:43,264
Why else would a guy come here
and take the place of another person?

809
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:44,683
What would be his reason?

810
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,173
I phoned Nancy Fisher.

811
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,884
I said, "This guy's a fake. It's not him."

812
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,592
I said, "The ears don't match."

813
01:02:54,642 --> 01:02:56,182
And my comment to him was,

814
01:02:58,058 --> 01:02:59,337
"You need to be very careful

815
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:01,927
that you don't intrude
on the federal investigation."

816
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:05,590
People aren't used to hearing
you talk about somebody's ears

817
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:09,137
and I think she was taken back by that.
She didn't know what I was talking about.

818
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:11,802
I thought I didn't have a right to question,

819
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,681
you know, their statement
that this was their family member

820
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,675
because how, how could they be wrong?

821
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:20,426
I mean, no-one would be wrong
about something like that.

822
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:24,053
What do they want? I've already got
the fact he doesn't have the same ears.

823
01:03:24,516 --> 01:03:27,798
Why would you ever,
ever take in a stranger?

824
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:29,839
Not just a stranger from this country

825
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,386
but a stranger from another country
who speaks with a French accent.

826
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:35,588
This has to be Nicholas Barclay.

827
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:40,381
It was an outrageous thing.

828
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:45,429
I cannot have talked to anyone
that hasn't read about this

829
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:50,888
that has said, "Wait a minute.
I know my own kid. I know my own son.

830
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,094
I can look in his eyes and tell..."

831
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:57,181
It's like when you go to a class reunion

832
01:03:57,223 --> 01:04:00,008
and you see the kids
you went to school with in 19...

833
01:04:10,974 --> 01:04:13,046
♪ DAVID BOWIE: Queen Bitch

834
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:25,555
It really began for me, the American dream,
when I took that big yellow bus

835
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,927
to go to school
with others, with other students.

Well, he started back to high school.

854
01:05:28,013 --> 01:05:29,174
I really was worried.

855
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:31,756
I didn't know what he was going to do.

856
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,425
This was a case. I mean, a real case.

857
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:38,303
This guy was lying
about who he said he was

858
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,420
and here the family was accepting him.

859
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:44,632
I expected him any day to blow up
something at the airbase

860
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,133
or do something at the army base.

861
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:54,091
I was pulling teeth trying to determine
who had kidnapped Nicholas,

862
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:56,460
when and where
and under what circumstances.

863
01:05:57,262 --> 01:05:59,217
I had almost no information

864
01:05:59,262 --> 01:06:02,510
because all the information he gave us
was very, very general.

865
01:06:02,555 --> 01:06:05,008
He couldn't give names,
he couldn't give places,

866
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:07,424
he couldn't give times,
he couldn't give anything.

867
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:13,427
The family was told that the reason
we were taking Nicholas to Houston

868
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,378
was because he'd been through trauma.

869
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:19,802
So he deserved to see a forensic expert
to deal with the trauma.

870
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:28,879
Initially I thought that this was
going to be a forensic interview,

871
01:06:28,928 --> 01:06:32,970
er, with the intent of finding out
more information

872
01:06:33,013 --> 01:06:34,968
about the people who abducted him.

873
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:45,254
Here was this pale white kid
and I introduced myself

874
01:06:45,303 --> 01:06:49,627
and, as he spoke back, immediately my...

875
01:06:49,677 --> 01:06:51,917
Something in me just said,
this is not right,

876
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:53,545
there's something wrong here.

877
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:55,834
I speak with him for a long time.

878
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:59,749
He asked me to repeat all the stories
I'd been telling everybody.

879
01:06:59,802 --> 01:07:03,169
I remember people grabbing me
and putting me in the van.

880
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:07,840
I went to sleep and I woke up in a room.
There was other kids...

881
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:11,086
I didn't see the same physiological change

882
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:18,092
in his body posture,
in his pupil size, in his heart rate,

883
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:19,593
that I would normally see

884
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:22,752
with somebody who's talking about
a traumatic experience.

885
01:07:28,093 --> 01:07:32,218
He couldn't speak English
without an accent.

886
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:37,214
That told me about the development of his brain,
and the development of language.

887
01:07:39,345 --> 01:07:44,760
You just cannot be raised for
the first six, seven years of your life

888
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:49,174
in an English-speaking home

889
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:53,792
and later on, you know,
eight, nine years later,

890
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:56,795
even 10 years later,

891
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:59,510
not be able to speak English
without an accent.

892
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:07,252
I can guarantee you that this kid was
not raised in an English-speaking family.

893
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:12,380
You know, I don't know who he is
but the person who was...I was interviewing

894
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,546
could not have been Nicholas Barclay.

895
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:20,544
OK, the worst scenario
just showed up and I don't like that.

896
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:24,289
This investigation did a 90 degree.

897
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:27,959
It just went from one, one place
all the way up to another.

898
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:31,419
I immediately called Carey Gibson
and I said to her,

899
01:08:31,468 --> 01:08:35,592
"Carey, Dr Perry has just stated
that this person cannot be your brother,

900
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:38,123
for the fact
that he cannot be an American.

901
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:42,175
This could be a very dangerous person."

902
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:48,915
She shrieked or screamed
and said, "Oh, my gosh!"

903
01:08:51,175 --> 01:08:53,545
So I said, "Don't be at the airport," you know.

904
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
"I'll handle it. I will take care of this individual"

905
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:58,872
and that she did not have to take him home,

906
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:01,046
you know, back to her home to live with them

907
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:03,497
and she says, "OK, OK."

908
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:14,794
We fly back into San Antonio
and there's Carey standing there.

909
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:17,295
What?

910
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:24,457
She acted like we'd
never had that conversation.

911
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:28,751
And she acted excited to see him,
asked him how his trip was.

912
01:09:29,635 --> 01:09:31,789
I think I just stared for a minute...

913
01:09:33,174 --> 01:09:36,457
And I called the US Attorneys' Office
right then and there

914
01:09:36,508 --> 01:09:38,499
and I said, "What do I do?"

915
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:44,794
And the Assistant US Attorney said,
"Let him return to her temporarily."

916
01:09:46,299 --> 01:09:49,581
She welcomed this person home
just like he was her brother.

917
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:53,577
I didn't have any clue
as to why she behaved in this manner.

918
01:09:53,965 --> 01:09:56,254
Because in my conversation with her,

919
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,048
I had said,
"This person is not your brother."

920
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:04,042
I don't think... I don't remember her
putting it in those words.

921
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:07,539
Well, maybe they wanted him so badly
to be their son

922
01:10:07,591 --> 01:10:09,379
that they said he was their son,

923
01:10:09,423 --> 01:10:12,126
but it was starting to get ridiculous.

924
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:19,995
I couldn't let it go. There was no way
in the world I could let it go.

925
01:10:21,673 --> 01:10:24,080
I started going into the neighbourhood,

926
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:26,206
and finding out about
the real Nicholas Barclay,

927
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:27,964
interviewing the neighbours,

928
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:31,373
trying to find out
what I could about that boy

929
01:10:31,424 --> 01:10:33,165
and about that family.

930
01:10:33,214 --> 01:10:35,041
And what's going on?

931
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,294
You know, why would Nicholas have left?

932
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,338
The police used to usually come

933
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:44,873
maybe like twice or three times a month.

934
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:47,955
Either it was argument with the kids

935
01:10:48,006 --> 01:10:51,335
or with their boyfriend or with the other son.

936
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,257
I spoke to everyone and they all said
that Nicholas had caused trouble,

937
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:00,087
had come home late at night.

938
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,454
We've all had arguments in our family,

939
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:04,379
but it's rare that we call the police,

940
01:11:04,423 --> 01:11:06,544
that it is so bad that they have to come.

941
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:10,166
It, it made me think
there was something going on,

942
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:12,419
more than meets the eye. Of course it did.

943
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:21,626
I knew that DNA samples would prove
that he wasn't Nicholas Barclay.

944
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,917
Mrs Dollarhide said, "This is my son.

945
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:32,164
I don't have to provide blood samples
for you for DNA

946
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:33,837
and she laid down on the floor,

947
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,955
literally laid down on the floor,

948
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,415
and said, "No, and you can't pick me up,
and you can't make me."

949
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:45,124
I did not want to go anywhere with the FBI,
but I don't remember refusing.

950
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:48,082
I was stunned.
I've never had that reaction before.

951
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:50,619
She wasn't just apathetic,
she was hostile.

952
01:11:52,423 --> 01:11:57,125
To be honest with you, I really have
no idea what I was thinking at that time.

953
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:01,875
My main goal in life was not, not to think.

954
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:07,170
We didn't need to prove who he was.
We knew who he was.

955
01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:15,420
I no longer saw them as a grieving erm...
victimised family.

956
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:18,459
I saw them as a very questionable family.

957
01:12:19,004 --> 01:12:23,792
There would be no reason for them
to accept a stranger into their lives...

958
01:12:25,255 --> 01:12:27,541
..unless there was something to hide.

959
01:12:27,588 --> 01:12:29,413
That would be the only reason.

960
01:12:29,463 --> 01:12:32,545
Something was being hidden
and I didn't know what that was.

961
01:12:42,212 --> 01:12:45,873
When Beverly refused
to give her blood sample,

962
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,003
I started to become suspicious.

963
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:51,997
They knew that I wasn't Nicholas.

964
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:55,957
Whatever I was telling them,

965
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:00,083
they didn't believe a word of it.

966
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,918
But they were good at not showing it.

967
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:08,164
I mean, who wouldn't see it?

968
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:13,459
That's about four, five years ago now.

969
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:17,040
I remember in Spain,
Carey did everything for me.

970
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,328
When I didn't know something, she told me.

971
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:25,293
"You forgot everything
but you're going to remember it now

972
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:30,491
and, you know, this was Mom at the place
we're living in with... Do you remember?

973
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:34,952
Oh, this was Chantelle. You remember
Chantelle. That's your niece, my daughter.

974
01:13:35,003 --> 01:13:38,332
Do you remember that? Do you
remember that? Do you remember that?"

975
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,285
Over and over and over again.

976
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:41,533
That's Jason.

977
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:44,334
She wanted to put it in my head.

978
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:47,246
She wanted to put it in my head
so I would never forget.

979
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:51,417
She just could not say it's not Nicholas.

980
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:53,368
Did she believe it or not?

981
01:13:53,419 --> 01:13:54,747
If you asked me, I would say,

982
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:57,460
no, not for a second
did she believe I was her brother.

983
01:13:58,545 --> 01:14:00,784
She decided I was gonna be her brother.

984
01:14:02,544 --> 01:14:04,867
It's like I woke up in a place where...

985
01:14:06,503 --> 01:14:08,824
Lies even bigger than what I did.

986
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:10,453
You know, it's...

987
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:16,201
they pretended as much as I did
and even more.

988
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:27,743
I kept thinking about the kid,
Nicholas Barclay.

989
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,620
At the time of his disappearance,

990
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:43,163
he was living with Beverly
in the house on Swallow Street

991
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:46,244
and his brother Jason
was also living there.

992
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:53,869
Jason, Nick's older brother,

993
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:55,624
when he moved into their house,

994
01:14:55,668 --> 01:14:56,912
that house changed,

995
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,333
because before he got there,

996
01:14:58,376 --> 01:14:59,619
Nick and his mom

997
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,410
seemed pretty close to me.

998
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:04,375
She loved him to death.

999
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:09,204
I mean, she loved him, you could tell...
She, she... He was the light of her life.

1000
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:13,656
This guy moved in,
he was a bum, a drug addict

1001
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,292
and he only cared about himself.

1002
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:19,073
And when he got into that house,
it just made things that much more worse.

1003
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:23,285
In fact, I think it even pushed his mom
into doing drugs herself

1004
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:24,957
when he moved into the house.

1005
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,117
That house just became
a volatile situation altogether.

1006
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:33,582
I discovered from the police files,

1007
01:15:33,626 --> 01:15:36,195
a couple of months
after the disappearance,

1008
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,162
that Jason had called the police

1009
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:42,955
and said that his brother
had tried to break into the house.

1010
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,454
Well, we see that kind of thing all the time.

1011
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:51,746
People, people
are constantly doing stuff like that

1012
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:55,038
to make people think that person's alive.

1013
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,117
I started to put two and two together

1014
01:16:00,165 --> 01:16:03,118
and I thought something happened
inside that house to that boy.

1015
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,076
I didn't need to be Columbo
to put all the pieces together.

1016
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:18,407
They killed him.

1017
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:23,076
Some of them did it, some of them knew of it,
and some of them chose to ignore it.

1018
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:32,581
I wasn't worried about
Nicholas coming back no more.

1019
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:40,155
Neither Nicholas Barclay
or his mother were cooperating,

1020
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:43,538
so we were going to have to have
a search warrant executed

1021
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:46,249
in order to obtain those blood samples.

1022
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:52,782
I couldn't pretend no more to be Nicholas
and act like Nicholas.

1023
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:57,487
I took two or three other agents with me
to go pick him up.

1024
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:05,320
So inside me, I started getting,
you know, more and more aggressive,

1025
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:07,193
weird.

1026
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,329
I couldn't go on.

1027
01:17:10,124 --> 01:17:13,039
We got the fingerprints
and we got the palm prints.

1028
01:17:13,082 --> 01:17:16,944
Within a few weeks, we would be sending
them out to Interpol, to the embassies,

1029
01:17:16,997 --> 01:17:18,953
to see if any of these fingerprints

1030
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:21,866
matched anything that they had on record.

1031
01:17:21,915 --> 01:17:23,704
I was trying to find a way out,

1032
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:26,787
not only a way out in San Antonio, Texas,

1033
01:17:26,831 --> 01:17:29,035
but a way out, out of my mind.

1034
01:17:29,582 --> 01:17:32,946
Nicholas was becoming
much more agitated and angry

1035
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:35,829
and I really felt like
he was going to run away

1036
01:17:35,872 --> 01:17:38,990
and if he ran away we might have
a very hard time locating him.

1037
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:42,498
I started tailing him,
I started following him.

1038
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,069
I started sitting up on Beverly's place
where she lived

1039
01:17:46,121 --> 01:17:50,281
and writing down licence numbers of
all the cars that came to her, to see her.

1040
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:56,281
So I took a razor blade
and I slit my face.

1041
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:59,494
Everything was snowballing
and snowballing and snowballing.

1042
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:03,199
I show them, show them that

1043
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:05,782
I was under a great deal of pressure.

1044
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,867
On March 3rd of 1998,

1045
01:18:07,912 --> 01:18:11,659
the legate in Madrid, Spain, called me

1046
01:18:11,706 --> 01:18:14,490
and he said, "We've just identified him."

1047
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,032
And I said, "You're kidding?"

1048
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:21,200
I knew that everything was going down
and it was just a matter of weeks.

1049
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:26,200
He said, "What I'm gonna do right now
is fax to you the records that I have."

1050
01:18:28,206 --> 01:18:29,863
CHARLIE: He agreed to meet with me.

1051
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,785
We ordered hot cakes.

1052
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:34,532
And we started to eat.

1053
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:36,486
And he said...

1054
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,909
I said,
"You really made your mother angry."

1055
01:18:38,956 --> 01:18:42,071
And he said,
"She's not my mother and you know it."

1056
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:44,863
And I thought, well, I'II be damned.

1057
01:18:45,246 --> 01:18:47,487
And so I stood over the fax machine,

1058
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:51,781
waiting for, of course, them to come in

1059
01:18:51,829 --> 01:18:54,068
because I was screaming
and jumping up and down.

1060
01:18:56,246 --> 01:18:58,237
I actually said, "Well, I'll be damned,

1061
01:18:58,288 --> 01:19:00,776
you're going to finally tell me
who you are."

1062
01:19:03,037 --> 01:19:07,280
I was like doing a dance
and everybody was high-fiving.

1063
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:10,826
It was like, you know, we finally,
we finally know who this person is.

1064
01:19:13,037 --> 01:19:17,410
And my heart was beating fast,
just like it is now thinking about it.

1065
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:20,866
And... And I said, "Who are you?"

1066
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:24,075
He said, "I'm Frederic Bourdin
and I'm wanted by Interpol."

1067
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:28,826
The fingerprint cards told me

1068
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:32,201
that he was not 16, he was 23.

1069
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:35,235
That he was not American, he was French.

1070
01:19:35,496 --> 01:19:38,494
That he was not Nicholas Barclay,
he was Frederic Bourdin.

1071
01:19:39,204 --> 01:19:42,153
We grow up in America thinking Interpol

1072
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:45,783
is kind of the God of the cops.
You follow me?

1073
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:48,399
That's the highest step you can get
in "Copland".

1074
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:50,657
And so I thought, Jesus Christ,

1075
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:54,069
if he's wanted by Interpol,
what has he done? You know.

1076
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,109
There is no limit to what he's done.

1077
01:19:56,161 --> 01:19:57,702
So he began to tell me.

1078
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:03,280
NANCY: Frederic Bourdin is delinquent.

1079
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:05,402
Activities and modus operandi...

1080
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:15,945
He has travelled throughout Europe

1081
01:20:15,995 --> 01:20:17,487
appearing at shelters for minors

1082
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:18,993
under different aliases.

1083
01:20:19,827 --> 01:20:21,618
Spain, 1992.

1084
01:20:23,078 --> 01:20:25,400
Spain, September 1993.

1085
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:28,026
(Overlapping voices)

1086
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:30,523
Barcelona...

1087
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,694
.. stated that he'd run away
from his adoptive parents' house.

1088
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,860
Brussels, '95.

1089
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:39,909
Pyrenees...

1090
01:20:39,953 --> 01:20:41,943
Milan, 1993.

1091
01:20:43,243 --> 01:20:44,440
Glasgow.

1092
01:20:44,493 --> 01:20:47,409
I sat there. I could hardly eat,
I could hardly swallow my food.

1093
01:20:53,203 --> 01:20:54,363
He always wore glasses.

1094
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,566
Giovanni Petrullo.

1095
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,692
Michelangelo Martini.

1096
01:20:59,243 --> 01:21:00,321
Donovan MacNeph.

1097
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:03,361
- Peter Samson.
- William Thomas.

1098
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:05,117
Jimmy Sale.

1099
01:21:05,162 --> 01:21:06,903
Peter Robin.

1100
01:21:06,953 --> 01:21:08,943
James Markey.

1101
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,071
Frederic Cassis.

1102
01:21:10,118 --> 01:21:11,195
'93.

1103
01:21:13,409 --> 01:21:14,689
Hernandez Fernandez.

1104
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:15,814
'95.

1105
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:17,029
Edgar Guteyere.

1106
01:21:17,076 --> 01:21:18,356
'97.

1107
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,484
Spain, 1997.

1108
01:21:20,783 --> 01:21:23,153
It's possible he may need psychiatric help.

1109
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,277
Settle in tonight

1110
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:31,283
because we are about to share with you

1111
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:32,903
a story so bizarre,

1112
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:35,026
it's hard to believe it's true.

1113
01:21:35,077 --> 01:21:37,612
This is the tale of a master imposter

1114
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:41,025
who managed to lie his way
into the United States

1115
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:44,442
and prey upon
the most vulnerable of people.

1116
01:21:44,493 --> 01:21:46,567
He is the only person in US history

1117
01:21:46,618 --> 01:21:50,149
ever to have assumed
the identity of a missing child.

1118
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:53,152
He fooled even the lost boy's mother.

1119
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,901
It's hard to imagine
how he could have gotten away with it.

1120
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:22,812
We knew it was going to be,
you know, heart-wrenching and...

1121
01:22:24,116 --> 01:22:25,278
you know...

1122
01:22:25,324 --> 01:22:27,314
but we never thought it wouldn't be him.

1123
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:30,528
You know, why would you even think that?

1124
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:32,815
The first feeling was complete sadness.

1125
01:22:33,034 --> 01:22:35,522
Because it wasn't Nicholas.

1126
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:37,565
Which took us back to square one.

1127
01:22:37,616 --> 01:22:39,940
Where is Nicholas?

1128
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:42,066
That was the first one.

1129
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:46,441
The second emotion was,

1130
01:22:49,242 --> 01:22:52,073
how could I be so fucking stupid?

1131
01:22:52,115 --> 01:22:53,939
I mean, seriously.

1132
01:22:57,907 --> 01:23:01,605
I contacted the SAPD,
the San Antonio Police Department,

1133
01:23:01,658 --> 01:23:05,816
and told them, decided to tell them,
that, hey, they killed him.

1134
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:12,272
Based upon Frederic Bourdin's allegations,

1135
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:16,653
a homicide investigation was opened

1136
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:20,395
and the allegation
was against the family members

1137
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,986
as being...participating in
the disappearance of the child.

1138
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:29,524
It was related to us
that while Frederic was in jail

1139
01:23:29,574 --> 01:23:32,276
that he said that my mom confessed to him

1140
01:23:32,324 --> 01:23:35,274
that her and Jason
killed Nicholas and hid the body.

1141
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,032
They accused me first

1142
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,522
and it totally freaked me out.

1143
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:50,565
Because I, I...have been crazy
but never violent.

1144
01:23:52,823 --> 01:23:57,446
This is the street the kid lived on
when he went missing.

1145
01:24:04,281 --> 01:24:06,355
There's the house right there.

1146
01:24:10,448 --> 01:24:12,354
I think the boy's buried here.

1147
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:17,987
I want to talk to Darryl inside.

1148
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:24,441
He's agreed to let me dig
and see if Nicholas Barclay's here.

1149
01:24:26,657 --> 01:24:29,440
If Beverly knew that this individual
was not her son,

1150
01:24:29,489 --> 01:24:32,321
then she had to have
some type of ulterior motive

1151
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:36,357
and it had to be something very scary

1152
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:40,103
for her to accept a stranger
into her household

1153
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:41,613
posing as her own son.

1154
01:24:41,655 --> 01:24:43,776
I agreed to take a lie detector test.

1155
01:24:44,989 --> 01:24:47,062
She passed the polygraph.

1156
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:51,229
And I said to the polygraph examiner,

1157
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:52,938
"I don't understand this,

1158
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:55,692
I don't understand it at all.
Will you give it to her again?"

1159
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:06,067
So he gave it to her again
and she passed the polygraph.

1160
01:25:06,113 --> 01:25:09,147
I said, "No, there is something wrong."

1161
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:13,645
The third time he gave it to her,

1162
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:16,189
she flunked every question.

1163
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:17,611
I mean, like, big-time.

1164
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:21,517
The polygrapher said the machine
practically jumped off the table.

1165
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:26,102
Her answers appeared to be
false on everything.

1166
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:31,402
And he turned to her and he said,

1167
01:25:31,445 --> 01:25:35,854
"Mrs Dollarhide, it appears
that you know where your son is.

1168
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:40,229
It appears that you know what happened
to him" and some other questions.

1169
01:25:40,487 --> 01:25:43,570
And that's when she became
very aggravated, very agitated,

1170
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:45,437
jumped up and ran out and was screaming.

1171
01:25:48,778 --> 01:25:53,022
I lied about being...stealing,

1172
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:58,194
and I had...so that's why I failed.

1173
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:02,607
I didn't lie about anything
to do with Nicholas.

1174
01:26:02,653 --> 01:26:04,561
It was the other questions.

1175
01:26:05,987 --> 01:26:07,859
- Darryl? Charlie Parker.
- Mr Parker.

1176
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:09,976
How are you doin'?

1177
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:11,642
It's nice in here.

1178
01:26:11,695 --> 01:26:13,154
So this is the house, huh?

1179
01:26:13,196 --> 01:26:14,569
Yes, sir.

1180
01:26:14,611 --> 01:26:19,944
The polygraph led us to believe
that she did have some information...

1181
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:26,195
..she could provide that she refused to
and we felt like Jason had information.

1182
01:26:26,862 --> 01:26:31,435
If Jason did something to Nicholas,
I didn't know about it

1183
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:36,191
and I can't imagine Jason ever doing that.

1184
01:26:36,237 --> 01:26:38,605
It's just not in his makeup,

1185
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:44,644
but...I don't know.

1186
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:52,521
I know my brother or my mother did not
kill Nicholas, accidentally, on purpose.

1187
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:55,106
Whatever Frederic said, it never happened.

1188
01:26:55,903 --> 01:27:00,643
When we first got my dog, he was always
digging in the back corner over there

1189
01:27:00,694 --> 01:27:02,068
where the, the tree is.

1190
01:27:02,111 --> 01:27:06,852
And one day I was mowing
and saw, like, pieces of, like, plastic,

1191
01:27:06,903 --> 01:27:09,308
- kind of like a tarp kind of material...
- OK.

1192
01:27:09,361 --> 01:27:12,228
..sticking out of the ground.
I tried to pull it up to get it out,

1193
01:27:12,276 --> 01:27:15,190
and it just kept ripping on me
as it was stuck in the ground.

1194
01:27:15,234 --> 01:27:17,806
So I never paid any attention to it
or gave it any thought,

1195
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,267
until last night when we were speaking
on the phone.

1196
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,523
And the bush has been there a while?

1197
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:30,652
I had initially tried to get a hold of
Jason prior to Frederic's arrest

1198
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:31,937
and couldn't.

1199
01:27:33,027 --> 01:27:35,942
And then when I finally did
get a hold of him,

1200
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:38,652
I asked him
about the disappearance of his brother.

1201
01:27:39,611 --> 01:27:44,846
He just seemed totally apathetic about
the disappearance of his younger brother.

1202
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,274
Extremely apathetic.

1203
01:27:46,317 --> 01:27:49,520
And didn't care that he'd been returned

1204
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,896
but when he did see him,

1205
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:52,566
no, that wasn't his brother,

1206
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:55,478
but he didn't seem interested enough
or excited enough

1207
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:58,524
to tell his mother and sister,
"That's not my brother.

1208
01:27:58,568 --> 01:28:01,187
No, no, they just wanted to believe."

1209
01:28:01,775 --> 01:28:04,478
Yeah, it's a good spot. Let's see.

1210
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:06,600
Say he dumps him here first...

1211
01:28:08,276 --> 01:28:11,108
..and then, if he looks up,

1212
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:15,517
yeah, yeah, this is good, this is good.

1213
01:28:15,566 --> 01:28:19,432
He was very hostile,
refused to help in any way,

1214
01:28:19,485 --> 01:28:23,478
and then he later left
the drug rehabilitation centre

1215
01:28:23,526 --> 01:28:27,020
and was found having died
from a drug overdose.

1216
01:28:27,442 --> 01:28:31,305
I think that Jason became a perfect scapegoat
because he's not here.

1217
01:28:32,526 --> 01:28:35,144
He died,

1218
01:28:35,192 --> 01:28:40,228
so he can't be questioned
or, you know, anything.

1219
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:45,314
I mean,
he can't, he can't even defend himself.

1220
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,559
It's kinda like a nightmare.

1221
01:28:57,858 --> 01:29:03,014
AII this stuff is coming at you and none
of it's true but nobody believes you.

1222
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:05,768
Or they think that you had
something to do with it.

1223
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:11,764
And it's like getting in trouble
for something you didn't do.

1224
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:18,311
You know, when kids tell you,
"I didn't do it!"

1225
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:20,433
You're going, "Yeah, right."

1226
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:24,765
But I didn't do it.

1227
01:29:27,358 --> 01:29:31,054
I do feel like the family knows
the whereabouts of Nicholas Barclay.

1228
01:29:31,107 --> 01:29:35,267
I think that Beverly Dollarhide
and Jason Dollarhide knew at one time

1229
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:37,804
what happened to Nicholas Barclay.

1230
01:29:37,857 --> 01:29:39,563
Show me one piece of evidence,

1231
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:43,268
show me one thing that will lock
anybody in our family up over this,

1232
01:29:43,315 --> 01:29:47,096
just one shred of actual proof.

1233
01:29:47,233 --> 01:29:49,354
Back here. Let's go back here.

1234
01:29:54,106 --> 01:29:57,474
The biggest,
funniest one to me, hilarious,

1235
01:29:58,024 --> 01:30:00,807
is that we went and picked up
a complete stranger

1236
01:30:00,856 --> 01:30:03,890
to hide the fact that we killed Nicholas

1237
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,510
or someone in my family killed Nicholas.

1238
01:30:06,564 --> 01:30:09,811
When through four years
that Nicholas was disappeared,

1239
01:30:09,856 --> 01:30:12,142
we were the only ones looking for him.

1240
01:30:12,189 --> 01:30:17,642
Why would we go pick up a stranger to hide
something that didn't need to be hidden?

1241
01:30:27,356 --> 01:30:29,430
Just another one of his lies.

1242
01:30:33,023 --> 01:30:34,564
REPORTER: Even from behind bars,

1243
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:37,972
he continued to lie to families
of other missing children.

1244
01:30:38,855 --> 01:30:40,596
From this phone in his cell,

1245
01:30:40,646 --> 01:30:42,637
Bourdin made hundreds of collect calls

1246
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:45,723
claiming to have information
about lost children.

1247
01:30:46,356 --> 01:30:47,897
He even said he could help solve

1248
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,641
the highly publicised case
of Sabrina Aisenberg,

1249
01:30:50,689 --> 01:30:54,434
an infant who was taken from her home
in Tampa, Florida, last year.

1250
01:30:58,188 --> 01:31:00,262
No.

1251
01:31:04,897 --> 01:31:06,306
Yes.

1252
01:31:11,856 --> 01:31:13,397
He's a habitual liar

1253
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:15,182
and it blows my mind

1254
01:31:15,232 --> 01:31:21,179
that anybody can take anything
that is said out of his mouth as truth.

1255
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:27,308
What? This kid comes
and says he's Nicholas,

1256
01:31:27,355 --> 01:31:28,682
and then turns around and says,

1257
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:31,682
"You...these people
that took care of me killed him."

1258
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,396
Hm.
How do you come up with that conclusion?

1259
01:31:34,438 --> 01:31:36,973
He put us through enough already

1260
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:40,800
and then for him to do this
while he's in jail for what he's done

1261
01:31:40,855 --> 01:31:43,059
and to cause more pain to our family?

1262
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,307
