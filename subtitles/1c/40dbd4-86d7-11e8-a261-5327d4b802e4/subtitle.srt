1
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:54,452
Hello!

2
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,824
Hello, is it Ha-tau?
I'm Auntie!

3
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:57,759
What's the matter?

4
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,423
Are you still sleeping?
I'll call you later

5
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,300
OK!

6
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:21,446
Hello!

7
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,249
It's you again, Auntie!

8
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,359
You still didn't get up!
Then I call you later

9
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:30,190
Oh, no need! Just go on!

10
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,265
The problem is that your
cousin is not feeling well

11
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,136
and will go to see doctor!
To avoid wasting time in travelling

12
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,397
I'll let her live with you for
several day! OK?

13
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,741
Didn't I have a cousin really?

14
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,069
She's your second uncle's
daughter, Ah-ngor!

15
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:56,987
Who is it?

16
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:13,065
I just thought that you were out!
I'm Ah-ngor!

17
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,503
You are my cousin, aren't you?

18
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,671
Just treat yourself at home!

19
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,710
There are kitchen and washroom

20
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,076
Hello! Someone's calling me!
Tell him to call me later!

21
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:39,429
Hello!

22
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,997
Hello! Can I speak to Brother Wah?

23
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,629
He's sleeping. Who is calling?

24
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:44,966
You don't even know me

25
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:46,504
You must be his new friend

26
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,107
I'm Fly! Who are you?

27
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,239
I am his cousin!

28
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,867
Cousin?! Never mind!

29
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,071
Tell him that I'm waiting for
bargaining with Fat-karl

30
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,545
Tell him to contact me
when he get up

31
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:56,876
OK!

32
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:00,438
Hello!

33
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,946
Hello, Cousin!
Didn't Brother Wah get up?

34
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,410
Didn't still! Is it urgent?

35
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:07,747
Didn't you want me to wake him up?

36
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,420
No, thanks! If he get up,

37
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,217
tell him that I'm still
waiting for Fat-karl

38
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,389
and tell him to call me!

39
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,890
OK!

40
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,010
Go to sleep if you are tired!

41
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:08,439
I could sleep in the living room tonight!

42
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,118
Why do you wear a gauze-mask?

43
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,853
To avoid infecting other!

44
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:24,491
What kind of disease?

45
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,462
The doctor said that my lung
is malfunctioning

46
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,760
and tell me to see a specialist

47
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:33,465
You won't die!

48
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,600
Just eat more oranges and
you'll be alright!

49
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:43,447
So strange!

50
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,019
A guy called Fly had phoned you

51
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,923
several time a while ago!

52
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,794
Really? What did he say?

53
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,737
Hello!

54
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:05,997
Hello, little cousin!

55
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:07,204
Haven't Brother Wah get up?

56
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,102
Hello!

57
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:10,971
I'm still staying with Fat-karl
for collecting debt

58
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,779
Damn it! You still haven't
get the money till now?

59
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,715
He's just making fun of you!
you stay there and I come at once!

60
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:30,957
I cannot go for dinner

61
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,394
with you tonight!

62
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,400
Here's one hundred dollars
for your dinner!

63
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,098
The key is under the carpet!

64
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,004
Take it off, would you?
It isn't looking good

65
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,688
Have a cup of tea first!

66
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,561
Fat-karl, I tell you...

67
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,690
I'm doing you favour
to talk with you

68
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,197
for such a long time

69
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,200
I, Fly, am not famous

70
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,835
because I'm not qualified

71
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,739
also my Big Brother always
tell me to be subtle

72
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:16,639
Did you know Mr. Aeroplane
of Agah-chee Wan?!

73
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,671
He had made a debt of $1600

74
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,040
and just paid it late for two days,

75
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,375
now he cannot fly,
and have to sit on a wheel chair

76
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:26,013
I did that with my own hands

77
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:28,780
Are you trying to frighten me?

78
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,122
He, Aeroplane, is a nobody
and cannot be compared to me

79
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,651
I tell you...

80
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:34,889
I, Fat-karl,

81
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,723
never before have the habit
of paying debt

82
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:40,329
Let's say that Big-Circle
who were more powerful...

83
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,990
and now Big-Circle
becomes Small-Circle!

84
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,701
Do you know why?

85
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,737
It was because he forced me
to pay his debt,

86
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:47,339
so I hit him nearly into death

87
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,202
He now get only one eye left!

88
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:51,767
Just having two years experience

89
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,879
don't you have the guts to collect my debt?

90
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,579
I got knife-scars more than
the number of your leg's hair!

91
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:01,380
Scar? My Big Brother has one!
I'll cut myself if you have!

92
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,314
Cut yourself then!

93
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,290
Haven't you finish talking?

94
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:07,988
We're in the beginning still!

95
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:10,486
Still in the beginning for so many hours!

96
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:11,928
Don't you want to die?

97
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,794
Don't move! Everybody don't move!

98
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,493
Would you pay the debt?

99
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:20,800
Yes, yes! Why wouldn't I?

100
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:25,337
It's unbelievable! So easy!

101
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,945
I know, just by his face,
that he is a sheep wearing tiger's skin

102
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:28,945
With so many companions,

103
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,640
they will strike you in the very
beginning if they have guts

104
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,647
You are right!

105
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:32,546
This is for you!

106
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,845
Thank you, Brother!

107
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,150
Where are you going Big Brother?

108
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:46,430
Brother Wah!

109
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:49,362
Visiting Mabel?

110
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,059
Yeah!

111
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:51,227
She hasn't go for work yet!

112
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:52,299
I'll wait for her downstairs

113
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:53,598
OK!

114
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:09,651
That boutique has a lot of
new arrival!

115
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,517
Really?

116
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,385
I'll go to the boutique with
you some other day!

117
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:12,684
OK!

118
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:21,332
Mabel!

119
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,060
Come here!

120
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,602
I didn't have my dinner!
Would you go eating with me!

121
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,302
That's OK if you don't like to!

122
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,441
Why did you go to work so lately?

123
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,812
I just left from the hospital

124
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:44,117
Just from the hospital? Why?
Stomach-washing again?

125
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,884
Not stomach-washing!
It's abortion!

126
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:52,665
Are you kidding?

127
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,198
You can treat it as kidding
if you like to!

128
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,638
No it won't! Why didn't you tell me
that you were pregnant?

129
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,502
Had you gave me a chance
to tell me?

130
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,674
I had waited for three day!
But didn't you call me?

131
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,775
You could call me if I didn't!

132
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,644
Call you! What could I tell you?

133
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,077
Tell you I'm going for abortion

134
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,481
or tell you to marry me?

135
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,088
We'd been together for six years!
What did I get finally?

136
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,254
I felt like not knowing you

137
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,155
and didn't even get any money

138
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,589
I'm so poor that I had to borrow
my mother's money for abortion!

139
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:25,823
Speak up! What did I do for?

140
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,398
Shut up!

141
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,498
Stop saying!
Since the day we'd met,

142
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:33,002
you knew already what kind
of person I am

143
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,499
Don't stay with me if you want
to marry and want money

144
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,445
Don't think that because you had
abortion so secretly

145
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:42,912
that I would feel sorry for
all the rest of my life

146
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,243
I won't!

147
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,443
Your mouth said you won't
but your heart said you will

148
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,984
Because you didn't bother me,
didn't care about me

149
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,921
I spoiled your baby

150
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,857
And I am going to tell everybody

151
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,283
that I had your baby aborted,

152
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,691
so that you'll feel guilty for
the rest of your life

153
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,802
You've got the guts!

154
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:47,638
Cousin!

155
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:51,943
Are you alright?

156
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,068
Cousin!

157
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:24,847
What's the matter, cousin?

158
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,613
Are you lovelorned?

159
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,491
What did you say?

160
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,127
What did you say?

161
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:53,011
I tell you! Never talk
about lovelorn again

162
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,674
Or else, I'll throw you out!

163
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:11,715
Did you see the doctor?

164
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:13,854
I just returned from the hospital

165
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:17,319
What have the doctor said?

166
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,625
I will get the report tomorrow!

167
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,142
Haven't you have your meal?
Go eating with me!

168
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,706
I have make the meal!

169
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,351
Fly had phoned you again
this morning

170
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,354
What had the dirty guy said?

171
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:56,164
Nothing special!
Just some casual talk!

172
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,260
Didn't he ask anything about me?

173
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,833
What kind of thing?

174
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,673
The thing happened last night!

175
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,239
Fly had asked only once!

176
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:16,685
What? What did he ask?

177
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,987
I'm afraid to tell you!

178
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,522
Just tell me what you heard!

179
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,960
Do you insist me to tell you?

180
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,597
He asked me if
you were lovelorned

181
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:45,115
You have been here for all day!
What didn't you go out?

182
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:51,055
No place to go!
I have no friend in Kowloon

183
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,362
Eat quickly!
We'll go out together tonight

184
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,235
Cousin, are you studying or working?

185
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,541
I'm working already!

186
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,071
What kind of job?

187
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,049
I'm working in a friend's restaurant

188
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,613
Boy friend?

189
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:27,423
Well! Not quite!

190
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:29,651
Everybody call him Uncle Tang

191
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,262
Let us go to the cinema a while later!

192
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:39,132
We'll go if you are free!
You have no need to stay with me

193
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,699
Calling rescue?

194
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,630
Ah-site, how much have you lose?

195
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:14,734
Five hundreds!

196
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,910
I won't play for so little money!

197
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:26,216
One thousand for one game,
agree for not?

198
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,088
One thousand? What's your opinion,
King of snooker?

199
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:33,482
What? To see my quality
just by one thousand dollar?

200
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:34,883
I play with single-hand
in this game,

201
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,824
for two thousands

202
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:40,291
Single hand!
Let's sign contract at once!

203
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:43,499
Ah-site!

204
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,233
Single-head!

205
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:04,683
Another ball into pocket!
What's your opinion?

206
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,529
Right, King of snooker is really great!

207
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:29,847
Ah-site, how many scores have I lost?

208
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:35,912
No need to calculate!
He has thirty scores more than you

209
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,285
Still has five scores more than you
even if you win all the ball rested

210
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,815
How do you look?

211
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,118
That means we need
a targeting stick!

212
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,099
Ah-site, bring me my private cue

213
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,003
Start, start!

214
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,446
Stunt Follow

215
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:06,852
Get away!

216
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,420
Get out of my way!

217
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,626
Now, set the targeting stick!

218
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,400
Not stable! Make it more stable!

219
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,767
Beware! You will lost 7 scores!

220
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:38,047
Save that balls! Save it!

221
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,514
Are you taking me as a dead!

222
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,016
Fuck off!

223
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:45,186
Big Brother!

224
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,021
What's the matter, Big Brother?

225
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,126
Get away!

226
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,611
Go away, bastard!

227
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,077
Don't go!

228
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,283
Don't go!

229
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,760
Bastard, don't block the way!

230
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,415
Damn you!

231
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:53,281
Damn it! Damn it!

232
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:07,632
Fuck off

233
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:32,756
Big Brother!

234
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,513
Could we leave now?

235
00:22:58,857 --> 00:22:59,846
It's OK!

236
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:26,473
Be quiet, would you?

237
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,239
Are you alright?

238
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,409
I'm alright!

239
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,795
Why don't you go to sleep?
It's so late

240
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,372
Cousin, my report said that

241
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:47,372
my health is alright

242
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:49,639
I want to celebrate with you at first,

243
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,382
but, Auntie said the weather is fine

244
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,450
and the restaurant is busy these days

245
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,514
Uncle Tang want me to go back earlier

246
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,752
I have called you twice,
but you have no response

247
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,615
You must be very tired, I think

248
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:02,252
Summer is coming

249
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,719
and many people will spend
their holiday in Lantau Island

250
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,429
Do you have holiday working
in such career?

251
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,393
I've made a meal for you
in the kitchen

252
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:13,031
Besides, I've bought several glasses

253
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,003
I know, they will be all broken
sooner or later

254
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,865
So I've hid one of them

255
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,141
One day when you need this glass,

256
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:21,609
give me a phone, and...

257
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:23,840
I'll tell you where it was hidden

258
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,779
Goodbye, Ah-ngor!

259
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:03,918
Everybody!

260
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:09,589
Be quiet! Be quiet!

261
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,197
All my relatives and all my guests,

262
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,235
today is the wedding of
my brother, Ah-site

263
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,968
We've prepared some simple
food to serve you

264
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,471
Would we all raise our glasses
I drink first

265
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:30,172
Cheer!

266
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,949
I've already said that two hundred
dollars were too much

267
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,383
How would I know he would

268
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,748
hold the ceremony on the roof!

269
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:38,349
Please eat!

270
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,350
Use your meal, please!

271
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,288
Don't behave this way! Eat!

272
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,695
Look at this way!

273
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:52,697
Take one more photograph!

274
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,262
OK! OK!

275
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,338
Thank you!

276
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,772
Go bring your mother-in-law and
father-in-law to take a photograph!

277
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,202
Hurry up!

278
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,278
Father, would you take a photograph!

279
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,779
No!

280
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,115
Take it, father!

281
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,552
No!

282
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:16,517
Don't be like that,
go take a photograph!

283
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:20,222
No! What for?
It's really a shame!

284
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,598
Eat quickly if you want to!

285
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,224
We must leave soon
or else I'll faint

286
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,098
Don't be like that, father!

287
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,971
Don't hold any celebration
if you don't have money

288
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,775
Celebrating on the roof
is extremely unbelievable

289
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,706
I just don't know how to teach you

290
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,947
You have never done
a good work in the past

291
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:45,687
It's your brother's wedding!

292
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,348
Why did you made it so shabby?

293
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,391
Don't you think that I didn't
want to make it luxurious?

294
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,790
But I have no money!
What can I do?

295
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,400
Damn it! So noisy!

296
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,843
Gay fellow!

297
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,052
What did you say?

298
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:21,258
What did I say?
I said you are gay!

299
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,418
I did serve you shark's fin
or abalone, didn't you?

300
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,159
It has no air-conditioning!
Why are you so talkative?

301
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:30,428
You only deserved vegetal abalone

302
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:32,361
If your son-in-law didn't
say you love eating abalone,

303
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:33,596
I won't let you have it!

304
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,870
If I know you are so troublesome,

305
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:38,674
I'll give you shit, not abalone!

306
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:41,008
Are you looking for death?

307
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,010
Don't you dare throwing things to me?

308
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,038
Don't block my way!
Let me kill him

309
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:45,114
Don't you want to fight?

310
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,911
Don't do that, Big Brother!

311
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,280
Want to fight, don't you?

312
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,412
Hey, now what do you want?
Get away!

313
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,557
I tell you, don't make any noise!

314
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:55,387
What can't I speak?

315
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:56,186
Sit down!

316
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:57,522
Get lost!

317
00:31:57,662 --> 00:31:58,287
Good boy!

318
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,330
Sit, sit down!

319
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,927
Hey! Is it right?
He's really bastard

320
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:05,661
Do you really want to fight
before Big Brother?

321
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:06,736
Don't you?

322
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:09,431
Speak up! Speak once more!

323
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,808
Anyway, he is Ah-site's father-in-law

324
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:19,481
If you make trouble,
your young brother will be embarrassed

325
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,550
Do you agree?

326
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:24,246
OK! It's my fault!
I'm wrong!

327
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:36,467
My young brother,
I make you suffered today

328
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:44,364
I'll pay for it when I have
money some days

329
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,184
I knew that It's our turn

330
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,917
But it happens so soon

331
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,225
The cops arrested us last night.

332
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,722
They're just small fry, It's not a big deal

333
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:09,091
Big-mouth kay controls the money

334
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,499
They said that

335
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:23,410
The cops are making a deal with him.
They wont him to be turncoat witness

336
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:26,476
This case is quite serious!

337
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,848
So that Godfather sent me
to inform you that,

338
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:32,423
don't make any trouble if
it is not necessarily these days

339
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,051
Hey, the police has a great
action outside!

340
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:37,786
All of you bastards

341
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,021
who have drugs and weapons,

342
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,359
go hide them away quickly!

343
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,328
Ah-wah, someone visiting
you outside!

344
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,562
Thank you!

345
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:53,872
What are you coming for?


346
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,309
I visit you with special reason

347
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,274
Your brother, Fly,
owe us a sum of money

348
00:33:57,782 --> 00:34:00,751
He hasn't pay the debt for several period
and didn't reply our call

349
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:03,413
My big brother sent me
to inform you that...

350
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,616
If he don't show up tomorrow,

351
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,721
we won't give him any chance

352
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:12,690
Tell Tony that I know how
to teach my own man,

353
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,190
and, about the debt,
I will ask Fly

354
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,357
If It's true,

355
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,991
I will bring him to see
Tony tomorrow

356
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,745
Do you want to see me?

357
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,683
You need money don't you?

358
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:42,888
I always need money

359
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:48,793
I'm used to it. I have big prospects

360
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,795
The fortune teller told me
I'll be freat at the age of 30

361
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:57,231
Every thing is fine then

362
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,172
No need to stay here

363
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,113
Did he told you that you can't live to 30

364
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,911
No!

365
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:10,115
I heard that you borrowed money from Tony

366
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,153
Who is Tony?

367
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,654
I don't know him.

368
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,758
What did you say?

369
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,385
English

370
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,755
You knew that I don't know English

371
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,592
I ask you. Did you borrow money from Tony?

372
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:26,169
No!

373
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,938
No? Why are they looking for you?

374
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,974
They are eating around the corner

375
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,436
Do you want me to tell them you're here?

376
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:34,840
Yes!

377
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:42,976
Who are you winking to?

378
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:48,424
How much did you borrow?

379
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,587
Just a small sum. Take it easy

380
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,094
Small sum is also money

381
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:54,864
How much?

382
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,091
Hundreds bucks. It's not a big deal,
leave him alone

383
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:00,629
But they come to me

384
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,241
Tell me

385
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:13,808
4 meals and a pair of gold bracelets

386
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:30,966
Here are eight thousands!

387
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:39,901
What? Eight thousands?
Are you using one dollar as two?

388
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:43,976
It's so if he said it is!

389
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,380
The principal is eight thousands!
What about the rest?

390
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:51,021
He haven't paid for
four installments

391
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,123
Omitting the odd, he still owe us
thirteen thousand and five

392
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,625
We are giving you benefit
because we know you

393
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,728
Why don't you go robbing?

394
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,101
Who do you think you are?
Speak to me?

395
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,497
So fond of talking

396
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:08,135
Ah-kwong, talk to him for
several hours at there!

397
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:08,967
Yes!

398
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:09,732
Fuck off, you son of bitch!

399
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:12,866
Shut up! Get out!

400
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,143
Get out!

401
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,086
Your brother is lucky in
working under you

402
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:32,653
If he is working for other,
he have already died!

403
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:38,294
Don't talk anymore
I don't want to talk about that

404
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:43,399
I return you the principal first

405
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:46,533
But he really didn't have money
to paid the interest

406
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:47,667
So we have to delay for
two installments more

407
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:49,580
Two installments delay?

408
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,511
Why not return to me after my death?

409
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:54,777
You must trust me even
if you don't trust him!

410
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,546
I'll responsible for this debt

411
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,416
But I have no money now

412
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,882
I'll give you after two days

413
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:07,387
How can you be a Big Brother
if you don't have any money at hand

414
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,500
I think you better go farming!

415
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,930
I thought that you had money
so I dared to talk with you

416
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:16,871
You are such a poor Big Brother...

417
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:26,008
Did you really want it?

418
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:28,984
What's the matter?

419
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:30,743
What? You are crazy!

420
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,248
I have the gut to take it
if you have it now

421
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:38,594
OK! I dial a phone first

422
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,864
Why are you standing here still?

423
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,603
Your boss told you to talk with me,
why didn't you speak?

424
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:54,734
What's your father name?

425
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:55,846
What's your mother called?

426
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,072
Stop joking, Fly!

427
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:58,577
Why didn't you speak?

428
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,244
You don't have parents?

429
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:08,182
Aren't you the boss?

430
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:13,088
Don't come near to me

431
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,898
I have some problem now,
can you lend me some money?

432
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:16,796
Could you?

433
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:17,730
Yes, I could!

434
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:18,665
Really?

435
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:19,599
Really! No problem!

436
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,068
Fly!

437
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:25,506
Now I borrow these money
from your boss

438
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,467
It's up to you, take it or not!

439
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:29,804
But, there's no debt between us
from now on

440
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,650
I tell you, if I become rich
in the future

441
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,149
I will paid back to you

442
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:35,213
Today, you are wrong
in helping outsider

443
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,820
to beat your own people

444
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:37,750
Is it right?

445
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,983
What are you waiting for?
Take the money to Tony!

446
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,217
Cancel each other!

447
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,797
This is given you as bonus!

448
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:57,131
You are really something!
Playing trick in my place

449
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,976
You are also great!
You've make fun of me!

450
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:03,507
Wait a moment

451
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:05,678
Get away!

452
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:18,456
Tony, I'm employing you
to guard this place,

453
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:21,394
instead of inviting robber to rob me

454
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,056
What do you mean by that?

455
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,562
Boss, he is just losing temper!

456
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:43,853
The situation is bad now,

457
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:46,283
but you two still fighting each other

458
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,353
Are you treating me as a dead?

459
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:54,096
It's him who done wrong first
Borrowed my money

460
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,462
causing trouble in my place,
and robbing my boss

461
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,201
He was wrong in the
whole situation, Godfather!

462
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:03,703
You know he is crazy already,
so don't bother him

463
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:08,205
And you are doing too much,
taking advantage from him

464
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,008
You must know that he was
guarding that place!

465
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,047
Godfather, I'm giving back!

466
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,917
He want the money back,
so I paid the debt

467
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:20,353
We've made an equal exchange!

468
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,617
Equal?

469
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,624
What are you doing?

470
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,154
I'm the one who make decision till I die

471
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:27,629
So troublesome!

472
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:30,359
Now I tell you two,
you paid the installments every month

473
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:34,028
And the event is settled in this way
Make a vow!

474
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,537
What are you two doing?
I told you two to make agreement!

475
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:44,307
Have a hand-shake? Shake

476
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:52,554
Ah-kay, the traitor,
is a witness for the police

477
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,119
We cannot let this guy survived

478
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,952
Kill him before he go to court

479
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,354
What's your opinion?

480
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,734
The task is difficult!
Which one should we send?

481
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,602
I don't want outsider to take this case

482
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:07,669
Let's make it this way

483
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:10,774
You two, find some smart boys

484
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,072
to draw dead lots two days later

485
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:19,279
He's the one, brave, and haughty

486
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,715
Send your younger brother
if he wish to do it

487
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:24,715
I'll let him go!
I'll let him not paying my debt

488
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:26,153
His family can have subsidize
if he fail

489
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:27,683
Do you have the guts?

490
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:30,350
What? What did you say?
Frightening me?

491
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,825
Shut up!

492
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:34,957
Don't making fun of the followers

493
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,567
You and me are the bravest

494
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,130
It's either you or me to take this case

495
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:44,302
I'll do it if you don't,
say it and I'll take it!

496
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,012
You'll do if you don't speak up

497
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:54,250
Say you don't and admit that
you are a coward. And I'll take the case

498
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,317
Wake up!

499
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:59,247
Now you two are pushing me together?

500
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,483
OK! I kill you two first
and then I'll kill him

501
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:04,151
Not again! Stop quarrelling!

502
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,592
I have my plan in handling this case

503
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,024
All of you go out first

504
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:09,665
I leave now, Godfather!

505
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,059
I leave now, Godfather!

506
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,361
Ah-wah, come back!

507
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:20,971
I know that you and your brother
are good friends

508
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:24,773
But he is too crazy. Teach him...

509
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,111
or he will like a time-bomb beside you

510
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,718
and some day he will
cause you deadly trouble

511
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,521
I know, I have think of it

512
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:34,891
I want to find him a job

513
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,124
It's good to do it!

514
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,960
Fishballs...

515
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,963
That's all for today

516
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,535
Brother fly, brother wah is here

517
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:53,473
Hey, you deal with him

518
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,947
Fishballs...

519
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:06,147

520
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,689
Give me one

521
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:10,282
What?

522
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,860
Do you mean I can't do small business?

523
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:15,621
Do you know who I am?

524
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:22,569
You'll develop into big business

525
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:25,039
Yeah, I sell fishballs here today

526
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:27,971
Someday I'll sell bounbs in Middle East

527
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,770
Bull shit Police is coming

528
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,312
Wait a minute...

529
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,045
Police is coming

530
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:38,978
What the hell!

531
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:41,416
Does this cart belong to you. Fishball man

532
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,286
What's your name? Fishball man

533
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:44,553
What?

534
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:45,559
If you don't sell fishballs

535
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,186
You stand here with scissors?

536
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:48,889
How come so you're Fishball man

537
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:52,196
I'm just cutting my vibrissae

00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,537
So It's not your cart. Take it away

539
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,106
Take it

540
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,471
Hey! What are you doing?

541
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,838
The cart and the fishballs
are bought by money

542
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:02,468
Money doesn't matter. But pride matters

543
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:05,480
I'm not famous. But people know me

544
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:07,379
I don't want to sell fishballs

545
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:08,780
I want to hang around

546
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:14,718
Get lost, get away

547
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,258
I want you to have a job

548
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:19,891
I don't like selling fishballs

549
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,896
What do you like to sell?

550
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,233
You can't do anything

551
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,698
Just hang around

552
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:26,325
You are not anything

553
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,335
Yeah, I'm not anything

554
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,030
I can only sell fishballs

555
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:32,866
You ask me to do that

556
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:34,708
If I can't stand anymore

557
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:37,006
I'll put poison on the fishballs

558
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:42,849
It's good for you. Do you understand?

559
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:04,501
Hi, what a coincident!

560
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:06,070
Right! Really a coincident!

561
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,038
How are you?

562
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:20,617
Fine!... I have married!

563
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:31,599
Good! Are your husband
treating you good?

564
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:33,764
Quite good!

565
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,235
So heavy is the rain!
Who knows how long will I have to wait!

566
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,374
I'm waiting for my husband!

567
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:48,478
Have a cigarette?

568
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:50,079
I didn't smoke anymore!

569
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:05,196
It's not yours

570
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,800
I leave now!

571
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:20,150
Goodbye!

572
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:31,451
Is Ah-ngor here?

573
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:33,790
She is not here. Who are you?

574
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,067
It's alright. Thanks

575
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:13,059
Lady!

576
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:14,056
What's the matter?

577
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,187
Is Ah-ngor here?

578
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,994
I'm not sure! She had went to Kowloon
and still haven't returned

579
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:19,602
To Kowloon?

580
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:20,863
Yes!

581
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:23,569
Thank you

582
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:24,901
You're welcome

583
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,120
When did you arrive?

584
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:21,191
I just arrived

585
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:27,898
You look a bit fatter than before

586
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:32,400
A little bit

587
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,502
So are you

588
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,677
It's all because of him
He's my doctor

589
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,254
Would you stay up here tonight?

590
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:50,985
No... I'm going home now

591
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,502
Ah-ngor!

592
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:08,135
I just wanted to you tell that
I've found that glass

593
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:06,098
Miss Cheung called you just now

594
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:07,533
She said that she was going to
the pier of Silver-mine Bay

595
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,298
and told you to wait for her anyway

596
00:54:14,464 --> 00:54:15,522
You may go to sleep

597
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,233
and I`ll check in for you tomorrow

598
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:19,793
OK!

599
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,082
When do you go to work next morning?

600
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:44,387
Very early! I'll make breakfast for you

601
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:46,521
Good!

602
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:52,665
How long will you live in here?

603
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:56,165
It depends!

604
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:14,554
I leave now

605
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,052
I see you off

606
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,156
That's OK! It's near

607
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:24,526
Would you not go home tonight?

608
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:29,765
Why do you not visit me until now?

609
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,309
Because, I know myself clearly

610
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,648
I cannot promise you anything

611
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:50,351
If I'm not missing you,
I won't visit you today

612
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:53,689
If you don't visit me in these days

613
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:56,594
I will probably marry that doctor

614
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:04,430
Fish-ball guy, give me one dollar
of fish-ball with more dressing

615
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:16,311
Take it, why don't you take it?
You've said you want more dressing!

616
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:19,813
Take it or I'll get mad

617
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:26,789
Fish-ball guy? Damn you!

618
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:32,222
It won't, Mr. Fly!
Why are you so poor?

619
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:33,852
You don't have to sell fish-ball,
do you?

620
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:37,723
Poor guy

621
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:40,330
It must be your Big Brother
who told you to do so

622
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:43,363
You should leave your Big Brother

623
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:46,874
Look at my followers,
all dressed up!

624
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,910
Taking wireless telephone,
do you need that?

625
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:51,572
You bastard! Your Big Brother
sent you

626
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:53,205
selling fish-ball in the street

627
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:54,745
Working for me is better!

628
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:56,378
Escape

629
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,691
Escape for what?
You are a gangster!

630
00:58:02,826 --> 00:58:04,293
We have so crowd of gangsters here!
It's no need to afraid!

631
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:05,416
Beat him!

632
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,395
Don't be afraid!
You'll be alright even if you're in jail

633
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:11,694
Fight back at one
if someone beat you

634
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:13,234
Don't make us lose faces

635
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,428
You bastard, you...

636
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:17,767
Take it easy! It's OK!

637
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,206
You are not selling drugs,
just fish-ball

638
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,276
Something good to be seen

639
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,405
Beat him!

640
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:13,357
Hey, don't go you bastard

641
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,355
Don't go!

642
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:17,565
Go to hell, bastard!

643
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,677
Take him here

644
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,526
Finished drinking

645
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:51,295
Right! How many chicken wings
are there in two boxes

646
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,200
About two or three hundreds!

647
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:57,066
Two or three hundreds?

648
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:06,074
Hey, go back and tell your boss...

649
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:09,416
not to send you to take thing

650
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:10,610
so heavy alone

651
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:13,222
Or else, I'll give him one fist
for one wing in return

652
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:15,753
You are crazy

653
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:17,052
I am crazy?

654
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:21,957
Do you want me to help you?

655
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:24,464
It's OK! Anyway, I will quit!

656
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:29,598
Quit! Why?

657
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:33,072
I want to find a job in Kowloon

658
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:37,909
Good! It's doing me favour!
You can live in my house!

659
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,083
Don't say the second time

660
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,612
You can't deny it if
you say it twice

661
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:46,913
I'm not kidding!

662
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,050
I go out and
will never come back

663
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:02,937
Hey, what do you want to eat?

664
01:01:12,282 --> 01:01:14,409
Tell him that I'll go to
find him on time

665
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:17,111
If Fly has anything wrong,
he'll pay for it

666
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:18,584
It's finished!

667
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,148
What's the matter?

668
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,923
Nothing special! Fly has some problem
and I'm going out now

669
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,152
Would it be dangerous?

670
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:28,689
No, it'll be alright,
I'll be back tonight

671
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:40,398
Uncle Kwan, so many people here?

672
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:43,335
Ah-wah, It's Fly doing wrong
in this case

673
01:02:43,706 --> 01:02:47,164
But, I don't want to make it big
since we all know each other

674
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,944
Say something good to Tony
and the case will be settled

675
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,651
Tony, no matter what did Fly do,

676
01:03:03,793 --> 01:03:05,624
I'll punish him according to my rules

677
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,654
So please give me back my brother

678
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:10,960
Brother? What kind of brother?

679
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:14,097
Is this a brother?
You like to protect your brother

680
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:15,966
now you are protecting him!

681
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:20,670
Making fun of me?
You should protect him if he is good

682
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,608
Now you are just protecting a lump of shit
How can you be a Big Brother?

683
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:25,938
Tony, stop when you
have some advantage

684
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:26,946
Don't go too far

685
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,280
Uncle Kwan, save it for yourself!
I'm teaching him to grow up

686
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:33,412
His gangster can treat me
like this

687
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,817
Where can we stand
in the future then?

688
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,291
I'll release him surely!

689
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:42,358
But I must be satisfied
My requirement is low

690
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,399
Just say one sentence I like

691
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:45,762
I'll release him

692
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:52,639
Do you like to hear these words

693
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,072
Do you want your brother?

694
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,703
Ah-wah!

695
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:16,724
Big Brother

696
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,463
Are you alright?

697
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:27,465
Can you walk?

698
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:30,973
Yes, I can

699
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:43,417
Tell your follower to help him stand

700
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,749
Help him stand

701
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:49,990
No, I can stand by myself

702
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:20,354
I can walk by myself

703
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,243
Don't get near to me

704
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:37,843
Big Brother! Big Brother!

705
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:47,753
I tell you two,

706
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,222
this case can't be settled even
if you bring the highest King

707
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:08,135
Fly, this case certainly
won't end up this way

708
01:06:08,278 --> 01:06:09,506
You take this money

709
01:06:09,779 --> 01:06:12,179
And go back to Til-gang Lin
and wait for the case to fade out

710
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:13,475
I won't go!

711
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:14,549
I've made a vow

712
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:16,879
I won't go back to see my mother
if I do not succeed

713
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:22,624
OK, I go to Lantau Island with you

714
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,884
Why do you drive me away
so insistly?

715
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:28,259
Why? I don't want you to be
killed tomorrow

716
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:29,831
when you go out

717
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,325
You know he is just a mad dog

718
01:06:32,468 --> 01:06:34,595
Why don't you listen to me
not to provoke him?

719
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:37,863
It's him who provoked me,
I didn't provoke him

720
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:40,498
Don't you think I should just about it!
I have the power to play, haven't I?

721
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:43,406
Don't you have the power
to play with him?

722
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,780
If you have, you won't be beaten
so heavily and have face swollen up

723
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,977
Yes, I was beaten to
have face swollen

724
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:55,290
You are blaming me on losing you face,
you can leave me alone

725
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:06,097
No one force you to speak this
Don't speak it for fun

726
01:07:07,537 --> 01:07:09,061
I leave you alone now

727
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:10,862
If you are safe when
you go out tomorrow

728
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,406
I'll do anything for you

729
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,085
We all don't know what
will happen tomorrow

730
01:07:58,421 --> 01:07:59,479
Do you agree?

731
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,424
Let's go eating out!

732
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:15,996
Come along!

733
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:50,070
Beat him!

734
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,943
Fly, I twist your face
I twist you to death

735
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,714
I can plot against you
this time, can't I?

736
01:09:03,186 --> 01:09:04,585
Don't beat my Big Brother

737
01:09:04,654 --> 01:09:07,452
Leave him alone. Just beat me up

738
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,319
Not enough?

739
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:11,893
Let me beat your brother up.
That makes you two pairs

740
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:14,690
I want you to see
how I fool around your brother

741
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:16,162
Shit

742
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:21,395
fight back

743
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:28,002
I, Tony, is very justified

744
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:31,912
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth

745
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:40,446
Don't move!
It's the most sensitive place of you

746
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:42,815
I don't know where will you
eject if you move

747
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:53,733
Great! I'm lucky this time

748
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:57,267
Will I still be so lucky next time?

749
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:02,837
You are so excited

750
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,344
Do you want to join our party?

751
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,141
OK! Come join us! Come on!

752
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,979
You cannot move a little

753
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:14,283
You will eject on this brother

754
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:15,890
or that if you move

755
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:26,626
Don't let them look down on you?

756
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,034
If I cannot escape today

757
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:32,399
You must go back to Til-gang Lin

758
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:36,275
and never go out again

759
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,078
Tough guy

760
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,477
But whether you are tougher
than this thing

761
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:49,057
It's very hard... very hard...

762
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:52,856
Very, hard, isn't it.... very hard isn't it...

763
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:13,371
Look at you, bitch!

764
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:27,356
Another one collapsed

765
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:31,931
Damn you! You are pissing!

766
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:35,003
You should wear him a napkin
before taking him out

767
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:37,697
What kind of Big Brother are you?

768
01:11:39,976 --> 01:11:42,877
Right! Let your head down

769
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:45,803
so that you can see your face by the urine

770
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,248
And see why you are such a failure

771
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:54,915
Then, go back to your motherland
and farm with your Big Brother

772
01:11:56,425 --> 01:12:00,589
Urban road is not suitable for you?
Do you understand?

773
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,318
It's alright, alright!

774
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:37,197
Where... are you going?

775
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:47,237
I'm letting you lose face

776
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:50,306
Just treat that you've never know me

777
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:54,275
From now on I have no business
to do with you

778
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,351
Just leave me alone

779
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:09,183
Cousin

780
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,222
Open the door! Open up!

781
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:17,865
Open the door!

782
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:21,928
Hurry up! Open the door!

783
01:14:23,072 --> 01:14:23,731
What's the matter?

784
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,170
My cousin felt to the ground
and hurt himself

785
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,805
He's alright. Let him take a rest first

786
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:41,855
Where have you been last night?

787
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:45,455
I was staying with cousin

788
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,501
Lock the door when you leave!

789
01:14:57,673 --> 01:14:59,698
Give me a phone if anything happens

790
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,016
She's coming

791
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:49,052
Hey, receive guests

792
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:50,415
I'm sorry

793
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:51,924
You talk to each other first

794
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:05,832
Shooting in a police station
won't cause death penalty

795
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,803
Go to jail for several years

796
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,237
and become a man when you come out!

797
01:16:09,678 --> 01:16:11,669
Now people call you boy,

798
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:13,608
and they'll call you "sir" tomorrow

799
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:17,175
It's a chance to be famous!
Understanding?

800
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:18,882
Godfather. I'm afraid!

801
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:22,850
What? Afraid! You've drew the lots
and now you said you afraid

802
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:26,550
Every colleague will kill you
even if I let you go

803
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:30,358
Don't say so much! Keep going!

804
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,364
Godfather, I'm really afraid

805
01:16:32,735 --> 01:16:33,895
Chicken-hearted

806
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:40,032
Godfather, I've got something to talk to you

807
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:43,106
$23.5 with tin. Here is $30.
No change. Thanks

808
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,782
Ah-site

809
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:50,717
Brother

810
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:55,386
You're a different person after you
become a father

811
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,256
I have no choice.
I have a young wife and baby

812
01:17:01,597 --> 01:17:03,565
I'll do anything for living

813
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:08,797
Take the money

814
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:09,870
What are you doing?

815
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:11,632
I promised you

816
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:14,835
I'm sorry for last time

817
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:19,680
Please find a luxurious restaurant this time

818
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:24,415
And the lest of the money is for the
celebration of your son's first month

819
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:28,721
Remember,
don't let your wife's family look down on you

820
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,950
Do you understand?

821
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:31,752
How can you get the money?

822
01:17:31,894 --> 01:17:34,192
It's none of your business

823
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:49,068
I'll not around.
Call brother wah if you get in trouble

824
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:55,139
We didn't do any big thing

825
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:57,247
I feel ashamed

826
01:17:57,853 --> 01:17:58,478
Don't say that, brother

827
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,281
Listen to me

828
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:18,301
You may despise me in the past

829
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:27,378
Yes, I deserve that

830
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:37,885
But 2 days later,
when you read paper and watch TV

831
01:18:39,495 --> 01:18:43,864
You'll realize that I'm not an idiot

832
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:49,629
I can be your big brother

833
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:06,654
Remember to tell everyone you

834
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:14,789
Remember

835
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:40,749
Do these clothes suit you?

836
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:44,821
You didn't sleep the whole night!
Take a rest!

837
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:47,787
I can't sleep!

838
01:19:58,107 --> 01:20:02,737
Don't worry! Just slight injury!
It's alright!

839
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:06,371
You're lucky this time,
but what about the next time?

840
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,708
I've never thought about next time
in doing anything

841
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:16,724
Just one thing

842
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,221
I want to be with you next time
when I go touring

843
01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:27,664
I've said this twice
I won't take it back

844
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:29,526
What are your opinion?

845
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:45,012
Come on! Come to me!

846
01:21:37,472 --> 01:21:39,599
Brother Wah! My Big Brother
have given me a lot of money last night

847
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,677
and told me to hold banquet again

848
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:44,543
And he said I would know

849
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,272
he was not coward when I read
newspaper two days later,

850
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:47,939
Brother Wah, would you
come out at once

851
01:21:49,685 --> 01:21:51,880
Nobody will care about him
if you don't

852
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:04,326
I'm coming now

853
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:11,696
Going out again?

854
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:13,636
Nothing! Some kind of friend

855
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:15,333
called me out to talk a while

856
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:17,775
Right! I'll go to buy some medicine

857
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:19,346
in Silver Mine Bay

858
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:41,866
Do you want me to buy anything for you?

859
01:22:44,973 --> 01:22:46,406
I'll be back soon

860
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,956
Double eight

861
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:14,559
Miss Cheung called you

862
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,058
to tell you that medicine
was not important

863
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:19,892
But took care of yourself
and came back earlier

864
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:51,899
I win again

865
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:54,297
Give me money

866
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,733
Count it later

867
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:13,784
Why not tell me
you're changed your address, Tony?

868
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:16,889
Get up...

869
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:19,619
Do you know the game rules here?

870
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:23,022
You don't welcome me?

871
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:28,701
Give me money

872
01:25:29,371 --> 01:25:30,963
I don't want to be screwed up

873
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:36,969
You're been screwed up

874
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,304
Even you feel sorry,
your son will have no ass

875
01:25:39,448 --> 01:25:40,244
What are you talking?

876
01:25:40,382 --> 01:25:41,815
What? What?

877
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:43,944
Let him be the boss 2 days

878
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:47,213
He never be the boss.
He risks his life for that

879
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:50,756
Just 2 days

880
01:25:55,497 --> 01:25:56,156
Come on

881
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:58,459
seven tile of circles

882
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:11,337
Do you know the rules? Get another tile

883
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:17,450
Eight

884
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:29,290
I'm sorry

885
01:26:29,531 --> 01:26:31,021
Come on

886
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:34,665
Don't fool me

887
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:36,031
Leave him alone

888
01:26:36,972 --> 01:26:38,439
Let him be a two days hero

889
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:44,705
You're very patient. Goddam you!

890
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:57,647
You think I don't dare to beat you?

891
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,286
Come and beat me

892
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:01,022
If you beat me

893
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,293
I'll lie down

894
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:07,833
And you'll get into
big-mouth kay's trouble

895
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:13,669
Come on

896
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:15,107
Goddam you!

897
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,938
Shit

898
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:21,275
I'll shoot him if you move

899
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:25,119
Shoot him if you dare

900
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:27,614
Are you threatening me?

901
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:29,815
Pull the trigger and shoot me

902
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,698
Don't shoot

903
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:44,897
No...

904
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:53,378
Are you scared, Asshole?

905
01:27:53,515 --> 01:27:54,379
Let me blow off your head

906
01:27:54,516 --> 01:27:58,384
No..., don't shoot him

907
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,613
I wanted to shoot him

908
01:28:00,889 --> 01:28:03,187
But you're not worth to be shot

909
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:10,159
These are the money that I owe you.
Take it

910
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,694
You must take it.
Or you'll lose your chance

911
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:18,067
Take it. Or I'll shoot you

912
01:28:22,777 --> 01:28:24,244
Say thank you

913
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:29,249
Thank you

914
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,949
You're nothing even you wear suits
with call phone

915
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:39,921
Be the man of such brother

916
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:44,793
And you'll go to hell

917
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:57,943
We just want to make money

918
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:00,912
You mean I shouldn't take the money
even he pay me back?

919
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,380
Take it and go dancing

920
01:29:07,455 --> 01:29:10,618
You treat your brother like that

921
01:29:23,972 --> 01:29:28,068
I'm in grocery, mom. Do you come up?

922
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,502
What is going on?

923
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:31,574
Nothing. I know you don't like feeling hot

924
01:29:31,846 --> 01:29:33,677
So I buy you a air conditioner

925
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:37,915
We're installed it down there.
This one just leave in to you

926
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,645
I don't come up. Your father is here

927
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:44,989
He's your husband, not my father

928
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:22,520
When will you calm down
and stop escaping?

929
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:24,728
Why did you come out to see me?

930
01:30:26,267 --> 01:30:27,734
Why don't you leave me alone?

931
01:30:29,537 --> 01:30:32,597
Who will care for you if I don't?

932
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:41,812
Don't think that you'll be
famous after this task

933
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:49,684
Right, everybody will say
you are brave this time when you do that

934
01:30:51,459 --> 01:30:53,586
But no one will remember you next week

935
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:56,555
But what become of you then?

936
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:59,195
No one will know you later

937
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:13,880
I've done many things
for godfather also

938
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:21,320
I had received money for death
when I was fourteen

939
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:26,354
I was greater than a lot of people, right?

940
01:31:27,295 --> 01:31:30,196
But look at me!
I'm just an ordinary man now

941
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:34,028
Anyway, you were famous
for sometime!

942
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:38,628
But what about me?

943
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:44,002
No one notice me and
you are happy about that

944
01:31:44,746 --> 01:31:46,509
People look down upon
everything of me

945
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:49,681
They even said that
I was a dog beneath you ass

946
01:31:49,818 --> 01:31:51,445
Do you know that?

947
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:57,858
I would rather be three-minute hero

948
01:31:57,992 --> 01:32:00,358
I don't want to be a fly for all my life

949
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:04,959
Let me finish a great task on my own,
would you?

950
01:32:05,733 --> 01:32:07,667
Just for this time

951
01:32:21,749 --> 01:32:27,517
OK! Did you decide to go?

952
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:30,552
I'll go with you if you want to

953
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:33,451
I'll take revenge for you
if you are shoot down

954
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:36,564
Don't treat me so good,
would you?

955
01:32:40,735 --> 01:32:42,828
I can't pay you back

956
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:46,036
I don't want to talk
so much with you

957
01:32:46,174 --> 01:32:48,438
Just say it, and I'll go with you

958
01:32:49,978 --> 01:32:53,937
We'll go to Lantau Island
if you say no

959
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:59,386
I'll settle anything following

960
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:10,321
OK! OK! OK!

961
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,023
I go back with you

962
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:29,075
Ah-choi, Ah-choi

963
01:33:29,217 --> 01:33:30,980
Don't look down upon other

964
01:33:31,486 --> 01:33:33,386
He used to be great and famous
but now he was finished

965
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:38,716
Don't be so stingily!
Give something to Ah-cho
