1
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,055
<i>Saigon.</i>

2
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,807
<i>Shit.</i>

3
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,561
<i>I'm still only in Saigon.</i>

4
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,615
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up</i>
<i>back in the jungle.</i>

5
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,333
<i>When I was home after my first tour,</i>
<i>it was worse.</i>

6
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,260
<i>I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.</i>

7
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,356
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife</i>
<i>until I said yes to a divorce.</i>

8
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,070
<i>When I was here, I wanted to be there.</i>

9
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,867
<i>When I was there, all I could think of</i>
<i>was getting back into the jungle.</i>

10
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,123
<i>I'm here a week now.</i>

11
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,670
<i>Waiting for a mission.</i>

12
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,297
<i>Getting softer.</i>

13
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,806
<i>Every minute I stay in this room,</i>
<i>I get weaker.</i>

14
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,308
<i>And every minute</i>
<i>Charlie squats in the bush,</i>

15
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,060
<i>he gets stronger.</i>

16
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,028
<i>Each time I looked around,</i>
<i>the walls moved in a little tighter.</i>

17
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,380
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants.</i>

18
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,174
<i>I wanted a mission.</i>

19
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,511
<i>And for my sins, they gave me one.</i>

20
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,431
<i>Brought it up to me like room service.</i>

21
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,768
Captain Willard, are you in there?

22
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,104
Yeah, I'm coming.

23
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,857
<i>It was a real choice mission.</i>

24
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,444
<i>And when it was over,</i>
<i>I'd never want another.</i>

25
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,706
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

26
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,708
What does it look like?

27
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,636
- Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

28
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,263
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,224
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

30
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,479
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.

31
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,484
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

32
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,569
What'd I do?

33
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,863
There's no charges, Captain.

34
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,867
You have orders to report
to COMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.

35
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,953
- I see.
- All right?

36
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,539
- Nha Trang for me?
- That's right.

37
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,168
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

38
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,087
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

39
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,842
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

40
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,220
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

41
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,096
- Don't be an ass.
- Get hold of him good.

42
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,349
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

43
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,517
- In we go.
- Now stand underneath this, Captain.

44
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,618
<i>I was going to the worst place in the world</i>
<i>and I didn't even know it yet.</i>

45
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,622
Weeks away
<i>and hundreds of miles up a river</i>

46
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,708
<i>that snaked through the war</i>

48
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,630
Insult me again and I'll kick your ass...

49
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,716
<i>It was no accident</i>
<i>that I got to be the caretaker</i>

51
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>any more than being back in Saigon</i>

52
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,144
<i>There is no way to tell his story</i>
<i>without telling my own.</i>

53
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,897
<i>And if his story is really a confession...</i>

54
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,148
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

55
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,233
<i>... then so is mine.</i>

56
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,528
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

57
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,240
- Stand at ease.
- General.

58
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,619
Do you want a cigarette?

59
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,454
No, thank you, sir.

60
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,500
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

61
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,710
No, sir.

62
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,671
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

63
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,172
Not personally.

64
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,759
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

65
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,969
Yes, sir, I have.

66
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,512
Your report specifies Intelligence,

67
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,639
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, I Corps.

68
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,517
I'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

69
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,237
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

70
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,782
No, sir.

71
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,535
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector,

72
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,330
Quang Tri Province, June 18, 1968?

73
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,375
Captain?

74
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,590
Sir, I am unaware
of any such activity or operation,

75
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,929
nor would I be disposed
to discuss such an operation

76
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,474
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

77
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,613
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

78
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,824
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

79
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,494
I noticed that you have

80
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,914
a bad hand, there. Are you wounded?

81
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,625
I had a little fishing accident on R&R, sir.

82
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,252
- Fishing on R&R?
- Yes, sir.

83
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

84
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,466
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

85
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,510
Well, let's see what we have here.

86
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,013
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

87
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,309
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

88
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,063
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

89
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,528
Captain, I don't know
how you feel about this shrimp,

90
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,863
but if you'll eat it,

91
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,158
you'll never have to prove your courage
in any other way.

92
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,204
Right, well,
why don't I just take a piece here?

93
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,625
Captain, you've heard
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

94
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,255
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.

95
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,215
Jesus.

96
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,801
Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.

97
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,971
Luke, would you play that tape
for the Captain, please?

98
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,516
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

99
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,729
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,</i>
<i>sector Peter Victor King.</i>

00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,898
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

101
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,652
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

102

00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>I do hate them.</i>

127
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,703
Walt Kurtz was one of the most
outstanding officers

128
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,914
this country's ever produced.

129
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,417
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

130
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,796
And he was a good man, too.

131
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,798
A humanitarian man.

132
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,926
A man of wit and humor.

133
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,471
He joined the Special Forces.

134
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,350
And after that,

135
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,188
his ideas, methods,

136
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,942
became

137
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,779
unsound.

138
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,828
Unsound.

139
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,754
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this Montagnard army of his

140
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,592
that worship the man like a god.

141
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,804
And follow every order, however ridiculous.

142
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,310
Well, I have some other shocking news
to tell you.

143
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,354
Colonel Kurtz is about to be

144
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,024
arrested for murder.

145
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,902
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

146
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,032
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese intelligence agents.

147
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,784
Men he believed were double agents.

148
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,872
So he took matters into his own hands.

149
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,126
Well, you see, Willard,

150
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,296
in this war, things get

151
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,674
confused out there.

152
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,095
Power, ideals, the old morality,

153
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,848
and practical military necessity.

154
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,311
But out there with these natives,

155
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,398
it must be a temptation

156
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,443
to be God.

157
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,408
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart

158
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,371
between the rational and the irrational,

159
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,082
between good and evil.

160
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,960
And good does not always triumph.

161
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,881
Sometimes

162
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,218
the dark side

163
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:56,264
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

164
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,602
Every man has got a breaking point.

165
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,230
You and I have them.

166
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,067
Walt Kurtz has reached his,

167
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,780
and very obviously he has gone insane.

168
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,922
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

169
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,139
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat,

170
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,935
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

171
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,272
follow it, learn what you can
along the way.

172
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,191
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team

173
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,861
by whatever means available

174
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,780
and terminate the Colonel's command.

175
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,497
Terminate the Colonel?

176
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,003
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

177
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:13,800
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct.

178
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,137
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

179
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,975
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

180
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,147
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist,

181
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,817
nor will it ever exist.

182
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,834
<i>How many people had I already killed?</i>

183
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>There were those six</i>
<i>that I knew about for sure.</i>

184
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,883
<i>Close enough to blow their last breath</i>
<i>in my face.</i>

185
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,182
<i>But this time it was an American</i>
<i>and an officer.</i>

186
00:19:55,736 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>That wasn't supposed to make</i>
<i>any difference to me, but it did.</i>

187
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,162
<i>Shit, charging a man with murder</i>
<i>in this place</i>

188
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,833
<i>was like handing out speeding tickets</i>
<i>at the Indy 500.</i>

189
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,089
<i>I took the mission.</i>
<i>What the hell else was I gonna do?</i>

190
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>But I really didn't know</i>
<i>what I'd do when I found him.</i>

191
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,937
Did you check the tank?

192
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,731
Yeah.

193
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,944
<i>I was being ferried down the coast</i>
<i>in a Navy PBR.</i>

194
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:42,407
<i>A type of plastic patrol boat,</i>
<i>a pretty common sight on the rivers.</i>

195
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,118
<i>They said it was a good way</i>
<i>to pick up information and move</i>

196
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,454
<i>without drawing a lot of attention.</i>

197
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,456
<i>And that was okay.</i>

198
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,875
<i>I needed the air and the time.</i>

199
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,128
<i>Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.</i>

200
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,047
Morning, Captain.

201
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,344
<i>The crew were mostlyjust kids.</i>

202
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,805
<i>Rock 'n' rollers</i>
<i>with one foot in their graves.</i>

203
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,225
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

204
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,022
<i>The machinist, the one they called Chef,</i>
<i>was from New Orleans.</i>

205
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,650
<i>He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.</i>

206
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,486
<i>Probably wrapped too tight</i>
<i>for New Orleans.</i>

207
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,238
<i>Lance, on the forward.50s,</i>
<i>was a famous surfer</i>

208
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,616
<i>from the beaches south of LA.</i>

209
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,328
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe</i>
<i>he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.</i>

210
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,793
<i>Clean, Mr. Clean,</i>
<i>was from some South Bronx shithole,</i>

211
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,961
<i>and I think the light and space of Vietnam</i>

212
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,297
<i>really put the zap on his head.</i>

213
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,552
<i>Then there was Phillips, the Chief.</i>

214
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,556
<i>It might have been my mission,</i>
<i>but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.</i>

215
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,892
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

216
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,019
to get into the Nung River.

217
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,855
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

218
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,025
Don't worry about it.

219
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,361
Don't smoke.

220
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,449
You know,
I've pulled a few special ops in here.

221
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,535
About six months ago,

222
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,455
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

223
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,667
He was regular Army, too.

224
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,797
I heard he shot himself in the head.

225
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,315
<i>Good morning, Vietnam.</i>
<i>I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.</i>

226
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,278
<i>It's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon</i>
<i>right now, also very humid.</i>

227
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,488
<i>And we have an important message</i>
<i>for all Gls</i>

228
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,074
<i>who are living off base</i>
<i>from the Mayor of Saigon.</i>

229
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,159
Yeah!

230
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,995
<i>He'd like you to hang your laundry up</i>
<i>indoors instead of on the windowsills.</i>

231
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
<i>The Mayor wants you</i>
<i>to keep Saigon beautiful.</i>

232
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>And now, here's another blast from the past</i>

233
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,753
<i>going out to big Sam</i>
<i>who's all alone out there</i>

234
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,921
<i>with the First Battalion, 35th Infantry,</i>

235
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:06,301
<i>and dedicated by the fire team</i>
<i>at An Khe to their groovy CO...</i>

236
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,012
- The Rolling Stones, Satisfaction.
- All right!

237
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,724
Work out, Clean!

238
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,310
Get down, Bubba!

239
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,237
Hang on, Lance!

240
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,121
Get down, Bubba!

241
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,131
Yeah!

242
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,101
I see you is right on target.

243
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,816
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

244
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,150
All right!

245
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,653
Look out, Lance!

246
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,381
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>they handed me the wrong dossier.</i>

247
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,676
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>they wanted this man dead.</i>

248
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,180
<i>Third-generation West Point,</i>
<i>top of his class,</i>

249
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:39,936
<i>Korea, Airborne,</i>
<i>about 1,000 decorations, et cetera, et cetera.</i>

250
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:47,569
<i>I had heard his voice on the tape</i>
<i>and it really put the hook in me,</i>

251
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,990
<i>but I couldn't connect up</i>
<i>that voice with this man.</i>

252
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,958
<i>Like they said, he had an impressive career.</i>

253
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,711
<i>Maybe too impressive.</i>

254
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,297
<i>I mean, perfect.</i>

255
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,218
<i>He was being groomed</i>
<i>for one of the top slots in the corporation,</i>

256
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,138
<i>General, Chief of Staff, anything.</i>

257
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,477
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour</i>
<i>with advisory command in Vietnam</i>

258
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,605
<i>and things started to slip.</i>

259
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:28,234
<i>His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff</i>
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.</i>

260
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,114
<i>Seems they didn't dig</i>
<i>what he had to tell them.</i>

261
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>During the next few months,</i>
<i>he made three requests for transfer</i>

262
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:42,457
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia,</i>
<i>and was finally accepted.</i>

263
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,669
<i>Airborne?</i>

264
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,174
<i>He was 38 years old.</i>

265
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,345
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

266
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,934
<i>1966, joins Special Forces,</i>

267
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,436
<i>returns Vietnam.</i>

268
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,190
- Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.

269
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,193
- What's that?
- B-52 strike.

270
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,111
Man.

271
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,529
- What's that?
- Arc light.

272
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,699
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

273
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,785
Charlie don't never see them
or hear them, man.

274
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,079
- There they are.
- Concussion will suck the air

275
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,538
out of your damn lungs.

276
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,209
- Something terrible is gonna happen.
- Smoke!

277
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,044
Secondary burning.

278
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,046
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

279
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,130
Let's have a look, Chief.

280
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,428
<i>It was the air cav, First of the Ninth.</i>

281
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:38,972
That's them.

282
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,391
<i>Our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.</i>

283
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:45,269
<i>But they were supposed to be</i>
<i>waiting for us another 30 km ahead.</i>

284
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:50,108
<i>Well, Airmobile,</i>
<i>those boys just couldn't stay put.</i>

285
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,707
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

286
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,470
<i>First of the Ninth</i>
<i>was an old cavalry division</i>

287
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,099
<i>that had cashed in its horses for choppers</i>
<i>and gone tear-assing around Nam</i>

288
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,018
<i>looking for the shit.</i>

289
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,355
<i>They'd given Charlie a few surprises</i>
<i>in their time here.</i>

290
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,901
<i>What they were mopping up now</i>
<i>hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.</i>

291
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,488
Just keep running by. Run for television.

292
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,991
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on! Keep going.

293
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,659
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

294
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,827
Don't look at the camera.

295
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,121
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

296
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,915
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through!

297
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,501
Go through! Just go by! Keep on going!

298
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,464
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

299
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,489
Where can I find the CO?

300
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,032
The Colonel's over there!

301
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,454
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

302
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,997
Captain Willard!

303
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,918
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

304
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,671
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you
on the requirements of my mission.

305
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,382
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

306
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,219
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

307
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,221
- We'll see what we can do, but...
- Colonel.

308
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,139
...just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

309
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,898
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

310
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:58,069
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds,

311
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,823
six of clubs, eight of spades.

312
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,159
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

313
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,036
Four of diamonds.

314
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,958
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

315
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,128
- What?
- Death cards!

316
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,839
- Death?
- It lets Charlie know who did this.

317
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,095
- Cheer up, son.
<i>- We will not hurt or harm you.</i>

318
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,806
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

319
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,976
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

320
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,607
<i>- We are here to extend a welcome hand...</i>
- Come on.

321
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,734
<i>...to those of you who would like...</i>
- Everybody in?

322
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,446
<i>... to return to the arms</i>
<i>of the South Vietnamese government.</i>

323
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,533
Hurry up!

324
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,078
Move it out!

325
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:54,876
<i>This is an area that is controlled</i>
<i>by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.</i>

326
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,253
Hey! What's this?

327
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,755
What is this?

328
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,800
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

329
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,178
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

330
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,762
- is that pot lid.
- Yeah?

331
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,472
What does he have to say?

332
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,184
This soldier is dirty VC.

333
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,687
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

334
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,399
Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

335
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,527
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

336
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,447
Get out of here! I'll kick your fucking ass!

337
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,948
He killed a lot of our people!

338
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,868
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts strapped on him

339
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,786
can drink from my canteen any day!

340
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,665
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors
is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

341
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,543
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

342
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,463
Yeah? Here.

343
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,799
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

344
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,806
- What's your name, sailor?
- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir!

345
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,018
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...
- Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

346
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,647
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.

347
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,066
I've admired your nose riding for years.

348
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,110
I like your cutback, too.
I think you have the best cutback there is.

349
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,905
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

350
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

351
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,076
- This guy with you?
- Yeah.

352
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,412
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

353
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,122
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu.

354
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,333
- John, hi. Far out.
- Pretty solid surfers.

355
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,210
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

356
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,711
No way.

357
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,548
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

358
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,760
fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass.

359
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,221
- Been riding since you got here?
- No way.

360
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,431
I haven't surfed since I been here.

361
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,727
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

362
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,647
Through him in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

363
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,401
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

364
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:47,446
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
in the words our savior gave us.

365
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,993
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

366
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,704
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

367
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,914
on Earth as it is in heaven.

368
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,125
Give us this day our daily bread...

369
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,046
<i>... as we forgive those</i>
<i>who trespass against us.</i>

370
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,591
<i>Lead us not into temptation,</i>
<i>but deliver us from evil.</i>

371
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,646
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty good day</i>
<i>for himself.</i>

372
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,065
<i>They choppered in the T-bones</i>
<i>and the beer</i>

373
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>and turned the LZ into a beach party.</i>

374
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,488
<i>The more they tried</i>
<i>to make it just like home,</i>

375
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,116
<i>the more they made everybody miss it.</i>

376
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,578
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

377
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,211
<i>Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.</i>

378
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,549
<i>He loved his boys</i>
<i>and you felt safe with him.</i>

379
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,219
<i>He was one of those guys</i>
<i>that had that weird light around him.</i>

380
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,639
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna get</i>
<i>so much as a scratch here.</i>

381
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,560
What happened to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

382
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,278
Airborne.

383
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,325
Sir, two places we can get into the river...

384
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,119
- Yeah.
...here and here.

385
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,663
It's a pretty wide delta,
but these are the only two spots

386
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,998
I'm really sure of.

387
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,252
Well, that village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy, Willard.

388
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,005
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy,

389
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,840
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

390
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,718
I lost a few recon ships in there
now and again.

391
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,262
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

392
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,515
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

393
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,726
Damn gook names all sound the same.

394
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,439
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

395
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,316
That's a fantastic peak.

396
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,027
- Peak?
- About six foot.

397
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,322
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak.
It's got both the long right and left slide

398
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,533
with a bowl section. It's unbelievable.

399
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,701
It's just tube city.

400
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,499
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

401
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,127
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

402
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,170
It's all goddamn beach break.

403
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,256
It's really hairy in there, sir.
That's where we lost McDonald.

404
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,590
They shot the hell out of us there.

405
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,427
That's Charlie's point.

406
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,347
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

407
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,391
There's always a good offshore breeze
in the morning.

408
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,601
We may not be able to get the boat in.

409
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,146
The draft at the mouth of that river
may be too shallow.

410
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,525
We'll pick your boat up and put it down
like a baby, right where you want it.

411
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,778
This is the First of the Ninth air cav, son.
Airmobile.

412
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,198
I can take that point and hold it
just as long as I like.

413
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,452
And you can get any place up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

414
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,662
Hell, a six-foot peak.

415
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,583
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

416
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,751
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for you,

417
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,587
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

418
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,173
- I don't know, sir, it's...
- What is it, soldier?

419
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,092
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

420
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,178
Charlie don't surf!

421
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,163
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

422
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,667
Hey, man! They're picking up the boat!

423
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:35,341
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

424
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,470
All right, son, let her rip.

425
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,263
Let's go!

426
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,183
I never have gotten used to a light board,
and I can't get used to one.

427
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,894
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

428
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,440
- You prefer a heavy or a light board?
- Heavier.

429
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,733
- Really?
- Yeah!

430
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,860
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

431
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,154
You can't ride the nose on those things.

432
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,574
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

433
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,036
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

434
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,746
Assume attack formation.

435
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,540
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.</i>
<i>Okay, we're going in.</i>

436
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,544
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

437
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,671
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

438
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,466
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

439
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,053
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

440
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,764
Hey, they're gonna play music!

441
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,315
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

442
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,069
So we don't get our balls blown off.

443
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:16,168
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on psy war op, make it loud.

444
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,047
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

445
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,136
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

446
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,964
Run, Charlie!

447
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,777
<i>We got some...</i>
<i>There's more and more down there.</i>

448
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,530
Look out, automatic.50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

449
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,784
I've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

450
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,036
<i>All right, this is Fox Five. We're going in.</i>

451
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,175
<i>- All right. What a shot.</i>
- Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

452
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,719
Get you a case of beer for that.

453
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,868
6-4-1-0, we're over the village right now.

454
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,828
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

455
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:23,081
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Well done, hawks. Well done.

456
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,418
I want some 20 Mike-Mike Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

457
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,337
Ripple the shit out of them.

458
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,839
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
.50 caliber onboard.

459
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,592
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

460
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,471
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

461
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,014
Don't these people ever give up?

462
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,519
Nice shot, Bill.

463
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,981
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

464
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:53,362
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

465
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,405
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

466
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,284
Get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right.
It's just a flare.

467
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,621
- Everybody all right? Lance, you all right?
- I'm fine!

468
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,929
Get down!

469
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:43,704
I'm not going! I'm not going! I'm not going!

470
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,303
<i>We just got a secondary</i>
<i>down there in the plaza.</i>

471
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,265
<i>Blue Three, Blue Four,</i>
<i>hold out over position...</i>

472
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,184
<i>Duke Six, Duke Six,</i>
<i>we've got wounded down there.</i>

473
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,192
My God! Oh, my God!

474
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,196
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

475
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,490
Please! Help me!

476
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,912
- Please, God! Help me!
- Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

477
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,082
- Let's give him some morphine.
- My God! My God!

478
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,462
- 0-3-7-7-4-2.
- Where's that duster?

479
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,298
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

480
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,924
I want my men out.

481
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,010
<i>Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.</i>

482
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:44,056
<i>This is 10-10. We're gonna be in,</i>
<i>throw them on and get out...</i>

483
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,622
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

484
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,502
<i>Jesus! The whole goddamn thing just...</i>

485
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,629
<i>- She blew the shit out of...</i>
- Fucking savages.

486
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,675
<i>- Can I get a medevac?</i>
- What's going on... Christ, she's a sapper.

487
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,844
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny.

488
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,930
Go in there.
Put that right skid right up her ass.

489
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,019
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

490
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,396
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over...

491
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,817
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

492
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,570
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.</i>
<i>My tail rotor's out. I got control.</i>

493
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,207
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man.

494
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,710
- No, no! The waves! The waves!
- Right.

495
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,547
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

496
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,008
Look! Good six-foot swells!

497
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,492
Come here, Lance.

498
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,913
Incoming!

499
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,546
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

500
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,633
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

501
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,679
Come here! Come here!

502
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,934
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

503
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,812
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

504
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,522
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

505
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,941
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,444
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

507
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,529
That clear? Now get going.

508
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,200
I'll cover for them.
And bring a board for Lance!

509
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,578
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.

510
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,498
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait
to get out there.

511
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,626
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

512
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,588
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

513
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,798
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.

514
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,676
- Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

515
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,973
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

516
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,311
You wanna wait here for six hours?

517
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,775
Yo! Hey! Chief!

518
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,869
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding. Come on!</i>

519
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,705
<i>- Let's go, dickheads, take off!</i>
- God damn it!

520
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,500
Don't you think it's a little risky for R&R?

521
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:03,171
If I say it's safe to surf this beach, Captain,
it's safe to surf this beach!

522
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:07,634
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.

523
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,097
Give me that RT, soldier.

524
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,850
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

525
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,979
God damn it! I want that tree line bombed!

526
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,773
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.</i>
<i>Dove One-Three, stand by.</i>

527
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,775
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son!</i>

528
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,527
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three, roger.</i>

529
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,570
<i>They need some napalm</i>
<i>down there in the tree line.</i>

530
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,406
<i>Can you guys push ground</i>
<i>and put it down there?</i>

531
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,366
<i>Right, One-Three.</i>
<i>We're fixing to fuck with them.</i>

532
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,077
<i>- What's the target?</i>
<i>- We're trying to suppress some mortar fire</i>

533
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,662
<i>off the tree line down there.</i>

534
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,373
<i>- Roger. Here we come.</i>
<i>- Good, give it all you got.</i>

535
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,792
<i>Bring in all your ships.</i>

536
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,045
Don't worry. We're gonna have this place

537
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,922
cleaned up and ready for us in a jiffy, son.

538
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,173
Don't you worry.

539
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,676
<i>Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three.</i>

540
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,554
<i>The jets are inbound now.</i>
<i>You got about 30 seconds to on-station.</i>

541
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,432
<i>Get your people back and heads down.</i>
<i>This is gonna be a big one.</i>

542
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,206
You smell that?

543
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,834
- Do you smell that?
- What?

544
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,378
Napalm, son.

545
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,214
Nothing else in the world smells like that.

546
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,633
Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!

547
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,138
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

548
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,308
You know, one time
we had a hill bombed for 12 hours.

549
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,769
And when it was all over, I walked up.

550
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,981
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

551
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,278
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

552
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:52,030
The whole hill,

553
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,866
it smelled like

554
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,828
victory.

555
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,336
Someday this war's gonna end.

556
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,902
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

557
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,362
Come on. Let's get high.

558
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,447
- Want to smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

559
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,741
<i>Someday this war's gonna end.</i>

560
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,578
<i>That would be just fine</i>
<i>with the boys on the boat.</i>

561
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,956
<i>They weren't looking</i>
<i>for anything more than a way home.</i>

562
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,499
Captain?

563
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:50,630
<i>Trouble is, I'd been back there</i>
<i>and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.</i>

564
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,761
Buddha time, here.

565
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,015
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

566
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,481
<i>If that's how Kilgore fought the war,</i>

567
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,110
<i>I began to wonder</i>
<i>what they really had against Kurtz.</i>

568
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,280
<i>It wasn't just insanity and murder.</i>

569
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,117
<i>There was enough of that</i>
<i>to go around for everyone.</i>

570
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,337
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

571
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,881
I'm not here.

572
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,135
I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangos.

573
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,804
I meet Raquel Welch.

574
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,851
I make a nice mango cream pudding,

575
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,940
kind of spread it around on us.

576
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,819
Hey, Captain, I wanna get some mangoes.

577
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,530
Just don't go out there by yourself.

578
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,492
You don't want to go in there alone.

579
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,413
- Not unless you really know the territory.
- Any poisonous snakes around here?

580
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,042
Fuck it. I'm gonna go eat some mango.

581
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,135
Chef?

582
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,638
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

583
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,766
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

584
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:28,436
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

585
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,899
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

586
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:39,531
Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier,

587
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,491
a great saucier.

588
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,495
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

589
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,043
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

590
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:03,054
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

591
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,392
But then I got orders for my physical.

592
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,866
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

593
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,245
A cook school, that did it.

594
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:31,291
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't want to hear about that.

595
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:37,672
They lined us up in front of 100 yards
of prime rib.

596
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,050
All of us lined up, looking at it.

597
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,803
Magnificent meat, really.

598
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,306
Beautifully marbled.

599
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:54,647
Next thing, they're throwing the meat
into these big cauldrons. All of it, boiling it.

600
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,318
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

601
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,863
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

602
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,950
That's when I applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the...

603
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,535
What is it?

604
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:52,872
Charlie?

605
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,468
It's a tiger!

606
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,848
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

607
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,560
Battle stations. Lance, up front!
On the.60, Clean!

608
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,895
- Got it, man.
- Holy shit.

609
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,816
- Chef, come on!
- Fucking tiger!

610
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,026
- Captain, come on!
- What's happening?

611
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,570
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

612
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,824
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

613
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,660
- Bring that.60 forward!
- Never get out of the boat!

614
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,082
Never get out of the boat!
I gotta remember. Never get out of the boat.

615
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,671
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

616
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,548
- What?
- A fucking tiger!

617
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,092
- Tiger?
- Yes! I've had it!

618
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,804
I've had the whole
goddamn fucking shit, man!

619
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:54,392
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because I'm fucking bugging out.

620
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,269
I didn't come here for this.

621
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,021
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.

622
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,942
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

623
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,823
All I wanted to do was fucking cook!
I just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!

624
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,618
- It's all right. It's all right.
- What happened, bro?

625
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,664
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

626
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,125
- All right. It's gonna be all right.
- You're all right.

627
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,628
It's gonna be all right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

628
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,464
Never get out of the fucking boat.

629
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,800
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

630
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,763
<i>Never get out of the boat.</i>

631
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,307
<i>Absolutely goddamn right.</i>

632
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,478
<i>Unless you were going all the way.</i>

633
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,610
<i>Kurtz got off the boat.</i>

634
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,530
<i>He split from the whole fucking program.</i>

635
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:57,622
<i>How did that happen?</i>
<i>What did he see here that first tour?</i>

636
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,756
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old.</i>

637
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:12,553
<i>If you joined the Green Berets, there was</i>
<i>no way you'd ever get above colonel.</i>

638
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,848
<i>Kurtz knew what he was giving up.</i>

639
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:21,813
<i>And the more I read and began</i>
<i>to understand, the more I admired him.</i>

640
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,817
<i>His family and friends</i>
<i>couldn't understand it,</i>

641
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,985
<i>and they couldn't talk him out of it.</i>

642
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,407
<i>He had to apply three times</i>
<i>and he put up with a ton of shit.</i>

643
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:36,536
<i>But when he threatened to resign,</i>
<i>they gave it to him.</i>

644
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:44,001
<i>The next youngest guy in his class</i>
<i>was half his age.</i>

645
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,630
<i>They must have thought he was some</i>
<i>far-out old man,</i>

646
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,215
<i>humping it over that course.</i>

647
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,886
<i>I did it when I was 19</i>
<i>and it damn near wasted me.</i>

648
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:01,394
<i>A tough motherfucker. He finished it.</i>

649
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:09,861
<i>He could have gone for General,</i>
<i>but he went for himself instead.</i>

650
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,866
<i>"Dear Eva,</i>

<i>He received no official clearance.</i>
<i>He just thought it up and did it.</i>

00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,369
<i>What balls.</i>

662
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,416

663

<i>But after the press got a hold of it,</i>
<i>they promoted him to full colonel instead.</i>

664

<i>Man, the bullshit piled up so fast</i>

666

This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

667
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,173
Expecting us this time?

668
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,760

- Everything goes back up into the truck.
- What?

672

We gotta get all that stuff up.

673

Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

674
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,291
- Let's go!
- I bet you we can score up here.

675
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,169
Man, check out the bikes, Lance.

676
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,965
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

677
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,426
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, sukiyaki.

678
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,428
Yeah, man. This is something.

679

- Please!
- This must be the guy.

680

Right over there.

Sergeant. Sergeant?

682
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,989
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

683
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,908
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all.

684
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,077
- What do you want?
- Can I get some Panama Red with it?

685
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:08,039
Panama Red. Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

686

- Sergeant?
- Destination?

687

- I don't have no destination.
- I can't do a goddamn thing

688
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,420
without a destination.
You got a destination?

689
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,588
- Sergeant.
- I need diesel fuel.

690
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,715
All right. You got a destination?
I need a destination.

691

I can't do a goddamn thing

692
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,845
Sarge, these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

693
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,431
I carry priority papers
from COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

694
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,517
Okay, right, sir.
Hey, listen, it's a real big night.

695
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,935
Eight bucks for that...

696
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,856
All right. Damn.

697
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,610
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

698
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,863
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

699
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,492
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

700
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,579
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

701
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,041
Hey, listen, would you guys like some seats,
some press box seats for the show?

702
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,002
You want those?
The show, man. The show out here.

703
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,838
- Bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

704
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,715
You got it. You gonna be here?

705
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,845
Listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?

706

718
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,105
What's the matter?

719
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,150
They've got them here tonight.

720
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,616

Hey, lover! You want us to come over?

729

<i>Charlie didn't get much USO.</i>

<i>He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.</i>

740

<i>His idea of great R&R</i>
<i>was cold rice and a little rat meat.</i>

<i>death or victory.</i>

- Believe what?

746

Miss December.
I gotta come here and find her here?

747

- Shit.
- Holy shit.

Get out! I got it! Yeah! I got it!

01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,694
Lance, get down!

754
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,487
Put that fucker out, man!

755
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,538
What the fuck they think they're doing?

756
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,316
<i>Late summer, autumn 1968.</i>

757
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:18,695
<i>Kurtz's patrols in the highlands</i>
<i>coming under frequent ambush.</i>

758
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,615
<i>The camp started falling apart.</i>

759
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,665
<i>November.</i>

760
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:34,002
<i>Kurtz orders assassination of three</i>
<i>Vietnamese men and one woman.</i>

761
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,674
<i>Two of the men were colonels</i>
<i>in the South Vietnamese army.</i>

762
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,721
<i>Enemy activity in his old sector</i>
<i>dropped off to nothing.</i>

763
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,269
<i>Guess he must have hit</i>
<i>the right four people.</i>

764
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,276
<i>He joined the Special Forces.</i>
<i>And after that, his...</i>

765
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,114
<i>The Army tried one last time</i>
<i>to bring him back into the fold.</i>

766
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,240
<i>... methods...</i>

767
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,118
<i>And if he'd pulled over,</i>
<i>it all would have been forgotten.</i>

768
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,244
<i>... unsound.</i>

769
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,872
<i>- But he kept going...</i>
<i>- Now he's crossed into Cambodia...</i>

770
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,791
<i>... and he kept winning it his way...</i>

771
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,793
<i>... with this Montagnard army of his...</i>

772
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:15,961
<i>... and they called me in.</i>

773
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:21,341
<i>... man like a god. And follow every order,</i>
<i>however ridiculous.</i>

774
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:28,348
<i>They lost him. He was gone.</i>

775
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,686
<i>Nothing but rumors</i>
<i>and random intelligence,</i>

776
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,813
<i>mostly from captured VC.</i>

777
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,235
<i>The VC knew his name by now,</i>
<i>and they were scared of him.</i>

778
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,531
<i>He and his men were playing hit and run,</i>
<i>all the way into Cambodia.</i>

779
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,498
I know where I'm going.
I'm going to the White House

780
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:57,919
to have dinner with
the President of the United States, baby.

781
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,254
That's where I'm going.

782
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,257
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

783
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,260
Clean.

784
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:13,310
- How long has that kid been on this boat?
- Seven months.

785
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,938
He's really specializing in busting my balls.

786
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,941
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

787
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,528
Yeah? What do you think, Chief?

788
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,364
I don't think.

789
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,534
My orders say I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't!

790
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,622
But one look at you,
and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

791
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:48,345
We're going upriver
about 75 klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

792
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,977
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

793
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,940
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

794
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,654
You just get me close to my destination,
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

795
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,826
All right, Captain.

796
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:33,974
<i>"Dear Son,</i>

Hey, shut up, fuck-up!

821
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,423
I'm sure sorry about that. If I had known,
I'd have taken you to New Orleans...

822
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,509
...introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

823

Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,
and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.

824
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:38,723
Lay off, Chef.

825
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,518
You're the only fucking prick
I see around here.

826

If I want to play with a prick,
I'll play with my own!

- Lay off, Chef!
- What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

828
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,650
- Fucking cherry boy!
- Chef, I said lay off!

829
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,736
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!

830
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:55,532
What do you think I said?
And give yourjaws a rest!

831
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,952
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor!

832
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,707
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking shirt
and stop smoking that dope!

833
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,041
You hear me?

834
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:12,382
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

835
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,426
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

836
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,678
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

837
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,432
I want you to stay awake up there, man.
You got a job to do.

838
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,411
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

839

Let's take a look. Lance.

840
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,625
Bring them in.
Clean, on the.60. Chef, get a.16.

841
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,420
Clean, get on that.60!

842
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,758
What's up, Chief?

843
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,262
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

844
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,390
Well, let's forget routine now
and let them go.

845
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,893
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

846
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,436
I'm gonna take a look.

847
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,689
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

848
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,233
Hell, you wouldn't even be
in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.

849
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,945
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

850
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,283
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

851
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,619
All right. Come on. Let's bring it over.

852
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,802
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

853
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,478
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Move it!

854
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,316
- You two, come on.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.

855
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,859
I got you, Chief.

856
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,448
It's clear, Chief.

857
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,666
Okay, that's them. That's them.

858
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,334
- They're okay.
- Board and search it.

859
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,546
It's just a fucking boat.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

860
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,922
Board it and search it.

861
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,341
Just some baskets and some ducks,
fucking bananas.

862
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,468
- Ain't nothing on it.
- Don't be ashamed, Chef.

863
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,636
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

864
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,847
There's a goat and some fish.

865
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,057
- Chef!
- Bunch of fucking vegetables.

866
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,393
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothing on it, man!

867
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,019
- Get on it!
- All right!

868
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:32,647
Move it, asshole! God damn it!

869
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,692
Just some pigs. Look, mangos.

870
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,777
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fucking rice.

871
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,488
- Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
- Some fucking fish.

872
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,367
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

873
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,245
What's in that vegetable basket?

874
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,330
Get out of here! Come on!

875
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,584
- Get over there, God damn it.
- Chef, check that vegetable basket.

876
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,127
- All right!
- Shut up, slope.

877
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:56,129
- There ain't nothing in here.
- What's in the boxes?

878
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,255
Not a fucking thing.

879
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,673
- Look in that tin can.
- Nothing.

880
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,134
- That rusty can.
- Just fucking rice, that's all!

881
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,427
- There ain't nothing on it!
- Check the yellow can.

882
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,804
Check the yellow can.
She was sitting on it. What's in it?

883
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:10,393
Chef!

884
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,274
Motherfuckers!

885
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,327
- Hold it!
- Come on, let's kill them all.

886
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,580
- Fucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

887
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,333
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

888
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,586
- Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

889
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,672
Why the fuck not?

890
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,717
- Clean?
- I'm good.

891
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,520
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

892
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,647
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

893
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,691
- You all right?
- See what she was running for?

894
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,489
It's a fucking puppy.

895
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:06,908
It's a fucking puppy.

896
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,370
Give me that dog!

897
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,288
- No, you're not gonna get it!
- Fucking give it to me!

898
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,207
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

899
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,294
- Fuck you! Fucking mango, too!
- Chef.

900
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:19,921
You want that?

901
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,131
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

902
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,259
- Chef!
- Yes!

903
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:26,052
She's moving behind you. Check her out!

904
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,804
All right. All right.

905
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,223
Come on, Clean, God damn it.
Give me a hand.

906
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,183
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

907
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,646
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

908
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,190
All right, Chef, just wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Chef.

909
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,650
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing, Chef?

910
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:44,195
- She's hurt. She's bleeding.
- Man.

911
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,823
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

912
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,616
What are you talking about?

913
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,410
We're taking her
to some friendlies, Captain.

914
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,995
She's wounded, she's not dead.

915
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,289
- Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain...

916
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:08,136
Fuck you. Fuck him.

917
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,555
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.

918
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:14,535
<i>It was the way we had over here</i>
<i>of living with ourselves.</i>

919
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,831
<i>We'd cut them in half with a machine gun</i>
<i>and give them a Band-Aid.</i>

920
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:28,257
<i>It was a lie, and the more I saw of them,</i>
<i>the more I hated lies.</i>

921
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:34,764
<i>Those boys were never gonna look at me</i>
<i>the same way again.</i>

922
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:38,059
<i>But I felt like I knew</i>
<i>one or two things about Kurtz</i>

923
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,353
<i>that weren't in the dossier.</i>

924
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:49,487
<i>Do Luong bridge was the last Army outpost</i>
<i>on the Nung River.</i>

925
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,160
<i>Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.</i>

926
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,916
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

927
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:03,543
It's beautiful.

928
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,339
I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

929
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,968
Hey, you know that last tab of acid
I was saving?

930
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,887
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

931
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,098
You dropped acid? Far out.

932
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,905
- Take me home.
- God damn you!

933
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,500
God damn!

934
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,961
You'll get what you deserve!

935
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,930
Is there a Captain Willard onboard?

936
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,390
- Yeah!
- Captain Willard?

937
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,310
- Yeah, who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

938
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:03,978
Get that light off me.

939
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:08,441
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these
three days ago, sir.

940
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,694
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

941
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,946
You don't know
how happy this makes me, sir.

942
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,698
- Why?
- Now I can get out of here,

943
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,366
if I can find a way.

944
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:24,081
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!

945
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,630
Captain, where you going?

946
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,382
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

947
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:38,805
- Pick me up on the other side of the bridge.
- Somebody go with him. Chef!

948
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,724
I'll go. I wanna go.

949
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,074
<i>You get your ass in gear.</i>

950
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:37,196
Come on, man. Listen to the music, man.

951
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:41,534
- Where can I find the CO?
- You came right to it, son of a bitch!

952
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,954
Lance! Get down here!

953
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:51,961
- You still got a Commanding Officer here?
- Beverly Hills.

954
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,379
What?

955
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:58,342
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

956
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,012
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

957
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,091
- God damn it, you stepped in my face!
- We thought you were dead.

958
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,010
Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

959
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,933
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?

960
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,809
You think you're so bad, nigga?

961
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:50,728
What are you shooting at, soldier?

962
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,356
Gooks.
What the fuck you think I'm shooting at?

963
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,192
I'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire,

964
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,944
but I think I killed them all.

965
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,029
You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

966
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,867
Shit, he's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.

967
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,670
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

968
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,004
They're all dead, stupid.

969
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,548
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

970
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,551
Who's the Commanding Officer here?

971
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,053
Ain't you?

972
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:30,059
You think you're so bad, huh?
I got something for your ass now, nigga!

973
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,936
I got something for you now!

974
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,898
He's underneath the bodies, man.

975
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,152
- Go get the roach, man.
- Go get the roach, man.

976
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:43,698
- Go get the roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the roach.

977
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:51,622
Roach. Roach. Roach.

978
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,042
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

979
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,878
- Lance!
- Do you hear them?

980
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,884
Go bust them!

981
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,765
Hey, GI, fuck you!

982
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,444
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

983
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,573
- Yeah.
- I'll kill you, GI!

984
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:26,741
You need a flare?

985
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:29,994
No.

986
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,205
He's close, man.

987
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,791
He's real close.

988
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,982
GI, fuck you!

989
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,904
GI, fuck you!

990
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,702
Motherfucker.

991
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,747
Hey, soldier,

992
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,669
do you know who's in command here?

993
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,548
Yeah.

994
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,190
Shit!

995
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,989
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

996
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,617
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

997
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,706
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

998
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,459
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

999
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,339
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1000
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,049
Let's move out.

1001
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:11,679
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1002
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,851
- Let's just get going.
- Which way, Captain?

1003
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,942
You know which way, Chief.

1004
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,528
You're on your own, Captain.

1005
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,239
Do you wanna go on?

1006
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,952
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1007
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,705
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1008
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,748
Think about it.

1009
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,254
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1010
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,136
Chef, on the bow.

1011
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,181
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go.

1012
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,405
Whose package is that?

1013
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:57,826
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1014
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,870
- That's it for you.
- Lance!

1015
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,998
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1016
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,503
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waiting for this one.

1017
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,256
I got another one, got a box from Eva.

Sue skinned her knee."

01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,459
<i>- send you a tape of their own...</i>
- Hey, Lance.

1053
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:30,354
There! Over there!

1054
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:35,401
Motherfuckers!

1055
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,413
There! Over there!

1056
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,960
Lance! Chef!

1057
01:33:56,589 --> 01:34:01,468
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1058
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,762
- Lance!
- Where'd the dog go?

1059
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,682
Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1060
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:10,144
Where's the dog?
We got to go back to get the dog!

1061
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:13,814
- Hey, Clean.
<i>- It's always been nice to have...</i>

1062
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:16,066
Hey, Bubba!

1063
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:20,279
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!

1064
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,948
<i>- And so, I'm hoping...</i>
- Bubba!

1065
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:27,911
<i>... that pretty soon,</i>
<i>not too soon, but pretty soon,</i>

1066
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:31,707
<i>I'll have a lot of grandchildren</i>
<i>to love and spoil,</i>

1067
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:35,210
<i>and then when your wife get them back,</i>
<i>she'll be mad with me.</i>

1068
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:42,968
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come</i>
<i>to celebrate your coming home.</i>

1069
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,637
<i>Granny and Dad</i>
<i>are trying to get enough money</i>

1070
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,014
<i>to get you a car.</i>

1071
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:50,684
<i>But don't tell her, because that's our secret.</i>

1072
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,815
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing,</i>
<i>stay out of the way of the bullets,</i>

1073
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,320
<i>and bring your heinie home</i>
<i>all in one piece</i>

1074
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:05,616
<i>because we love you very much.</i>
<i>Love, Mama.</i>

1075
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:17,336
Oh, man. You're so young.

1076
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,720
Clean.

1077
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:56,310
Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

1078
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:59,187
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1079
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:02,107
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1080
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:04,443
I ain't risking no more lives.

1081
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:07,404
I'm in command here, God damn it.
You'll do what I say.

1082
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,783
You see anything, Chef?

1083
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,121
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1084
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,434
Watch it over here, Chief.

1085
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,228
Got a stump.

1086
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,024
Lance, on the.50s.

1087
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,652
<i>He was close.</i>

1088
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,364
<i>He was real close.</i>

1089
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:57,496
<i>I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him,</i>
<i>as if the boat were being sucked upriver</i>

1090
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,499
<i>and the water was flowing back</i>
<i>into the jungle.</i>

1091
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,462
<i>Whatever was going to happen,</i>

1092
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:09,508
<i>it wasn't gonna be</i>
<i>the way they called it back in Nha Trang.</i>

1093
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,639
Arrows!

1094
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:16,848
Fire!

1095
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,310
Chef, open up! Fire!

1096
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:27,401
Lance, fire!

1097
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:38,537
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.

1098
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,622
They're just little toy arrows.

1099
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,833
Cut it out! Quiet!

1100
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,335
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1101
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,088
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1102
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:49,840
Quiet!

1103
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,677
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out

1104
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,679
because you don't know
where the hell you're going, do you?

1105
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:57,431
Do you?

1106
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,309
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1107
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:05,272
- Lance, get the wheel!
- Fire!

1108
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,484
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1109
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,631
A spear.

1110
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,922
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.

1111
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:57,008
There's a Green Beret colonel up there
who's gone insane

1112
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:58,969
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1113
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:03,056
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1114
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:05,392
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1115
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,479
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1116
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:13,400
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1117
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,028
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1118
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,574
I mean, I thought
you were going in to blow up a bridge

1119
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,577
or some fucking railroad tracks
or something.

1120
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:26,621
- Sorry.
- No, no, wait, wait.

1121
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:30,000
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1122
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:33,753
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1123
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:44,783
<i>Part of me was afraid of what I would find</i>
<i>and what I would do when I got there.</i>

1124
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:52,290
<i>I knew the risks, or imagined I knew.</i>

1125
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:59,005
<i>But the thing I felt the most,</i>
<i>much stronger than fear,</i>

1126
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:02,550
<i>was the desire to confront him.</i>

1127
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,541
Just keep moving.

1128
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:20,920
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1129
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:51,010
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1130
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:55,431
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1131
01:45:56,851 --> 01:46:00,103
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1132
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,365
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1133
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:14,993
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys
bite you, I'll tell you.

1134
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:18,371
That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1135
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,708
I'm an American. Yeah.

1136
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,668
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1137
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,879
Hi, American.

1138
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,797
American civilian. It's all right.

1139
01:46:28,549 --> 01:46:31,467
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what I've been dreaming about.

1140
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:33,720
Chef.

1141
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:37,140
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1142
01:46:41,437 --> 01:46:43,062
I'm a photojournalist.

1143
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:45,732
I've covered the war since '64.

1144
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:48,651
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1145
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:56,075
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1146
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:58,411
Who are all these people?

1147
01:46:58,495 --> 01:47:03,583
Yeah, they think you've come
to take him away,

1148
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:06,794
- and I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1149
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,841
Him! Colonel Kurtz.

1150
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:15,595
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1151
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:19,390
Hell, man, out here, we're all his children.

1152
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:23,686
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1153
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:29,943
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.
Well, you listen to him.

1154
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,446
The man's enlarged my mind.

1155
01:47:34,323 --> 01:47:37,700
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1156
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,995
Sometimes you'll say hello to him, right,

1157
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,456
and he'll just walk right by you
and he won't even notice you.

1158
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:47,043
And then suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1159
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:50,213
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word
in 'life'? If you can keep your head

1160
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:52,090
"when all about you are losing theirs
and blaming it on you,

1161
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:53,633
"if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1162
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:58,137
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1163
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:04,686
"I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

1164
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,312
Stay with the boat.

1165
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:10,108
Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1166
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:17,323
He can be terrible, he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1167
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:21,160
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1168
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:32,463
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words.

1169
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:35,425
I can tell you something,
like, the other day he wanted to kill me.

1170
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:38,261
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1171
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,346
Because I took his picture.

1172
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,641
He said, "If you take my picture again,

1173
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:48,646
"I'm gonna kill you," and he meant it.

1174
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,361
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1175
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:57,697
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1176
01:48:59,325 --> 01:49:01,701
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1177
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:04,746
You don't judge the Colonel
like an ordinary man.

1178
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:13,713
Okay, watch it now. These are Americans.

1179
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:14,839
Americans!

1180
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:16,674
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1181
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:21,095
Let me take your picture.
Could you hold... Hello? Hello?

1182
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:22,722
Could you hold up a minute?

1183
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:46,245
Colby.

1184
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:03,805
The heads.

1185
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:10,061
You're looking at the heads.
Sometimes he goes too far.

1186
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:12,772
He's the first one to admit it.

1187
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:16,150
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1188
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:21,072
If you could have heard the man
just two days ago.

1189
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:25,618
If you could have heard him then, God...
You're gonna call him crazy?

1190
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:27,662
Fucking A.

1191
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:34,502
- I just wanna talk to him.
- Well, man, he's gone away.

1192
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:38,798
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1193
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:39,882
I'll wait for him.

1194
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:44,137
He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.

1195
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:48,850
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1196
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:53,688
- Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
- Okay, Chef.

1197
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:58,734
- We'll go back to the boat for a while.
- Yeah, stay with Lance.

1198
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:26,721
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1199
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:29,807
That's what the man's got set up here!

1200
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:32,977
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1201
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:35,062
Shit, he's loco.

1202
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:38,608
- Then you'll help me?
- Help you? Fucking A, I'll help you.

1203
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,109
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1204
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,235
Good boy.

1205
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:43,529
We could blow all them assholes away.

1206
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:46,240
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1207
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:51,662
I ain't afraid of all them fucking skulls
and altars and shit.

1208
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:57,418
I used to think if I died in an evil place,

1209
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,046
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to heaven.

1210
01:52:01,006 --> 01:52:03,966
But now, fuck.

1211
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:08,471
I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1212
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:11,891
So what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.

1213
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,601
- No, no.
- Get out of here.

1214
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,478
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1215
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:19,774
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1216
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,568
see if I can find the Colonel, okay?

1217
01:52:24,613 --> 01:52:26,989
- What do you want me to do?
- Damn it.

1218
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:33,538
Here, you take the radio,
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours,

1219
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:37,750
you call in the air strike.

1220
01:52:40,546 --> 01:52:41,921
Air strike?

1221
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:48,344
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1222
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:50,596
It's all in there.

1223
01:52:52,266 --> 01:52:54,892
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1224
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:07,113
<i>Everything I saw told me that Kurtz</i>
<i>had gone insane.</i>

1225
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:17,164
<i>The place was full of bodies.</i>
<i>North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.</i>

1226
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,842
<i>If I was still alive,</i>
<i>it was because he wanted me that way.</i>

1227
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:04,712
<i>It smelled like slow death in there.</i>

1228
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,550
<i>Malaria, nightmares.</i>

1229
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:14,388
<i>This was the end of the river, all right.</i>

1230
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,112
Where are you from, Willard?

1231
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:37,286
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1232
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,878
- Were you born there?
- Yes, sir.

1233
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:50,716
- Whereabouts?
- Toledo, sir.

1234
01:54:58,058 --> 01:54:59,850
How far are you from the river?

1235
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:08,526
The Ohio River, sir?

1236
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:12,738
About 200 miles.

1237
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:23,708
I went down that river once
when I was a kid.

1238
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:31,298
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember.

1239
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:36,595
It must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1240
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:39,682
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1241
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:46,272
but for about five miles, you'd think that
heaven just fell on the Earth,

1242
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:49,650
in the form of gardenias.

1243
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:11,005
Have you ever considered
any real freedoms?

1244
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,722
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1245
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:25,227
Even the opinions of yourself?

1246
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:44,997
Did they say why, Willard?

1247
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:51,962
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1248
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,814
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1249
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:17,530
No longer classified, is it?

1250
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:26,288
What did they tell you?

1251
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:35,589
They told me that you had gone
totally insane,

1252
01:57:38,552 --> 01:57:44,890
and that your methods were unsound.

1253
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:50,646
Are my methods unsound?

1254
01:57:56,736 --> 01:58:02,908
I don't see any method at all, sir.

1255
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,627
I expected someone like you.

1256
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:18,257
What did you expect?

1257
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,100
Are you an assassin?

1258
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:34,148
I'm a soldier.

1259
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:39,612
You're neither.

1260
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:46,368
You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks

1261
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:52,791
to collect a bill.

1262
01:59:36,753 --> 01:59:42,383
Why? Why would a nice guy like you
wanna kill a genius?

1263
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:51,100
Going down pretty good, huh?

1264
01:59:51,726 --> 01:59:52,810
Why?

1265
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:56,188
You know?

1266
01:59:56,982 --> 01:59:59,024
Do you know that the man,

1267
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:04,530
the man really likes you?

1268
02:00:07,826 --> 02:00:13,706
He likes you. He really likes you,
but he's got something in mind for you.

1269
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:16,959
Aren't you curious about that?

1270
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:23,007
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1271
02:00:26,511 --> 02:00:29,304
There's something
happening out here, man.

1272
02:00:32,726 --> 02:00:35,227
You know something, man?
I know something that you don't know.

1273
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:37,146
That's right, jack.

1274
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:42,818
The man is clear in his mind,
but his soul is mad.

1275
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:46,071
Yeah.

1276
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:51,201
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1277
02:00:52,287 --> 02:00:56,165
But the man's...

1278
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:02,171
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1279
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:07,760
And a voice, a voice...

1280
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:15,434
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.

1281
02:01:15,852 --> 02:01:20,481
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1282
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:22,900
You're gonna help him.

1283
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:25,694
What are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone?

1284
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:30,449
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1285
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:31,617
What are they gonna say about him?

1286
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:36,163
What are they gonna say?
"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.

1287
02:01:36,414 --> 02:01:39,875
"He had plans. He had wisdom."
Bullshit, man!

1288
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:44,338
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1289
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:49,218
You.

1290
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:56,475
Almost eight hours.

1291
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:02,481
God. I'm asleep.

1292
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:07,152
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1293
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:20,332
Fuck.

1294
02:02:24,671 --> 02:02:26,255
Has it been eight hours?

1295
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:34,012
Hello, Almighty, Almighty,
this is PBR Street Gang.

1296
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:35,681
Radio check. Over.

1297
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:39,351
<i>PBR Street Gang,</i>
<i>this is Almighty standing by. Over.</i>

1298
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:05,103
What the hell! Jesus!

1299
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:13,862
Christ!

1300
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:46,014
"We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men

1301
02:06:46,724 --> 02:06:52,145
"Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!

1302
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:56,233
"Our dried voices, when
We whisper together

1303
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:59,653
"Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass

1304
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:03,240
- "Or rats' feet over broken glass..."
- He's out there.

1305
02:07:03,324 --> 02:07:04,825
"In our dry cellar..."

1306
02:07:05,451 --> 02:07:11,373
- He's really out there.
- "Shape without form, shade without color,

1307
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:17,129
"Paralyzed force, gesture without motion..."

1308
02:07:17,505 --> 02:07:19,047
Do you know what the man's saying?

1309
02:07:20,383 --> 02:07:22,092
- Do you?
- "Those who have crossed..."

1310
02:07:22,718 --> 02:07:26,721
This is dialectics. It's very simple dialectics.
One through nine,

1311
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:30,433
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1312
02:07:30,518 --> 02:07:34,896
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1313
02:07:34,981 --> 02:07:36,815
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1314
02:07:36,899 --> 02:07:39,526
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1315
02:07:39,735 --> 02:07:41,653
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1316
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,822
Dialectic logic is,
"There's only love and hate."

1317
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:45,949
You either love somebody
or you hate them.

1318
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:47,492
Mutt!

1319
02:07:49,829 --> 02:07:50,871
You mutt.

1320
02:07:51,914 --> 02:07:56,918
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1321
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,671
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1322
02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:02,090
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.

1323
02:08:31,913 --> 02:08:34,623
<i>On the river, I thought</i>
<i>that the minute I looked at him,</i>

1324
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,499
<i>I'd know what to do.</i>

1325
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:44,132
<i>But it didn't happen. I was in there</i>
<i>with him for days, not under guard.</i>

1326
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:49,304
<i>I was free.</i>
<i>But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

1327
02:08:50,765 --> 02:08:54,059
<i>He knew more</i>
<i>about what I was going to do than I did.</i>

1328
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:04,653
<i>If the generals back in Nha Trang</i>
<i>could see what I saw,</i>

1329
02:09:05,613 --> 02:09:08,198
<i>would they still want me to kill him?</i>

1330
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,326
<i>More than ever, probably.</i>

1331
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:14,704
<i>And what would his people</i>
<i>back home want,</i>

1332
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:17,832
<i>if they ever learned</i>
<i>just how far from them he'd really gone?</i>

1333
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:23,838
<i>He broke from them,</i>
<i>and then he broke from himself.</i>

1334
02:09:25,508 --> 02:09:29,678
<i>I'd never seen a man so broken up</i>
<i>and ripped apart.</i>

1335
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:34,808
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1336
02:09:37,478 --> 02:09:41,398
But you have no right to call me a murderer.
You have a right to kill me.

1337
02:09:42,733 --> 02:09:48,697
You have a right to do that.
But you have no right to judge me.

1338
02:09:56,038 --> 02:10:01,042
It's impossible for words to describe

1339
02:10:03,379 --> 02:10:09,342
what is necessary to those

1340
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:16,725
who do not know what horror means.

1341
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:20,395
Horror.

1342
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:26,026
Horror has a face.

1343
02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:30,447
And you must make a friend of horror.

1344
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:36,995
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1345
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:42,375
If they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1346
02:10:43,878 --> 02:10:45,754
They are truly enemies.

1347
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:53,595
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1348
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:02,020
It seems a thousand centuries ago.

1349
02:11:05,608 --> 02:11:11,446
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1350
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:21,581
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1351
02:11:24,043 --> 02:11:27,420
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1352
02:11:31,008 --> 02:11:33,551
We went back there

1353
02:11:33,636 --> 02:11:39,099
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1354
02:11:41,477 --> 02:11:48,274
There they were, in a pile.
A pile of little arms.

1355
02:11:50,403 --> 02:11:52,654
And I remember,

1356
02:11:56,534 --> 02:11:59,327
I cried. I wept like

1357
02:12:01,497 --> 02:12:04,165
some grandmother.

1358
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:09,587
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1359
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,591
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1360
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:16,302
I never want to forget.

1361
02:12:17,972 --> 02:12:22,684
And then I realized, like I was shot,

1362
02:12:23,185 --> 02:12:25,353
like I was shot with a diamond,

1363
02:12:26,564 --> 02:12:29,691
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1364
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:36,948
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that. The genius."

1365
02:12:38,367 --> 02:12:40,743
The will to do that,

1366
02:12:42,413 --> 02:12:46,875
perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

1367
02:12:49,462 --> 02:12:51,379
And then I realized

1368
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:55,049
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1369
02:12:55,134 --> 02:12:59,095
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1370
02:13:00,556 --> 02:13:05,226
These men who fought with their hearts,
who have families, who have children,

1371
02:13:05,311 --> 02:13:09,147
who are filled with love,
but they have the strength,

1372
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:17,363
the strength to do that.

1373
02:13:18,449 --> 02:13:22,744
If I had 10 divisions of those men,

1374
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:26,789
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1375
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:33,004
You have to have men who are moral,

1376
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:39,385
and at the same time, who are able

1377
02:13:41,013 --> 02:13:47,268
to utilize their primordial instincts to kill

1378
02:13:49,188 --> 02:13:55,777
without feeling, without passion,
without judgment. Without judgment.

1379
02:14:01,283 --> 02:14:03,910
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1380
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:30,186
I worry that my son
might not understand what I've tried to be.

1381
02:14:32,898 --> 02:14:37,527
And if I were to be killed, Willard,

1382
02:14:39,071 --> 02:14:44,534
I would want someone to go to my home
and tell my son everything.

1383
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:50,832
<i>Everything I did. Everything you saw.</i>

1384
02:14:52,585 --> 02:14:58,089
<i>Because there's nothing that I detest more</i>
<i>than the stench of lies.</i>

1385
02:15:01,176 --> 02:15:08,182
<i>And if you understand me, Willard,</i>
<i>you will do this for me.</i>

1386
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:16,876
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over.</i>

1387
02:16:18,671 --> 02:16:21,798
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.</i>
<i>Standing by. Over.</i>

1388
02:16:24,051 --> 02:16:27,929
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.</i>
<i>Standing by. How do you copy?</i>

1389
02:16:33,268 --> 02:16:36,062
<i>They were gonna make me a Major for this,</i>

1390
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:39,941
<i>and I wasn't even</i>
<i>in their fucking Army anymore.</i>

1391
02:16:42,111 --> 02:16:46,823
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it,</i>
<i>him most of all.</i>

1392
02:16:48,784 --> 02:16:53,162
<i>I felt like he was up there,</i>
<i>waiting for me to take the pain away.</i>

1393
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:00,586
<i>He just wanted to go out like a soldier.</i>
<i>Standing up.</i>

1394
02:17:01,922 --> 02:17:05,508
<i>Not like some poor, wasted,</i>
<i>rag-assed renegade.</i>

1395
02:17:09,388 --> 02:17:11,681
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead,</i>

1396
02:17:12,641 --> 02:17:15,309
<i>and that's who he really</i>
<i>took his orders from anyway.</i>

1397
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:37,850
"We train young men to drop fire on people,
but their commanders

1398
02:18:39,061 --> 02:18:43,981
"won't allow them to write 'Fuck'
on their airplanes

1399
02:18:44,066 --> 02:18:47,068
"because it's obscene!"

1400
02:20:10,277 --> 02:20:11,652
The horror.

1401
02:20:15,866 --> 02:20:17,241
The horror.

1402
02:25:40,273 --> 02:25:45,361
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang.</i>
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.</i>

1403
02:25:45,445 --> 02:25:47,279
<i>Do you read me? Over.</i>

1404
02:25:48,156 --> 02:25:49,740
<i>PBR Street Gang.</i>

1405
02:25:50,367 --> 02:25:52,451
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...</i>

1406
02:26:30,699 --> 02:26:32,116
<i>The horror.</i>

1407
02:26:36,538 --> 02:26:37,913
<i>The horror.</i>
