00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,776

2
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,146
<i>Pick up.</i>

3
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,678
Cornein.

5
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,647
Drink?

6
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,247
No, thank you.

7
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,963
Perfect.

8
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,531
This way.

9
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,839
Slowly.

10
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,493
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

11
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,972
<i>Pick up.</i>

12
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,676
<i>Pick up.</i>

13
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,508
<i>Brandon?</i>

14
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,322
<i>Brandon?</i>

15
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,687
<i>Brandon, where are you?</i>

16
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,026
<i>Brandon? Brandon?</i>

17
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,670
<i>Brandon?</i>

18
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,211
<i>Ugh!</i>

19
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,051
<i>- This is me calling you.</i>

20
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,556
<i>Fuck!</i>

21
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,223
"I find you disgusting."

22
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,698
"I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive."

23
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,299
This is what the cynics used to say.

24
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,204
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.

25
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,115
They would say, "Can we stop this virus?"

26
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,880
As if it was a negative progression.

27
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,680
But it's growing.

28
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,354
More and more,
with a momentum that is unstoppable.

29
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,260
Now some kid snorts the entire load
of his mother's spice cupboard.

30
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,062
Post that on YouTube.

31
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,795
They would watch
as it becomes the buzz word

32
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,734
amongst high school students everywhere.

33
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,137
Eventually, the cynicism
is turning into awe.

34
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,391
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?

35
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,964
They took it.

36
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,873
Yeah, I know. Someone could have told me.

37
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,038
Some kind of virus.

38
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:35,902
Cool.

39
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,255
Thank you.

40
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,649
<i>Okay, me again.</i>

41
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,952
<i>I'm dying. I have cancer.
I have one week to live.</i>

42
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,227
<i>The very worst kind of cancer.</i>

43
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,995
<i>Of the vulva...</i>

44
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,935
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,403
You're such a dick.

46
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,572
What are you doing, man?

47
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,346
All right, gentlemen.
If you just please make yourselves at home.

48
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,302
<i>It falls upon me as your
beloved boss to propose a toast.</i>

50
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,436
<i>To success.</i>

51
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,272
- I just hope my wife appreciates it.

52
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,976
Get a new tie, please.

53
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,814
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my goodness.

54
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,448
I love women in suits.
I love women in suits.

55
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,922
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life.

56
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,462
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- Gray suit?

57
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,794
- I'm gonna go talk to her. Count me down.
- You should go talk to her.

58
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,527
Yeah, you should.

59
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,227
Five, four, three, two, one.

60
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,792
Boom.

61
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,429
Have fun.

62
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,134
Twenty bucks says he fucks it up.

64
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,680
Hi, excuse me. Listen, I don't want to
beat around the bush.

65
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,719
I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
My name's David.

66
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,618
- Hi, David. Elizabeth. Nice to meet you.
- Elizabeth. That's a beautiful name.

67
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,179
- Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be rude.
- Loren.

68
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,453
- Hi, how are you? David. Nice to meet you.
- Rachel.

69
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,994
Listen, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?

70
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,358
- Sure. Why not?
- I would love that.

71
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,159
That would be my pleasure.
What are you guys drinking?

72
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,097
- Well, we were thinking shots.
- You were thinking shots?

73
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,431
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?

74
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,798
- Bring it on.
- Love it.

75
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,033
Excuse me. Bartender? Can we get
four shots of your finest tequila?

76
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,131
Thank you very much.

77
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,303
I can see you're very successful.

78
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,405
I think part of the secret to my success
is attention to detail.

79
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,507
- Detail?
- Play the game.

80
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,848
- What game?
- Okay. Blue or green?

81
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,516
I like games. I like this game.
Blue. Green. Green, it's green.

82
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,252
- That's brown.
- Wow, wow!

83
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,850
I don't know how you change
the color of your eyes like that.

84
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,123
How do you do that so quickly?
That's amazing. That's a real talent.

85
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,822
- Detail man.
- Hey, buddy.

86
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,799
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.

87
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,427
I want you to know you fucking nailed it.
You're the man.

88
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,870
Your pitch, amazing.
Listen, we're playing a game here.

89
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,271
Close your eyes again. Blue or green?

90
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,267
- Brown.
- Fuck off.

91
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,437
All right. You, Loren, close your eyes.

92
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,474
- Blue.
- Blue.

93
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,571
- You're just making that up.
- See? He's good.

94
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,378
He's just picking colors randomly.

95
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,545
- You can have his shot.
- Excuse me. We need another shot, please.

96
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,588
- You can put these on me.
- No, I told you, I had it.

97
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,683
No, I have it.

98
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,228
- I'll get the next round.
- Sure.

99
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,059
You're a strong, independent woman.
I like that.

100
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,963
Thank you. Cheers. To nailing it...

101
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,057
- To nailing it.
- To nailing it.

102
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,158
- To nailing it.
- ...and to success.

103
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,225
Yes.

104
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,464
Mmm!

105
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,837
I love that.

106
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,835
Oh, fuck.

107
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,304
Whoa!

108
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,069
So what do you girls do for fun?

109
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,671
Fun? Karate.

110
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,516
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song,

111
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,852
I would love it if you would dance with me
to this song that I wrote for you.

112
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,483
Come on. Let's go on the dance floor.
One song.

113
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,494
Yeah, come on. You're a fun girl.
It'll be fun.

114
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,191
I'll bring her back. Swear to God.
Come on, come on, it's fun.

Whoo!

gonna get robbed and roofied.

00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,178
- Dance?
- No.

120
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,271

Listen, your eyes, they're beautiful.

I didn't get it right the first time?

129
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,472
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see them again.

Look at those eyes.
I know the color of your eyes!

What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.

156

I don't care. I don't care.

176
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,458
I don't need anybody else. I love you.

177
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,529
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, please.

178
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,472
I love you. I love you.

179
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,571
Please.

180
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:54,076
I feel sick. I feel really sick.

181
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,719
- Morning.
- Morning.

182
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,161
Nice earring. Hot date?

183
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,127
- Juice?
- Mmm!

184
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,101
Will you use a glass?

185
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,906
Sorry.

186
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,586
You're going gray.

187
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,851
Do you think I look fat?

188
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,097
Do you think I look fat?

189
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,931
- Sit down.

190
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,834
Fuck you!

191
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,576
I'm doing a couple gigs.

192
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,513
Yeah. Sure.

193
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,352
Can I stay?

194
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,051
- You want toast?
- Just for a few days?

195
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,094
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.

196
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,824
- Mark?
- Please.

197
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,163
Jesus, Sissy.

198
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,767
What do you expect?

199
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,067
Pretty please?

200
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,336
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it

201
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,869
- before I leave every morning.
- I will. I promise. I will.

202
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,382
Okay. Okay. Okay.

203
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,846
- We leave in 15.
- Okay!

204
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,190
Mmm! So good!

205
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,242
Stop fucking around.

206
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,449
- Leave it.
- You have fluff.

207
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,583
I like it there.

208
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,866
- How are you for money?
- I'm good.

209
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,772
- 'Cause if you need some money...
- Honestly,

210
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,310
I even make money now and everything.

211
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,974
- Yeah, sure.
- Huge amounts.

212
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,941
- What, you collect it in that hat?

213
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,519
You should come and hear me.

214
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,251
- Yeah, I will.
- "Yeah, I will"?

215
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,624
Like, "Yeah, I will," like last time?

216
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,723
Please come.

217
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,392
Where'd you get this, anyway?

218
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,060
It's vintage.

219
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,264
- Yeah, I can see that.

220
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,605
Wow.

221
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,667
- Do you like?
- Yeah.

222
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,582
Please come.

223
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,679
Okay, I will.

224
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,183
Yay.

225
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,888
Sorry.

226
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,394
Fuck, my computer.

227
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,233
Well, well, well.

228
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,533
Morning, asshole.

229
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,905
Look who's decided to
grace us with his presence.

230
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,068
Yeah.

231
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,633
Don't tell me. No cabs.

232
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,771
No, your wife
wouldn't let me leave this morning.

233
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,338
Hey. That's not cool.

234
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,911
You should be so lucky.

235
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,480
- Any calls?
- Yes. Like, 50.

236
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,061
- Hey! Heads up, buddy.
- Whoa!

237
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,532
So, how'd it go last night?

238
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,871
Got home, went to bed. Good night.

239
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,463
Uh-huh. Right, right.

240
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,273
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.

241
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,905
Yeah, my sister's playing
downtown somewhere.

242
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,709
She's playing?

243
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,649
She's a musician. Well, she's a singer.

244
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,244
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what?
That sounds like a lot of fun.

245
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,654
And that will ruin your enamel.

246
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,732
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.

247
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,832
- Good evening.
- Evening.

248
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,241
Reservation. Sullivan?

249
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,610
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?

250
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,150
Thank you.

251
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,315
- There you are.
- Right this way, please.

252
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,923
Wow, look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.

253
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,227
Nice pick.

254
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,630
Oh!

255
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,666
I forget how beautiful the city is.

256
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,666
Thank you.

257
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,281
Hi, guys. How are you both doing tonight?
What can I get you?

258
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,444
Your accent. Are you... You're from...

259
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,816
Brazil.

260
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,654
Rio? Hmm?

261
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,248
- Sao Paulo
- Oh!

262
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,657
That is a beautiful city. That's...

263
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,526
You've been there?
- Once or twice.

264
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,496
Can we get two dry martinis with olives?

265
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,692
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,793
And a little bit later,
why don't you come by for a drink with us?

267
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,904
I'll make sure I get those drinks.

268
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,371
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

269
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,709
She would be so offended if I didn't try.

270
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,608
Unbelievable.

271
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:12,418
<i>Start spreading the news</i>

272
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,568

Wow. Wow! Bravo!

She's good! She's good!

307
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,819
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,453
- I'm David.
- Sissy.

309
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,054
- It is a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet...

310
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,793
I think you are absolutely fantastic
and you look great in the dress, too.

311
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,199
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

312
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,933
What did you think?

313
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,804
Yeah, it was interesting.

314
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,433
What do you mean?

315
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,342
No, it was...

316
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,446
It was good. It was good.

317
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,346
It was good?

318
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,754
He was crying. He was crying.
There were tears coming down his face.

319
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,949
I saw it. You made a grown man cry.

320
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,047
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

321
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,524
I'm gonna get some drinks.

322
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,721
That's a great idea. Why don't you
get a round for the table, buddy?

323
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,467
Okay. I'm really sorry about that.

324
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,664
He's had a rough day at work.
I think he's a little bit emotional right now.

325
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,742
- So you guys grew up in Jersey?
- Yeah.

327
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,300
- You still live there?
- God, no.

328
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,937
That's good. That's good.
Where do you live now?

329
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,482
- Kind of all over the place.
- Yeah?

330
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,416
- What's the last city you've been to?
- L.A.

331
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,953
- Los Angeles?
- Mmm-hmm.

332
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,216
- Oh, boy. You like it there?
- I mean, I'm going back.

333
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,725
- That must mean you love it then, huh?
- No! I can't even fucking drive.

334
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,455
- Wait a minute. You can't drive?
- It's a nightmare.

335
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,996
- Nope.
- Why not?

336
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,726
I tried when I was a kid
and I was horrible.

337
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,529
Wait, how old were you
when you quit driving?

338
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,399
- Sixteen.
- You were 16 years old?

339
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,596
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,731
So, wait a minute.
How do you get along in Los Angeles?

341
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,207
- I take the bus.
- No. No, no, no.

342
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,371
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.

343
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,574
- What happened to your arm here?
- Oh!

344
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,583
When I was a kid, I was bored.

345
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,279
- You must have been really bored.
- I was.

346
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,083
All right, we've got a problem.

347
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,885
Your sister cannot be
taking the bus anywhere, okay?

348
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,424
I know a guy who owns
a car rental company.

349
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,357
We're gonna get you a car,
we're gonna drive around in circles

350
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,258
in a parking lot and you
are going to learn how to drive.

351
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,661
- Not stick, automatic. It's a little easier.
- I would love that.

352
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,324
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet,

353
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,801
we're gonna get you a golf cart
and you will drive the golf cart around.

354
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,668
Wow. Now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.

355
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,572
- A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue, huh?

356
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,407
You know, they should. They should.
It would be a lot cleaner and greener.

357
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,777
It would be great for the city.
Brandon, what do you think?

358
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,577
- Sounds great.
- Yeah?

359
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,351
I love your brother. What an amazing man.

360
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,887
- How long are you here for?
- I don't know.

361
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,619
You don't know?

362
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,931
Can I see you again? Please?
Is that too forward? I find you fascinating.

363
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,995
I really do.
I think you're a fascinating creature.

364
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,502
I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we...

365
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,163
This is a celebration, let's get champagne.

366
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,638
- Yes! Champagne!
- Champagne for everybody.

367
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,073
- The whole table! Come on.
- Champagne.

368
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,625
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out, get out.

369
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,160
Come here, come here, come here.

370
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,596
No!
- Come on, come on with me.

371
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,166
- Get off. Get off.
- How did that work?

372
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,793
- Get off me.
- Come on, come on.

373
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,600
Champagne on your dress, that's...

374
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,838
- Well, I'm hot, I'm hot.
- You are hot.

375
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,650
You are?

376
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:25,111
- No! You're crushing me.

377
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,178
I need to take this off. I'm hot.
I need to take it off. I'm hot.

378
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,817
Nice sheets.

379
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:39,191
Aren't they nice sheets?
Bed Bath & Beyond.

380
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,524
Stop.

381
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,273
What if I kiss you right here?

382
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,280
How about here?

383
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,455
- Yeah?
- Shit.

384
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,337
Mmm-hmm.

385
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,435
What?

386
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,809
Stop talking!

387
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,890
I have to be up and out by 7:00.

388
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,949
It's cold.

389
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,459
Sissy, get out of my room.

390
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,002
Sissy, get out of my room.

391
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,272
Get the fuck out! Get out!

392
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,460
Hey, slacker. Your computer's back.

393
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,612
Dave's looking for you.

394
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,311
- Yeah. It was really great last night.
<i>- Daddy, Daddy.</i>

395
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,618
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
Thanks for calling.

396
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,789
Hey, buddy.
Listen, we said an hour French,

397
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,558
and then Isobel’s gonna pick you up
because Mommy's picking up Nathan.

398
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,224
All right? You can go after.

399
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,768
<i>Yeah, I know, but Mommy says I can't.</i>

400
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,270
Okay. Well, let's go talk to Mommy. Hmm?

401
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,598
<i>- She's all the way downstairs.</i>
- Well, go downstairs and tell her

402
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,611
that Daddy said
it's okay for you to go to Jason's.

403
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,543
Huh? Come on. How about that? Do it.

404
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,446
- You can do it. Get up.
<i>- Okay.</i>

405
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,212
Yeah.

406
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,277
<i>Mommy? Mommy?</i>

407
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,256
What's up, man?

408
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,816
- Steven said you wanted to see me.
- Yes.

409
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,862
Dude, 9:00 this morning, where were you?

410
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,294
- Dentist. Root canal.
- Oh, shit.

411
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,664
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who did you see?

412
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:23,000
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.

413
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,269
Good. Good. You're stinging
the company health plan, I hope, right?

414
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,276
- Sure.
- That's what it's there for, man.

415
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,970
All right, brother.

416
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,979
Listen, one more thing.

417
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,610
Your hard drive is filthy, all right?
We got your computer back.

418
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,019
I mean, it is dirty.

419
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,750
I'm talking like hoes, sluts, anal,
double anal,

420
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,851
penetration, interracial facial, man.

421
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,487
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.

422
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,661
- You think it was your intern?
- On my hard drive?

423
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,831
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.

424
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,205
And we're blowing our wad in cash,
you know?

425
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:05,007
It takes a really, really sick fuck to
spend all day on that shit.

426
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,844
<i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>

427
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,906
Yeah. Hey, buddy. What'd she say?

428
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,419
<i>She said I can go to Jason's for a half hour,
but I have to be home by 5:00 for dinner.</i>

429
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,922
Okay. That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.

430
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,652
- You got everything you want. You happy?
<i>- Yup. Yup.</i>

431
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,094
- Yeah. You better be. Get out of here
<i>- Okay. All right, see you.</i>

432
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,971
Hey. You like your sugar?

433
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,943
I do.

434
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,723
Hey.

435
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,257
- Hello.
- Hello.

436
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,989
Did you find it okay?

437
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,588
Yes, I'm glad you made it.

438
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:38,733
Yeah?

439
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:44,272
I'm late. Sorry.

440
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,334
You look handsome.

441
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,207
- You look amazing.
- Hi.

442
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,975
- Thank you.
- How are you doing tonight?

443
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,743
- Thank you.
- Okay.

444
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,378
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?

445
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,614
Sure.

446
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,886
The soup of the day is tomato
with basil oil and parmesan crostini.

447
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,629
The special is marinated swordfish,
tabouleh and Moroccan charmoula.

448
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,993
It's really good.

449
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:14,468
We're also serving a DeBragga and Spitler
New York Strip with a side order of fries,

450
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:18,131
and the salad is snow pea and radish
with a cider vinaigrette.

451
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,943
Can I start you off with a sparkling water?

452
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,501
Tap water's fine.
- Okay.

453
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,343
And the wine menu is right next to...
Yup, there you go.

454
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,178
- You want some wine?
- Sure.

455
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,712
- White? Red?
- Red. Maybe...

456
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,313
Pinot Noir is light,

457
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,821
if you like it, like, light.

458
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,496
Great.

459
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,863
Okay. I'll be back.

460
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,034
- So...

461
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,974
Where do you live?

462
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,536
- Brooklyn.
- Nice.

463
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,776
Born and raised. Where you from?

464
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:07,018
I was born in Ireland
and we moved here when I was a teen.

465
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,181
Did you get back much? Thank you.

466
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,850
A couple times.

467
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,993
A big family? You miss them?

468
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,456
Uh...

469
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,699
I have a sister.

470
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,702
I have two.

471
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,898
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

472
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,933
Older? Younger?

473
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,634
Older and younger.

474
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,610
I'm right in the middle.

475
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,011
What?

476
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,112
- Just wondering.

477
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,647
Are you nervous?

478
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,421
- Why would I be nervous?
- You look a little nervous.

479
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,859
Do I?

480
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,790
- No.
- Well, what's a date?

481
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,423
It's no big deal.

482
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,826
It took me an hour to
figure out what to wear.

483
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,167
- You chose wisely.
- Yeah.

484
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,674
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.

485
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,146
Great.

486
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,148
Oh! Yeah. I haven't even looked at this.

487
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,520
- I'll have the lamb.
- The lamb.

488
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,786
I'll have the lamb, too. That sounds great.

489
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,328
- Okay. No appetizer?

490
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,055
- I'm fine.
- No.

491
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,430
Okay. And how would you like the lamb?

492
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,025
Medium.

493
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,934
We recommend it pretty pink.

494
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,165
- Okay.
- Yeah?

495
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,643
Okay. Pink it is.

496
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,246
Thank you. Excuse me.

497
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,849
So you seeing anyone at the moment?

498
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,186
No, I'm not. Are you seeing anyone?

499
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,460
- No.
- No? Really?

500
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,059
Why is that?

501
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,634
I don't know. It's just the way it is.

502
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,226
It's just the way it is. Yeah, I...

503
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:06,741
Actually, I'm separated.

504
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,075
- Tragedy.
- Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.

505
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,776
Okay.

506
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,875
You were married for long?

507
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,156
- No.
- Did we decide on the wine?

508
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,652
Well, yeah.
Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

509
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,389
Yeah, great. Great choice. Okay.

510
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,000
I wasn't married long. Gave it a shot.
It didn't really work out.

511
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,570
No.

512
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,637
- Wow.
- What?

513
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,140
- You just seem, like...
- What?

514
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,144
- Averse to the whole idea.
- Well, yeah.

515
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,908
I just don't understand why
people would want to get married.

516
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:49,917
Especially nowadays, I mean, it's...
You know?

517
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,543
I don't see the point.

518
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,323
In relationships?

519
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,881
It doesn't seem realistic.

520
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,662
- Are you serious? I mean...
- Yeah. I am, really.

521
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:10,637
Well, then, you know, why are we here,
if we don't matter to one another?

522
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,867
- Well...
- Why are you here?

523
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,001
The food is supposed to be great here.

524
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,876
No, no, no. I'm not saying it like that.

525
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,279
I mean... I just mean... You know?

526
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,446
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...

527
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:30,353
I mean, you come to restaurants,
you see couples sitting together,

528
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,951
and they don't even speak to one another,
they don't have anything to say.

529
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,863
They probably don't have to speak
because they're connected.

530
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,265
Or they're just bored with one another.

531
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,030
- Every...
- Here we go.

532
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,676
What's your longest relationship?

533
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,601
Um...

534
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,373
Exactly.

535
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,180
- That's... You can pour.
- Sure.

536
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,683
Four months.

537
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,063
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.

538
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,462
I did. For four months.
- For four months.

539
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,956
Thank you.

540
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,392
Look, touch that.

541
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:47,958
Your head?

542
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,799
- No, no, no.
You're such a weirdo.

543
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,275
No, seriously, seriously, seriously.
Touch it.

544
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,037
Okay.

545
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,480
- Oh, my God.
- Do you feel that?

546
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,017
Yeah, what is it?

547
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,950
- It's a remnant.
- A remnant?

548
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,921
Yeah, from the Neanderthals.

549
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,584
There's only a few of us left
since the Homo sapiens took over.

550
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,648
Okay.

551
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,052
Hmm.

552
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,528
That would explain the forehead.

553
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,587
- What's that supposed to mean?
- "What's that supposed to mean?"

554
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,895
- What do you mean?

555
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,163
Seriously, how did you get it? What is it?

556
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,501
- I used to play this game with my cousin...
- Mmm-hmm.

557
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,805
...where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.

558
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,846
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.

559
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,381
I was knocked out for five or 10 minutes.

560
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,940
- I peed my pants.
- Oh!

561
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:47,024
If you had a choice to
live in the past or the future,

562
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,222
and you could be
anything you wanted to be,

563
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,959
what would you be?

564
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,196
What would you be?

565
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,339
Well, I always wanted to be
a musician in the '60s.

566
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,809
That's cool. A musician?

567
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,209
Yeah.

568
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,905
'60s is tough, though.

569
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:10,111
I saw Gimme Shelter recently, you know,
the Rolling Stones documentary?

570
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,449
- Yeah.
- It kind of seemed like hell.

571
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,810
What?

572
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,484
Yeah, the '60s would be, like,
the last place I would want to be.

573
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,549
- No way!
- Yes.

574
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,158
Ugh! Chaos!

575
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,597
So where and what would you wanna be?

576
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,759
Um...

577
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,229
You know, here, now.

578
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,734
That's boring.

579
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:36,800
Fuck you.

580
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,755
Okay. Well, this is me.

581
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,260
- This is you?
- This is me.

582
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,459
Thank you very much, Brandon.

583
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,633
Thank you very much, Marianne.

584
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,136
We should do this again.

585
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,909
Right.

586
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,618
So is that a yes?

587
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,025
Maybe, yeah.

588
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,676
Hello? Sissy?

589
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,153
Oh, fuck!

590
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,620
Fuck!

591
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,032
Fuck!

592
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,493
- What, are you fucking spying on me?
Lock the fucking door, Brandon.

593
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,006
- Are you fucking spying?
"Are you fucking spying?"

594
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,702
Fuck! Brandon...
- What do you want?

595
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,574
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?

596
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,544
- You wanna fight?
- You want some of this?

597
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,876
What do you want from me?

598
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,211
- What do you want from me?
- Brandon!

599
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,375
- What do you want?
- Get off me!

600
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,715
- Why did you come here? Why?
- Get off me! Get off me!

601
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,345
- Why? Why?
- Get off me!

602
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,913
You're fucking hurting me.
- Talk to me! Fucking bitch!

603
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,323
Get the fuck off, you fucking weirdo.

604
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,985
- Fucking slut!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

605
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,580
Brandon?

606
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,181
Brandon, I'm sorry.

607
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,231
<i>Hey, where's Brandon?</i>

608
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,771
<i>Are you Brandon's girlfriend?</i>

609
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,913
<i>Do you wanna play?</i>

610
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,744
<i>You wanna play with my tits?</i>

611
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,051
<i>I know Brandon would really like it,</i>

612
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:12,216
<i>and I know exactly what Brandon likes</i>

613
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,635
Come on.

614
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,941
Where are you taking me?

615
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,883
Come on. You'll see.

616
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,112
- No, where are we going?
- Come on.

617
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,526
You want a drink?

618
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,932
What are you looking at?

619
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,631
This view is amazing.

620
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,113
Hey.

621
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,862
Are they vintage?

622
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,464
A little bit.

623
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,698
- I love it.

624
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,551
Oh, yeah.

625
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,035
Brandon?

626
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,022
You know, it's cool. It's okay.

627
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,763
Should I go?

628
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,389
Sure.

629
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,136
I can walk you down.

630
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,540
That's okay.

631
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,479
Can I get you a drink?

632
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,008
No.

633
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,888
Fuck.

634
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,485
Need a hand?

635
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,361
No. The hook's odd.

636
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,000
There you go.

637
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,028
David?

638
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,530
Pick up.

639
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,971
I take it you're at your pottery class.

640
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,646
Have you eaten?

641
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,047
No.

642
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,682
Are you hungry?

643
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,283
No.

644
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,775
Can you just give me a hug?

645
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,804
He's not gonna screw you again.

646
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,444
You left him a message, didn't you?

647
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,906
You can't help yourself.

648
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,379
It's disgusting.

649
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,347
Why are you so fucking angry?

650
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,486
Why am I so fucking angry?

651
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,959
That's my boss.

652
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:39,772
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.

653
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,468
What's the matter with you?

654
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,703
You know he's got a family, right?

655
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,548
- You know he's got a family?
- No.

656
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,314
You didn't see
the wedding ring on his finger?

657
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,855
No.

658
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,413
You're a liar.

659
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,023
I'm sorry.

660
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:08,599
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.

661
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,035
Well, at least I say I'm sorry.

662
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,103
Try doing something.

663
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,207
Actions count, not words.

664
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,143
I'm sorry.

665
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,814
I'm sorry.

666
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,215
I fucked up.

667
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,486
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.

668
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,953
Some people fuck up all the time.

669
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,100
Look, just forget it.

670
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,436
This isn't working out. Obviously.

671
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,176
You need to find somewhere else to live.

672
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,245
I don't have anywhere else to go.

673
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,624
This isn't about him.

674
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:11,924
I make you angry all the time
and I don't know why.

675
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,695
No. You trap me.

676
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,169
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.

677
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,308
"I've got nowhere else to go."

678
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,973
I mean, what sort of fucking shit is that?

679
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,516
You're my brother.

680
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:34,019
- So what? I'm responsible for you?
- Yes.

681
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,487
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.

682
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:39,492
No, I didn't give birth to you.
I didn't bring you into this world.

683
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,559
You're my brother, I'm your sister.
We're family.

684
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,962
- We're meant to look after each other.
- You're not looking after me.

685
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,899
- I'm looking after myself.
- I'm trying. I'm trying to help you.

686
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,369
How are you helping me, huh?
How are you helping me?

687
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,530
How are you helping me?

688
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,534
Huh? Look at me. How are you helping me?

689
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:02,513
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.

690
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:07,520
Do you understand me? You're a burden.
You're just fucking dragging me down.

691
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,945
How are you helping me?

692
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,583
You can't even clean up after yourself.

693
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,993
Stop playing the victim.

694
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,589
I'm not playing the fucking victim.

695
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:23,001
If I left, I would never
hear from you again.

696
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,197
Don't you think that's sad?

697
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,335
Don't you think that's sad?

698
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,974
You're my brother.

699
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,117
Why is it always so dramatic with you?
Everything is always the end of the world.

700
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,754
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.

701
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,693
I don't wanna talk.

702
01:14:55,824 --> 01:15:00,796
Try not talking. Try just listening
or thinking for a change.

703
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,110
Yeah, 'cause that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.

704
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,340
- I've got my own fucking apartment.
- Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.

705
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,439
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.

706
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,917
You have a job and an apartment.
I should be in awe of you.

707
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,511
Well, at least I'm responsible for it.

708
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,886
At least I don't
depend on people all the time.

709
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,858
- You're a dependency. You're a parasite.
- You don't have anybody.

710
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:23,020
You don't have anybody. You have me
and your fucking pervert boss.

711
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:26,089
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?

712
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,658
Don't talk to me about sex life, Brandon.
Not from you.

713
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,764
Whatever.

714
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,004
I'm going out.

715
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,704
Great. And then you'll come back

716
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,645
and we'll just have
the same fucking conversation again.

717
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,740
No, you'll move out.

718
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,050
And then I'll never hear from you again?

719
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,626
Hey.

720
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,257
Hey.

721
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,148
<i>You wanna get out of here?</i>

722
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,020
I could take you somewhere.

723
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,896
What, are you with someone?

724
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,770
Does he go down on you?

725
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,632
I do.

726
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,109
That's what I like to do.

727
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,392
<i>I like the way it feels.</i>

728
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,155
<i>I like the way it's just me and it.</i>

729
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,366
I wanna taste you.

730
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,572
I wanna slip my tongue inside you,

731
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,104
just as you come.

732
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,255
You want me to make you come?

733
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,460
I can do that. Want me to do that?

734
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,262
What's up, babe?

735
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,737
- I was just getting some drinks.
- Yeah, huh?

736
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,127
Whoa.

737
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,060
Not tonight, buddy.

738
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,768
I said not tonight.

739
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,282
I was just telling
your pretty girlfriend here,

740
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:14,286
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.

741
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,413
I mean, bone her real hard.

742
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,048
- Till she's clawing up my back.
- He's kidding.

743
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,752
This guy's funny.

744
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,999
After I fuck her hard up the ass,

745
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,763
I'll put my balls in her mouth
while I come in her face.

746
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,662
- You won't let me fuck you in the ass?
- Christ.

747
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,038
- You get to fuck her in the ass?
- You know.

748
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,873
Tell me more, man,
'cause I'm fucking loving this.

749
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,242
- Smell it.
- Yo!

750
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,509
- Jesus, come on.
- You motherfucker.

751
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:53,919
Hey, Romeo.

752
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,331
<i>Brandon, it's Sissy.</i>

753
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,502
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>

754
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,739
<i>Please, will you pick up the fucking phone?</i>

755
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,186
<i>Brandon, I need you.</i>

756
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,763
<i>We're not bad people.</i>

757
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,040
<i>We just come from a bad place</i>

758
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,443
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.</i>

759
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,416
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

760
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:40,092
<i>at this time, due to a police investigation,
we have to discharge this train.</i>

761
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:44,262
<i>Please fallow the conductor to
the rear of the train.</i>

762
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,532
Watch your step between cars.

763
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,669
Watch your step.

764
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,408
Follow me, please. Follow me.

765
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,379
Watch your step. This way.
This way. Quickly.

766
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,815
This way.
Nothing to see. Move on.

767
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,511
Right this way, please.

768
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:10,429
<i>This is Sissy. Leave a message.
Don't if you're an asshole.</i>

769
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,873
<i>- This is Sissy. Leave a...</i>
- Shit!

770
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,752
Shithead.

771
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,738
God!
