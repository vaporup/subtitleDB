00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Melancholy of Lars Von Trier

2
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,500
Part 1 JUSTINE

3
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sir...

4
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,150
You can back up a little more if you want...
I think you need that extra...

5
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't think he can hear you.

6
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,000
Sir, can you hear me up there?

7
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Can you copy, sailor?

8
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I think he's in a different county...

9
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
It's like five feet.

10
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
And now he stops. He's got five feet here.

11
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
That's good. Stop, stop, stop, stop!

12
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
Wait, wait, wait!

13
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're a little close.
I think he can keep going a little bit, maybe.

14
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:09,690
Oh, no, no, no.
He can't. I don't...

15
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
Be careful, please. It is not my car.
I will.

16
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,400
I promise.

17
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,500
Turn around to the left, please.
Stop there, sir.

18
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,350
Straighten up, sir.

19
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah, I think I'm good there, right?

20
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300
You're not even looking.

21
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I can see it's not looking good.

22
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:35,882
I'm a very experienced driver...

23
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,000
It's like really close on that side.
Really?

24
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, don't go any further forward. Just straight...

25
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,300
How do I put it in...?

26
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
What?

27
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:56,013
This way?

28
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Get out of the way.

29
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
Come on.

30
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,750
Sorry.

31
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,900
Yes, I know.

32
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,500
We're sorry.

33
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,500
I won't even bother saying how late you are.

34
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
Sorry. We're really sorry.

35
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,300
Hi.

36
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,800
Hi, Claire. So sorry.

37
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Hi.

38
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
We probably should have taken something smaller.

39
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
This brilliant idea was yours of renting a stretch.

40
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,000
This is very much not my project, okay?

41
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,900
I spent the whole week with the dullest man on earth.

42
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Not to mention the most expensive wedding planner on the planet.

43
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Okay, so you want this?

44
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah, of course.

45
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,500
So, when you're there... and that was two hours ago.

46
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,672
Okay.

47
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,681
All right, let's go.

48
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,000
What star is that?

49
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,040
I don't know.

50
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
John, you're a bit of an expert on stars,
aren't you?

51
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,800
I wouldn't say that.

52
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh, yes you would.

53
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,000
Which one are you looking at exactly?

54
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,100
The red one.

55
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,865
I'm amazed you can see that.

56
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,500
That's Antares. It's the main star in the Scorpio constellation.

57
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
Justine ...

58
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
We just have to go to the stables to say hello to Abraham.

59
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,500
No, you're not.
Oh, yes.

60
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
Who's Abraham?

61
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:49,154
Abraham.

62
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,900
Look, I'm married.

63
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Michael's my husband now.

64
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,900
I'm sure you two will like each other.

65
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Nice to meet you.

66
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm his mistress. I'm the only one who can ride him.

67
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,300
That's not exactly true.

68
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
What? Occasionally I take her for a ride.

69
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
See you later.

70
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,000
I can no longer be silent.
All the guests are waiting for more than two hours.

71
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,850
I know.

72
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm at the end of my rope.

73
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,900
Welcome to the reception of Mr. Steinam, Mr. Marko.

74
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Thank you.
Thank you, Little Father.

75
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Would you be so good as to to participate
in the wedding bean lottery?

76
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,300
Of course.

77
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Please submit your bid as to the total number
of beans in the bottle.

78
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Yes, er... two million and six beans.

79
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Two million and six beans.

80
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,900
Would you care to make a bid on behalf of your wife?

81
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, I don't dare to do that.
I really don't.

82
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Very well, we'll let madam's bid remain open.

83
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,300
We made it.

84
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
Hi, Mom.

85
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,770
Love that dress.

86
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,100
Congratulations Aunt Steelbreaker.

87
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
Thanks, Leo.

88
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
What's this?
A dagger.

89
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,034
Wow!

90
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,677
Sweetheart.

91
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Let me introduce you.
This is Betty... and Betty.

92
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Betty and Betty, this is my daughter, Justine.

93
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,800
Hi, nice to meet you.

94
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm gonna say hi to everybody.
Of course, of course.

95
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen ...

96
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,400
We waited a while for this.
A toast to the bride and the groom.

97
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,500
Justine and Michael.

98
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,400
The tray must go left to right ...

99
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
From left to right.

100
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,200
Justine, I don't want to make a speech.

101
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Why? Please.

102
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
What are you doing?

103
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
You'll see.

104
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Excuse me.

105
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Neither of the ladies sitting next to me
has been given a spoon.

106
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,800
I'd like very much to have one.

107
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,900
Excuse me.

108
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,600
You're terrible.

109
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,000
Waiter.

110
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Justine, would you mind slapping your father
for me hard, please.

111
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Tim.

112
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,500
Justine, listen up, goddammit.

113
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,500
As most of you know,
I'm here tonight playing sort of a double role.

114
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
On Michael's side, I'm best man.

115
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,500
And, coincidentally, I'm also the employer of the bride.

116
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
I've got nothing bad to say about the groom, but...

117
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,700
The bride ...

118
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,400
Justine ...

119
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,500
Gorgeous woman ...

120
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where's my tagline?

121
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,800
You were always great in coming up
with a tagline in a hurry.

122
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
What happened?

123
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,700
Did your emotional life suddenly take over?

124
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,500
Did finding the man of your life render you unable to work?

125
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm just asking because if I were to choose between

126
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:25,000
a woman for my dear friend Michael and an employee...

127
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,000
I would always choose the employee.

128
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
Advertising, Justine, advertising.

129
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Justine, you were way, way, way too good for advertising.

130
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,100
You know it, I know it, we all know it.

131
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,400
So thank you for staying with it.

132
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,750
I'm gonna let you and the rest of you
think about this tagline now

133
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,500
while I leak a bit of news.

134
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,500
Today the company hasn't lost a copywriter ...

135
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,900
The company has gained a new art director.

136
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,000
And that's you, Justine.

137
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,000
Congratulations.

138
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
Goddammit, you earned it.

139
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,500
The father of the bride wants a word.

140
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,900
My dear girl, you look...

141
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,900
glowing today.

142
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,900
And me, I'm just a little confused
what with all the Bettys at my table.

143
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Never seen you look so happy.

144
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
So, what can say without talking about your mother?

145
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
My wife of yesteryear.

146
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Which is exactly what I don't wish to do.

147
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,500
I don't think that I would be revealing any secret
if I were to say

148
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:20,000
that she can be very domineering at times.

149
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,000
Domineering?

150
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
What a load of crap!

151
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,900
For those who don't know who I am,
I'm Claire and Justine's mother.

152
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,100
Justine, if you have any ambition at all,

153
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,449
it certainly doesn't come from your father's
side of the family.

154
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

155
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,500
I wasn't at the church. I don't believe in marriage.

156
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,750
Claire, whom I have always taken for a sensible girl,

157
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:53,500
you've arranged a spectacular party.

158
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,400
Till death do us part and forever and ever...
Justine and Michael.

159
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
I just have one thing to say ...

160
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,900
Enjoy it while it lasts.

161
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
I myself hate marriages.

162
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Gaby, please.

163
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Especially when they involve my closest family members.

164
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Why did you even bother coming?

165
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Justine, come with me.

166
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Listen to me. We agreed that you weren't going
to make any scenes tonight.

167
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
The don't want any scenes.

168
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,400
No, we don't!

169
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:10,064
No.

170
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,600
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

171
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,900
But I didn't do anything.

172
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know what I mean.

173
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,242
Okay.

174
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,415
Okay.

175
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,200
Katherine has demanded the floor.

176
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,300
Where is the bride?

177
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,200
I've looked everywhere, no bride.

178
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,500
Now the groom is going to give a speech for the bride.

179
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,500
Dear Justine...

180
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,000
What are you doing to me?
I 've never given a speech before.

181
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm serious, I've never given a speech before.

182
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,500
Justine is the speaker.
She can say the most wonderful things, but ...

183
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,900
Then let her make the speech, damn it.

184
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Justine...

185
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I love you so much...

186
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And never dreamed that I would have
such a gorgeous wife.

187
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,800
I believe that I'm the luckiest man on Earth.

188
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,800
I love you.

189
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,500
That's kind of it. That's all I have.

190
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,080
Hello, everyone, we're going to move to the living room

191
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,789
so that we can clear some tables.

192
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,800
Then the newlyweds will dance.

193
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:07,000
And then, at eleven thirty,
the bride and groom will cut the cake in here.

194
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
He wants to be put to bed.

195
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,600
Sweety, you did so good.

196
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,800
I wanna do it.

197
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,700
No, tonight's your night.
No, please.

198
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Are you sure?
Yeah, come on.

199
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,900
Good night, sweetheart.
Come on, come here.

200
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,200
Are you comfortable?

201
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,500
When are we gonna build caves together?

202
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,000
We're gonna build lots of caves together.
Just not  tonight.

203
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
You're still my aunt Steelbreaker, aren't you?

204
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes. It's exactly who I am.

205
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Justine ...

206
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Hi, Claire.

207
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm just taking a little nap.

208
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Don't nap, it's your wedding.

209
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're not even halfway through yet.

210
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,500
No. you're right.

211
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
I have to pull myself together.

212
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
What's going on, Justine?

213
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,900
I'm trudging in through this...

214
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:48,776
Praying really hard.

215
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's clinging to my legs.

216
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
It's really heavy to drag along.

217
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,000
No, you're not.

218
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,000
I know you'll hate to hear it.

219
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't say a word to Michael.

220
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,500
You think I'm stupid?

221
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,700
I'll get her.

222
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
And my mom, too.
Yeah.

223
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,300
Justine, It's John.
We're ready to cut the cake, sweetheart.

224
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
Please come downstairs as soon as you can, okay?

225
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Gaby...

226
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Gaby...

227
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,400
Gaby, I'm sorry to disturb you,
but we're ready to cut the cake.

228
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,200
When Justine took her first crap on her potty,
I wasn't there.

229
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,200
When she had her first sexual intercourse,
I wasn't there.

230
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,400
So give me a break, please,
with all your fucking rituals.

231
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,400
Unbelievable, fucking unbelievable.

232
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,750
Everyone, thank you for being so patient.

233
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,500
We're just having a little issue with the wedding dress.
She'll be right down.

234
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,100
Those bitches have locked themselves in their bedrooms
and now they're taking a bath.

235
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Is everybody in your family stark raving mad?

236
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,800
This is embarrassing.
I know.

237
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,400
We should have put showers in the guest wing.
I've said it a hundred times.

238
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,100
For fuck's sakes, if people want to linger in a bath,
stay at home.

239
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,025
Here we offer you an 18 hole golf course,
where else would they get that?

240
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Nowhere.

241
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Unbelievable!

242
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,850
That's it, she's out.
What, Justine?

243
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,000
Your mother.

244
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,900
Unbelievable.

245
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,500
She ruined my wedding. I will not look at her.

246
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Outstanding.

247
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,438
My God, we cut it.

248
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,200
No, don't say that.

250
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,800
You should never say you're sorry.

251
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,000
I can see that you're not feeling well tonight.

252
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,500
You should have seen you weren't ready yesterday.

253
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
I haven't been taking care of you lately.

254
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,900
It's my fault.

255
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Can we talk somewhere?
Of course.

256
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,900
Sit down, please.

257
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
I wasn't going to give you this until tomorrow.

258
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I found our plot of land.

259
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
They call it Empire apples.

260
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,000
They're bright red and very sweet.

261
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,900
But with the perfect tartness.

262
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
I had one as a kid.

263
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,800
Beautiful, huh?

264
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,965
In ten years' time, when the trees have grown
you can sit in the shade, in a chair.

265
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
If you still have days when you're feeling a little sad ...

266
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,700
I think that will make you happy again.

267
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
It's very sweet.

268
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah?

269
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
No wonder you've been so busy.

270
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I signed the deed for it yesterday,
I didn't want to tell you.

271
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Here.

272
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,110
No, you should have it,

273
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,410
I want you to have it with you all the time
and hold on to it.

274
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,900
So you can look at it once in a while.

275
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,400
I'll always keep with me.

276
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,000
Maybe we can have a little swing
hanging from one of the trees.

277
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
We'll talk about that when the time comes.

278
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, no... of course.

279
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,700
When the time comes.

280
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,500
Goodbye.

281
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,000
You'd better be goddamn happy.

282
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes, I should be.

283
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,850
I really should be.

284
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,000
Do you have any idea how much this party cost me?
A ballpark figure?

285
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:55,117
No.

286
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,400
I don't.

287
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,700
Should I?
Yes, I think you should.

288
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,800
A great deal of money.

289
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,800
A huge amount of money.

290
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,900
In fact, for most people, an arm and a leg.

291
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
I hope you feel it's well spent.

292
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, that depends on whether or not we have a deal.

293
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,100
A deal?
Yes, a deal.

294
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,400
That you'll be happy.

295
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,400
Yes, of course. Of course we have a deal.

296
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,900
Good.

297
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,900
Congratulations.

298
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,200
I tried to throw your mother out.

299
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes, you usually do.

300
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,100
Yes, I do.

301
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Thank you.

302
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,500
It's a wonderful party you've given me.

303
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,450
How many holes are on our golf course?

304
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,500
Eighteen.

305
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,300
That's right.

306
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,700
Happy? Yeah.

307
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,700
This is the young man.

308
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,300
Congratulations.
Thank you.

309
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm Tim.
Hi, Tim.

310
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Tim started working for us two days ago.

311
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,300
He happens to be my nephew, but ignore that.

312
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Tim thought I wouldn't be able to squeeze that tagline
out of you tonight.

313
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,600
I thought it might be difficult.

314
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,000
You're colleagues. I hired him the moment I heard
about his education.

315
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,550
What education is perfect if you want to make it
in Public Relations?

316
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,600
Tim?

317
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,950
None at all, of course.

318
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,900
It was almost too perfect.

319
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,000
He knows nothing. I hired him on the spot.

320
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,300
And at a very good salary. What do you say, Tim?

321
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,000
A very good salary.

322
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Welcome, then, Tim.

323
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,750
There's just a slight catch
to a very good job with a very good salary.

324
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
The salary is very good.

325
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,150
Why, what are you pushing Tim into doing?

326
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,800
To get that damn tagline out of you tonight.

327
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,300
Otherwise he's out on his ear, which sucks,
considering the debts he's in.

328
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Goodbye.

329
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Once you give her a job, she won't let go.

330
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,900
You gotta be there at the time of birth,
so you follow her now.

331
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,400
I mean, get that tagline.

332
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,300
Do let me know if the tagline's there
and I'll jot it down.

333
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
Spare me.

334
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
I'll go out for a minute.

335
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm really sorry.

336
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,500
I'm thrilled about this wedding
and I know it's costing John a lot of money.

337
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
John's filthy mouth...
He needs to shut up about it.

338
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,500
It 's not about the cost.

339
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
It's just that I thought you really wanted this.

340
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,500
But I do.

341
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,100
Michael has tried to get through to you all evening
to no avail.

342
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
That's not true.

343
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I smile and smile and smile ...

344
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,500
You're lying to all of us.

345
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,600
Don't you miss this?

346
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
What do you want in this place?

347
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,000
You 've no business here.

348
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,500
Nor have I.

349
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,500
Your sister, it seems, is somewhat bewitched by you.

350
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,661
Mom...

351
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,500
I'm a bit scared.

352
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,000
A bit?

353
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'd be scared out of my wits if I were you.

354
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,500
No, it's something else, I...

355
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm frightened, Mom.

356
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,000
I have trouble walking properly.

357
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,800
You can still wobble, I see.

358
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,000
So just wobble the hell out of here.

359
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
Stop dreaming, Justine.

360
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm scared.
We all are, sweetie.

361
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,500
Just forget it. Get the hell out of here.

362
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
No, thanks.

363
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,500
Everybody, excuse me.

364
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Could you all follow us outside, please.

365
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,300
Betty, Betty, Betty ...

366
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,800
Another glass, please.

367
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,050
Are you really called Betty?

368
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,700
No sir, sorry.
Don't worry about it.

369
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,000
Dad, can we talk?

370
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,400
Could you sit with me for a little while?

371
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,200
Wait. What?

372
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,900
Wait.

373
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,500
Get out of me.

374
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,800
Michael, can you give me a moment?
What's happened?

375
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,500
Just give me a moment, please.
What's happened?

376
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,900
Can I have a moment, please?

377
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,200
Yeah... of course.

378
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,900
Can you zip me?

379
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,900
Are you okay?

380
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:40,251
Okay.

381
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,700
Hi.

382
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,900
Good night. Have a good time.

383
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
I'm on my way home, my darling.

384
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,000
Please, Dad, I really need to talk to you.

385
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,600
Little Father ...

386
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,800
My dad would like to spend the night.
Is there a room available?

387
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,800
Room number eight is vacant.

388
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,965
We could prepare that for your father.

389
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,800
Well ..
Yes, my father likes that.

390
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,000
Then we can have breakfast in the morning.

391
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,000
Justine...

392
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,000
Why don't you come and have onion soup with us?

393
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,600
Tim. Get us some soup.

394
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
How's your wonderful night going?

395
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,000
It's too bad about Tim.

396
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,500
What about Tim?

397
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,500
He got fired.

398
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,900
He didn't last many hours in the business, but ...

399
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:27,800
then again, it's a rather unpredictable one,
you're king one day and beggar the next.

400
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,800
So you go back to wherever you came from,
right buddy?

401
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm glad we found each other, Jack.
I was looking for you.

402
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,400
Didn't I tell you? She can't stop working,
not even on your wedding night.

403
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I had nothing at the dinner ...

404
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,500
But I've been playing with an idea for a small campaign.

405
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,700
The problem is, how do we effectively hook
a group of minors

406
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,000
on our substandard product,

407
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,100
preferably in a habit-forming way?

408
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,000
And I've reached a conclusion in regards to the tagline.

409
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,520
I was just thinking, what if ...

410
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:13,402
instead...

411
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:18,300
we try to sell you to the public, Jack?

412
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,600
Then, surprisingly,
I arrived right back where I started from.

413
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,000
At nothing.

414
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,200
Nothing? It's not such a bad tagline, Jack.

415
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Would my newly fledged aide please
expand a little on the thoughts of the tagline?

416
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,000
Nothing is too much for you, Jack.

417
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,900
I hate you and your firm so deeply

418
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:56,800
I couldn't find the words to describe it.

419
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,500
You are a despicable, power-hungry little man, Jack.

420
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,800
Is that a resignation?

421
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,100
'Cause there aren't too many jobs out there,
I tell you.

422
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,200
I broke my plate.

423
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,200
So I...

424
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,070
I guess we'll...

425
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,035
take off now.

426
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,800
Yes.

427
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,000
This could have been a lot different.

428
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,500
Yes, Michael, that have been.

429
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,600
But, Michael ...

430
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
what did you expect?

431
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah.

432
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,500
You're right.

433
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,200
Claire...

434
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Sometimes, I hate you so much.

435
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,900
The way I see it, you're now short of a boss
and a husband.

436
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,900
Could I, in all my humility, offer my services?

437
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,500
You have the ideas, I have the head for business.

438
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,800
We could be the perfect couple.

439
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,800
We've had good sex.

440
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,800
I don't think that's a very good idea.

441
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,791
No.

442
01:01:24,865 --> 01:01:25,865
No.

443
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,900
Excuse me, the result is ready.

444
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,100
What?

445
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,500
The number of beans in the bottle has been arrived at.

446
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,500
And?

447
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,650
Six hundred and seventy-eight.
That's the final count.

448
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,350
Six hundred and seventy-eight?

449
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:46,000
And none of the guests got it right.

450
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:46,900
Really?

451
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,800
Some were pretty close, but no one guessed right.

452
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
Incredible.
You could say that.

453
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,600
Incredibly trivial.

454
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,900
But that's the result of the competition.

455
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,950
And a lot of people would like to know the result.

456
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,500
And then there is the prize.

457
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,000
Throw it away.

458
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,800
Dad...

459
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,144
To my beloved daughter, Betty.

460
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,500
I'm as proud of you as any father could be.

461
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,900
But I couldn't find you and I was offered a ride home
I couldn't refuse.

462
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,000
See you soon. Kisses from your stupid dad.

463
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,900
Justine, wake up.

464
01:03:35,668 --> 01:03:36,668
Wake up.

465
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
We're going for a ride.

466
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,300
I tried, Claire.

467
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,800
Yes, you did.

468
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,800
You really did.

469
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,500
Come on.

470
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,000
Come on, Abraham, come.

471
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,500
Come on, lets go. Come on!

472
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,600
The red star is missing from Scorpio.

473
01:05:40,455 --> 01:05:42,355
Antares is no longer there.

474
01:06:01,411 --> 01:06:07,610
Part 2 CLAIRE

475
01:06:57,094 --> 01:07:01,992
I swear to God, your sister can't do anything by herself.

476
01:07:04,093 --> 01:07:06,292
Hello, darling. How are you?

477
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,590
Just do as I've told you.

478
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:16,630
There's a taxi down the street waiting for you.
I already told her that.

479
01:07:19,185 --> 01:07:22,584
Just open the door, and get in.

480
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:23,789
Unbelievable.

481
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:27,183
Just get in the cab, darling.

482
01:07:28,284 --> 01:07:31,584
Well, then call me back if you can't make it to the cab.

483
01:07:31,787 --> 01:07:34,588
We'll pay for it when you arrive.
Don't worry about it.

484
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,982
We'll see about that.

485
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,785
I love you, darling.

486
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:43,181
Please, John, she's my sister.
Oh, please!

487
01:07:43,587 --> 01:07:45,988
She's a bad influence on you and Leo.

488
01:07:46,086 --> 01:07:47,286
She's ill.

489
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,580
Right.

490
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:59,386
Have you been going online again?

491
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:03,587
Claire, you promised.

492
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,280
I'm afraid of that stupid planet.
That stupid planet?

493
01:08:08,581 --> 01:08:10,782
That wonderful planet, you mean.

494
01:08:11,282 --> 01:08:14,581
First it was black, now it's blue.

495
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:17,984
Blocking Antares, hiding behind the sun.

496
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:22,783
Darling, this is going to be the most amazing experience
we will have in our lives.

497
01:08:22,818 --> 01:08:26,181
It won't be here in five days,
and it is not going to hit us.

498
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:29,083
Just like it didn't hit Mercury, as we knew it wouldn't.

499
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,434
And it didn't hit Venus, as we well knew it wouldn't.

500
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:34,179
And it won't hit Earth, as we know it won't.

501
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:36,184
Claire, look at me.

502
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:39,783
Sweetheart, you have to trust a scientist.

503
01:08:40,977 --> 01:08:43,127
They say that it will hit...

504
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,277
No they don't, that's not true.

505
01:08:45,383 --> 01:08:46,933
Not the real scientists.

506
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:49,681
Now, the prophets of doom they'll write whatever they can to get attract attention.

507
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,280
But the real scientists, all of them agree.

508
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:55,380
Melancholy is just gonna pass right in front of us.

509
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,982
And it's gonna be the most beautiful sight ever.

510
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:03,282
Now, I wish you'd watch it through the telescope with me.

511
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,780
Please.
No, I'd better not.

512
01:09:20,978 --> 01:09:22,378
Son of a bitch.

513
01:09:37,776 --> 01:09:41,677
When are we going to build those caves,
Aunt Steelbreaker?

514
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,775
Sweetheart, not right now.
We're gonna do that in a little while.

515
01:09:44,959 --> 01:09:45,959
Okay?

516
01:10:32,573 --> 01:10:34,274
She's still sleeping.

517
01:10:35,975 --> 01:10:38,477
Yes, but she has to get up now.

518
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:42,072
What are you making?

519
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:43,770
Meatloaf.

520
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,073
Meatloaf?
Yes.

521
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:50,575
If that's doesn't get her out of bed, nothing will.

522
01:10:52,072 --> 01:10:55,975
Time to wake up, Justine. No more sleeping.

523
01:10:57,272 --> 01:11:02,371
Going to take you to a nice bath.
How would you like that? Come on.

524
01:11:04,775 --> 01:11:09,675
You 'll see you'll like it.
I promise. Come on.

525
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:16,268
I'll wash you, okay?

526
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,372
Just lift your foot.

527
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,368
Go on.

528
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:29,073
Lift your foot.

529
01:11:31,272 --> 01:11:33,171
You need a bath.

530
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:40,271
You need to wash. Right?
I'm so tired ...

531
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,366
Come on, try.

532
01:11:44,068 --> 01:11:45,667
I can not.

533
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,364
Justine, you'll like it.

534
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:05,070
See?

535
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:11,115
It's nice, it's a nice bath.

536
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,567
Justine ... Please.

537
01:12:21,765 --> 01:12:23,266
Okay, so...

538
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:25,670
We've practiced for tomorrow.

539
01:12:28,163 --> 01:12:31,062
And I have a surprise for you for dinner.

540
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:34,665
Can you smell it?

541
01:12:36,663 --> 01:12:38,162
Meatloaf?

542
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:39,967
Surprise!

543
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:24,565
It tastes like ashes.

544
01:13:32,964 --> 01:13:35,265
It's all right, sis.

545
01:13:41,861 --> 01:13:45,762
Auntie  Steelbreaker's crying.
Don't worry, son.

546
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,760
Do you want to go back up?

547
01:14:06,963 --> 01:14:08,564
May I be excused?

548
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,360
Take one more bite.

549
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,762
Look.

550
01:14:40,254 --> 01:14:44,251
It's a planet that has been hiding behind the sun.

551
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:47,759
And now it passes by us.

552
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:50,254
It's called a Fly by.

553
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:04,656
It's not something you need to frighten
aunt Steelbreaker with now.

554
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:13,654
If you think I'm afraid of a planet,
then you're too stupid.

555
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:27,946
Just a few things we're gonna need
in case of Melancholy gets really close.

556
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:36,844
Look, I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't mention this to Claire.

557
01:17:39,142 --> 01:17:41,241
She gets anxious so easily.

558
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:58,142
Come on, Justine.

559
01:18:09,243 --> 01:18:10,744
Take it. That's it.

560
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:23,740
Come on, Justine, take him out.

561
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:26,941
Justine, take him out!

562
01:18:49,243 --> 01:18:50,343
Come on.

563
01:18:51,843 --> 01:18:53,143
Come on!

564
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:55,436
Come on!

565
01:18:57,845 --> 01:18:59,344
Don't beat him!

566
01:18:59,393 --> 01:19:00,541
Come on!

567
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:07,744
Justine, don't beat him!

568
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:23,140
Stop.

569
01:19:48,237 --> 01:19:50,237
There it is.

570
01:19:50,736 --> 01:19:53,135
There's your Fly by.

571
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,420
You don't touch the instrument.
Come on Leo.

572
01:24:28,618 --> 01:24:30,119
Look.

573
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:35,668
Our son has invented a very fine device.

574
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:40,818
If you adjust the steel
and point it towards the planet from your chest

575
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:45,916
it'll tell you how fast it's approaching
and ultimately how fast it will recede.

576
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:47,524
Okay.

577
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:56,217
Leo...

578
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:58,516
What are we excited about?

579
01:24:58,616 --> 01:25:01,066
Tomorrow night.
That's right.

580
01:25:04,914 --> 01:25:06,714
Wow, that's amazing.

581
01:25:06,914 --> 01:25:09,914
Amazing isn't it?
Let me look.

582
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:49,508
Earth & Melancholia
Dance of Death

583
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,906
John!

584
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:23,510
John!

585
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,707
Coming.

586
01:27:33,506 --> 01:27:38,106
We're prepared for this. The power will be back on
in a few days.

587
01:27:47,003 --> 01:27:48,303
Claire...

588
01:27:50,202 --> 01:27:52,951
Tomorrow evening Melancholy will pass us by

589
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:55,707
and you'll never have to see it again, okay?

590
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:58,103
So it won't hit us?

591
01:27:58,204 --> 01:27:59,903
Not a chance.

592
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:05,006
What if your scientists have miscalculated and...

593
01:28:07,404 --> 01:28:09,305
They haven't.

594
01:28:10,705 --> 01:28:12,603
You promise?

595
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:17,601
Of course I do.

596
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:21,103
I promise.

597
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:29,702
It's rising again.

598
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:31,707
Just like the moon.

599
01:28:31,752 --> 01:28:34,650
Because of the Earth's rotation.

600
01:28:34,703 --> 01:28:37,303
Exactly like they said it would.

601
01:28:57,603 --> 01:29:01,204
Are you hungry?  No, thanks.

602
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,599
Are you okay?
Yeah.

603
01:29:23,702 --> 01:29:25,702
Do you plan to kill us all?

604
01:29:27,703 --> 01:29:30,302
Maybe I should take those.
Don't touch them.

605
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,700
Don't you touch them.

606
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:57,496
Justine, come and have a bath.
I've had a bath.

607
01:29:58,698 --> 01:30:01,099
Really?
Yes, I'm very clean.

608
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:05,696
Little Father didn't come to work.

609
01:30:06,295 --> 01:30:09,192
I checked the noteboard.
He didn't leave one.

610
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,599
I tried to call him, but maybe something's wrong
with the phone.

611
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:21,098
You see, it's never happened before
that he didn't come to work without giving us notice.

612
01:30:23,093 --> 01:30:24,692
Does he have a family?

613
01:30:24,797 --> 01:30:27,197
He lives in the village...

614
01:30:27,498 --> 01:30:29,698
I do not know if he has a family.

615
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:34,697
Maybe this is a time when he needs to be with them.

616
01:30:45,393 --> 01:30:48,094
It'll pass us by tonight.

617
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:53,790
John is quite calm about it.

618
01:30:54,695 --> 01:30:56,595
Does that calm you down?

619
01:30:57,092 --> 01:30:58,893
Yes, of course.

620
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:02,495
Well, John studies things. He always has.

621
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:14,890
The earth is evil.

622
01:31:17,089 --> 01:31:19,190
We don't need to grieve for it.

623
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:22,188
What?

624
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:24,592
Nobody will miss it.

625
01:31:31,192 --> 01:31:33,992
But where would Leo grow up?

626
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,593
All I know is ...

627
01:31:41,989 --> 01:31:44,989
Life on earth is evil.

628
01:31:45,686 --> 01:31:48,086
There may be life somewhere else.

629
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:49,890
No, there isn't.

630
01:31:49,991 --> 01:31:51,789
How do you know?

631
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,840
Because I know things.

632
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:57,688
Oh, yes, you always imagine, you did.

633
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:59,791
I know we're alone.

634
01:31:59,892 --> 01:32:02,590
I don't think you know that at all.

635
01:32:10,688 --> 01:32:13,687
Six hundred and seventy-eight.

636
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:16,289
The bean lottery.

637
01:32:17,188 --> 01:32:20,688
Nobody guessed the amount of beans in the bottle.

638
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:23,190
No, that's right.

639
01:32:23,235 --> 01:32:25,683
But I know.

640
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:28,689
Six hundred and seventy-eight.

641
01:32:30,988 --> 01:32:33,188
Well, perhaps...

642
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:35,686
What does that prove?

643
01:32:35,985 --> 01:32:37,886
That I know things.

644
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:45,588
And when I say we're alone...

645
01:32:47,482 --> 01:32:49,583
We're alone.

646
01:32:50,183 --> 01:32:53,584
Life exists only on Earth.

647
01:32:55,686 --> 01:32:58,387
And not for long.

648
01:33:04,186 --> 01:33:07,486
I can stay up all evening till the middle of the night...

649
01:33:07,533 --> 01:33:12,684
when we get to see the planet fly by,
and I get to look at the telescope.

650
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:16,588
Yes, of course, darling.

651
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:20,583
But are you sure you can stay up that late?

652
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,479
You haven't slept much lately.

653
01:33:22,533 --> 01:33:23,833
Yes, I can.

654
01:33:23,887 --> 01:33:26,585
Can't I, Auntie Steelbreaker?

655
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,179
Can't I?
Yes, you can. Of course you can.

656
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:57,681
It's eleven. It's almost here.

657
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,680
Leo, sweetheart.

658
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,180
It's time to wake up.

659
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,021
Leo.

660
01:34:09,372 --> 01:34:10,372
Leo.

661
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:14,882
There.

662
01:34:51,175 --> 01:34:53,175
Leo should be watching this.

663
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,779
My God.

664
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:28,673
There.

665
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,578
Take a look.

666
01:35:54,971 --> 01:35:56,873
Are you afraid?

667
01:36:01,175 --> 01:36:03,276
No, it looks...

668
01:36:04,374 --> 01:36:05,875
It looks friendly.

669
01:36:05,923 --> 01:36:07,674
Yes.

670
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:11,570
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.

671
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:15,768
My God.

672
01:36:53,272 --> 01:36:55,273
I'd like to raise a toast.

673
01:37:01,367 --> 01:37:02,866
To life.

674
01:37:05,469 --> 01:37:08,368
To life? What do you mean, to life?

675
01:37:09,665 --> 01:37:12,265
You said it was going to be okay.

676
01:37:15,066 --> 01:37:17,566
There was no sense in alarming everybody.

677
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:20,068
So, you're saying that our lives were in danger?

678
01:37:20,118 --> 01:37:21,669
No, I was saying...

679
01:37:21,922 --> 01:37:26,702
No, I'm saying that when dealing with science
and calculations of this magnitude...

680
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:30,664
you have to account for a margin of error.
That's all I'm saying.

681
01:37:36,464 --> 01:37:37,963
I'm sorry.

682
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:47,565
It's not fun any more.

683
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:50,665
Actually it's moving away from us as we speak.

684
01:37:51,962 --> 01:37:54,613
You just can't see it through the naked eye.

685
01:37:58,267 --> 01:37:59,965
Come here.

686
01:38:04,665 --> 01:38:06,664
Put this to your chest.

687
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:12,300
Aim it up at the planet.
Hold on.

688
01:38:14,963 --> 01:38:17,562
Is that right?
Yes.

689
01:38:17,663 --> 01:38:21,662
In five minutes... it'll be smaller.

690
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,260
I can't breathe.
Just relax, relax.

691
01:38:50,316 --> 01:38:52,964
This is normal. It's taking part of our atmosphere.

692
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,561
For a little while, it's gonna make us winded.

693
01:38:55,665 --> 01:38:58,164
Just try and breathe calmly.

694
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:02,958
Just breathe.

695
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,460
Just breathe.

696
01:39:06,561 --> 01:39:07,961
There you go.

697
01:39:08,461 --> 01:39:10,560
Just try to breathe calmly.

698
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,260
There you go.

699
01:39:28,255 --> 01:39:30,605
Please, can I look now?

700
01:39:31,858 --> 01:39:33,657
Of course.

701
01:39:45,761 --> 01:39:47,562
It's smaller.

702
01:39:49,061 --> 01:39:50,360
Of course it is.

703
01:39:50,657 --> 01:39:53,657
It's smaller! It's smaller!

704
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:55,959
Sure. Of course it is.

705
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:04,311
It's moving away from us at over
sixty thousand miles an hour.

706
01:40:07,454 --> 01:40:09,656
For heaven's sake...

707
01:40:10,653 --> 01:40:12,653
Come here.

708
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,055
Mom...

709
01:40:24,656 --> 01:40:26,656
We have to stay up...

710
01:40:29,553 --> 01:40:32,153
I wanna look through the telescope ...

711
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:35,257
Breathe calmly.

712
01:40:42,155 --> 01:40:44,354
Be happy, please.

713
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:47,451
If I dare, you can do it.

714
01:40:48,949 --> 01:40:51,651
I'm happy you're happy.

715
01:40:53,955 --> 01:40:56,357
You have it easy, don't you?

716
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:02,553
I imagined the worst thing possible.

717
01:41:03,653 --> 01:41:07,555
That's right, Claire.
Sometimes it's easy being me.

718
01:41:20,653 --> 01:41:22,552
Hi, darling.

719
01:41:25,448 --> 01:41:28,148
Do you want tea?
No, thank you.

720
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:30,252
Something to drink?

721
01:44:22,753 --> 01:44:23,753
John!

722
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:25,842
John!

723
01:44:28,868 --> 01:44:29,868
John!

724
01:44:33,706 --> 01:44:34,706
John.

725
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:42,191
John.

726
01:44:45,165 --> 01:44:46,165
John.

727
01:44:56,144 --> 01:44:57,144
John!

728
01:45:38,633 --> 01:45:43,033
I can't find John. Do you know where he is?

729
01:45:44,532 --> 01:45:45,433
No.

730
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,634
I was just listening.

731
01:45:53,585 --> 01:45:55,636
There's something different.

732
01:45:59,633 --> 01:46:03,133
The horses... They've come down.

733
01:46:51,628 --> 01:46:52,628
John...

734
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:58,226
Good morning, Mom.

735
01:48:00,523 --> 01:48:02,124
Get a blanket.

736
01:48:15,523 --> 01:48:17,523
Justine, breakfast.

737
01:48:29,222 --> 01:48:31,020
Where's John?

738
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:34,421
He rode to the village.

739
01:48:37,925 --> 01:48:40,125
Why didn't he just take the car?

740
01:48:41,225 --> 01:48:43,526
Abraham needed a ride.

741
01:48:44,626 --> 01:48:46,626
Since you never ride him.

742
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:52,922
Come with me.

743
01:49:53,116 --> 01:49:54,614
Justine ...

744
01:49:56,121 --> 01:49:57,621
Come!

745
01:50:31,919 --> 01:50:33,020
Claire...

746
01:50:54,016 --> 01:50:57,615
Claire. Dammit... what...?

747
01:50:57,764 --> 01:50:58,764
Claire.

748
01:51:13,617 --> 01:51:17,616
Where are you going?
To the village. Come.

749
01:51:17,812 --> 01:51:19,911
This has nothing to do with the village.

750
01:51:20,209 --> 01:51:21,610
Get in!

751
01:55:11,598 --> 01:55:15,099
I want us to be together when it happens.

752
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,599
Outside on the terrace.

753
01:55:28,598 --> 01:55:31,295
Help me, Justine.

754
01:55:31,595 --> 01:55:34,497
I want to do this the right way.

755
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:37,595
Better do it quickly.

756
01:55:39,395 --> 01:55:42,894
A glass of wine together, maybe?

757
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,098
You want me to have a glass of wine on your terrace?

758
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:49,600
Yes, would you do it, sis?

759
01:55:51,094 --> 01:55:53,292
How about a song?

760
01:55:57,095 --> 01:55:59,394
Beethoven's Ninth ...

761
01:56:00,496 --> 01:56:02,396
Something like that?

762
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:07,092
Perhaps we could light some candles.

763
01:56:09,595 --> 01:56:12,596
You just want us all to gather on your terrace

764
01:56:12,592 --> 01:56:15,591
sing a song and have a glass of wine...

765
01:56:16,196 --> 01:56:18,096
the three of us.

766
01:56:20,392 --> 01:56:23,092
Yes, that would make me happy.

767
01:56:29,592 --> 01:56:32,091
Do you know what I think of your plan?

768
01:56:34,927 --> 01:56:36,127
No.

769
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:39,589
I only think that he might like it.

770
01:56:43,993 --> 01:56:46,092
I think it's a piece of shit.

771
01:56:50,095 --> 01:56:51,995
Justine, please...

772
01:56:54,991 --> 01:56:57,091
I just wanted to be nice.

773
01:56:57,139 --> 01:56:59,390
Nice?

774
01:57:00,588 --> 01:57:03,289
Why don't we meet in the fucking toilet?

775
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,093
Then let's not.

776
01:57:08,589 --> 01:57:10,589
You're damn right, let's not.

777
01:57:16,591 --> 01:57:20,593
Sometimes I hate you so much, Justine.

778
01:58:12,588 --> 01:58:17,089
I'm afraid that the planet will hit us, anyway.

779
01:58:25,587 --> 01:58:30,085
Don't be... please.

780
01:58:31,082 --> 01:58:33,582
Dad said there is nothing to do, then...

781
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:35,585
Nowhere to hide.

782
01:58:42,587 --> 01:58:47,587
If your dad said that,
then he's forgotten about something.

783
01:58:52,386 --> 01:58:55,585
He's forgotten about the magic cave.

784
01:58:56,084 --> 01:58:59,486
The magic cave...
Yep.

785
01:59:05,082 --> 01:59:07,582
Is that something everybody can make?

786
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:11,580
Aunt Steelbreaker can.

787
01:59:28,783 --> 01:59:31,584
All right, let's go find stick, all right?

788
02:01:31,269 --> 02:01:33,069
Hold my hand.

789
02:01:37,777 --> 02:01:39,275
Close your eyes.
