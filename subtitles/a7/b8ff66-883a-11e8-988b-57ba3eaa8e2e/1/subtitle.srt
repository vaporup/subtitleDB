1
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,609
He is wearing bullet proof vest!

2
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:58,767
Shoot his head only!

3
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:24,194
Although you saved me from the jail

4
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,491
It doesn't imply that
I'm out of danger now

5
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,802
From the day
we joined the Green Dragon Society

6
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,331
We two seemed
to be having life imprisonment

7
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,101
But this jail of Green Dragon Society,

8
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,434
is too big for us to escape

9
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:41,441
In these 20 years,
I've done many successful cases

10
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:45,008
But the failure
of the assassination of Princess Yuki

11
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,713
is caused by my wrong judgement

12
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,086
I know pretty well
about the rules of our society

13
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,494
Even I've made many contributions

14
00:03:56,563 --> 00:04:00,761
No matter how many contributions
I have had

15
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:05,095
It can't compensate my fault

16
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:15,279
You've been tailing me for 3 months,
what do you want?

17
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,907
We are working
for our master respectively

18
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,551
I work for my client

19
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,547
Remember, I'm a city soldier

20
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,248
I'm May Yiu

21
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,222
Release the princess now

22
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:33,858
I won't remember
the name of a dead person

23
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:53,348
My fate and my eyes...

24
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,381
is ruined by this woman

25
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,122
I've never begged you, right?

26
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,156
Kill her for my sake!

27
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,656
Then, I can die at ease

28
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,620
I'll do it!

29
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,253
My good student!

30
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,868
A good master will not treat
his fellows badly

31
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:13,102
My life, is my deposit

32
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:25,350
Silver Fox,
I'll pay the rest in my next life

33
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,586
See you!

34
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:43,534
Master,
this grave is specially prepared for you

35
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,362
Die in peace

36
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:16,530
Sorry, I'm late

37
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:27,804
May I know...

38
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,531
May I know what are you looking?

39
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,030
Be patient!

40
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:53,630
You'll see the greatest invention
of the world soon

41
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,636
Siu Chuen, what're you talking?

42
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,541
May's sister is testing
her new invention now

43
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:01,539
This is called "Suffocate bullets"

44
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:02,813
A bullet can be suffocated

45
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:05,109
I'm successful now!

46
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,077
The gas tube exploded!

47
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:12,755
How are you, sister

48
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,458
May I know, is it dangerous?

49
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,296
Stay back!

50
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,240
Let me use my "dagger bomb"

51
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,314
Stand behind the yellow line

52
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,624
Successful!

53
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:49,789
Is it a prize?

54
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,765
Sister!

55
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,201
Don't look at me

56
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:58,795
From my experience

57
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,834
This is a natural retreat

58
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,836
This is not related to my new invention

59
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:04,602
Do you agree?

60
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,879
Softer please!

61
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:16,522
I'm hurt by a grenade,

62
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,691
not a needle

63
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,652
This is the information sent
by the police

64
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,327
Who do you think is the one
who murdered Old Eagle?

65
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,492
The only one...

66
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:30,965
is the best friend of him

67
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,104
Called Silver Fox

68
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,664
Silver Fox?

69
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:39,176
May, please don't take this case!

70
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,446
Since you're still young,

71
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,240
quit your job and get marry

72
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,942
Once upon a time...
someone told me these too

73
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,489
When I worked in the office

74
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,716
I dreamt of exciting life

75
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,860
Later, I met you and May

76
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,395
Then started my life as city soldier

77
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,561
After these years...

78
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:04,032
Suddenly, I hope to have ordinary life

79
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,941
You won't understand!

80
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,600
If I ask, from the sun and the moon,

81
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:12,745
which one will you choose?

82
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,309
I'll choose cake

83
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:16,409
What?

84
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,508
Don't you understand? Is it too abstruse

85
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,085
Both of us can't understand
what we are talking

86
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,185
One is attentive

87
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,090
One is active

88
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:36,391
Both of them can't stay together

89
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,697
Sister, Siu Chuen gave me a ring

90
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:42,973
He asked me to consider our marriage

91
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,841
Maybe, I'm only the secret admirer

92
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:52,050
Actually, Ching hasn't mentioned...

93
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,684
his love to me

94
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,990
Maybe, he doesn't like me

95
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,920
Do you love the concubine?

96
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,491
Damn it!

97
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,364
It's time to propose to May

98
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,432
I think she'll like this ring

99
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:19,339
Hi

100
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,078
Why are you so happy?

101
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,578
I won't tell you

102
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:27,986
But it'll be useless for you to know it

103
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,254
Ask May to tell you then

104
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,253
Do you know the murderer of Old Eagle?

105
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:35,661
Wrong!

106
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:37,689
Guess again

107
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:38,998
I can foresee something

108
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,766
The case of Old Eagle will be a trouble!

109
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,560
If any of us die

110
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,269
The one left should take care of May

111
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,470
My God! What a big mouth?

112
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,239
You are like a nosy bitch!

113
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,875
I'm serious

114
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,372
Although they are not involved
in that case

115
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:56,480
Take my advice,

116
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,412
don't let them stay with you so oftenly

117
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,216
Why?

118
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,517
Why?

119
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:05,055
You've killed Old Eagle indirectly

120
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:05,748
If Silver Fox knows that

121
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,415
they are so close to you

122
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:10,461
They'll be in deep shit!

123
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:11,628
Also...

124
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:12,991
What a horrible scream?

125
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,665
We've to pick Siu Chuen's sister up now

126
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,532
Where is your sister?

127
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:19,965
Behind the door

128
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,807
Kidding?

129
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,976
She'll be the wall paper definitely!
I'm leaving

130
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,081
Tonight is the right time

131
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:08,147
Some experts said it's the best time
to propose in a full moon night

132
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:12,418
If May receive my ring,
she'll be very happy

133
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:15,026
She must be eager to know
where our marriage would be held

134
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,594
St. John or Po Lin Temple?

135
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:22,401
Brother Ching, you're too selfish!

136
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,433
After your marriage with May,

137
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,606
Siu Chuen will become lonely!
How poor is he!

138
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,268
It doesn't matter!

139
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,069
We'll treat him some nutrious soup

140
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,373
What'd you like to drink?

141
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,145
I want something to drink

142
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:37,347
Daily soup is the best

143
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:39,412
You want daily soup now?

144
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:40,484
Would you want herbal tea too?

145
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,780
Why not buy some snacks too?

146
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,481
Palms, cakes, etc

147
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:48,191
OK, I'll buy if any

148
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,589
Thank you

149
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:04,404
Do you think
tonight is specially romantic?

150
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:07,035
Really? I don't think so

151
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,170
We've been here for many times

152
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:10,873
No!

153
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:14,778
I think tonight is specially romantic!

154
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,291
Thank you,

155
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,152
you finally show your affection to me

156
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,201
What are you doing?

157
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,230
Have you discovered...

158
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:37,502
the wooden chair we are sitting
is rather special?

159
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,746
What? Nothing special!

160
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:46,173
No, there is some black mark

161
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,953
Who made it?

162
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,826
This is a box!

163
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,632
Who left this here?

164
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,838
Is...

165
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:13,840
is...

166
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,686
Ching!

167
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,351
May, it's yours

168
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:25,354
Thank you

169
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:26,622
Soft drink

170
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,190
Why do you have red face?

171
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:33,255
Because I haven't eaten daily soup...

172
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:35,427
and cakes

173
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,366
Do you understand?

174
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,399
One'll have red face
if lack of daily soup and cake

175
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,400
But I want to cook
some soup for you in future!

176
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:46,144
Ching is so difficult to understand!

177
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:50,182
You'll have red face
if you don't eat cakes

178
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:56,377
How is your consideration?

179
00:14:58,558 --> 00:14:59,991
Give me some more time please

180
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:02,958
I'll go to the toilet

181
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,958
It's mine, the ring is mine

182
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:40,688
Marry me

183
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,795
That's it! You needn't speak in English

184
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,494
You can talk in English too

185
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,031
"You are the one that I want
Oh! Oh! Oh!"

186
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:51,007
"You are the one that I want
Marry me, OK?"

187
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,576
Can you understand what I'm talking?

188
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,643
You needn't understand

189
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:59,442
This is one method of proposing

190
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,144
Maybe, use the 2nd method

191
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,748
You want me to marry you?

192
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,485
Not that easy! Can you wait?

193
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,935
What? 3 to 7 years?

194
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,764
It doesn't matter,

195
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,529
the most important thing is to marry me

196
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:21,934
I'll do what you want

197
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:26,669
What?

198
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:30,204
Are you brother Ching?

199
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,948
Are you the sister of Siu Chuen?

200
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:38,881
Why are you so short?

201
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:39,922
Don't lie to me!

202
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:03,204
May

203
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:19,649
May

204
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,797
May, wake up!

205
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,762
Wake up!

206
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,385
Siu Chuen...

207
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,943
Follow me

208
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:58,722
I'll send you to hospital

209
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,958
We've no time

210
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,063
Ask Ching to take care of Wai Heung

211
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,025
Take care

212
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:16,406
Siu Chuen!

213
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,503
Siu Chuen!

214
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:26,910
Brother!

215
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:30,812
Brother!

216
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,425
Brother

217
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,365
If you don't want them to be in danger,

218
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:21,072
leave them

219
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:24,341
The target of Silver Fox is you only

220
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,378
When will I stop hiding?

221
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,375
He can't defeat us
if we join together, right?

222
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:33,683
If you don't listen to me, you'll regret

223
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:41,059
Sorry, I can't promise you

224
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:00,110
Only this way...

225
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,008
can make Ching stay out of danger

226
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:17,123
No! May won't love Siu Chuen

227
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,422
Let us send you to Macau

228
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:19,760
No!

229
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,123
Why do you want to stay in HK alone?

230
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,667
Shut up! I won't go back to Macau

231
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:28,505
My brother had promised me,
after this semester,

232
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:31,734
If I have good report,
he'd take me to HK

233
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:35,312
Can't you listen? He promised me

234
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:38,750
After the case of your brother,
I'll take you back to HK

235
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,283
Why should I listen to you?
You've no right to control me

236
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:43,015
Who do you think you are?

237
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,516
If your brother was still alive,

238
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:47,990
I'd have been your sister-in-law

239
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,993
My brother didn't mention you before

240
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,720
He didn't mention any sister-in-law

241
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,894
My brother won't marry you

242
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,060
You idiot!

243
00:22:58,404 --> 00:22:59,996
I'd marry your brother

244
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,038
You liar!

245
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,170
You are jealous

246
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,340
I know you love your brother

247
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:12,813
He belonged to you,
he should not love the other one

248
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,754
But there are many kinds of love

249
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:20,619
Yours love is between brother and sister

250
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,758
The love between your brother and me
is the love of romance

251
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:25,463
No!

252
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,325
The love between Ching and me...

253
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,131
is a kind of friendship

254
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,600
Liar! Ours is beyond friendship!

255
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:36,173
You can cheat her,

256
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,502
but don't drag me down

257
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:40,036
Tell her!

258
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,208
Tell her we are not just friends

259
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,280
Tell her!

260
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:46,810
Don't you want to tell the truth?

261
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,086
Tell her!

262
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:50,151
We are not just friends!

263
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:51,653
I don't know!

264
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:53,381
Since she doesn't know, just tell her!

265
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,459
We're not just friends!

266
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,288
Why don't you face the world?

267
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,125
This...

268
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,426
is not true!

269
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:04,726
We are friends since childhood

270
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,104
I know everything of you

271
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:08,705
When you smoke,
I'll light the cigarette for you

272
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,173
You get marry...

273
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:12,509
why didn't Chuen tell me either?

274
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:14,171
Hadn't he told you?

275
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:18,777
No!

276
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,676
If he told me, I'd have killed me

277
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:21,944
Silver Fox could have no chance!

278
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:23,218
What are you talking about?

279
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:26,658
Where are you going?

280
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,627
I don't want to listen your bull shit!

281
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:33,331
Siu Chuen was my fiance

282
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,965
He was the man I loved most

283
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,341
The tear is for myself

284
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:48,404
I can't help!

285
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,212
Well, let me forget Siu Chuen first

286
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:53,646
I'll meet you later

287
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,585
Hope I'll still remember you

288
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:05,029
Sorry

289
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:08,698
Only this way can make you safe

290
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,866
If you are upset now,

291
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:14,369
I'll be more upset

292
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:27,145
What are you murmuring?

293
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,381
Don't cry!

294
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,134
Brother said you'd take care of me

295
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,399
OK

296
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,162
You want to live with me?

297
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,469
You'd learn how to take care of yourself

298
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,542
I'm a city soldier

299
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,207
I don't want any burden

300
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:01,650
This is the 1st time...

301
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,084
I've seen a man's eyes with sorrow

302
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:09,718
From that day,

303
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:13,126
the lives of Wai Heung and me
changed a lot

304
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:15,490
She is no longer a simple pupil

305
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:17,759
She is an assistant of a city soldier

306
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,467
In this year,

307
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,469
I've learnt how to take care of myself

308
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:25,405
Also I've experienced...

309
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:27,408
Many first times with Ching

310
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,012
Our 1st time of hand in hand

311
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,512
Our first embrace...

312
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:42,494
Get up!

313
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:44,889
How can you be my assistant?

314
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,591
I can do it!

315
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:51,560
Damn you! Watch me!

316
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:53,900
I'll teach you a lesson!

317
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:56,834
From that day onwards,
every time I go with him

318
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:58,801
My heart beats very fast

319
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,072
Isn't it called first love?

320
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,972
I wonder
what kind of 1st love Ching is having

321
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:26,493
In this year, everytime thinking of May,

322
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:28,902
he'll play his sword for 45 mins

323
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,333
He's so good in playing sword!

324
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,207
If he was born in the past,

325
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,643
he'd have been a romantic swordsman

326
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,849
When will he play the sword for me?

327
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,574
What is called love,
what is righteousness?

328
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:16,610
It's you again!

329
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,153
Why do you call so many times a day?

330
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,315
You call at least 3 times per day!

331
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,623
Is it funny to do so?

332
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,087
I don't know May's address!

333
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,532
You are devil!

334
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,598
You'll bring bad luck to me!

335
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:31,099
I wonder what's my bad luck this time

336
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,600
Oh my dress!

337
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:38,341
Am I your enemy?

338
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,000
Do you want a revenge now?

339
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,204
You always give me trouble!

340
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,077
If it was burnt a little bit lower,
I could make it as trousers

341
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,980
Now it's just a waste!

342
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,416
You want to know where is May?
Let me trap him!

343
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,648
Who is calling?

344
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,917
Oh my face!

345
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:58,854
Can it be trust?

346
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:07,929
Tomorrow is my 12th birthday,

347
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,002
will Ching celebrate with me?

348
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:33,554
Tomorrow is a very impressive day of you

349
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,132
Your lover will leave a kiss
on your face

350
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:11,996
Happy Birthday!

351
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,537
Why there is $5000 left here?

352
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:27,580
Wai Heung, tonight is a very important
moment for us

353
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,711
I'll bring you to a very decent place

354
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,984
Take the money on the table and dress up

355
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:38,362
I'll pick you up at six

356
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,543
Wai Heung

357
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:55,711
I'm coming

358
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:01,545
Are you ready?

359
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,550
I'm coming

360
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:15,761
Oh, you?

361
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,162
What's wrong?

362
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,928
I don't want you to disturb me anymore

363
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:23,002
You really want to know where May is?

364
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,011
What do you mean?

365
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,047
I'm going to tell you

366
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,274
You'll tell me?

367
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,046
I'm a lady

368
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:36,385
Don't touch me

369
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:37,954
I'm sorry

370
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,514
Please tell me now

371
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,690
Today is an important day of May

372
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,885
Being her sister, I'm so glad

373
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,397
Is she going to marry?

374
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:48,900
She wants to cover her identity,
she is called Madam of Pets

375
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,659
Tonight, she'd choose her husband
from kung-fu competition

376
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,770
Take her address

377
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:58,242
If you have that guts,
go and take her yourself

378
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,144
No! She won't marry
with the other one except me! You liar!

379
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,478
I won't cheat you

380
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:07,515
Don't you believe?

381
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,847
Just stay here and have some snack

382
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:14,152
I tell you, you've no choice

383
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,687
Trust it or not,

384
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:17,328
you've to find out yourself

385
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:19,896
Moreover, it's the truth

386
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:29,397
You are in my trap now

387
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,266
Where is brother Ching?

388
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,103
He is going to marry,
he won't dine with you tonight

389
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,141
What are you talking about?

390
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,939
Oh! Thank God!

391
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,880
My sister will be in peace from now on

392
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,552
I don't believe

393
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,620
Trust it or not,

394
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,054
it's not up to you

395
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,504
The maids are beautiful

396
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:03,799
Yeah!

397
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,470
The maids are pretty,

398
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,475
I think the Madam is much more beautiful

399
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:12,444
Don't you know that...

400
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,642
all competitors tonight must be under 40

401
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,879
What? My face is older than my age

402
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,650
I'm 28 only

403
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,453
How can you talk to Mr. Ford in this way

404
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:23,555
Disappear now!

405
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:24,824
Wait...

406
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,990
Grannie, before the competition

407
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,328
Ford has kicked over 20 people away

408
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:35,835
He is quite good for our Madam

409
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,609
Invitation please

410
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:44,480
Sorry, I haven't

411
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:46,182
So you can't get in

412
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,210
I have it, but I've forgot to bring it

413
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,852
No invitation, no entry

414
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:55,191
Why there are...

415
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,055
so many competitors?

416
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:00,629
Sure! If anyone marries Madam of Pets

417
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,494
He is marrying
the greatest doctor of the world

418
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,598
You know, she is the best doctor

419
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,501
If you can't marry her

420
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,536
You can still drink the Tin-chi water

421
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,369
Which is good for health

422
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:20,214
I've got so many VIP cards, so I'm VIP

423
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,144
Save it

424
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:24,818
No invitation card, no entry

425
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,949
You have principle, haven't you?

426
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:30,191
I'm leaving!

427
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:33,956
I'm the friend of Madam

428
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,496
May! I'm Ching...

429
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,137
Grannie

430
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:47,274
Hey

431
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,804
Watch out...

432
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:50,709
If you keep on fooling around

433
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:51,974
I'll kill you!

434
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,476
I'm a friend of Madam!

435
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,880
We are friends since childhood

436
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,314
Look at you, I can tell you are lying

437
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,115
Is Madam...

438
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,690
called May?

439
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:01,682
Isn't it?

440
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,189
We can't tell her name so easily

441
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,020
Heung

442
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:06,229
Yes

443
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,525
The competition will start soon,
guard here

444
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,167
If anyone wants to mess up

445
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:11,759
Kill!

446
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,230
Got it!

447
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:15,030
Get lost

448
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:16,704
Get lost!

449
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:18,871
Madam is here!

450
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,017
I'm Ford,
it's my pleasure to meet you Madam

451
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,248
How are you?

452
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,818
To express my sincerity to you

453
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,289
I'd be the 1st one to take the challenge

454
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,019
Who'd come and fight with me?

455
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:12,925
Madam,

456
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,861
among the competitors,

457
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,330
Ford is the best one

458
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:17,762
I see

459
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,213
1, 2, 3, Magic!

460
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,042
Disappear!

461
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,409
Is it great?

462
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:38,453
Can I go in?

463
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,188
No!

464
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:07,511
Don't you know you're in great danger?

465
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,950
I think you are guest,

466
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:12,282
so I give you some face

467
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:14,322
But Grannie gave an order that,

468
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:15,754
I won't give you face anymore

469
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:18,184
So what does that mean?

470
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,991
Just try, I'll show you

471
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:26,669
Don't look down
upon the women of our Palace

472
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,600
We are...

473
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:29,671
specially trained!

474
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:33,802
I've to teach you a good lesson

475
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:41,445
Mr. Ford's defeated all competitors

476
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:43,211
Who else would like to challenge?

477
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:48,051
I've come on time!

478
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,891
I've defeated all the useless men

479
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:55,232
According to the rules,

480
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,968
who is the winner,
who'll get marry with Madam

481
00:37:59,137 --> 00:37:59,728
No way!

482
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:00,768
Buddy!

483
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:01,405
Why?

484
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,437
I'm thinking of your own good

485
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:04,832
What?

486
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:07,440
Sure! You'd check the woman before!

487
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,510
How can you risk your life...

488
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,204
without having a glance of her face?

489
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,741
What kind of bullshit is it? Who are you

490
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:15,510
You?

491
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:17,449
OK!

492
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:20,757
I'll tell you the truth!

493
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:22,784
Madam is cohabiting with me

494
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:23,551
When?

495
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:24,294
It's a long story!

496
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:25,053
What are you talking?

497
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,791
We've 2 daughters

498
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,632
Now, she is pregnant again,
for 24 months!

499
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,732
Bull shit!

500
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,974
I recognize the dagger! May, it's you!

501
00:38:38,543 --> 00:38:39,703
Although you use different dagger,

502
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:42,672
I can tell it's you by the smell

503
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,611
A strange smell!

504
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,713
This dagger is for cutting
my tough skin of my feet

505
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:48,850
So, is the smell strong?

506
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,952
What?

507
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,118
Grannie should not laugh!

508
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,588
Don't mess up here!

509
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:00,523
Do you know who am I?

510
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:02,389
My enemy of course!

511
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:03,329
Don't you think you are my lover instead

512
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,201
May is my women

513
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,628
Can't you see...

514
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,338
her looking at me with love?

515
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:09,364
Catch him!

516
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:10,834
Again?

517
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:14,173
How smart is he!

518
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,002
Madam!

519
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,007
I'll do it!

520
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:22,884
Attack!

521
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,856
How is it?

522
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,426
I pretended being attacked!

523
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:32,320
This is a useful strategy!

524
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:33,756
Am I smart?

525
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:37,398
May,

526
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,167
do you know...

527
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,860
it's hard for me to find you?

528
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,239
What's wrong I have done?
Why don't you come to see me?

529
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:45,103
I know!

530
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,344
The death of Siu Chuen impressed you

531
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,977
But you'd not choose your husband
in such cheap way

532
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:52,374
If the pirate won

533
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,450
you'd have lived in the ship!

534
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,253
I think you've mistaken

535
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,289
I'm not May

536
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:00,889
If you want me to trust you,

537
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:02,920
leave your gauze to let me see your face

538
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:05,259
If you want me to leave my gauze

539
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,998
you'd defeat all the competitors

540
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,794
This is our rule!

541
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,525
Madam!

542
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:16,104
I won't change anything I set

543
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,436
He can come in this hall,

544
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,402
I'd give him this chance

545
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:23,277
OK,

546
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,573
you've your own reason

547
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:27,942
Do you want to marry May?

548
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:30,346
I'll make a dead set at you!

549
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,447
I'll chop your fingers off!

550
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,547
I've warned you

551
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,187
I'll make a dead set at you!

552
00:41:37,722 --> 00:41:38,984
Go back!

553
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:40,124
Yeah!

554
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:40,916
Hey!

555
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:43,657
Your beard!

556
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:45,492
Go!

557
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,896
Go!

558
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,799
He is the Romeo of this century!

559
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,938
I've tried so hard to defeat Ford

560
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:57,003
I think our marriage...

561
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:58,073
Grab his woman!

562
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:06,472
Get lost!

563
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,362
Do you know...

564
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:29,597
the result of removing my gauze

565
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,037
To marry you!

566
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:32,974
Your sister has told me!

567
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:34,106
I can't guess...

568
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:36,712
we'll be so romantic here

569
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,967
You are more beautiful than before!

570
00:42:58,803 --> 00:43:00,031
I can't match you, sorry

571
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:01,102
I'm leaving!

572
00:43:01,906 --> 00:43:04,306
Wait! How can you leave?

573
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:06,842
Don't force me!

574
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:09,571
Well, I won't push you if you don't
want to take the responsibility

575
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:11,772
I won't beg anyone

576
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,017
Why do you want to do that?

577
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:17,620
I think you were my woman

578
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,748
If you want to suicide

579
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:22,085
Kill me first

580
00:43:25,663 --> 00:43:26,891
Go!

581
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:32,892
I'm sorry!

582
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:50,113
You liar!

583
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:55,924
I'll take all your cards,
so you can't cheat anymore

584
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:15,879
Sorry,

585
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,381
I'm late for some personal business

586
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:20,043
Sorry!

587
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:25,052
Brother Ching!

588
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,123
Don't cry!

589
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,192
Happy birthday!

590
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,628
Although he kissed my forehead,

591
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:42,636
I'm so happy

592
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:45,741
Now, I'm 16 years old,
when I become taller,

593
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,935
he can't kiss my forehead

594
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:50,272
But my lips

595
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,382
I remember May used to come to our home

596
00:45:30,788 --> 00:45:33,382
at this time annually

597
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:35,750
She'll plant the Jasmin for us

598
00:45:37,128 --> 00:45:41,531
Because she knows that
Siu Chuen loved Jasmin most

599
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:47,228
Give me the pot

600
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:52,667
Don't you know,

601
00:45:52,844 --> 00:45:54,744
my brother loved this flower most

602
00:45:54,979 --> 00:45:56,913
Every Summer,

603
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,345
he used to bring me one

604
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:10,961
Actually, I love Jasmin

605
00:46:11,696 --> 00:46:12,720
I don't know why,

606
00:46:13,297 --> 00:46:16,596
everyone will think of Siu Chuen
when seeing Jasmin

607
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:18,566
Instead of thinking of me

608
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:23,300
Look! There are more Jasmin over there

609
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:24,496
How beautiful!

610
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:46,921
Miracle!

611
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:54,531
My jinx!

612
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:56,766
Don't go

613
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,439
Tell me where May is!

614
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,070
Find it from the Yellow Page Directory

615
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:02,004
Jinx...

616
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:12,246
I can't tell you are here!

617
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:13,385
Don't go!

618
00:47:15,426 --> 00:47:16,484
Jinx!

619
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:17,891
I'll kill you!

620
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:20,889
Go to hell!

621
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,798
Suffocate Bullets?

622
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,098
Where is May! Tell me!

623
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:31,533
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you

624
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:34,339
Retreat!

625
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,781
The Suffocate Bullet?

626
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,853
So why do you ask me?

627
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,578
It's me!

628
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:19,616
Drunken again!

629
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:23,687
Have a look please!

630
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:33,097
Wake up!

631
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,328
Are you concious now?

632
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:38,505
I'm leaving, thank you

633
00:48:58,596 --> 00:49:03,124
Wai Heung,
leaving without any notice is my style

634
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:06,197
Hope you'll not blame me

635
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:10,031
Cause I've finally traced out May

636
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:12,806
I've to find her

637
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:23,082
I've go to a very very long way

638
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,921
So, it's not convenient
to bring you along

639
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:27,884
I know...

640
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:30,887
you are a strong girl

641
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:33,992
You can take care of yourself

642
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:37,659
I'll come back, take care

643
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,512
What is love,

644
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:54,412
what is righteousness?

645
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:58,612
Or...

646
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:02,589
what is liar?

647
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,527
La...

648
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:29,350
It's me!

649
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,684
We are successful!

650
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,694
Ching is going to New York now

651
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:53,006
Just a phone no. Can...

652
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:54,906
drive him away

653
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:57,077
How can he dream that

654
00:50:57,248 --> 00:51:00,877
the real May is just next to him

655
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:04,315
So, you don't have to worry now

656
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:08,447
Even Silver Fox comes back,
he can't find Ching

657
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:14,797
Hello...

658
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,476
Come out!

659
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:34,375
Silver Fox!

660
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,645
Thank you for your call

661
00:51:40,024 --> 00:51:41,582
I know where she is now!

662
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:46,260
You bitch, you always disclose my place

663
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,154
Do you know it's dangerous?

664
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,860
What sort of danger?

665
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,533
Try my Thunder Bomb!

666
00:52:11,655 --> 00:52:12,815
You're hurt!

667
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:15,023
Why you're still here?

668
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:16,656
Jinx!

669
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,388
I beg you

670
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:22,095
I've said you are my jinx!

671
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:23,365
Don't come close to me!

672
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:25,936
May is so stupid to set such trap!

673
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:27,900
How can you be trapped! Jinx?

674
00:52:28,072 --> 00:52:29,164
Leave me alone

675
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,238
Or I'll teach you good lesson

676
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,602
Tell me where she is! Hurry up

677
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:34,275
Please... Don't come to me

678
00:52:34,445 --> 00:52:35,309
OK! Then you come out

679
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:39,073
Tell me where she is

680
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,217
OK... OK...!

681
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,146
But you must leave me alone
after I tell you

682
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:48,990
You've got it, right?

683
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:49,887
Not very clear

684
00:52:57,601 --> 00:52:59,762
Bastard! You'd call the ambulance for me

685
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:03,096
I'm so poor

686
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:15,914
Where are you, Brother Ching?

687
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:17,644
Listen, Silver Fox has been back

688
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:18,788
It's very dangerous for you
to stay alone

689
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:20,947
You'd go to May, I'll come back at once

690
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:23,693
May? Where is she?

691
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:27,027
Opposite?

692
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,291
You mean over the Jasmin?

693
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:33,594
Ask me to stay with her?

694
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:37,731
Why don't you phone to her by yourself?

695
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:39,270
Don't ask too much

696
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:40,543
The line is busy!

697
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,105
Go and tell her for me

698
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:43,246
That's all

699
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:49,019
It'll be faster by taking short cut

700
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:17,473
Sister May...

701
00:54:25,522 --> 00:54:29,856
Sister May...

702
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:36,426
Sister May...

703
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:47,103
Who are you?

704
00:54:47,277 --> 00:54:49,438
What are you doing here?

705
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:52,846
Where is May?

706
00:55:11,668 --> 00:55:13,932
Silver Fox, I've waited you for one year

707
00:55:14,171 --> 00:55:16,469
Now, we'll take a revenge for Siu Chuen

708
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,258
I'll use your life to pay for my eye

709
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,604
A metal tailing machine

710
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:18,624
Super dagger!

711
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,198
Let you try my Horrible Angel

712
00:58:01,405 --> 00:58:02,133
May!

713
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:14,081
May!

714
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:28,064
Are you OK?

715
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,492
How are you?

716
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:35,561
Don't go!

717
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:44,327
Hey!

718
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:47,433
What are you doing? It's a gun!

719
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:54,042
May, why there is smoke coming
from his body?

720
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:56,171
Brother Ching, be careful!

721
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:00,009
Don't let him stick to your body!

722
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,108
Don't worry, he is under control now

723
01:01:05,355 --> 01:01:07,550
No, I am under his control!

724
01:01:08,425 --> 01:01:10,893
You like it? Go ahead!

725
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:13,424
Watch out!

726
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:14,825
I want to make your bones broken

727
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:18,125
Let me go! I feel painful

728
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:20,269
Faint! Please let me down!

729
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:39,851
Wai Heung!

730
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,462
Go!

731
01:02:09,553 --> 01:02:11,714
She is shot twice by my "Horrible Angel"

732
01:02:11,988 --> 01:02:14,081
She has 24 hours left

733
01:02:14,758 --> 01:02:17,249
After that, she'll lose control

734
01:02:17,494 --> 01:02:19,962
And becomes my slave, forever

735
01:02:20,597 --> 01:02:23,532
May Yiu, I have to find you

736
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:51,153
Hey, this is a hospital!

737
01:02:51,328 --> 01:02:52,158
You can't go in!

738
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:53,296
Call the doctor for me!

739
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,258
You can't go in!

740
01:03:00,537 --> 01:03:01,526
Brother Ching?

741
01:03:03,206 --> 01:03:04,503
Brother Ching!

742
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:17,047
You have waken up!

743
01:03:18,455 --> 01:03:19,945
Why don't you go in?

744
01:03:26,963 --> 01:03:28,191
May has told me

745
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:33,563
When she forgets Siu Chuen,
she'll come to me

746
01:03:35,472 --> 01:03:36,871
If she wants to see me

747
01:03:38,275 --> 01:03:39,606
She'll find me

748
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:54,923
May doesn't love brother at all

749
01:04:00,063 --> 01:04:01,360
When she was unconcious

750
01:04:01,765 --> 01:04:03,460
She has been calling your name

751
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,665
Calling me?

752
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:44,934
Do you know?

753
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:47,510
Everytime I look at your window

754
01:04:47,979 --> 01:04:51,039
I'll think, what will the people
inside think about...

755
01:04:51,215 --> 01:04:52,739
if they see...

756
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,316
those jasmin

757
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:04,623
Now, I know

758
01:05:06,129 --> 01:05:08,723
In this year

759
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,093
Everytime I see you through the window

760
01:05:13,503 --> 01:05:16,097
I hope to be with you

761
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,565
I see Wai preparing your dinner

762
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:22,611
I hope I were the one who cooked

763
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:33,552
But it was too late!

764
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:37,917
Will you remember me?

765
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:39,993
I will...

766
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,994
You have to remember,
what does May look like

767
01:05:45,168 --> 01:05:47,329
If I become a Horrible Angel

768
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:49,835
you'd destroy me

769
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:53,072
Remember!

770
01:05:58,448 --> 01:05:59,506
May

771
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:02,050
May

772
01:06:08,058 --> 01:06:10,959
It's useless for you to point at me

773
01:06:11,127 --> 01:06:12,617
She is a plant now

774
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:14,855
I can extend her life only

775
01:06:15,031 --> 01:06:16,589
I can make her recover

776
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:18,233
Stop talking that to me

777
01:06:18,668 --> 01:06:20,499
or I'll kill you

778
01:06:20,737 --> 01:06:21,567
Don't you believe?

779
01:06:23,673 --> 01:06:24,571
It's you

780
01:06:24,774 --> 01:06:25,433
Why you are here?

781
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,442
Oh my ass!

782
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:31,609
Jinx! What do you want?

783
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:32,777
Follow me!

784
01:06:36,886 --> 01:06:38,877
How to save her? Tell me!

785
01:06:40,723 --> 01:06:41,781
Go ahead!

786
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,987
I beg you

787
01:06:46,162 --> 01:06:47,891
Please let me die in peace

788
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:49,822
You shot me, you know?

789
01:06:51,968 --> 01:06:53,560
Everyone knows that
you are an Encyclopedia

790
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:57,237
Tell me! How to save May?

791
01:06:57,841 --> 01:06:58,739
Lock the door!

792
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,577
But you'd save me first

793
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:04,609
I'm a human being

794
01:07:04,814 --> 01:07:07,476
My blood is flooding out

795
01:07:08,184 --> 01:07:08,946
What do you want?

796
01:07:10,086 --> 01:07:11,951
OK, I'll stop the blood flooding

797
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:12,813
How?

798
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:14,152
By my finger

799
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:16,786
No, I'll tell you

800
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:18,356
Go ahead!

801
01:07:20,797 --> 01:07:23,766
Or I'll help you again

802
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,295
OK, I'll tell you

803
01:07:25,502 --> 01:07:27,970
To make her concious, why one would do

804
01:07:28,138 --> 01:07:29,105
What?

805
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:31,466
The frozen water of Tin Chi
in the Pet Palace

806
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,035
Frozen water of Tin Chi?

807
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:34,771
Can I buy one in the store?

808
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:36,969
Get lost!

809
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,540
It can only make her concious

810
01:07:39,782 --> 01:07:42,546
To save her from Horrible Angel,

811
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:43,808
only one doctor...

812
01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:45,045
can do it!

813
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:45,913
Who is it?

814
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:47,756
Hey...

815
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:48,958
She is Madam of Pets

816
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:54,993
Where are you going?

817
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:58,363
Oh my Suffocate Bullets! Where are they?

818
01:07:58,535 --> 01:07:59,797
He stole it, for sure

819
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:02,163
What shall I do now?

820
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:04,704
Shit! May and Ching have gone

821
01:08:04,974 --> 01:08:06,168
They must have gone to Pet Palace

822
01:08:06,342 --> 01:08:07,604
I've to call the police

823
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:10,437
Madam of Pets?

824
01:08:12,382 --> 01:08:15,476
Madam, Madam...

825
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:19,782
How dare you enter our palace
without permission?

826
01:08:19,956 --> 01:08:22,356
I want to see you, Madam

827
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:24,249
Please call her out!

828
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:26,027
Madam will not see you!

829
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,092
Please ask her out!

830
01:08:27,697 --> 01:08:28,994
You want to see her? Defeat me first!

831
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,562
So big!

832
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,838
Poor eye sight!

833
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:39,400
Suffocate Bullets! Let's go!

834
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:41,869
You'd blame yourself!

835
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:07,600
How are you?

836
01:09:09,372 --> 01:09:10,430
I...

837
01:09:21,918 --> 01:09:23,886
You give me up because of this woman?

838
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:25,952
I've found my woman

839
01:09:27,323 --> 01:09:29,757
Please save her!

840
01:09:30,293 --> 01:09:31,282
Save her!

841
01:09:32,262 --> 01:09:33,388
Don't you think I'll save her?

842
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:38,231
You abandon our Madam

843
01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:40,263
We won't save you two

844
01:09:40,637 --> 01:09:41,433
Get lost!

845
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:44,365
I want to beg for mercy

846
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:47,533
So, I'll not leave even you scold me

847
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,109
I just want you to save my woman

848
01:09:54,117 --> 01:09:55,414
Your woman

849
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:57,044
Kick her out!

850
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,016
Yes!

851
01:09:58,221 --> 01:09:58,949
Stop!

852
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:00,486
Madam!

853
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:03,215
Please don't angry with her

854
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:05,959
I...

855
01:10:06,195 --> 01:10:08,129
I can't think any other way

856
01:10:08,364 --> 01:10:09,558
So I have to beg you

857
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,430
Please save her

858
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:12,965
You want me to save her?

859
01:10:13,403 --> 01:10:15,564
OK, I'll give you a chance

860
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:24,476
Kneel down in front of me and beg me

861
01:10:25,114 --> 01:10:27,139
Maybe, I'll consider your proposal

862
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:29,649
Come on

863
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:32,113
Kneel down!

864
01:10:33,656 --> 01:10:34,680
Don't

865
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:37,953
Even you promise to save me

866
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:39,994
I haven't promised to let you save me

867
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,198
He is my man, I won't let him kneel
in front of me

868
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:48,397
So he won't kneel down
in front of other woman

869
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:55,203
Don't!

870
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:58,947
If you don't do it, she'll die

871
01:10:59,716 --> 01:11:02,150
I'll give you 6 hours for consideration

872
01:11:02,618 --> 01:11:04,142
After that,

873
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,413
the Horrible Angel will be effective

874
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:09,581
Then, it'll be useless for you
to do anything

875
01:11:11,627 --> 01:11:14,095
Please remind me

876
01:11:14,764 --> 01:11:18,427
I've to see Ching lossing his woman

877
01:11:19,268 --> 01:11:20,701
I won't let you see it!

878
01:11:21,337 --> 01:11:22,395
I'll make you blind first!

879
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:35,549
Leave her alone!

880
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:43,214
Leave her alone?

881
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:45,684
OK! Beg me

882
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:48,287
Beg me, I'll let her go,

883
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:50,665
and I may save her

884
01:11:51,401 --> 01:11:52,766
Come and beg for mercy

885
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:56,133
No! Don't do that!

886
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:17,183
Brother Ching!

887
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:22,856
Now you can save her now

888
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,657
I won't

889
01:13:30,299 --> 01:13:31,926
Have you ever being rejected?

890
01:13:32,502 --> 01:13:33,764
I'll let you taste...

891
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:35,494
the bitter fruit of being rejected

892
01:13:39,509 --> 01:13:40,908
I know it now...

893
01:13:42,078 --> 01:13:44,376
It's bitter of being rejected

894
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:49,642
I won't blame her

895
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,150
Because I've done something wrong first

896
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:54,847
Now,

897
01:13:58,261 --> 01:14:00,024
it's just fair to her

898
01:14:01,564 --> 01:14:03,930
I asked her
not to push me some day before

899
01:14:05,468 --> 01:14:08,096
I don't want to push her now

900
01:14:10,339 --> 01:14:11,806
Since she doesn't want to save you

901
01:14:13,876 --> 01:14:15,104
Let it be!

902
01:14:15,845 --> 01:14:17,142
Let's go

903
01:14:36,632 --> 01:14:38,623
I've no way to save May

904
01:14:39,936 --> 01:14:41,062
But I can...

905
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:44,304
stay with May forever...

906
01:15:22,011 --> 01:15:25,105
I can see through the window
in this house

907
01:15:30,586 --> 01:15:31,917
Excellent smell of the Jasmin

908
01:15:33,122 --> 01:15:34,248
Yeah!

909
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:38,849
The Jasmin is most beautiful tonight

910
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:40,128
Really?

911
01:15:44,266 --> 01:15:49,329
Can't you feel that,
here is specially romantic

912
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:54,074
Don't you feel it?

913
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:58,470
The moon specially full tonight

914
01:16:04,153 --> 01:16:05,882
Why there is a ring?

915
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:11,156
A wedding ring

916
01:16:12,795 --> 01:16:14,695
Who left this here?

917
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:21,736
It's...

918
01:16:26,142 --> 01:16:27,336
It's me!

919
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:36,841
I want to propose

920
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:43,014
Marry me!

921
01:17:08,718 --> 01:17:13,746
Why do you cry?

922
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:23,160
I miss this! Time is so short

923
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:26,558
I'll leave you soon

924
01:17:27,636 --> 01:17:30,799
I won't let you leave me

925
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:34,636
I've open all the gas pipe

926
01:17:37,012 --> 01:17:39,606
When you start to become Horrible Angel

927
01:17:40,349 --> 01:17:43,648
I'll explode the house

928
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,744
Ching!

929
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:49,221
We'll be burnt together

930
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:51,787
Ching!

931
01:18:10,045 --> 01:18:11,444
In my dictionary

932
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:13,542
There is no perfect ending

933
01:18:17,653 --> 01:18:18,779
Wai Heung!

934
01:18:32,101 --> 01:18:33,159
How are you?

935
01:18:33,569 --> 01:18:34,968
How are you?

936
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:36,330
Are you OK?

937
01:18:41,877 --> 01:18:44,243
I'm worrying no one'd attend our wedding

938
01:18:45,614 --> 01:18:46,740
You've come the right time

939
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:49,380
Your corpse is my wedding gift

940
01:18:50,186 --> 01:18:52,245
What a big mouth!

941
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:58,054
I'll kill you

942
01:19:02,832 --> 01:19:04,163
Same!

943
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:06,260
I've good preparation

944
01:19:13,509 --> 01:19:16,034
Let me eat this nutrition food first,

945
01:19:16,212 --> 01:19:17,042
come on

946
01:19:33,562 --> 01:19:35,189
My God!

947
01:19:35,364 --> 01:19:37,229
Every injection will...

948
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:38,866
increase the effect

949
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:44,537
Come again!

950
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,131
I see how much you can stand?

951
01:19:55,484 --> 01:19:56,712
But all will be effective...

952
01:19:56,886 --> 01:19:58,376
after 24 hours

953
01:19:58,554 --> 01:19:59,612
So it doesn't matter how much I was shot

954
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:04,784
Come on!

955
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:10,522
OK, I'll attack

956
01:20:42,731 --> 01:20:43,698
I'll catch you

957
01:20:50,406 --> 01:20:51,998
Why do you hide inside?

958
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:53,535
I'm locked

959
01:20:56,679 --> 01:20:59,170
Locked? OK! Attack!

960
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:03,315
You love chasing people? Watch me!

961
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:07,283
Fainting?

962
01:21:09,124 --> 01:21:10,557
Shacking?

963
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:16,255
Hey...

964
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,020
Go to hell!

965
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:45,957
Come again?

966
01:21:52,601 --> 01:21:55,832
Hey, you'd not bump your head
on the wall even you've lost

967
01:21:58,607 --> 01:21:59,665
You want to come out
by breaking through the mirror?

968
01:21:59,975 --> 01:22:03,103
Stop dreaming!

969
01:22:04,013 --> 01:22:04,741
Hold it!

970
01:22:07,016 --> 01:22:07,744
Don't go

971
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,528
I can't stand it

972
01:22:26,969 --> 01:22:27,993
I can't stand anymore

973
01:22:29,004 --> 01:22:31,097
Come and help me! Brother Ching!

974
01:22:31,507 --> 01:22:32,735
I'm coming!

975
01:22:37,813 --> 01:22:39,075
Pull tightly!

976
01:22:39,248 --> 01:22:40,306
I'm pulling!

977
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,939
Hey!

978
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:04,102
I've got it!

979
01:23:17,352 --> 01:23:20,048
4 Horrible Angels! Go to hell now!

980
01:23:27,996 --> 01:23:29,190
My God! Superman!

981
01:23:39,775 --> 01:23:40,901
Why do you fly so slowly?

982
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:44,543
Punch in!

983
01:23:49,518 --> 01:23:50,177
Again!

984
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:53,822
I'm faster!

985
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:03,528
May!

986
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:15,905
Finally will become my slave

987
01:24:29,992 --> 01:24:31,186
May...

988
01:24:38,133 --> 01:24:40,727
Wake up, May!

989
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:42,664
May...

990
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:57,816
Counter attack! She is not May!

991
01:25:11,099 --> 01:25:16,332
Brother Ching

992
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:21,238
Attack him, now!

993
01:25:24,846 --> 01:25:25,403
Brother Ching

994
01:25:25,581 --> 01:25:27,310
Go through May,
then she'll be your slave!

995
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:16,025
May!

996
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:17,095
May...

997
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:25,564
Let's go

998
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,741
Go! Forget about me!

999
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,326
Madam Pet?

1000
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,111
Go!

1001
01:27:07,082 --> 01:27:08,640
I'll go to hell with you

1002
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:18,624
Brother Ching!

1003
01:27:18,794 --> 01:27:20,193
Go! Forget about me!

1004
01:27:24,599 --> 01:27:25,896
Brother Ching!

1005
01:27:26,068 --> 01:27:28,161
Pull her out!

1006
01:27:32,074 --> 01:27:34,269
Don't pull me out!

1007
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:41,475
Brother Ching...

1008
01:27:55,097 --> 01:27:58,396
Save him! Save him now!

1009
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,459
Brother Ching!

1010
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:00,293
Don't go!

1011
01:28:03,572 --> 01:28:04,561
Brother Ching!

1012
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,104
What do you want?

1013
01:28:16,818 --> 01:28:18,376
Why do you do that to us?

1014
01:28:19,287 --> 01:28:20,845
You'll never be hurt
by the Horrible Angel...

1015
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:23,319
after taking this

1016
01:28:24,226 --> 01:28:25,523
Why do you have to save me?

1017
01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:30,593
I want you to be miserable
after lossing Ching!

1018
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:32,498
I won't...

1019
01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:35,499
let you die together

1020
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:13,803
Brother Ching

1021
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:17,169
Brother Ching!

1022
01:29:18,313 --> 01:29:19,245
Brother Ching!

1023
01:29:32,427 --> 01:29:34,987
Thank you for saving May

1024
01:29:37,766 --> 01:29:39,358
How dare you cheat Madam! Arrest him

1025
01:29:40,469 --> 01:29:41,367
Let's go

1026
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,901
Stop! Let them go!

1027
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,665
Madam isn't that stupid

1028
01:29:48,376 --> 01:29:50,003
But she wants
the perfect couple flee away

1029
01:29:51,012 --> 01:29:52,309
Perfect couple?

1030
01:29:52,614 --> 01:29:54,445
But Ching is injured
by the Horrible Angel!

1031
01:30:00,422 --> 01:30:02,390
Madam's put the solution...

1032
01:30:02,591 --> 01:30:03,956
on May already

1033
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:07,590
Brother Ching won't be dead

1034
01:30:30,285 --> 01:30:31,775
That was the last time...

1035
01:30:31,953 --> 01:30:33,921
I saw them

1036
01:30:34,456 --> 01:30:36,651
They've never come back to me

1037
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:41,092
Many years later, someone told me

1038
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:44,690
They appeared once in Tibet

1039
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:12,926
We'll remember you forever, Siu Chuen
