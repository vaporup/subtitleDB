1
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,120
That's her!

2
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,010
Myon?

3
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,130
Myon!

4
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,150
Very impressive!

5
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,550
"send message"

6
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,570
Hello?

7
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,930
"delivery failure"

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,820
"One Way/Osaka-Tokyo"

9
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,950
You live around here?!

10
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,080
Right under your nose, huh?

11
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,120
Um, wanna ride?

12
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,500
C'mon.

13
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,390
You wish!

14
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,120
You've got it all wrong!

15
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,530
Oh, sure.

16
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,040
I live with my sister, my dad lives with
a younger woman.

17
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,510
It's a joke.

18
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,510
Mom left one night when we bailed out.

19
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,280
Sorry I haven't kept in touch.
My life's kind of a mess, well, still is!

20
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,790
Don't worry!
Nice to see you're still the same... size.

21
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,550
Haven't they gotten bigger?

22
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,520
My breasts?

23
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,690
Huh, no, your feet! Let's find you a drugstore!

24
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,090
Better yet, a love hotel.

25
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,190
Hey!

26
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,640
Don't move!

27
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,070
Thanks!

28
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,370
Ouch!

29
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,540
What're you doing?

30
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,820
Nishi...

31
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,820
Um...

32
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,300
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

33
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,790
If I married him?

34
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,070
Married...

35
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,780
In junior high, I wrote her a note,
just "I like you a lot."

36
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,780
Next day, her turn, "me too."

37
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,910
Knocked me off my feet!

38
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,380
We were just 13,
never even held hands after school.

39
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,020
Being shy made things awkward right after...

40
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,250
...and we could only exchange letters, mails!

41
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,330
Two years later, during a school trip...

42
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,800
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

43
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,570
"Hotel Tariff"

44
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,610
Made me think! I never had the guts
to make a move, always playing it safe.

45
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,780
Always waiting for someone
to help things develop!

46
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,820
Nishi, what do you want?

47
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,420
You don't fight, you don't get hurt,
you want me to do all the work.

48
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,130
But that's unfair. 'Cos I'm scared too!

49
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,230
We're not school kids anymore, y'know?

50
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,710
What?

51
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,970
I...

52
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,150
I still love you. Don't marry that guy!
I've loved you since I was 9!

53
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,990
You should marry me!!

54
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm...

55
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,330
I'm really happy!

56
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,710
But I love him too.

57
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,180
But I'm so happy now!

58
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,350
Myon, I'm not sure I get it,
but give me some time!

59
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,860
Give me a chance, please.

60
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,190
OK, Nishi! Give it your best shot!

61
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,920
You bet!

62
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,960
Nishi?

63
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,430
Nishi? Nishi!

64
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,240
Think I'm too young to marry?

65
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,210
Yeah.

66
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,580
So, you'll be off limits to future suitors!

67
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,450
Some are crying themselves to sleep right now.

68
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,050
Well I hope you'll be really happy.

69
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,790
Too bad... you don't like me
like you used to...

70
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,160
What are you talking about?
I love you forever!

71
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,530
You haven't changed.

72
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,070
You can be sure about that!

73
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,700
You want to eat yakitori?

74
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,300
Sure!

75
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,310
My sister and I have our own place!

76
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,280
Really?

77
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,010
Gotta make a living!

78
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,680
We've given up on the loans.

79
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,750
I'm gonna run forever!

80
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,620
Cool!

81
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,260
- Hi. Hey, Nishi!
- Hi!

82
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,700
Nishi! What a surprise! Come sit over here!

83
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,400
Thanks!

84
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,940
Long time no see!

85
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,280
Yang, today's special, and a beer.

86
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,280
Have a drink first!

87
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,290
What've you been up to?
Working on your Mangas?

88
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,830
Yes! Got a job on the side.

89
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,230
You're going to Tokyo, right? Tokyo's great!

90
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,940
Lots of good looking women trying to make it
in TV, modeling.

91
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,640
When I got married,
I often went there on business!

92
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:07,090
I'd get invited to hostess bars where there'd
be a bunch of girls like that.

93
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,490
And I'd pick one out and... yum yum!

94
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,500
Students promoting stuff on the streets,
game show assistants...

95
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,330
- Sir...
- They sure were hot!

96
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,630
- You cheated?
- I was having fun, but they'd fall for me!

97
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,110
I had quite a rep, five girls in Tokyo,
three in Osaka, those were the days...

98
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,940
- Don't listen to him!
- Sorry about this.

99
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,040
Meanwhile, these two popped out and...

100
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,090
- You don't sound too thrilled!
- Had to take care of them!

101
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,850
So that was it!

102
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,030
Y'know, if I'd gotten together with
that promo-girl...

103
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,160
I wouldn't be broke now.

104
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,030
Stop dreaming!

105
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,570
That's him.

106
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,400
Yep, dad hasn't changed at all!

107
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,000
His girlfriend's the same age as me!

108
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,480
Picked her up at a loanshark's office!

109
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,950
Riko? She's not quite on par with
the others though!

110
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,180
So you just forgot about her?

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,020
What a waste! Like keeping roses in the can!

112
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,090
- What?!
- Your wife! You didn't deserve her!

113
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,220
Why are you taking her side?

114
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,070
'Cause I love the women of the Uchida family!

115
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,100
You were surrounded by
three of the most beautiful women!

116
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,650
I even planned a trip
to your home town last year!

117
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,310
Thinking the place'll be
swarming with girls like them!

118
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,320
Had to see the source!

119
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:55,090
Myon, maybe you should marry Nishi.
You'd be happier that way.

120
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,660
What're you talking about?

121
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,390
You love him. You wrote about him
all the time when you were in school!

122
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,910
- Wrote what?!
- Oh, Nishi this, Nishi that, Nishi, Nishi...

123
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,070
Dad!!

124
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,670
Ryo's nice too! But I prefer Nishi!

125
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,010
Hi!

126
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,780
Hi!

127
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Ryo.

128
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,620
Sir?

129
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,650
Don't mind him!

130
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,520
This is Nishi.

131
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,660
This is Ryo!

132
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,960
Hi. Heard a lot about you! Pleased to meet you!

133
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,030
Same here.

134
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,260
Beer?

135
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,130
Yes!

136
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,930
Did you hear about Kenta's accident?

137
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,060
Yeah.

138
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,770
So please be careful.

139
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,500
Here Nishi!

140
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,710
Thanks!

141
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,210
You do Mangas, right?

142
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,190
Nishi promised to do one about me!

143
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,850
Yes, something naughty and sexy!

144
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,150
Can't wait...

145
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,420
Stop it!

146
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,960
Something nasty and kinky!

147
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,150
I wanna see that!

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Good looking guy, great bod',
seems trustworthy...

149
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,630
But wasn't something a little...

150
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,400
...odd when you came in?

151
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,270
We were talking about ME,
'bout how I'm the one for Myon.

152
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,690
You're in the way pal, a third wheel,
can't you see it?

153
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,520
I shouldn't embarrass her by competing
with him. Don't want to make them feel awkward.

154
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,990
I'll get my truck on the 25th!

155
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,930
Congratulations.

156
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,200
Carries a 5 ton load! I'll be making money!

157
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,240
- You're a truck driver?
- Thanks.

158
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,880
I used to do things like that! Hard stuff!!!

159
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,110
Had no idea, Nishi.

160
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,810
Well, my body's all I've got going for me!

161
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,720
A real man alright...

162
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:08,790
Sensitive can mean neurotic. Women are
happier with these rough and simple types!

163
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,690
Nice smile too! I'm history. She's yours...

164
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,610
Hello...

165
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,920
Here...

166
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,960
It'll dry soon!

167
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,810
Something wrong?

168
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,840
Your beer...

169
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,320
Hey!!

170
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,420
- You know this guy?
- The owner!

171
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,790
He's off today! I'm only here part-time!
I'm not sure where he is. Sorry.

172
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,860
OK!

173
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,540
Settle down Atsu! We're gonna wait for him!

174
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,210
Right here...

175
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,250
I think he said he was taking
a couple of days off somewhere!

176
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,220
I knew it, off to a holiday resort!

177
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,500
With MY World Cup tickets, having fun.

178
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,610
Stop it! I'll call the police!

179
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,550
Say, you're kinda cute.

180
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,590
What the fuck are you doing you scum?

181
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,610
And who do you think you are?

182
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,740
Stop it!

183
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,280
Ryo!

184
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,580
Stop it!

185
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,920
Atsu, that's enough, put that piece away!!

186
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,530
I said put it away!

187
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,310
- What?!
- You don't know what's going on, bro!

188
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,110
I do.

189
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:54,880
No, you don't! My little Riko,
that old fuck, he...

190
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,420
He co-erced her!!

191
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:04,930
I know Atsu, but you don't mix business
with private stuff! We're professionals.

192
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:12,740
Y'know, I've been meaning to tell
you - you've got no taste.

193
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:22,680
Teen car, fag watch, just plain bad taste.

194
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,690
Me, I'm different, I'm a player!
Not a business man, but an artist!

195
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,690
Personal stuff IS my business!

196
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,320
Watch your mouth! You don't even know
the meaning of the word artist!

197
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,990
Oh... Atsu, sorry man,
didn't know you felt that way.

198
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,470
Do whatever you want!!!

199
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,630
I'm cool, it's just,
I get mad when I think about that guy!

200
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,970
Raping my Riko, keeping her locked in...

201
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,550
Yeah, well if you put it that way,
it's your call!

202
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,020
Say Atsu, can I add something?

203
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,320
NO!

204
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,200
Too bad he's out... he'd understand how I feel,
my hurt, my grief!!

205
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,940
If he sees ME raping HIS girlfriend right here!

206
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,180
I don't know this guy,
first time he comes in here.

207
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,780
Well it's true!

208
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,860
Bro, this bitch is lying!

209
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,560
You cunt!

210
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,670
They give it up so quickly!

211
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,730
All of 'em!

212
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,170
Wow, great boobs!

213
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,440
Don't move!

214
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,750
That's right, like that!

215
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,830
Shut the fuck up!

216
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,530
Say, those are sexy undies!

217
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,600
Kinda sparse down there, don't move,
show it to me!

218
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,640
Nishi, are you there?

219
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,150
Nishi?

220
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,420
Is he here? Where is he, this way?

221
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,890
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

222
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,660
Where are you?

223
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:04,400
This you? Curled up like a ball?
You wanted some, didn't you?

224
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,440
Well, turn around, take a look at that pussy.

225
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,810
You know you want to!

226
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,950
Your turn after, amigo!

227
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,580
Come on, get up and get IT up!

228
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,290
I...

229
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,860
I...

230
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,870
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

231
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,330
Hurt you!

232
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,500
No way!

233
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:44,640
Ha! Did you hear that, gonna hurt you he said!

234
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,310
Put a bullet in him, on cue, just when he said
"hur!" Out the front before "t!"

235
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,390
Miserable loser!

236
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,060
That's not funny.

237
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I was looking at you, you're gross!

238
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,000
What are you saying bro'?

239
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,580
Too gross. Don't move! You piss me off!

240
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,720
- I'm sorry, forgive me, please!!
- Don't move!

241
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,080
I'll do anything!!

242
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,590
ATTEN-TION!

243
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,860
Say "shit-pee-dick" 10 times. Very fast.

244
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,130
And add a kiss to the last one!

245
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,330
Bro'...

246
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,930
Add a kiss and I'll forgive you!

247
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:48,620
Shit-pee-dick... shit-pee-dick...
shit-pee-dick...

248
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,450
Er, Shit-pee-dick-smack!

249
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,950
You promised...!!

250
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,830
Think about what you did on your way to hell.

251
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,970
Sorry about the trouble,
but it's the owner's...

252
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,740
Ah, forget it!

253
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,780
I'll have a beer and a stick!

254
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,010
If I only had one of those magic time belts,
turn it back...

255
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,480
"RECAP"

256
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,550
"ANGER BAROMETER"

257
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,490
Nishi, are you there?

258
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,560
Where is he, this way?

259
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,060
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

260
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:57,340
This you? You wanted some, didn't you?
Well turn around and...

261
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,280
I...

262
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,810
I...

263
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,580
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

264
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm gonna hurt you!

265
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,300
- I'm
- No!

266
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,760
- Gonna
- Stop!

267
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,140
- Hurt You
- Stop, please!

268
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,290
"sucks, doesn't it?"

269
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,030
"lame, aren't you?"

270
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,040
"a fart, no?"

271
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,150
"snot?"

272
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:52,720
OK, I get it! I'm not cool!
I'm useless! And no fun!

273
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,690
"bird shit?"

274
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,960
I'm a snot, I know! So, stop this!

275
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,660
Stop! Stop!

276
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,830
STOP!!

277
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Something's wrong with my eyes!

278
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,530
I keep changing, right?

279
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
You can't decide what I should look like!

280
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,640
Who are you?

281
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,740
You know! It's flickering there in your mind!

282
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,850
Come on, let it go.

283
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,080
What's the first thing that comes to mind?

284
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,180
"G-O-D"

285
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,090
G... God!!

286
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,500
There we are!
Not that how you call me matters!

287
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,930
A, B, they're just symbols anyway!

288
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,710
Confused? Wanna see my tits?

289
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:20,710
The only way to make it stop is to be honest.
Easier to see the truth that way!

290
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:27,220
The truth for you, that is!
Too late for counseling though.

291
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,490
Since you're DEAD! What a shame!

292
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,130
Dead... I'm... dead?

293
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,500
Really?

294
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,900
Just like that? Gone at 20?

295
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,400
Why was I born then?

296
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:03,160
So you could have fun at my expense?!

297
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,420
What's wrong with that, huh?

298
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, so I made you on a whim!
I made you, dipshit, for my sheer enjoyment!

299
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,240
What's wrong with that?

300
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,270
Oops, I have to go!

301
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,450
- Got a date!
- A date?!

302
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:38,680
Time's up. Go straight that way
and keep walking. You'll soon disappear.

303
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,950
And my next life?

304
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,290
- Huh?
- Next life?

305
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,930
Your what? Told you it's over. Start walking!

306
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:57,300
And disappear? No afterlife? We're done?

307
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,640
It's really over?!

308
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,490
Really, really, really over?! God?

309
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:17,190
Will you shut up! You saw how you got here,
multiple p-o-v's of you brain exploding.

310
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,690
A shocking documentary of your death,
deftly edited by moi!

311
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,930
You are DEAD!

312
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:36,110
I'm officially dead?

313
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,380
Them's the breaks Nishi.

314
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,370
Straight ahead and disappear...

315
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,110
So if I go the other way...

316
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,580
Hey! What're you doing?! I'll be late!

317
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,720
Wait!

318
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,760
Let me through, I'm going back!

319
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,130
Not down for the count, huh?

320
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:34,410
You're gonna fade away, that's how it works.
See, you're already fading.

321
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,150
I don't believe you! I'm not gonna disappear!
I'm going back!

322
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,550
Won't happen!

323
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,610
I'll make it, I'll get there, you'll see!

324
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,430
Not bad, can you keep it up?
With that brain? Body?

325
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,100
I'm gonna take care of that creep.

326
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,170
Be stronger. Determined!! Free and happy!

327
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,600
Live life to the fullest!

328
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,340
Pretty good...

329
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,580
Alright give it your best shot!

330
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,350
YES! I'm going back! I'm gonna do this!

331
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,150
I'm on your side... I'm on your side...

332
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,160
Your turn after, amigo. Get up and get IT up!

333
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,440
Never... never...

334
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,970
Never again!

335
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,980
Don't move!

336
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
Yang, come here.

337
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:10,590
I'll blow your head off if you move,
I'm done being the loser!

338
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,500
Give me the car keys!

339
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,870
Nishi...

340
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,070
You're on your own sir, come on, let's roll!

341
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,080
Hey!

342
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,380
Get in!

343
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,710
Wait...

344
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,520
Atsu got wasted!

345
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:40,060
My fault... They're in my car, we'll get them.

346
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,730
My apologies!

347
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,620
Nishi, watch out!

348
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,780
Help!!

349
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,290
And a hero is born...

350
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,130
Hands on the wheel!!

351
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,640
Don't worry, I'm on it! I'll protect you!
I love you both!!

352
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:25,870
Moron, eyes on the road! Why are we running?
We should go to the police, self defense, right?

353
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:33,250
No! No! No! No cops, no questions,
no regrets! I'm through with that!

354
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,790
Making a break for it, with you two!
Like I want!

355
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,920
No one's gonna get in my way!!

356
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,560
I'm following my heart's desires!
Like an outlaw!

357
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,180
Hey, can you hear me?

358
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:12,680
I do hope you realize you were living
in paradise till today.

359
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:20,120
Like angels flying around in heaven.

360
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:25,370
But now you're on a super express to hell!

361
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:37,550
The guy you smoked, that bald S.O.B, Atsu?

362
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:46,180
Fine football player and athlete,
known as the Maradona of Osaka!

363
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,420
For good and for bad reasons.

364
00:34:51,930 --> 00:35:00,810
Beautiful bod' like a wild animal!
Not that it has to do with anything.

365
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:07,100
You knew Atsu was packing,
that the car was full drugs,

366
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:13,550
money, you knew all that, you planned it.

367
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,610
A clear cut armed robbery and murder case.

368
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,500
His folks abandoned him,
he grew up without love!

369
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,060
Got tickets for the World Cup,
for him and his girl.

370
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,800
A model Japanese footie fan.

371
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:42,910
But just before the game,
a young guy like you puts out his light.

372
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,840
Ah, the ever-egocentric,
unfeeling youth of today!

373
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,520
Immature adults on the loose,
everything a blur except their friends.

374
00:35:52,630 --> 00:36:04,090
Living life like a video game,
finger on the reset button!

375
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,400
You're a roller-coaster with no breaks.

376
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,600
It's not true, you're making it up.

377
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:21,450
Typical story, nice and easy
for the cops to follow!

378
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,390
What I'm sayin' is, nobody's on your side!

379
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,090
This is it, kids! Make it a good game!

380
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,670
Nice speech old man.

381
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,700
Will you stop it!

382
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,410
- I can see you sweating in front of a prompter!
- Nishi!

383
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,410
It's improv!

384
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,110
Sure!

385
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,310
What?!

386
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:05,060
This roller-coaster you're trying to stop
is a genuine Angel Express!

387
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,700
And I can see you moved to tears
as you watch that mystic angel...

388
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,330
...spread its wings and disappear into the sky.

389
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,570
The fuck?!

390
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,500
Fuck!

391
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,210
Nishi!

392
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
Offside!

393
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,950
Asshole, this ain't football!

394
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,150
Now get in as close as you can!

395
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,490
Offside-trap!

396
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,320
STUNT DRIVING!

397
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,270
My nose is bleeding!

398
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,270
Mine too!

399
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,070
Mine too!

400
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
The bridge!

401
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,150
What the fuck are you doing?!

402
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,710
My Pitch, my little pitch!

403
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,250
Pitch. You came back! Pitch!

404
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,870
No more fooling around.

405
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,370
We'll get 'em on the bridge.

406
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:43,470
Perfect defense plan. Even Zidane and Figo
couldn't get through. We'll get 'em.

407
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,020
Whale?

408
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,550
What, you again?!

409
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,580
Not just yet!

410
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,320
You there, Nishi?

411
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,520
Are we... dead?

412
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,320
You both there? Wait a sec...

413
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,030
Where is it?

414
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,460
Bingo!

415
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,640
We're alive...

416
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,200
Thank God!

417
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,640
Seawater? Can't see shit.

418
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,510
Near the harbour, maybe.

419
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,810
Smells fishy...

420
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,850
Have no fear!

421
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,860
Fear takes the shape we're willing to give it!

422
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,190
Let's light a candle in our hearts,
make it gleam.

423
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,090
Try to enjoy the moment!

424
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,790
In spite of this turn of events.

425
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,700
"This is FUN"

426
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,300
This will shed a new light on things!

427
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,640
Remember our days in grade school?

428
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,250
When it was all play,
no restrictions or tomorrows?

429
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,050
We didn't end up here 'cos we were chased!

430
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,950
We came here seeking adventure!
An epic journey!

431
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,360
Let the party begin!

432
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,000
Hey, there's a boat!

433
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,670
Let's check it out!

434
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,340
Lane No.1, Nishi! 3rd Grade! And I'm off!

435
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,640
Hey, let's go.

436
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,650
Lane No.2, Myon!
Also, 3rd Grade, and here I go!

437
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,240
Wow, what a wreck.

438
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,610
Where are we?

439
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,180
Stinks!

440
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,380
I'm starving! Good for my figure, though!

441
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,250
Your body is DOPE!

442
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,790
Which you haven't seen. I just look slim.

443
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,790
Show me then!

444
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,220
No way!

445
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,590
Please!

446
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,460
Nope!

447
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,030
Please!

448
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,990
Sugar on top!!

449
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,900
Nah!

450
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,340
- Aw, c'mon!
- Nishi! What now, huh?!

451
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,540
You almost got us killed!

452
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,970
Sure they were scum,
but you also popped a guy!

453
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,080
What's with the "enthusiasm?"

454
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,910
I was killed! Shot by that creep!

455
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,850
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the one that's gone dodo!

456
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,160
Before that. See, I was so scared
I lucked out on getting angry.

457
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,250
And that's when he shot me! Cueball mother!

458
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,560
Then I was sucked up to heaven and...

459
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,490
You've lost it.

460
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,270
But I believed in myself,
believed like nothing else, and I was back!

461
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,680
To live true to yourself,
sincerely, without restraint!

462
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,180
I realized it's the only weapon
against any wall!

463
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,010
OK, you've lost me.
But THIS is where it got us!

464
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,090
We're only here 'cos we were lucky!

465
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:00,390
It's a miracle we're alive!
But if this keeps up, we'll be dead in no time!

466
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,810
I... I...

467
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,170
I...

468
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,510
I've got... a radio!!

469
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,150
A radio?

470
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,950
This place is dangerous, we need to move!

471
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,850
Hurry! Hurry!

472
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,830
- What the fuck?!
- C'mon, hurry!

473
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,800
- What is this?
- An earthquake? A tsunami?

474
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,240
- You guys are reckless!
- The fuck, old man?!

475
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:51,610
Hurry up! Grab an ore and row!

476
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,290
- Tidal wave?
- Tsunami!

477
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,690
Move it, people!

478
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,760
Over there!

479
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,030
Almost there!

480
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,800
Hang on!

481
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,320
Meal time's over. We're OK now!

482
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,130
Let's go up!

483
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,780
Wow! It's like a top secret lair!

484
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,780
TV, microwave, audio set, PC,
you've got everything!

485
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,120
So they just washed up?

486
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,190
Ah, and food!

487
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,470
And sexy lingerie!! You dirty old man!

488
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,240
Let's see what's inside.

489
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,810
No power, huh?
This stuff's just for show, then?

490
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,210
Gross!

491
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,150
Think of it as modern art!

492
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,220
Want to freshen up?

493
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,780
Plenty of clean hot water?

494
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,860
- You mean have a bath?
- Yes! Yes!

495
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,090
I'd like that!

496
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,820
Yeah? Me too!

497
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,680
This is bliss!

498
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,680
But boy we're in some mess! It's surreal!

499
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:15,490
I mean, we're in God-knows-where
enjoying a total stranger's hospitality!

500
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,330
Having a bath... Unbelievable.

501
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:25,570
Well, he's on the way to a Happy Meal,
but he seems nice!

502
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,900
Once a perv, always a perv, huh?

503
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,400
I feel like it's the first time
we're having a real talk.

504
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,140
We'll leave clean clothes here!

505
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,410
Those bastards! Not very subtle are they?!

506
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,720
Let's pretend they're costumes!

507
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,560
Hey, find something we can actually wear!

508
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,290
Wow! Looks amazing!!

509
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,090
You made this?

510
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,800
Gramps?

511
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,800
Should've seen him at work!

512
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,040
Really? It's like a NY sushi bar!

513
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,310
Where'd you learn to cook, gramps?

514
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,850
Whoa!

515
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,520
Yeah, it's delicious!

516
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,250
Five stars in my book!

517
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,860
Bon appetit!!

518
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,300
Wow.

519
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,660
What a meal!

520
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,200
Thanks!

521
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,140
Much better than some fancy
rotating sushi bar in Kita.

522
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,980
They started serving
Westernized sushi last year.

523
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,840
Rotating sushi bars.

524
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,280
Rotating sushi.

525
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,950
Rotating sushi...

526
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,110
Not like that...

527
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,420
No, no.

528
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,120
In front of the customers.

529
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,390
Mines dead too!

530
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,070
It's a cell... phone?

531
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,730
A phone, a mobile phone?!

532
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,810
I knew it!

533
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,510
So, can we make contact with
the outside world??

534
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:54,750
Can't! It's soaked! Probably a goner!

535
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,390
So, um, do robots exist now?

536
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:06,120
I saw a robot isle at the hardware
store the other day!

537
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah?

538
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,230
Yes! I knew it!

539
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:18,240
- How about flying cars?
- Huh?

540
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,010
Hmm, how long have you been here exactly?

541
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,850
More than 30 years!

542
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,790
I had a big deal going down...

543
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,290
Hid my stash in a comic book case...

544
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,530
But I took the wrong one...

545
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,610
Coastguards and DEA knew all about it anyway.

546
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,280
Was running, lights flashing everywhere...

547
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:06,250
When a huge whale swallowed me!

548
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,250
Couldn't believe it.

549
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,160
And then what?

550
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,560
Got caught in the waves!

551
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,170
It was pitch dark when I came around!

552
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,500
Tried to escape but the waves were too rough!

553
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,940
"TIME BOY"
Tried again! And again.

554
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:36,150
I couldn't have survived without my friends.

555
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,960
Um, where's the toilet?

556
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,460
The washroom? Straight ahead! I'll take you!

557
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,430
Nah, it's okay! Straight ahead, right?

558
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,040
Oh my God.

559
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,390
Hey, keep talking!

560
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,390
- Where's the "exit?"
- All the way down there!

561
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,200
- Oh, right.
- But of course!

562
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,400
Back to square one!

563
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:32,840
Got to know your own limits!

564
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,590
We're outta here!

565
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,790
We can go this way.

566
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,770
It's wobbling!

567
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,270
It's the only way, c'mon!

568
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,770
It'll be alright!

569
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,320
You'll get killed!

570
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,850
He's hungry again!

571
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,190
Hurry!

572
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,160
Come back.

573
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,690
Wait!

574
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,560
- The water's coming!
- Nishi!

575
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,060
There! The exit!

576
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,100
Put these on!

577
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,540
Nishi! Come back!

578
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,040
Nishi!

579
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,140
Hey, let go of me!

580
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,620
What the...?!

581
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,230
Nishi, you're awake!

582
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,560
What a relief! He's come around!

583
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,810
And here's something to cheer you up!

584
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,180
And a "Happy Mornin" to y'all!

585
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,270
Wow, is this a beautiful day or what?

586
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,950
You wouldn't believe how blue the sky was
this morning.

587
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,960
In line with the solar system is...

588
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,520
Thought I'd drive
all the way to Brazil, y'know?

589
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,960
Well, it's gonna be booming
at the resorts today!

590
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:14,010
Certainly not a day for school
or work, I tell ya!

591
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,070
Now, now, now...

592
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,110
C'mon, cheer up!

593
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,990
You're homesick, I've been there.
I cried and got angry too.

594
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,020
But I realized after coming here...

595
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,860
Oh, whatever.

596
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,290
Got an idea! There's a place
that'll cheer you up.

597
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,060
Great friends too!

598
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,400
Let's go! Everybody!

599
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,370
So wrecked cars are popping up everywhere!

600
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:51,530
Must've been some monster car chase...

601
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,880
You haven't eaten properly in three days!

602
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,070
You're not gonna last that way!

603
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,120
You need to eat for your breasts' sake!

604
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,150
And Nishi, you've eaten nothing!

605
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,250
Forget about getting it up!

606
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,350
Hey!

607
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,030
Just shut up, okay?

608
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,140
Gramps, will you take me to that fun place
you mentioned about?

609
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,020
Wanna go? It'll be fun!

610
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,350
I need a change!

611
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,220
That's the spirit! You'll love it!

612
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:43,390
Nishi?

613
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,930
You too!

614
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,590
Nah... count me out!

615
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,690
It'll be fun! You can meet my friends too!

616
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,470
Hearts'll soar!! Heads'll explode!

617
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,010
Cut it, Gramps! I'm not in the mood!

618
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,800
Just leave me alone!

619
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,010
Join us later if you feel like it, okay?

620
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,780
Let's go, Myon.

621
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,020
Let's go, let's go!

622
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,980
This'll be a blast!

623
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,450
You'll love my friends.

624
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,240
Fuck!! The look on his face!

625
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,570
He doesn't have a clue!

626
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,550
I only said those things
'cos he was being inconsiderate!

627
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,380
How about a little kindness, huh?

628
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,640
I'm hurt!

629
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,480
I have doubts about humanity!

630
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,020
What about my start in Manga?!

631
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,390
What about my glorious campus life, huh?!

632
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,730
Asshole!

633
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,330
Loser!

634
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,650
"Help me God I'm sorry"

635
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,020
30 years... 30 years...

636
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,440
Gotta drink your milk, honey!

637
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:04,990
30 years...
