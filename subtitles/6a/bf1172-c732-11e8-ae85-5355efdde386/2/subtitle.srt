1
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:21,537
You okay?

2
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,407
Isn't it amazing, Nishi?

3
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:31,987
Gramps, I...

4
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:36,417
Er, what I said back there was...

5
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:43,097
I'd become a bad person!

6
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:46,167
I wanted to boast about my evil ways.

7
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:49,897
I wanted to be known as a tough, rugged man!

8
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,337
I wanted to walk over everybody.

9
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:56,847
But I wound up here and...

10
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:59,247
I struggled!

11
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:02,477
But I managed to survive!

12
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,057
I can swim again!

13
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:09,917
Catch things, walk, see.

14
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,217
Isn't that fun?

15
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:18,457
Seawater's salty! This place stinks!
But it gives me joy!

16
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:23,907
Would you rather lie around doing nothing?
Or would you rather feel alive?

17
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,867
Which is more fun?

18
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,477
She sure can swim!

19
00:03:56,587 --> 00:04:00,317
She wanted to go to the Olympics
till she was about 15.

20
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,757
Had a coach and all.

21
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,987
Come to think of it,
I remember her winning something!

22
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:07,197
Bronze at the Kinki Races.

23
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,667
Stopped when her boobs got bigger!

24
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,537
No kidding! Gotta go with the flow, huh?

25
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,267
Yeah, with the flow!

26
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:20,277
How is it?

27
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,877
Wow! Fantastic!

28
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:29,287
Right, my turn!
Quality entertainment coming up!

29
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,167
Got one!

30
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,247
Nishi!

31
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:32,867
Nishi, remember when we found a stray dog?

32
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,717
In kindergarten?

33
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:38,077
And you said you'd take care of it?

34
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:41,147
That made me so happy!

35
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,727
Yeah?

36
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,317
I'm gonna take him home with me.

37
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,257
You will? Thank you!

38
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,817
I already have a sea-monkey, so it'll be fine!

39
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:58,467
Wanna see? C'mon, I'll show ya!

40
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,237
Myon.

41
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:03,377
So this is the new plot!

42
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,007
In the far, distant future,

43
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:10,607
where the world is starving from
over-population and environmental destruction,

44
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:15,587
Earth decides to send
a spaceship in search for food.

45
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,327
But something goes wrong.

46
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,987
They land on a strange planet.

47
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:30,837
There's water and oxygen,
but nothing edible for humans!

48
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:37,007
Except for one thing, they soon discover.

49
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,407
A certain creature's poo.

50
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:47,917
Ooh, gross!

51
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:51,457
And it's the perfect food for humans.

52
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:52,687
"It's delicious!"
And it's the perfect food for humans.

53
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:58,427
But the creature's unbelievably bad at hunting
and on the verge of extinction!

54
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,127
There's only one?

55
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:05,137
Our men help the creature hunt, look after it!

56
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:10,337
And they live like that for a while
until a new enemy arrives.

57
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:16,177
Higher species of plants begin to fight
for food, which is also creature chips!

58
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,117
A poo-war, huh?

59
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:21,717
But what happens then? The crew?

60
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,817
Guess we need to send them home safely, huh?

61
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:30,787
The planet is ideal in its own way, but...

62
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:36,497
In fact, the planet's some kind of cell!

63
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,197
Our crew must've ended up there
after being shrunk!

64
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:41,497
A cell?

65
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,737
Yeah, of a human body.

66
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,007
Whose?

67
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,037
Yours.

68
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,447
Mine?

69
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:52,177
Let's just say... it was the leader's fault.

70
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:58,317
His love for his girl,
his determination to find that planet,

71
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:01,557
his desperation led the ship there.

72
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:07,057
But one day, they realize
their bodies have grown bigger.

73
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,427
Why?

74
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,897
Wonder why!

75
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:16,007
And they hear a voice! From inside your tummy
as you're sitting in the toilet.

76
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:19,407
"Oh my God!
We're growing bigger and bigger!"

77
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,347
Yikes!

78
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:26,047
But they can communicate that way.
And they realize their inside your stomach.

79
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,417
- Then what?
- They've gotta get out!

80
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:30,247
- From where?
- At this point, they're moving along the colon!

81
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,587
Not happening!!

82
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:35,157
But what else can they do?
They keep getting bigger.

83
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,487
Your belly'll explode!

84
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,537
- I said no!
- "We're almost out, don't flush us!"

85
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,157
I AM flushing them!

86
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,607
"We're out! We're out!"

87
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,027
NO!!!

88
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,477
Myon!

89
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,277
Nishi!

90
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:40,147
Nishi! Myon!!

91
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:41,887
We're up here!

92
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,617
You guys OK?

93
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:45,347
A-OK!

94
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:50,297
I'm relieved! We were worried!

95
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,797
That was a surprise attack! So sudden!

96
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:16,347
Told ya so! It's wicked, man!
A miracle, I say!

97
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:20,047
The Other World by Robin Nishi.
The guy's a fucking genius!

98
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:25,287
Cut class and meet me at the arcade!
The Strawberry Plaza in ten!

99
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:26,797
Roger that.

100
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,937
This place's so commercial.

101
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:32,297
Dude, chill...

102
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,697
Isn't that...

103
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,867
Robin Nishi!!!

104
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,877
"R! Nishi Book Signing"

105
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:47,217
Check out the chicks!

106
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,377
Fuckin' cool!

107
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,117
Excuse me, you're Robin Nishi, right?

108
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,387
Hiroshi, you idiot!!

109
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:57,887
Fuck yeah!!

110
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:11,577
Sorry!!

111
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:12,967
We're huge fans!

112
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,807
The Other World rocks!!

113
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,687
Wanna grab a bite?

114
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:21,817
Follow me!!

115
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,647
Seriously?!

116
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,257
Eat!

117
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,327
Yes!!

118
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,667
- This is like, your average day??
- Yeah!

119
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:36,167
- Awesome!
- I feel so alive!

120
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,467
Robin, I'll pick up the tab!

121
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,177
What're you talking about?

122
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,677
Hiroshi, you idiot!!

123
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,807
Hiroshi, kids shouldn't worry
about things like that.

124
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,147
Have fun and become a man!

125
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:57,517
Not a clone, but someone who transcends!!

126
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:07,437
First contact with aliens!

127
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:13,067
And directing this epic moment
is the artist who made it all possible...

128
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:16,837
Salvatore Antonio Yang Gogh!!

129
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:36,257
"HELLO"

130
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:42,067
The crowd's cheers've gone up a notch here
at the 1st Cosmic Swimming Contest.

131
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,507
Representing Earth!
Matt Beyond Thorpe Myon!!!

132
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:52,197
And so the race begins
as we witness history in the making!

133
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:59,537
First corner and into the gate!
Cameras are not allowed inside!

134
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:10,517
And they're coming out! 4 in the first group!
And she's there!

135
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,727
Matt Beyond Thorpe Myon,
representing Earth!!!

136
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,267
Isn't this supposed to be extinct?

137
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,037
This one too!

138
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:57,827
"To Yang and Myon"

139
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:23,717
Think we can get out of here?

140
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:24,847
Want to?

141
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,947
We might be happier here.

142
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:47,437
Jump!

143
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:13,127
That's odd and it wasn't even time yet.

144
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:19,937
Good God! I was about to go fetch you!

145
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,037
Gramps.

146
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,807
What's going on?

147
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:35,347
The water level's increasing.

148
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,317
And he's eating less.

149
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,127
Meaning?

150
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,497
Can't say for sure, but he could be dying.

151
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:52,337
Dying? But what happens to us then?

152
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,267
Eventually, this place'll sink.

153
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:01,377
We've gotta leave. It's that or drown.

154
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,047
But how?

155
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:04,917
The boat, of course!

156
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,857
- The cops'll be looking for us.
- So?

157
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:10,427
The Yakuzas'll come after us!

158
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,117
So what! I wanna get out!

159
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:15,657
'Cos there's so much out there!

160
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:19,027
So many different people,
living different lives!

161
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,697
Incredibly good guys, bad guys...

162
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,867
Folks completely different from us!
It's one huge melting pot!

163
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:30,607
See, it's not about success,
dying in the streets, who's better, who's not!

164
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,947
I just want to be a part of it!

165
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:36,677
I realized that even if I've no connections,
no talent,

166
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:38,787
even if I'm one big loser,

167
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:43,627
I want to use my hands and feet to think
and move, to shape my own life!

168
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:48,357
We can just die here or we can try!

169
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:51,197
See what we've got!

170
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:58,407
It's impossible.
Motivation's not gonna get us over that wave.

171
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,567
We need a motor boat!

172
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:05,637
We've got a motor!

173
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:07,277
Right here!

174
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,587
But there's no fuel...

175
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:16,557
Sure there is!
We came here by car, remember?

176
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:22,927
Yes!

177
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:23,867
It could work!

178
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,267
It will work!!

179
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,777
We're going to make it!

180
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,277
We're so gonna make it!

181
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,577
Get up there!

182
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:39,637
The World Cup ends tomorrow
with its final match...

183
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,837
As the world awaits to find out
who'll be the winner...

184
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:45,107
We're near Osaka again!

185
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:45,877
Oh, yeah!

186
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:49,387
I think this is our only chance!

187
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:54,387
Maybe the whale's come here for us!

188
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,357
And we're going for it!

189
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:31,187
You're older. Lend it to her!

190
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:32,827
I don't want to!

191
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:33,827
Yang.

192
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:36,827
Don't run like that, Myon'll follow you.

193
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:38,667
Sorry, Myon...

194
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,797
I don't like that uniform!

195
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:45,077
- I'll work!
- Sorry Yang!

196
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:53,637
Wanna try?

197
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:02,457
Myon.

198
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,167
Yang!

199
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,527
Thanks!

200
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,537
I'm not gonna let you carry
all the load anymore!

201
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,507
I'll grow up.

202
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:24,177
I'm sorry.

203
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,547
I always knew you were the one
that needed support.

204
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:35,217
It's your turn, now!

205
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:38,027
Go ahead!

206
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:08,127
Here we go kids!

207
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:12,927
Yes sir!

208
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:24,157
Run!!

209
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,587
Water striders float...

210
00:25:58,697 --> 00:26:02,697
...using surface tension
from the hairs on their legs.

211
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:26,457
I'm sorry.

212
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:58,917
Your bones won't get strong
if you don't drink milk.

213
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,397
Yes, mom!

214
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,757
Ah, not again!

215
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,537
I'll put it in your food then!

216
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,007
This'll be perfect.

217
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,907
- Hey, wrong nail!
- The baby!

218
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:15,577
- You OK?
- It's heavy!

219
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,017
There!

220
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:20,617
Mmm, too much space for a little kid!

221
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:22,717
Ah, he'll be big in no time!

222
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:25,287
Wonder what he'll be like.

223
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:32,197
Be right there, sweetie!

224
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:36,567
Your fever's just gone down you know.

225
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:37,507
I'm fine.

226
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:39,367
See you later!

227
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,367
See you at 10!

228
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,637
Keiko? It's me!

229
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:47,047
Myon? I've got an art show.

230
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,547
That's great!

231
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,477
And she's going for the rope!

232
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:51,487
"A Lonely Death"

233
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,557
We've got no money either!

234
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:55,317
Worn by...

235
00:31:59,027 --> 00:31:59,727
There, found it!

236
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:00,487
Jun!

237
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:01,997
Hi!

238
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,997
That's insane! They're Yakuzas!!

239
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:09,737
I told you to wait till tomorrow,
so shut up and wait, you punk!!

240
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:14,437
Sorry about that! Now back to your interview...

241
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:51,907
That's her!

242
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:18,767
Myon!
