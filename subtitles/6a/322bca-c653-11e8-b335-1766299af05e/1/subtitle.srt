1
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
Aah!

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,640
What did you
run into me for?

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,760
I didn't mean it, mate.
That guy pushed me.

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,240
What did you
run into me for?

5
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,080
What are you
doing here?

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,360
What are
you doing here?

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,760
Let me tell
you something.

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
I want you
to listen to me.

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,880
This is not
your country.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,880
Get the yellow fuck!

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Fuck you! Fuck you!

12
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Get him!

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,960
You like it, gooky boy,
you like it?

14
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,760
Fuck off!

15
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,000
Chickenshit.

16
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,320
Where is he, inside?

17
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah. He hasn't
come out yet

18
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,360
but he's expecting you.

19
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,680
That was Pommy Bill.

20
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,880
He's come to help.

21
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,200
Did he hurt you?

22
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
No, but he's
been hitting

23
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,600
the roeies again-- the
worst I've ever seen.

24
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,520
Are you
all right?

25
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,480
Perhaps if you stop
struggling, sir.

26
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,640
Have it your way.

27
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,080
You like punching out
little girls, sir?

28
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,160
The junkies like punching up
little girls, do they?

29
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,440
Have you been taking
the phenytoin?

30
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,840
Yeah.

31
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
Where is it?

32
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
I don't know. I'm busy.

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,320
You haven't, have you?

34
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
Seizures been bad?

35
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,160
No.

36
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,320
You've got a bloody
chemist's shop here.

37
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,200
The one drug
you really need

38
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
you don't
bother with.

39
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,600
I need some
money, Martin.

40
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Missed you badly.

41
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't
want that.

42
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
Can't you just
be nice to me?

43
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,360
Pick up your things

44
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,120
and let's get
out of here.

45
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
You bastard!

46
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,480
I'm going to
fucking kill you.

47
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
I can't stay
with you, Martin.

48
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,880
Come on.

49
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,800
You're the one who
always starts it.

50
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,080
Hey, boys.

51
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,640
Sorry.

52
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,400
The men are here.

53
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,680
The big men
have arrived.

54
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Hey, we need
your muscle.

55
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
Rob and Chris
kicked us out.

56
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
Three jugs,
Harold.

57
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Fucking Rob
hit me, too.

58
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Stomp him
for us, Davey?

59
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,600
Hey, hey, hey.

60
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,240
Get him out.

61
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm not serving any kids--
get him out.

62
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,960
if he doesn't leave,
i'll turn off the beer.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Ooh!

64
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
Now!

65
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,960
Come on.

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Yeah...

67
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Get your mother
to read you a story.

68
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,240
Piss off, Max.

69
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,240
Go home!

70
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,400
Hey, Rollo
says you had

71
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,240
some gooks in here
last week.

72
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
What's it to you?

73
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Why were they here?

74
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,560
It's our place.

75
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,880
No, this is
my fucking place, mate.

76
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,640
Oh, yeah, but you
had gooks here, eh?

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Doesn't bother me.

78
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,120
You got a problem

79
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,800
that's your
fucking problem.

80
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
Who's that?

81
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't know.

82
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,160
A space monster,
if you ask me.

83
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
You mean
space cadet, love.

84
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,720
Hey, mate,
you going

85
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
to give us
a drink?

86
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,320
Come on, mate.
No, give us a drink.

87
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Wow.

88
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
That smells like shit.

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
Hey, can we go?

90
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Hey, What did you
just call me?

91
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
Hey, what did
you just call me?

92
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
Just leave it,
and let's just go home.

93
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
Don't lean
on my face.

94
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, fucking whatever

95
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,400
I surrender,
you motherfucker.

96
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,680
Gee, look at that jacket.

97
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,880
it's beautiful.

98
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,760
You want that jacket.

99
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,440
Move!

100
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,680
Nice jacket.

101
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah.

102
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,960
I hope it
was worth it.

103
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,480
It's bleeding.

104
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
No, it's not
even deep.

105
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,080
Little bit of glass
in it, though.

106
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,640
You want me
to operate?

107
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
It's still bleeding.

108
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
This is pretty clean.

109
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
Oh.

110
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,840
This is home.
Do you like it?

111
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,680
Yeah, what is
this, a squat?

112
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,000
Squat be fucked,
we pay rent here.

113
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,560
What is this?

114
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
Do you love me?

115
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,120
Do you love me?

116
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,320
Oh!

117
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,800
Well, you're awake.

118
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Brought my bag up
from downstairs.

119
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,480
I didn't get to salvage much

120
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,160
from the place
where I was living.

121
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,240
Some idiot tore it all up.

122
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,640
These are for tap dancing, see?

123
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,000
But they don't
fit me anymore.

124
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,640
That's a picture
of my mum.

125
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
isn't she beautiful?

126
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,360
Everyone says
I look like her.

127
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm not saying
I'm good-looking--

128
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm not
saying that--

129
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,520
but we do
look alike.

130
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
She's dead now.

131
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,800
It was a car accident.

132
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,240
She had her head chopped off.

133
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,000
I think it's good to be able
to talk about these things

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
without cracking up, you know?

135
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,640
Besides

136
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,000
I know she's still
with me somehow.

137
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,240
I think that when I have kids

138
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,280
she'll be one of them--
you know, sort of reincarnated.

139
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,920
When you see the yellow scum
coming up the road

140
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,680
Will you turn the other cheek
just like a gutless toad?

141
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,200
Or will you stand
your sacred ground

142
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,080
inform him of the facts

143
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Tell him he's not welcome here
then give him several smacks?

144
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,440
Smack him if he's yellow,
smack him if he's black

145
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,880
Smack him till he fucks off
and doesn't come back...

146
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,160
What are you doing?

147
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,600
Fucking keep your mind

148
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,400
on the fucking job,
woman!

149
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
What?

150
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,920
Hando,
uh, Magoo.

151
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,720
Magoo.

152
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,520
Way to go!

153
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
What are you
doing here?

154
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,720
Didn't have time to
tell you we were coming.

155
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Didn't know
we were coming--

156
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,360
forgot to
fucking stop.

157
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Check this out.

158
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,160
Joined up a couple
of months ago.

159
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
What for?

160
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,760
I needed a job,
didn't I?

161
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,360
They put you
through school.

162
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,320
I still get to keep
the hair short.

163
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,560
You're a hippie
with hair that long.

164
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Hey.

165
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,400
I thought you wanted
to shoot guns, mate?

166
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,600
I want to get
into a fucking sub.

167
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,120
Fire torpedoes.

168
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,640
How are you?

169
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,200
We're the handsome
Canberra boys

170
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
come to see the ugly
Melbourne boys.

171
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,960
This is my mate Magoo.

172
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,160
That's Jacqui

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,640
and that's Flea.

174
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,840
Hi.

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,560
Got something
for you, boys.

176
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
Macka pulled it

177
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,240
from the basement
of the war museum.

178
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,400
Standard issue
for the Hitler youth.

179
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
Wow!

180
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760
Cheap alloy.

181
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,520
Not that good--
made in '45

182
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
towards the end
of the war.

183
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,640
They were running
out of metal then

184
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
weren't they?

185
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
I'll take it.

186
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
50 bucks.

187
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,560
$30.

188
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,160
$40, then.

189
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
Ow!

190
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,040
Come on, Davey

191
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,720
you robbed me
of $50, mate.

192
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,000
That's all I got.

193
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,520
All i can stand for.

194
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
Come on!

195
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,720
Here. Pay me back
next dole check.

196
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Magoo.

197
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,000
Champ man.

198
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,120
Hey, how's Billy?

199
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
Look's all right.

200
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,640
It will be
all right.

201
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,200
I'll change
that bandage later.

202
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,040
He's going to
fucking kill him.

203
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,280
Any parties happening
in this sh-shitty town?

204
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
Pulling on the boots
and tightening up the laces

205
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,120
Shaving our heads
and strapping on the braces

206
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,320
Now you are a skinhead
looking for a fight

207
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the night

208
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the night

209
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,120
Making lots of trouble,
starting lots of fights

210
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Skinhead, skinhead,
getting really pissed

211
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Skinhead, skinhead,
tattooed on my wrist

212
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,000
Lurking in the laneway,
waiting for the scum

213
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Smash their yellow faces,
kick their fucking bums

214
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
When they plead for mercy,
we will show them none

215
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,840
Skinhead, skinhead,
till the job is done

216
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,000
Skinhead, skinhead,
putting in the boot

217
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,720
Looking for a street fight,
looking for a root

218
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the place

219
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Skinhead, skinhead,
stomping on your face

220
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
When the coppers see us,
at first they pull their gun

221
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,480
But when they see us come
towards then they start to run

222
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,600
When we wear our badges,
it makes us real proud

223
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,000
Skinhead, skinhead,
shout it out loud

224
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,320
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the night

225
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
Making lots of trouble,
starting lots of fights

226
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,720
Skinhead, skinhead,
getting really pissed

227
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,240
Skinhead, skinhead,
tattooed on my wrist

228
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the night

229
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,400
Making lots of trouble,
starting lots of fights

230
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
Skinhead, skinhead,
getting really pissed

231
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,880
Skinhead, skinhead,
tattooed on my wrist

232
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Skinhead, skinhead,
putting in the boot

233
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Looking for a street fight,
looking for a root

234
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,680
Skinhead, skinhead,
running through the place

235
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,040
Skinhead, skinhead
stomping on your face!

236
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
Skinhead, skinhead

237
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,640
Skinhead, skinhead

238
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
Skinhead, skinhead

239
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,160
Skinhead, skinhead

240
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,880
Skinhead, skinhead.

241
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,320
Wow, Bubsy!

242
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,080
Davey, cop a drink?

243
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,680
Nice party, mate.

244
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,560
I've got to get
the first bus back to base.

245
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,720
You enjoy being cannon fodder
for the system?

246
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
It's a job.

247
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,640
See you, Hando.

248
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,200
Hey, Flea.

249
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
You look
like shit, Davey.

250
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,200
Stupid little bugger.

251
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
Why do you go in
for all this stuff?

252
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Because I don't want to be a
white coolie in my own country

253
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,680
because it's not
our country anymore

254
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,600
because rich people
and powerful people

255
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
brought in boatloads
of human trash--

256
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,440
cheap labor, gooks mainly

257
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,800
and there's going to be more.

258
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,000
I want people
to know that I'm proud

259
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,400
of my white history
and my white blood.

260
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,240
One day,
it might be all I have.

261
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,760
But I don't want to go
the same way as the fucking abo.

262
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,640
See that map?

263
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,240
That's all the gook properties
on Barcley Street.

264
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,120
A few years ago,
that was a white area.

265
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,720
Mein Kampf.

266
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
You know it?

267
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,440
It's about war, isn't it?

268
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,160
This book was written
by Adolf Hitler

269
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
and turned into a joke
by the people

270
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,720
who don't want you to know
Hitler's view of the world.

271
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,080
It's simply about the ongoing
struggle of the white race

272
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
and the enemies it faces.

273
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,480
if you don't know
who the enemy is

274
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
you can't
win the war.

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,120
Listen.

276
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
"AII the noble cultures
of the past declined

277
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,640
"because the purity and vigor

278
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,640
"of the originally
created race faded out.

279
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,280
"They were
compromised

280
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,280
"by the seed
of lesser races

281
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,560
"who were attracted
to the works

282
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,040
of the superior men."

283
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,360
"The undeniable reason
for their decline was then

284
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,800
"due to a kind
of racial blood poisoning.

285
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,280
"Racial blood must,
then, be preserved

286
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,040
in its purity at all costs."

287
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
The money will
be transferred

288
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,280
to your account
in 30 days.

289
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
Did you finalize your plans
for the old place?

290
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,880
We will turn
the place

291
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,720
to the restaurant
with bar

292
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,600
for my sons to run
when a little older

293
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,520
if they are
smart enough.

294
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,040
Well.

295
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
You going to
root it, Bubsy?

296
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,720
I don't care.
Fuck Harold.

297
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,680
I'm just going out
for about an hour.

298
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,840
Mister...

299
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,120
his sons want to have
a look around.

300
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,560
This red's going to do lovely
things for your eyes.

301
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,120
Just watch
my makeup, okay?

302
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
What are you eating
that rubbish for?

303
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,560
You got rocks
in your head?

304
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
Geez...

305
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm not living
with no fat bitch.

306
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Hando, gooks down
at the railway hotel.

307
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,680
Fuhrer, fuhrer,
what have we done?

308
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,160
Our land is being overrun

309
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,120
by Jews and Blacks
and yellow scum

310
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,360
Fuhrer, fuhrer,
what have we done?

311
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,280
But I want to go.

312
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
Stay here.

313
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,040
Piss off, Bubs.

314
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,440
Fuhrer, fuhrer,
what'll we do?

315
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,720
Fuck you, you bastards!

316
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,880
Did your best
to discourage the Jew

317
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
Fuhrer, fuhrer,
what'll we do?

318
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,040
Fuck you, I'm going!

319
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
Fuhrer, fuhrer

320
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Want to come?

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,040
Our day will come

322
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,560
We'll crush the scum.

323
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,800
How you going?

324
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,200
Shit!

325
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,120
Get the gooks down here.

326
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,280
Shut up!

327
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,120
Door, Brett.

328
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,320
Right!

329
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,280
Shut up!

330
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Time to die, gook.

331
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,960
Time to fucking die!

332
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
Shut up.

333
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
Oh, let's break
some fingers.

334
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Tiger, fucking
skinheads!

335
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,280
What are you
doing here, Bubs?

336
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,960
You were told
not to come.

337
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Fuck off,
shithead.

338
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,000
Let me
through.

339
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,480
Fuck me!

340
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,320
What's happening?

341
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,840
What are you
doing here?

342
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,760
Hey, why don't
you bloody well

343
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,520
do what you're
told, woman?

344
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
I told you
to stay.

345
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,920
They're
only kids.

346
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
Who says?

347
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
We hate you, gook.

348
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,840
We'll never
let you go.

349
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,680
This is our
place, gook boy.

350
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Our place!

351
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,120
What are you
doing here, eh?

352
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,920
The only thing
for you here is pain.

353
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
We don't love you.

354
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,120
You understand?

355
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
I hope you do, mate

356
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,880
because I don't
speak monkey talk!

357
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,080
Give him
smack-in-head special.

358
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,920
Maybe you got him enough?

359
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
Go on, hit
one of them.

360
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,960
Come on, go for it.

361
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,160
Hando.

362
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,520
Hando, Hando!

363
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,520
There's gooks!

364
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,880
Thousands of them!

365
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,720
Monkeys! Monkeys!

366
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,480
Come on!

367
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,320
Magoo!

368
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,520
Fuck! Gooks!

369
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,480
Cunt!

370
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,000
How do you
like it?

371
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,960
You fucking
like it, man?

372
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,640
How do you fucking
like it, huh?

373
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,320
Brett!

374
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,080
Brett!

375
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,640
Wait for Brett,
you bastards!

376
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,360
Oh, fuck!

377
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

378
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,320
We're living in the sewer,
but we're gonna go far

379
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,800
You see our numbers growing,
we're shouting, "Hurrah"

380
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,920
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

381
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,960
We're fighting the system,
fighting the war

382
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
You think there's
not enough of us

383
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,520
There's gonna be more

384
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
We're gonna change
the country

385
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,360
We're gonna change the laws

386
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,160
and Fourth Reich fighting men,
winning the war

387
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,080
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

388
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,200
We're living in the sewer

389
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
But we're gonna go far

390
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,480
You see our numbers growing,
we're shouting, "Hurrah"

391
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,400
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

392
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,800
We march so proud,
carrying the flag

393
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,600
Beating up vermin,
beating up slag

394
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,400
Beating up the fairies
for dressing in drag

395
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Fourth Reich fighting men,
carrying the flag

396
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,600
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

397
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,840
We're living in the sewer

398
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,920
But we're gonna go far

399
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
You see our numbers growing

400
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,560
We're shouting, "Hurrah"

401
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,840
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

402
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
At last united

403
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,560
Fighting as one

404
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,680
The fighting isn't finished
till the job is done

405
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,680
The battle isn't over

406
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,040
Till the war is won

407
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,600
Fourth Reich fighting men
fighting as one

408
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,520
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

409
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,800
We're living in the sewer
but we're gonna go far

410
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,320
You see
our numbers growing...

411
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
Go!

412
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,400
Fourth Reich fighting men,
that's who we are

413
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,240
Marching in the alleys,
marching in the streets

414
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,600
Terrorizing scum with
the sound of marching feet

415
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,280
When the marching is over,
it'll be all right

416
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
Everyone will live together

417
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,240
In the Fourth Reich.

418
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Fuck this!

419
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,240
Fuck those fucking dogs!

420
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
But we're gonna go far

421
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
You see our numbers growing

422
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,920

We're living in the sewer
but we're gonna go far

425
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,040
You see our numbers growing

426
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,880
We're shouting, "Hurrah"

Fourth Reich fighting men...

435
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,000
Make fucking room!

436
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Fourth Reich fighting men

437
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,120
Come on,
you wankers!

438
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Fucking wankers!

439
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,760
Gooks!

440
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320

Fourth Reich fighting men

446
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,600
Fourth Reich fighting men

447
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,360
Fourth Reich fighting men

448
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,320
Fourth Reich fighting men

449
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,680

Fourth Reich fighting men.

453
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,960
Wankers!

454
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,000
You fucking asshole fucks!

455
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Fuck you!

456
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,240
Gookie!

You fat,

458
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,920
Jesus, we're getting crushed!

459
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,200
Fuckers!

460
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,960
You fucking

461
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,400
Fuck you!

462
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,560
What happened?

463
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,320
What are we
going to do?

464
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,680
There are fucking
thousands of them!

465
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Shut up!

466
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,280
Shut up, I said!

467
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,240
They got Champ,
Luke, and Magoo.

468
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,640
Why didn't you
all stop and help?

469
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,080
What do you expect

470
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,440
you fucking little
dickhead?

471
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,600
Where is Jacqui?

472
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,880
We should have stopped!

473
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,040
Bullshit!

474
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
We're in
for it.

475
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,600
Like fuck, Sonny.

476
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,000
They're at the front door.

477
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,520
Oh!

478
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,280
Come in.

479
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,560
Come on.

480
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,480
You fucking filthy,
slope-head scum.

481
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,400
You filthy, yellow monkeys!

482
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,080
What the fuck are you afraid of?

483
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,480
This is
our place.

484
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
No more running.

485
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,880
We stop
them here!

486
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,160
You look like a bunch
of scared fucking rabbits!

487
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,520
Through the manhole,
across the roof.

488
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,120
All right

489
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
Davey?

490
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,760
Go!

491
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,920
Fucking
move it!

492
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,040
Don't fucking
rush me, you...

493
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,160
Bubs.

494
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,280
Bubs.

495
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,960
Move it!

496
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
Let's go!

497
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,000
Keep your
head down.

498
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
They don't know
we're here.

499
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,480
Gabe!

500
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
Where's your jacket?

501
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,920
Davey!

502
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,400
Davey!

503
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,800
Davey!

504
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,800
Fucking next time, mate!

505
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,280
Rob! Oh, come on.

506
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,480
Rob!

507
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,480
Rob, open the door!

508
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,640
Rob, open up!

509
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,760
Rob, is that you,
prick wife-basher?

510
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,320
What are you
doing here?

511
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,280
Can we talk to
you for a while?

512
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,640
How long
is a while?

513
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I don't know.

514
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
Where's Tracy?

515
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,920
I'm here, Rob.

516
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
How come you stopped
making love to me?

517
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,560
That's it.

518
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Get lost.

519
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
She smoked my
fucking stash.

520
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,200
Rob, I know we haven't
known each other for long

521
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,760
but we feel bad
about what happened.

522
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,600
We'd like to
give you money

523
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,360
to pay for
the food we ate.

524
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,360
You have money?

525
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,480
Pigs!

526
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,080
Rob, don't
be a bastard.

527
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,920
We want to make it
up to you.

528
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,760
Well, stick it
in the hole.

529
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
if you want
this money

530
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,760
then have
the decency

531
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,080
to see us
face-to-face.

532
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,840
Serves you right,
you wanker!

533
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,080
I'll kill you
for this, Megan!

534
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,440
Shut up!

535
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,400
Ha, ha, ha!

536
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,600
Hello!

537
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh, come on, guys.

538
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,440
Let him go.

539
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,640
How's it going?

540
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,080
Oh, yeah.

541
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,360
"Oh, yeah."

542
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,240
Is that all you got
to say for yourself?

543
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Hello, Chris.

544
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,840
Hello, Chris.

545
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,080
Let's have a tonguey
for the skins.

546
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
Come on.

547
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,960
Tonguey for the skins.

548
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,640
Fucking faggots,
are you?

549
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,720
Tongue, faggots!

550
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,720
Faggots!

551
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,280
Sonny!

552
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,040
We're going to stay here
for a while.

553
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,800
You guys don't want
to hang around, do you?

554
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
Do you?

555
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,280
Now, I'm going to ask
you nicely to leave.

556
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,960
if i see either one
of you again...

557
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm going to chop
your legs off.

558
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,920
Okay?

559
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,920
Okay?

560
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,320
Stupid shit.

561
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,320
Hando.

562
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,160
Hando,
I'm starving, man.

563
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,280
Hippie degenerates.

564
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,800
Oh, hot food.

565
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,040
Yeah, so do you
do much cooking?

566
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,400
Sometimes.

567
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,680
Really?

568
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
My mum was a good cook.

569
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,760
And I liked
home ec at school.

570
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
They had a great kitchen
at Linley.

571
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,920
Where?

572
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,680
Linley Hall,
it's my old school.

573
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,400
Well, one of them.

574
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,200
What is this shit?

575
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,040
Vegetables and pasta sauce.

576
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,480
Anything else?

577
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,440
Well, I used everything we had.

578
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,120
Hey, Sonny.

579
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,560
i can put different sauce
on it if you like.

580
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,400
Like the disposal unit?

581
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,000
Bloody wog crap!

582
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
Thanks for helping.

583
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,560
Sometimes I live
like a slob, you know.

584
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,920
But when I
make the effort...

585
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm sorry. It
was an accident.

587
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,840
Don't!

588
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,000
Don't!

589
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,960
Stop it.

590
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,160
No!

591
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,320
All right.

592
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,560
It was an accident.

593
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,840
Gabe?

594
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,120
Gabe?

595
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,800
Gabe?

596
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,360
What are
you doing?

597
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,040
Davey, do
something!

598
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,160
What's wrong?

599
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,800
She's a spastic.

600
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,680
So, what's the matter
with you, then?

601
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,440
Does it happen often?

602
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,000
Sometimes.

603
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,360
I'm not crazy or anything.

604
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,640
No one said
you were:

605
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,480
I just get these
fits sometimes.

606
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,280
There's stuff
i can take for it.

607
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,440
I say we get a shotgun
and spray Harold's window.

608
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,280
Shotguns are for
Elmer Fudd, dickhead.

609
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I vote we get
a .45 automatic

610
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,800
and blow the head gook
back to Singapore.

611
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,880
Saigon, stupid.

612
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,160
i fired a .45
at a range once.

613
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,720
it was far out.

614
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,240
You never used a .45.

615
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,280
Don't shit me, Sonny.

616
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,840
What would you know,
baby Bubs?

617
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,000
An anti-static gun's
big news for you.

618
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,840
We can get any sort of gun
we want from Bully.

619
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,400
All we need
is the cash.

620
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,360
We need it
up front.

621
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,760
if you lot are going
to shoot people...

622
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
We're going.

623
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,720
Then go.

624
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,080
We don't want any
fucking passengers

625
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,520
from here on in.

626
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,360
So fuck off.

627
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,680
Sonny...

628
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,280
Do you want
to come with us?

629
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,200
No.

630
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,080
I want to kill gooks.
Gooks.

631
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,440
Gooks.

632
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,400
We could go
fruit picking.

633
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
i hate the fucking country.

634
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,880
Don't I?

635
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,160
All right, then.

636
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,880
You'll all
end up fucked.

637
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,680
You'll end up fucked
if you don't piss off.

638
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,040
You fucking moles.

639
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,960
I want guns.

640
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,160
Luke, Magoo,
Champ, Brett.

641
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,520
I want revenge.

642
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,480
Bully handles cars, eh?

643
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,720
Yeah, fuck cars.

644
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,880
Let's do a burg.

645
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,680
You want to knock
over a house, do you?

646
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,360
What about it?

647
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,360
I know a place you could do.

648
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,680
It's better than anything
you got on your minds.

649
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,680
Hi.

650
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,120
Ow. Ow.

651
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,360
Fuck your mouth.

652
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,200
You're not going to hit
me again, are you?

653
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,960
Ha!

654
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,920
How are your
renovations going?

655
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,040
Ah, bloody endless.

656
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,400
More Bundy, less Coke.

657
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,840
See, I remembered.

658
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,440
Are you going to stay?

659
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,840
No, this is
just a visit.

660
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,800
Oh, God!

661
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,960
I love you.

662
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,240
Do you know that?

663
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,160
I'm sorry.

664
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,160
Huh?

665
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,200
Sorry.

666
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,800
I'm going to go
to the loo.

667
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,720
I'll be back
in a sec.

668
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,360
Ha!

669
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,040
Nice place you have here.

670
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,440
Who the hell are you?

671
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,600
We came to wreck everything
and ruin your life.

672
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,920
God sent us.

673
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,640
Cheers, mate.

674
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,920
Good on you.

675
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,960
To Martin, the big,
fat, rich pig.

676
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,600
Fucking sack of shit.

677
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,760
Oh, fuck, mate.

678
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,880
You hit me
in the eye, there.

679
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,960
Gook.

680
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,760
Thanks, Martin.

681
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,920
Oh, shit.

682
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,160
Oh, fuck, mate.

683
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,320
What's in it?

684
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
Whack it
in there, mate.

685
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,920
Whack it
in there.

686
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,240
That's shit, isn't it?

687
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,360
Could be worth something.

688
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,520
The guns will be worth a lot.

689
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,120
Hey, Gabe.

690
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,240
Bubs.

691
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,760
Hey, Hando.

692
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,560
i found one
without the barrel filled in.

693
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,240
It doesn't work, though.

694
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
None of them work, Bubs.

695
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,320
The firing pin's
been ground down.

696
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,320
Still looks good, though.

697
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,800
So what does this bastard do
anyway?

698
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,040
Well, he used to be
in advertising

699
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,360
but he made films.

700
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,000
He did Mortal Blade
and Last Blood.

701
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,800
They came out
last year.

702
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,040
Did you
see them?

703
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,480
So how do you know him?

704
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,400
He's my dad.

705
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,440
He won an award

706
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,440
for this poster.

707
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,680
It's good, isn't it?

708
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,760
Did you see it?

709
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,280
He's very talented,
you know.

710
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,720
I'll play you.

711
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,240
Go on, then.

712
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,840
Oh, you fuck.

713
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,000
Hurry up,
come on:

714
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,720
Let's get it
fucking loaded

715
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,000
so we can piss off.

716
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,640
What a
fucking tragedy

717
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,880
breaking this up
for parts.

718
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,520
Cackles!

719
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,200
Just be fucking
careful, all right?

720
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,400
Martin really
loved this car.

721
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,720
Hmm.

722
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,440
Blotted his
copy book

723
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,720
with that piece
of shit, didn't he?

724
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,920
Jap crap.

725
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,120
Bubs!

726
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,520
Come on.

727
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,360
Why are you doing this to me?

728
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,440
I want to see you squirm.

729
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,240
Incredible little bitch.

730
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,000
I loved you.

731
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,520
That wasn't love.

732
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,520
Let me go, Gabrielle.

733
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Why didn't you love mum?

734
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,880
Did she know about us?

735
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,400
Did she?

736
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,840
Sometimes... I think
she killed herself.

737
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
She died in an accident.

738
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,040
An accident,
that's all there was to it.

739
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
I loved her...

740
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
and I loved you.

741
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,040
Shut up!

742
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,000
And you wanted me!

743
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,120
Next time,
I'll aim at your skull.

744
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,280
Check this out.

745
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,080
Timmy and Ted
went to bed

746
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,760
Dressed in red
dressing gowns.

747
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,400
Who's Timmy and Ted?

748
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,720
My cats.

749
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,240
I used to always do this.

750
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,000
That's my brother,
Nicholas.

751
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,480
He's gay now.

752
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,360
He's cute, though.

753
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,360
You're cute, too.

754
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,880
Give me a look.

755
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Oh, it looks all right.

756
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,040
See, Hando doesn't act
like he likes me.

757
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,160
He likes you, though,
doesn't he?

758
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,720
He's my best mate.

759
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,480
I want him to go away
on a holiday with me.

760
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,400
Just him and me.

761
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,520
And you.

762
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,840
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

763
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,880
You like me, don't you?

764
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,880
Don't you?

765
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,600
Quelle etrange
ardeur s'allume!

766
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,720
Quel feu nouveau me consume!

767
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,640
Ta main repousse ma main

768
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,960
Ta main repousse ma main

769
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,320
De nos coeurs
I'amour s'empare

770
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,520
Et nous change en ennemis

771
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,520
Non, que rien
ne nous separe!

772
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,880
Non, rien!

773
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,840
Non, rien ne nous separe!

774
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,960
Non, rien!

775
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,600
Jurons de rester amis!

776
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,200
Jurons de rester amis!

777
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,920
Jurons de rester amis!

778
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,360
Jurons...

779
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:05,520
Oh, oui!
Jurons de rester amis!

780
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:12,200
Oui, c'est elle,
c'est la deesse...

781
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
I'll kill you, boy!

782
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:39,360
C'est elle,
c'est la deesse...

783
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,800
He's got a gun!

784
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,960
Ayons meme sort!

785
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:04,800
Soyons amis
jusqu'a la mort.

786
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,760
Gabrielle!

787
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,960
Stop doing that
to your hair--

788
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,160
You look fucking
pathetic--

789
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,160
and while
you're at it

790
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,840
keep the fucking
noise down as well.

791
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,880
I told you to shut up!

792
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,840
What's wrong with you?

793
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,000
You, you dumb slut--
shut up.

794
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,520
Don't go crazy at me

795
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,240
just because you and your mates
fucked up.

796
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,920
You had it all
on a plate

797
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,360
but no, you had to play
silly buggers with the car.

798
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,440
Why couldn't you just
take his stuff and go?

799
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,480
You're a loser.

800
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,920
Don't call me that.

801
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,160
No one ever calls me that!

802
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,720
I was going to give her
to you, anyway.

803
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,160
I want you to go.

804
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,120
i'm sick of
looking at you.

805
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,640
Go!

806
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,800
We're finished.

807
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,040
You're out.

808
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,360
Just like that?

809
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,520
Yes.

810
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,920
All right.

811
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,760
All right.

812
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,480
You...

813
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,760
You'll all end up...

814
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,760
Shut up.

815
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,880
You live like shit!

816
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,120
You can't even
look after yourselves!

817
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,520
You're just... hopeless!

818
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,720
Where the fuck
are you going?

819
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,120
I'm going home.

820
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,040
Well, good riddance
to you, too, boy!

821
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,000
Maybe you'll get

822
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,200
that fuck you've been after
for so long!

823
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,040
Davey...

824
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,280
What are you leaving us for?

825
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,200
You leaving us for her?

826
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,680
You're a suck.

827
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,000
You're weak!

828
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,280
You're piss-weak
and gutless.

829
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,120
Fuck off, little Bubs.

830
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,160
I thought
you were strong.

831
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,120
You're weak,
you're weak.

832
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,720
You're nothing!

833
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,080
Gabe?

834
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,720
Leave me alone!

835
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,120
Gabe!

836
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,880
Look...

837
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,920
There's something
I've got to do.

838
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,720
Can I come?

839
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,000
No.

840
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,560
Have you got
a piece of paper?

841
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,720
No.

842
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,200
Bubs.

843
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,040
Look... if ever
you need me or want me

844
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,840
I'll be at this address.

845
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,400
Is that Footscray police?

846
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,680
Listen, um...
I know where there's some people

847
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,800
that you might be looking for.

848
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,880
Shut up,
fuckhead.

849
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,160
All right!

850
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,360
it got cut off yesterday.

851
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,040
Anyone know we're here?

852
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,120
No.

853
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,480
No way.

854
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,560
Is there a tap outside?

855
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,320
I don't know.

856
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,960
I thought you were
supposed to be my scout.

857
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,360
Fourth Reich fighting men

858
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,120
Fourth Reich fighting men

859
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,720
Fourth Reich fighting men

860
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,520
Fourth Reich fighting men

861
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,160
Fourth Reich fighting men

862
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,800
Fourth Reich fighting men...

863
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,160
Drop it!

864
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,120
Drop it!

865
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,120
Bubs!

866
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,160
Right.

867
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,760
Pick him up,
Pick him up!

868
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh, no.

869
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,840
Copper, you murdering
fucking...

870
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,160
You fucking...

871
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,760
Fuck off!

872
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,160
You fucking pig!

873
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,480
Les-slut!

874
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,240
Oh, fuck you!

875
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,000
i'll fucking kill you!

876
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,600
I surrender.

877
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,080
Too fucking late.

878
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,600
They're smiling at you.

879
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,320
You have a lovely smile too.

880
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,000
Thank you.

881
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
David.

882
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,240
David.

883
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,560
David!

884
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,360
Hi, Gabe.

885
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Why don't you
bring your friends

886
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,600
into the house

887
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,480
and entertain
them in there?

888
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,280
They're okay
out here, Gran.

889
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,240
You don't look right

890
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,240
without your jacket
with all the badges.

891
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,480
Well, my grandma--
she doesn't know about that.

892
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,760
She doesn't like
the badges or anything.

893
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,320
I don't want to upset her.

894
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,240
It's her place.

895
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,520
What's this?

896
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,360
That's my
matchbox collection.

897
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,040
My dad...

898
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,760
He's an industrial diver.

899
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,360
He travels all around the world.

900
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,000
See?

901
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:26,200
Amsterdam,
San Francisco

902
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,440
Venice, Perth

903
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,080
Naples.

904
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,920
I think he's in Sydney working
on the Sydney Harbour tunnel.

905
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,480
I haven't got a box
from there, huh?

906
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,440
Ow!

907
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,200
I love you.

908
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,240
I love you too.

909
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,720
Don't ever leave me.

910
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,080
Hando!

911
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,280
They killed Bubs.

912
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,640
What?

913
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,360
The cops come.

914
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,400
They took everybody else.

915
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,480
They killed Bubs.

916
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,200
How did they know
where to get us?

917
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,520
No, she's been with me
since she left the squat.

918
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,080
She hasn't told anyone.

919
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,240
David!

920
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,240
What is wrong?

921
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,760
Why are my liebchens
barking so?

922
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,040
It's just a cat.

923
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,960
They've seen a cat.

924
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,200
I'm alone, Gran.

925
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,280
You can't come in,
I'm not dressed.

926
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,320
They'll find
you here.

927
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,120
They'll come
looking for you.

928
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,360
Yeah.

929
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,120
I think we should
stick together.

930
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,440
Past is past, right?

931
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,160
You're all I've
got left, Davey.

932
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,760
What do you want
to do?

933
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,920
I've got a plan, mate.

934
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,680
Don't kill him!

935
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,880
Shut up!

936
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,720
No, he's fucking
killed him!

937
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,680
Oh, Jesus!

938
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,920
Is he dead?

939
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,320
is the car full?

940
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,840
is the car full?!

941
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,200
Is he dead?!

942
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,120
Yes.

943
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,280
is the car full?

944
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,600
Yes.

945
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,720
The fucking Jerry?!

946
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,400
Yes!

947
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,800
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

948
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,480
Why did you fucking
kill him?

949
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,000
We'll dump this piece
of shit in Adelaide.

950
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,760
I haven't been
to the beach in years.

951
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,400
Be all right if
we stay here a while?

952
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,520
Not long.

953
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,200
I think we should
go west.

954
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,240
I'll get you through this,
I promise.

955
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,240
Davey!

956
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,760
We just have
to stick together.

957
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,440
i'm not afraid.

958
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,120
She's sick, mate.

959
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,160
She's trouble.

960
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,240
She doesn't
really want you.

961
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,840
She'll just use you.

962
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,280
You won't get nowhere
with her, Davey.

963
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,200
She needs medicine
or something.

964
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,520
She's my problem,
isn't she?

965
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,720
Listen to me.

966
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,240
Take your hands off me!

967
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,120
I'm sick
of listening to you!

968
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,440
She's desperate!

969
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,160
She'll drag
you down, Davey.

970
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,160
She doesn't love you,
if that's what you think.

971
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,040
Is that what you think?

972
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,920
She's fucking desperate,
that's all.

973
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,280
Davey, she's going
to drag us both down.

974
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,320
Besides which...

975
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,040
you don't want
her involved

976
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,520
if we get caught
for last night, do you?

977
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,440
We've got to
get rid of her.

978
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,280
She can have a share
of the money.

979
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,000
Can't be fairer
than that.

980
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,680
Do you want
to tell her?

981
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,240
I'll tell her
if you want.

982
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,240
You're not just
dumping her.

983
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,200
We'll give her, uh...
We'll give her fucking...

984
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,960
We'll give her fucking
200 bucks, all right?

985
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,640
You've looked after her
as far as you can.

986
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,560
Are you going
to tell her?

987
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,240
Are you going
to tell her?

988
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,600
I'm with her,
and she's with me.

989
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,960
Well, Davey, I tried.

990
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,040
What's that?

991
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,600
That's where
the fucking car is!

992
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,040
What happened?

993
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,440
What happened,
you mental bitch?

994
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,360
Mental bitch, ha!

995
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,920
I heard what
you two said.

996
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,360
I know what
you're going to do.

997
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,720
You suck, Davey.

998
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,440
You can't do anything
without him.

999
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,560
It was me
who called the cops.

1000
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,960
What?

1001
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,520
I called them.

1002
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,960
Davey!
Davey!

1003
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,680
Hando!

1004
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,240
Davey!

1005
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,840
I told you,
you stupid cunt!

1006
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:05,040
i fucking
told you!

1007
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,040
i fucking told you!

1008
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,360
You bitch, you're fucking dead!

1009
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,760
Fuck!

1010
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,920
Stop!

1011
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,160
Stay.
