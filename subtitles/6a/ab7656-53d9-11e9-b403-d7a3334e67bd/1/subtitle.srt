1
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,774
We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars

2
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,512
but the operation was a costly one.

3
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,246
You destroyed the squatter village

4
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,818
and the Government
had to rehouse the families.

5
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,357
and pay the redemption

6
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,018
Last time, during the operation

7
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,861
You damaged the shopping centre as well.

8
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,856
We paid over a million
for the chandelier alone.

9
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:34,835
But the taxpayers know

10
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,879
police work doesn't come cheaply.

11
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,139
But they don't expect to pay for

12
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,975
the cost of someone's heroism.

13
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,885
Why didn't you use the stairs?
Did you have to destroy that chandelier?

14
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,692
Do you always have to be different?

15
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,451
You're right.
This force doesn't need superstars.

16
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,328
We need disciplined policemen.

17
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,199
I wasn't expecting a promotion.

18
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,439
Ka-kui, the operation
succeeded through team effort,

19
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,139
not just because of you.

20
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,606
You should be grateful
that we didn't fire you.

21
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,637
And the bosses wanted you disciplined

22
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,176
for holding me as hostage.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,051
I managed to talk them out of it.

24
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,610
I'm very grateful.

25
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,208
I worry about your individualism,

26
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,071
you're just a police officer.
Don't forget the point.

27
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,503
As of today, you're back in uniform.

28
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,041
You'll be assigned where needed.

29
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,277
You mean he'll be an errand boy?!

30
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,046
I think you'll be very busy.

31
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,364
What else do you do apart
from giving out tickets?

32
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,846
Calling all units,

33
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,624
there's been a serious road accident
at the Industrial Park.

34
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,984
Traffic is brought to a standstill.

35
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,954
All units in the area please respond.

36
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,921
May, go home.
I'm working now.

37
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,391
Just think of me

38
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,789
as a member of the public.

39
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,794
And I want to talk to a policeman.

40
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,024
About what?

41
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,734
I think you look very smart in a uniform.

42
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,969
Stop it, I'm on duty.

43
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,131
I've brought you a cold drink.

44
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,007
Thank you.

45
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,813
Thank you, sir.

46
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,860
I can't drink here.

47
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,702
Go on, you need a break.

48
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,830
If I have a drink,

49
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,069
I'll need the toilet soon.

50
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,399
Come on.

51
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,909
May, I'll get into trouble.

52
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,184
Hello, superhero!
You still haven't been sacked?!

53
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,287
You're lucky you're not in jail with Chu.

54
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,578
You think so?

55
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,829
The doctors said

56
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,489
I only had three months to live.

57
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,997
It's called compassionate release.

58
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,729
Three months can pass quickly, very quickly.

59
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,204
My boss will be alive long after you're dead.

60
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,879
Don't you know you're threatening him?

61
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,947
Really? In that case, he can sue me.

62
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,310
Just be careful!

63
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,441
Drive on.

64
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,146
Ka-kui?

65
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,251
Ka-Kui, Chu Tu is out from Jail.

66
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,544
I know, so?

67
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,845
You already knew? That's good then.

68
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,120
As a police
who wouldn't have caught a thief?

69
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,348
Who would you be scare of?

70
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,292
Just remember,

71
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,523
there are 250,000 Royal HK Police
at your back up.

72
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,360
Bill, are there really 250,000 police in HK?

73
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,031
Just because we
are still recruiting new blood.

74
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,225
Didn't you notice newspaper ad?

75
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,527
What are you waiting for?

76
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,562
Go on patrol!

77
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,675
Hey, I've talked to Raymond.

78
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,004
He said you could carry a gun
even after work.

79
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,677
I'm very happy tonight.

80
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,182
The show and dinner were great.

81
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,287
But you don't seem very happy.

82
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,484
Really? I am happy.

83
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,023
I wish you had enjoyed it
as much as I did.

84
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,557
Are you worried about Chu?

85
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,534
No. But I'm just being careful.

86
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,702
Maybe next week...

87
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,736
Hey, superhero!

88
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,480
Off duty already?

89
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,641
What are you doing here?

90
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,012
I can park here,

91
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,079
you can't give me a ticket.

92
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,525
Yeah, you must have a nice view

93
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,783
from flat B of the first floor.
Am I right?

94
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,652
Go upstairs.

95
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,157
How did you find this address?

96
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,467
It's amazing what information

97
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,234
you can get with money.

98
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,478
People will do anything for money,
you know?

99
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,138
What do you mean?

100
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,613
There's a narrow stairwell in the building.

101
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,318
If there was a fire, it'd spread

102
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,183
rapidly through the building.

103
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,054
Because of the narrow access,

104
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,521
the fire brigade couldn't get in here.

105
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,286
Therefore, you'd better

106
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,963
keep a close eye on her.

107
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,765
If she were to get her pretty ass burnt,

108
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,233
it'd ruin her marriage prospects.

109
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,394
Bastard!

110
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,244
Oh, hero, I'm so happy!

111
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,049
Sorry.

112
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,090
It'd my fault really.

113
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,531
A police like me have lots of enemies
and you are threatened.

114
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,591
I'm not scared.

115
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,831
If you don't have any enemies,

116
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,536
that means you couldn't catch a thief.

117
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,867
Could you rehouse yourself for a while?

118
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,906
Don't worry about me.

119
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,567
They are just morons.

120
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,573
No. We could be noticed
so easily while they won't

121
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,503
This way then,

122
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,847
I'll move to my aunt's and hide for a while.

123
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,441
Don't think about it too much.

124
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,318
But, if you threw a vase onto him
then I'll be dead definitely.

125
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,161
May.

126
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,297
Auntie.

127
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,570
You're on your own?
Where's Ka-kui?

128
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,006
He's still on duty.

129
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,645
It's OK, I can manage.

130
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,245
I'm not against you dating a policeman,

131
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,008
but I don't want him to spend
too much time on his work.

132
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,443
He's stubborn, too.

133
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,013
But he's a good policeman.

134
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,283
That's why he has lots of enemies

135
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,484
and you have to move home.

136
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,094
I have to be careful.

137
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,354
That way, he doesn't need to worry about me.

138
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,696
He ought to worry about you.

139
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,525
Who are they?

140
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,726
It was them last time.

141
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,836
I guess superhero isn't here.

142
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,704
Wait for me in the restaurant.

143
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,099
Right.

144
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,875
What do you want?
We have a score to settle.

145
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,411
I just want to know

146
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,309
where you're going.

147
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,473
It's nothing to do with her.

148
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,345
You must be her mother. Am I right?

149
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,013
Bastard!

150
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,992
You call me a bastard?

151
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,958
Yes! I'm the bastard son of a bastard!

152
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm not afraid of you.

153
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,355
Come on.

154
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:26,200
Auntie, why has your daughter
fallen for a cop?

155
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,666
That could be dangerous.

156
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,535
Living on the 19th floor
is dangerous, too.

157
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:35,213
What if you fall when
you're cleaning the windows?

158
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,304
Go ahead!

159
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,941
Don't be silly.

160
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,379
Go away.

161
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,879
Off!

162
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,153
You bastard.

163
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,482
Don't grab my hair.

164
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,225
You're hurting me.

165
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,588
You bitch.

166
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,527
Easy, she's just a girl.

167
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,634
Think yourself lucky.
If you were a man, you'd be dead.

168
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,928
I won't forget this.

169
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,440
Come on.

170
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,802
You be careful!

171
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,300
Are you ok?

172
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,977
Auntie!

173
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,286
It's your job that brings the enemies here.

174
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,886
Look, May was badly beaten because of you!

175
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,058
I've told you not to be with him.

176
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,322
Did John Ko attack you?

177
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,097
I started hitting him first.

178
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,636
He just hit me back.

179
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,328
And they knocked me down.

180
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,072
My backside still hurts.
I can't sit down now.

181
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,267
How did they know you'd be here?

182
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,375
They followed her.

183
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,978
That's how.

184
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,409
They're watching us from across the street.

185
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,113
I wonder what's next.

186
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,816
Ka-kui, don't!

187
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,453
He should go and scold them.

188
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,084
If it's that simple,

189
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,185
then I'll be relieved.

190
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,078
Idiot! Are you crazy?

191
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,731
What would you do besides bullying women?

192
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,242
It's my favourite hobby.

193
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,490
Get the bastard!

194
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,003
You know the law, don't you?!

195
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,234
If they did threaten her,

196
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,335
you could arrest them.

197
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,808
I don't care.

198
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,541
I got carried away.

199
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,382
That's not a good reason.

200
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,217
He reacted like anyone else would.

201
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,616
He's not anyone else.
He's a police officer.

202
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,221
What you've done is disgraceful!

203
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,415
It has disgraced us the police.

204
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,427
I don't think so.

205
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,450
If a policeman fails to respond to

206
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,618
a personal threat,

207
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,731
it's disgraceful.
And it disgraces the law, too.

208
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,399
You're a show-off.

209
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,589
So we won't forget you arrested Chu.

210
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,769
How can I explain this to the chief!

211
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,973
You don't have to. I quit.

212
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,585
You think that
will resolve the problem?

213
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,114
Why not?
This is probably the best solution.

214
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,780
I'll leave now.

215
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,359
Thank you for your support in the past.
Goodbye.

216
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,622
Ka-kui.

217
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,126
If that's your last word,

218
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,267
then try to find a less stressful job.
Bye-bye.

219
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,737
I will.

220
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,276
You think you can do anything
because you're cops.

221
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,537
Don't you know the law?!

222
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,777
You can't beat me up just like that.
Kill me if you can.

223
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,781
Shut up and sign this.

224
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm not signing anything.
No way!

225
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,524
I'll sue you for every penny
you've got.

226
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,786
I've got lots of money.
I'll get a lawyer. I'll sue you!

227
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,458
What?!

228
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,127
No!

229
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,300
See? You saw this officer
try to assault me.

230
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,803
He wants to beat me up like before

231
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,169
when he hit me and broke my glasses.

232
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,346
You'll pay for that.

233
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,513
You would dare to beat me up here?

234
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,747
Come on. What are you waiting for?!

235
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,581
Come on. I'm going to sue you,
you're going to jail.

236
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,465
These youngsters have no patience.

237
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,901
Bill, why didn't you ask him to stay?

238
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,362
You should have said so!

239
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,964
I thought you meant
throw him out of here.

240
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,875
Now I know what this gesture means,
I'll remember it.

241
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,718
Ka-kui, what's the matter?

242
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,479
You don't want me to be a policeman, do you?

243
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,261
Of course I do, I'm proud of you.

244
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,296
What do I have after being a cop

245
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,358
for such a long time? Just enemies.

246
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,830
There you go!
That means you've done your job well.

247
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,732
If a cop has no enemies,
there is only one reason:

248
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,928
he hasn't caught any crooks.

249
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm glad they hate you!

250
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,867
It proves that you're a tough good cop.

251
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,401
Thanks for that.

252
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,938
But I've had enough.

253
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,810
I resigned today.

254
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:20,840
Really?

255
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,818
Are you disappointed?

256
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,842
You're really quitting?!

257
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,717
I'm so happy!

258
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,415
Calm down.

259
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,318
What's she doing?!

260
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,494
May, for these years,
I haven't treated you as good as I should.

261
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,658
It's my fault.

262
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,793
I have three months' holidays.

263
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,397
Let's go somewhere else to relax!

264
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,464
Ka-kui, you mean it?

265
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,108
Where to go then? Bali.

266
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,133
Good idea!

267
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,013
We haven't travel for years.

268
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,077
Right, so let's go.

269
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,580
It feels good to fly on the plane.

270
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,355
That's $5,540, please.

271
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,483
Right.

272
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,187
I'll see you outside.

273
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,932
Credit card?
Sure.

274
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,637
Here's our catalogue, sir.

275
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,137
Thank you. Bye.

276
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,142
What clothes should I take?

277
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,914
You won't need any in Bali.

278
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,111
Don't be silly!

279
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,757
I can't believe we're going.

280
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,256
I just hope they won't rip us off.

281
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,185
No, they're a big company.

282
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,385
It's trustworthy.

283
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,987
It's paid for now.

284
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,526
Let's cross our fingers.

285
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,659
Fey!
Ka-kui.

286
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,692
Is this your area?

287
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,897
Yes.
What's up?

288
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,906
We've received a bomb threat
in here.

289
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,030
Really?

290
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,202
Yeah. Can you help us out?

291
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,835
All right, then. Thanks.

292
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,304
Ka-kui!

293
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,681
I'll just take a look, all right?

294
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,908
Sun.

295
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,343
Just in time. What's up?

296
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,419
We got a call about a bomb.

297
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,749
Are you sure it's real?

298
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,593
I don't think he was kidding.
He told us to clear the area.

299
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,093
We have ten minutes.

300
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,486
Really?

301
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,659
The manager said he's nuts.

302
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,970
Start clearing the building now.

303
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,569
There are too many people.

304
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,708
If it's a hoax, who'll be to blame?

305
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,671
I'm used to getting an earful.

306
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,141
If it is real, we'll endanger lives.

307
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,974
That's true.
What do we do?

308
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,678
Consider it real. Clear the building.
Call headquarters.

309
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,308
Where's the fire alarm?

310
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,344
Over there.

311
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,611
Ka-kui.

312
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,220
We'll go set off the fire alarm. Come on.

313
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,896
Your truncheon. But...

314
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,023
Come on, I'll bear the consequences.

315
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,095
Follow me.

316
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,380
Don't panic. Don't worry.

317
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,384
Come back. I've opened the till already.

318
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,481
Have they paid?

319
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,261
What's going on?

320
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,523
It's nothing.

321
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,128
What should we do?
They're not taking any notice.

322
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,293
Ka-kui.

323
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,074
Don't stay here. Go on!

324
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,244
Your attention please,
evacuate the building.

325
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,779
Everybody please leave immediately.

326
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,951
There's a fire in the building.

327
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,878
Please leave now.

328
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,652
Please leave in an orderly manner.

329
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,523
Everybody outside.

330
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:50,950
Be careful.

331
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,433
What's going on? Why the alarm's on?

332
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,397
How about our business?

333
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,639
Fay.
What's up?

334
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,736
Get them out of here.

335
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,176
This is for your own safety. Go now!

336
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,974
What about you?

337
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,377
I won't be long. You go first.

338
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,449
Check the building.

339
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,542
I can't understand this. It's crazy!

340
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,372
Who's in charge?

341
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,507
You talk to them.

342
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,445
Please leave here now,
the police will take care of it.

343
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,815
Ka-kui. Ka-kui!

344
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm all right. You go home first.

345
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,490
Hello, sir.

346
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,757
Who made the call?

347
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,767
We received a call

348
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,302
but we didn't know if it was a hoax.

349
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,563
Who set off the alarm?

350
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,299
It was me, sir.

351
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,835
You may leave.

352
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,614
Why did you do it?

353
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,682
Sir, when I was in the Police Academy,

354
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,879
I was taught that

355
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,559
public safety comes first.

356
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,782
So I set off the alarm.

357
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,623
Do you think
you're indispensable?

358
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,864
Superintendent. There's no fire.

359
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,669
But it was your men
who cleared the building.

360
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,396
Right. The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming.

361
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,869
You won't be needed now.

362
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,236
Right. I hope this isn't a hoax.

363
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,737
Uncle Bill. So do I.

364
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,471
Raymond. They want to see
the head man.

365
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,048
Shall I go?

366
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,345
Where's the Bomb Disposal Unit?
On their way.

367
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,313
What a mess.

368
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,482
Did I do the right thing?

369
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,819
How do I do know? Don't ask me.

370
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,990
Right now,

371
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,923
we have to wait and see.

372
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,056
Tell them to leave.

373
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,230
You can go back in very soon.

374
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,435
My ball!

375
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,352
When can we go back in?

376
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,653
Now what?

377
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,461
Very soon.

378
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,431
Here's your ball.

379
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,456
Thank you.

380
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,164
Ready?

381
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,403
The Bomb Disposal Unit are here.

382
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,074
If they don't find anything,

383
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,470
the boss will blow a fuse.

384
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,539
Uncle Bill, I'm very sorry.

385
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,479
I'm not...

386
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,255
Red alert!

387
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,290
All units move in.

388
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,470
Go and fight the fire. Go on.

389
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,513
I suppose the good news is
nobody got hurt.

390
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,674
What are the losses?

391
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,812
The insurance will cover it.

392
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,682
I'm more worried about
the damage to our image.

393
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,252
I've asked the press to cooperate
and I'm sure they will.

394
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,530
But who did it and why our company?

395
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,257
It may not be against us.

396
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,295
It could be someone
who's mentally disturbed.

397
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,600
There's a man on the line, sir.

398
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,273
He says he planted the bomb.

399
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,831
Have it put through.

400
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,200
Put him through.

401
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,136
Hello? Hold on.

402
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,280
Listen, we planted the bomb
in your shopping centre.

403
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,116
We want $10 million.

404
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,618
Pay up or your...
other properties will get bombed.

405
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,112
Let me talk to him.

406
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,222
All right.

407
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,021
But it's a huge amount of money.

408
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,392
We'll need to call a board meeting.

409
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,859
You've got 24 hours.

410
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,324
Don't call the police.

411
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,458
What to do then?

412
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,867
Must be some hoax.

413
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,262
Yes.

414
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,671
So what do we do?

415
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,831
Call the police.

416
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,032
We pay so much tax.

417
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,575
The police should do something for us.

418
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,071
Call the head for me.

419
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,137
Yes.

420
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,048
Raymond, you were extremely lucky.

421
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,583
It's amazing that no one
was hurt in the explosion.

422
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,220
Thank God for that.

423
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,523
And the Chu case, well done!

424
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,523
Thank you. But it wasn't just me.

425
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,185
That's right.

426
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,424
You've proved yourself.

427
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,599
You should handle this case. Do you agree?

428
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,200
Sure. Of course.

429
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,828
Bill.

430
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,299
This is a very tough case.

431
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,371
That's why they gave it to us.

432
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,743
In our department,
who do you think can solve it?

433
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,077
You're the only one.

434
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,506
I want a better idea.

435
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,616
And it's definitely not me.

436
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,523
Maybe we could bring back
somebody who's on leave.

437
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,984
Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui?

438
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,583
He has good experience.

439
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,231
I don't know.
He's unorthodox, impulsive.

440
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,556
He'll only give us trouble.
We have to bear the consequences

441
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,803
I agree he's a little bit rash,
but underneath he's a good cop.

442
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,761
I won't let him do it.

443
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,272
But if you think he's our man,
you go find him.

444
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,542
Let's see who's the boss.

445
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,618
Over there.

446
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,652
Here?

447
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,562
Fasten your seat belt please.

448
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,132
I forgot the sun screen...

449
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,470
Buy it when we get there.

450
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,481
Did you get your passport?
When you were young?

451
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,008
Put out a call
for Detective Chan Ka-kui.

452
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,175
Sure.

453
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,015
Attention please.

454
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,856
Will Chan Ka-kui....

455
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,415
Let me see.
No, don't look!

456
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,324
It's cute.
It's horrible.

457
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,730
..Ka-kui please contact us.

458
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,731
That's you. Yeah.

459
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,357
What's up?
I don't know.

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,526
I won't be long.

461
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,329
Are you Mr. Chan?
Yeah.

462
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,533
I'm afraid there seems to be

463
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,833
a problem with your passport.

464
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,399
Really?

465
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,805
It'll just be a quick check.

466
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,870
What's going on?

467
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,606
I'll be back right away.

468
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,241
Hurry!

469
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,509
OK

470
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,078
Bye-bye.

471
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,758
What do you want?

472
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,303
Thank you.
You're welcome.

473
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,432
What is it? I have a plane waiting.

474
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,534
We have a problem.

475
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,438
It seems that the bombing case
has become a blackmail case.

476
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,247
And it's a very tough one.

477
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,214
So?

478
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,013
This case is a real challenge.

479
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,307
Raymond was hoping...

480
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,918
I was hoping that you might
cancel your holiday.

481
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,822
No! I've already boarded the plane.

482
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,686
And I've quit.

483
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,850
I know how you feel.

484
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,126
You've been under pressure lately.

485
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,623
But ducking out like this?

486
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,989
I'm not ducking out.

487
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,992
He said he's not ducking out!

488
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,699
Raymond is a great admirer of your abilities.

489
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,811
I don't have any abilities.
I'm too impulsive.

490
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,644
Impulsive? More a man of action.

491
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,274
If only I could control my actions.

492
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,042
A true man of action
is one who acts upon instinct.

493
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,252
I think the police force

494
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,413
needs men with discipline.

495
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,458
Instinctive men have to be unconventional,

496
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,691
even at the cost of discipline.

497
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,794
If you did everything by the book,
no cases would be solved. Am I right?

498
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,323
Absolutely.

499
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,059
I'd better get back on board.

500
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,496
You're right.

501
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,231
Goodbye.

502
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,037
How much is the ransom?

503
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,413
Ten million. That's all we know.

504
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,674
Do we have any suspects?

505
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,142
Not a clue.

506
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,947
Do you think these people are insane?

507
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,253
Why are you asking me? I don't know.

508
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,692
Have you traced the dynamite?

509
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,227
Why?

510
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,486
Yes. Why?

511
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,521
Simple.

512
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,000
Dynamite is a controlled substance.

513
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,795
So you either smuggle it in

514
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,562
or steal it from a local company.

515
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,406
He's right. We'd not thought of that.

516
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,902
We must find their bomb factory

517
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,612
before the company pays the ransom.

518
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,848
If we do that, we can foil their plans.

519
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,884
Why can you always solve problems
so easily?

520
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,710
You're the one
who's made for this case.

521
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,149
You're in charge.

522
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,114
I've got a plane to catch.

523
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,122
Wait! Ka-kui.

524
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,252
You can go there any time.

525
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,323
This case is a one-off.

526
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:23,923
Go there next time. OK?

527
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,399
I'd better talk to May first.

528
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,761
Hurry up, then.

529
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,234
Hurry up.

530
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,874
Miss!
Yes, sir?

531
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,576
My plane...
It just took off.

532
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,609
It's taken off!

533
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,153
You've missed your flight!

534
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,120
Trust them to be on schedule.

535
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,090
I still have May's passport.

536
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,524
Damn! It sure isn't your lucky day!

537
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,024
Now what?

538
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,338
Uncle Bill, we better go.

539
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:12,571
All right?

540
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,606
I ate something bad.

541
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,809
That way, sir.

542
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:17,843
Thank you.

543
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,658
Excuse me. We're police officers.
We're here to see Miss Wong.

544
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,982
30th floor.

545
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,183
Thank you.

546
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,753
Bugging devices.

547
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,292
Bugging?

548
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,294
Be careful, Nixon lost his job
because of one of these.

549
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,458
If we are to solve the case,

550
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,930
we have to know our targets well.
We're counting on you.

551
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,763
Put them away.

552
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,544
Miss Wong,
there are two police officers here.

553
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,736
Where's the loo?

554
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,204
On your right.

555
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,405
Thanks.

556
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,909
25 please.

557
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,745
24 please.

558
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,915
Wait!

559
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,295
Uncle Bill, I'm really worried about May.

560
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,590
I'll call Jakarta airport
as soon as I get to the office.

561
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,977
Uncle Bill.

562
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,391
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Haven't you got any manners?

563
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,394
Let's use the other elevators.

564
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,639
Detective Chan
to see Miss Wong.

565
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,771
If you'll please wait.

566
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,806
Thank you.

567
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,178
Ka-Kui

568
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,246
Uncle Bill

569
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,427
I thought you were used to taking the blame.

570
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,429
That's no excuse!

571
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,686
Gentlemen.

572
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,732
I'm Detective Chang, this is Detective Chan.

573
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,856
We...

574
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,392
Please come with me.

575
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,563
We're...
I know. Mr. Fung is busy now

576
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,807
but he's signed the papers.

577
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,837
Excuse me.

578
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,847
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

579
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,012
Down the corridor.

580
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,947
Here, sir.

581
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,582
I'm so sorry.

582
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,556
It's OK. Where's your friend?

583
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,294
He had a sudden urge.

584
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,206
There's the chairman.

585
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,508
That site is worth three billion.
There would be a profit.

586
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,350
Chairman,
Yes?

587
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,185
Detective Chan is here.
Thank you.

588
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,213
Thanks for all your help.

589
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,161
You're developing the new estates very fast.

590
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,332
Please sit.

591
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,545
Welcome to all directors,
managers and heads.

592
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,917
I've called this meeting
to review the performance

593
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,112
of our property portfolio

594
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,082
and to set the sales target
for the next year.

595
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,192
You may all know that

596
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,918
since the collapse of

597
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,254
the stock market last year,

598
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:51,057
the Hang Seng Index has risen 66%.

599
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,894
Let me show you the performance

600
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,504
of the major blue chip shares.

601
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,056
However, by the performance of
the bank and property sectors,

602
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,124
the outlook of the stock market for

603
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,600
the next half year remains uncertain.

604
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,568
In situations like this,

605
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,776
small investors are likely
to put their money in property.

606
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,385
So we have to accelerate the pace of

607
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,184
developing our new housing estates.

608
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,523
Hi, you're gorgeous.

609
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,370
If someone asks the chairman

610
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,605
for this, it's $500 to get it back.

611
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,072
Really?

612
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,106
Yeah. Bye-bye.

613
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,275
What happened?

614
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,446
It's a meeting.

615
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,985
Did you plant the bugs?

616
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,919
Sure.
And the desk?

617
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,823
All done.
Was it easy?

618
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,849
He wasn't against it!

619
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,287
What was said?

620
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,321
Something about houses.

621
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,422
Really?

622
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,368
Where are you going?
I'll take the next one.

623
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,416
May's here.

624
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,323
May, you're back!

625
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,225
May.

626
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,726
You scumbag!

627
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,328
Let me explain.

628
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,306
You...
You didn't want me to come back!

629
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,703
You left me there

630
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,106
and took my passport!

631
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,816
When I got there, I couldn't do anything.

632
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,880
Before I was sent back here,

633
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,883
they detained me for ten hours in a cell!

634
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,123
Why should I keep my voice down?

635
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,355
When you take your dog for a walk,

636
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,027
do you not take him home afterwards?

637
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,595
I'm even worse than a dog.

638
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,389
May, they're watching us.

639
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,967
What are you staring at?

640
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,396
It's none of your business!

641
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,171
I want you to tell me
in front of everyone

642
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,103
what you think I am.

643
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,676
What the hell do you take me for?

644
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,573
You're my girlfriend!

645
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,477
Your girlfriend?! Open up! Open up!

646
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,190
If that's true,
why treat me that way?

647
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,120
You even treat strangers
better than me.

648
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,384
Let me tell you...

649
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,931
it's over between us!

650
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,006
Chan Ka-kui, you bastard!

651
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,318
Uncle Bill, did you make that call?

652
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,754
I needed to go to the toilet.

653
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,081
You've ruined my life.

654
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,392
Wait!

655
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,633
Go away or I'll run you over.

656
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,230
Go away!

657
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,264
Don't be childish!

658
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,638
Don't grab my bag! Go away!

659
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,544
Don't even touch me. Go away.
Leave me alone.

660
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,810
Let me explain.

661
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,313
I don't want to know.

662
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,349
I've nothing else to say to you.

663
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,481
May!

664
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,223
May, are you all right?

665
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,456
Stay away from me.
Don't touch my motorbike.

666
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,031
Keep away.
I don't want you anywhere near me.

667
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,157
Let me explain.

668
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,192
Keep away.

669
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,874
Why won't you help me?!

670
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,874
Just keep away from me.
I don't want to see you again.

671
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,778
May.

672
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,043
All right, get back to work.
I want to see Ka-kui.

673
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,218
Ka-kui, the boss wants to see you.

674
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,367
I'm sorry, sir.

675
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,493
It's all right.

676
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,165
Do you want to call May to explain?

677
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:57,935
I don't think it would help.

678
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,508
Don't explain to women!
This is my way to treat my woman.

679
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,938
If a man's not at home,

680
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,338
it's obvious he's working.

681
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,076
Excuse me, I have to go to the toilet.

682
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,612
Don't take any notice of his chauvinism.

683
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:09,841
Go get changed.

684
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:42,308
Are you going home, May?

685
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,780
It's better than wasting my time here.
Good night.

686
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,150
Can I walk you home?

687
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,282
No thanks.

688
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,667
Don't be foolish.

689
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,925
No, I won't.

690
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,135
Get me, it's me you want.

691
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,327
Don't be foolish.

692
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,841
You're in this together.

693
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,031
Don't try anything.

694
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,443
Prepare to die!

695
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,186
I really had you going! I got the both of you!

696
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,145
Ka-kui!

697
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,291
I've found it.

698
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,084
Looks like you're outnumbered.

699
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,241
If I knew it's merely an easy game

700
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,116
I won't call my men to come.

701
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,645
I'm flattered.

702
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,017
My boss asked me
to teach you a lesson.

703
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,286
I'm paid to do it.

704
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,656
But I don't need to dirty my hands,

705
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,128
my men can take care of you.

706
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,592
Get on with it.

707
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,935
We'll give you a chance.

708
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,332
If you apologise to Mr. Ko now,

709
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,336
we won't break both of your legs.

710
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,237
We'll just break one of them.

711
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,101
Cut the bullshit. Go on, kill me.

712
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,472
Kill a cop? No, I don't think so.

713
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,172
My boss wants to teach you a lesson.

714
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,352
Ripping a few limbs off should do the trick.

715
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,117
Get him!

716
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,089
Go!

717
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,643
There he is. Beat him up!

718
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,344
Go on, finish him off.
Get up.

719
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,829
Move over. Let me drive.

720
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:10,879
I'll turn you into mashed banana.

721
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,401
It wasn't my fault! I was paid to do it.

722
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,026
Keep away or I'll shoot!

723
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:55,895
Shoot me!

724
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,729
I'll shoot.

725
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,461
Shoot here!

726
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,490
It's not my fault.

727
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:09,271
It's not. It's not my fault.

728
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,673
Next time I'll kick your ass.

729
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,280
It's not my fault.

730
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,447
May.

731
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,682
May. Did they hurt you?

732
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,650
I'm all right.

733
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,720
You'd better be careful.

734
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,730
Why did you chase him? It's dangerous.

735
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,139
I wanted to make things up to you.

736
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,699
If it had been acid in that pistol
and not ink,

737
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,668
I'd have been scarred.

738
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,512
Maybe they wanted to distract you
and then kidnap me.

739
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,039
Then what would happen?

740
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:53,623
Ka-kui, I want my boyfriend
to be gentle,

741
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,722
not a savage. Do you understand?

742
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,827
Come in.

743
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,365
Good morning.

744
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,978
Police detective in park rumpus.
Who was that?

745
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,504
Look!

746
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,445
I'll check out the surveillance team.

747
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,488
It was me.

748
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,429
I know Chu wants revenge,

749
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,671
but don't take the law into your own hands.

750
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,967
Sorry, sir.

751
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,799
Anything I can do?

752
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,409
No, thanks.

753
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,343
I can cope with it.
I just want them to leave me alone.

754
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,212
All right. But keep your eyes open.

755
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,353
Now we've got a surveillance team.

756
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,520
They're very good.
Go and talk to them.

757
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,229
Did he give you an earful? Did he...

758
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,592
Let's go over there.

759
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,867
He just want to help.

760
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,973
How to show off if there is no audience?

761
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,684
Sir,

762
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:39,617
let me introduce.

763
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,960
This is Detective Chan Ka-kui;

764
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,522
Detective Ng, Detective Mui.

765
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,689
Hello.

766
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:45,723
You guys introduce yourselves.

767
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,534
Sum Kin

768
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,672
They are the special tactic unit.

769
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:50,962
Please take a seat.

770
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,969
They are expertised in following targets.

771
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,577
But why?
Will this be useful for the case?

772
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,605
Because we don't even know who did it.

773
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,839
That's easy.

774
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,484
Follow anyone suspicious
then you'll know.

775
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,776
Follow the suspects

776
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,289
then we could find the their hiding place
for making bombs.

777
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,147
Just to follow them during the transaction,

778
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,285
then we could arrest them.

779
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,550
That simple?

780
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,358
Of course.

781
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,421
Good, that's why I always have faith on you.

782
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,160
Hope you have a smooth cooperation.

783
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,332
Detective Ng, could I have a word with you?

784
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,095
There will be room for you soon.

785
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:23,595
Go.

786
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,631
Bye.
Bye.

787
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,702
Detective Chan.
Yes.

788
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,310
What does that mean?

789
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,184
Because you are cool.

790
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:45,683
Anything yet?

791
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,159
Fung said his shares would go up.

792
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,194
That's hardly relevant.

793
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,232
And his girlfriend is a top model!

794
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,865
I'm not interested.

795
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,766
I'll take it. You go call May.

796
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:01,933
Go on.

797
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,642
Ka-kui! Listen.

798
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,320
Your conditions have been presented

799
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,421
to the board and they will pay.

800
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,785
No shit. Do you have the money?

801
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,087
We don't have it all.

802
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,931
$10 million is a lot of money.

803
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,323
Trace it.

804
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:33,831
It's from Tai Po.

805
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,866
Check it out.

806
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:55,954
He's in Ting Kok Road.

807
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,489
HQ calling all foot patrols.

808
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,902
Are there any units in Ting Kok Road, over?

809
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,503
This is PC 12674 on Ting Kok Road,
over.

810
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,375
PC 12674,

811
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,943
check anybody leaving
a phone box in the area.

812
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,678
Are you stalling for time?

813
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,888
No, we didn't call the police.

814
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,554
Now we want 20 million.

815
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,352
20 million! It's impossible.

816
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:25,717
Find it.

817
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,358
Wait!

818
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,328
This is PC 12674.

819
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,596
Anything?

820
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,166
I think I've got a suspect.

821
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,935
Be careful. He's very dangerous.

822
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,770
He could be armed.

823
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,407
Keep everything low key.

824
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,717
Excuse me, you're supposed to use
the pedestrian crossing.

825
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,219
Go on.

826
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,962
Give me a chance, Officer.

827
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,522
Can I see your ID card?

828
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,002
Calling HQ...

829
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:29,854
PC 12674, can you hear...

830
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,696
An officer needs assistance
in Ting Kok Road.

831
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,170
I'm sorry, he isn't here.

832
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,864
Don't be sorry.

833
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,209
It's the way things go.
It wasn't your fault.

834
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,909
How long have you been in uniform?

835
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,616
About two months.

836
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,043
Then you're excused.

837
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,982
Will I get in trouble
for losing my gun?

838
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,548
What about promotions?!

839
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:04,625
Don't worry.
As long as you learn

840
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,194
from the experience, it's OK.

841
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:08,453
It happens to every cop.

842
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,487
It won't happen again.

843
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,099
Do you think you'd recognise him?

844
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,223
Sure.

845
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,358
Phone.

846
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,495
I could do with someone like you on the team.

847
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,861
I'll see to it.

848
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,006
Thank you. Can you file this for me?

849
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,610
Hello.
It's Joker.

850
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,137
Go ahead.
News.

851
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,171
What news?

852
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,878
A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite.

853
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,585
Nine o'clock, Hoi Wong Bar.

854
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,864
Do you know what we'll do next?
No.

855
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,894
Really?

856
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,634
What do you want?

857
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,237
Are you Fai? I want to talk.

858
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,271
Do I know you?

859
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,679
No. But you will.

860
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,253
All right. Let's go over there.

861
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,678
I'll be right back.

862
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,130
What's your name?
Lo.

863
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,154
What do you want?

864
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,660
Some explosives.

865
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,557
Explosives?

866
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,830
Do you have some?

867
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,029
What are they for?
Fishing.

868
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,207
You don't look like a fisherman.

869
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,540
What if I told you it was for business?

870
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,700
I'll give you a good price.

871
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,038
What do you say?

872
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,879
All right, I need to speak to someone.

873
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,844
It's not my stuff.
Don't go away.

874
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,411
Thanks.

875
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,837
Sorry, he's out of stock

876
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,374
but he'll call me back.

877
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,084
Stay here, I'll be back
when I've finished.

878
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,107
Thank you.

879
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,090
Hey, you. Stand up.

880
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,726
What's the matter?

881
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,566
CID. On your feet.

882
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,238
Hands up.

883
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,444
I only came for a drink.

884
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,179
A drink?

885
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,777
We heard you were dealing contraband.

886
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,280
Eyes front.

887
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,499
Hold it.
Throw me your gun. Quick!

888
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,197
Stand over there.

889
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,741
Easy. Don't do anything stupid.

890
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,824
Come on. Move.

891
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,457
Come out here!

892
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:02,847
Get lost.

893
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,426
You screwed me over. You bastard!
Why did you call the cops?

894
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,934
Stop! Stop it!

895
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,536
Please, that's enough. Please stop.

896
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:22,733
Why did you do it?

897
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,440
To make sure you weren't a cop.

898
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,308
That's why I called the cops to prove it.

899
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,278
I can get what you need.

900
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,840
Where is it?

901
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:30,975
Have you got the money?

902
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,723
It's cash on delivery.

903
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:42,953
Keep a look out.

904
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,070
Is it good stuff?

905
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,747
It's from the quarries.

906
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,506
Got any more?

907
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:03,741
Yeah, plenty.
