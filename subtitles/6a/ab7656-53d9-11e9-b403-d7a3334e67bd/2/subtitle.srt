1
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,010
There's enough to blow up
the Empire State Building.

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:08,380
I just met him!

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:09,680
I've never seen him before!

4
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:14,515
Do you think you can get away?

5
00:00:17,063 --> 00:00:18,052
Would you like a coffee?

6
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,021
A cigarette?

7
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:27,666
Two spoons of sugar?

8
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:29,163
Yes.

9
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:31,634
The temperature ok?

10
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,406
Ok.

11
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,915
This will offend the law. I won't do it.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,209
You seem comfortable.

13
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:43,846
Then should you cooperate with us now?

14
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:45,947
Cooperation?

15
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:47,715
You want me die?

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,318
If you cooperate, you will walk out of here.

17
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:51,159
We will keep everything secret.

18
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:53,025
If needed, we will keep you under protection.

19
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,000
If you three could protect me
for my whole life,

20
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,527
then I would consider it.

21
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,973
Don't talk that way.

22
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:04,607
Even if we release you now,

23
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,067
after you get out of here,

24
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:09,538
we will find drugs on you.
Well...

25
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,975
we could also find you guilty
for raping young girl.

26
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,049
Have you had good results this way?

27
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,322
Sure. It never fails.

28
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:24,460
What's the charge?

29
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:27,460
I've seen a lot worse than this

30
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,563
before going to jail, I'll play along.

31
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,276
You all seem like nice young ladies...

32
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,080
Have you not seen anything like this before?

33
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:00,225
No! Stop! I've had enough.

34
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,731
No, please!

35
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,102
Nice young ladies, huh?

36
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,836
Aren't you going to play along?

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,677
I'll sue you!

38
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:20,215
Say that again. Guns have a habit of
going off when you least expect it.

39
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,647
We'll just say it was an accident.

40
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,716
Yeah. Escaped prisoner!

41
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,222
Good. Get my gun!

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,455
No! I'll talk.

43
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:30,584
Why didn't you say so?

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,427
Come on, sit down.

45
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,423
Cigarette?

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,689
No.

47
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:37,992
There are men in here.

48
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:44,131
Show's over.

49
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,144
I have sold some explosives lately.

50
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,240
One buyer was a fisherman.

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,939
I've known him for long.

52
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:53,545
After buying, he sold it to someone
who used to blast reef fish.

53
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:55,547
The other one buys my stuff

54
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,847
to refill empty bullet shell cases

55
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,456
and then he sells them as bullets.

56
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:00,950
Yet he had only sold a few.

57
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:02,716
The third guy's name was Polar Bear.

58
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:05,260
He's a big-time dealer.

59
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:07,760
He often hangs out at the Yaumatei Pool Hall.

60
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:33,747
Taxi

61
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:40,287
Target on a taxi.

62
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:41,628
It's BP5608.

63
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,257
Big mouth, got it?

64
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,464
Taxi number BP5608.

65
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,036
Heading north to Kok Road.

66
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,431
Big mouth copied.

67
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,467
I see target BP5608.

68
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,242
It changes to TST metro station.

69
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,450
All copy.

70
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,713
Renew info.

71
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,419
Get to TST metro station.

72
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,101
Target on metro heading Kung Tong.

73
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,066
Copied.

74
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:35,803
Stay there.

75
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:36,904
Yes.

76
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:09,947
Target off metro.

77
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:53,747
Target on a taxi.

78
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,085
It's CW721,

79
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,352
heading Industrial area.

80
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,630
Target off the car.

81
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:05,926
Heading Yat Sing Street.

82
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,027
Copied. Over.

83
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,062
Sum, your team leave first.

84
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,341
Car to Yat Sing Street.

85
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,306
Start supervision. Wait for orders.

86
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,637
Yes.

87
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,315
I'll take a look.

88
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,101
Pal, where is Pak Lok Street?

89
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,161
Don't know.

90
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:42,196
Thanks.

91
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,302
Someone carrying two bags heading your way.

92
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,208
Polar Bear.

93
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,077
You went shopping?

94
00:07:58,557 --> 00:07:59,546
Were you followed?

95
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,684
No. Don't worry.

96
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,418
Come on. Open up.

97
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,286
There are three of them.

98
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,175
Detective Chan, it's them.

99
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,500
Must be them.

100
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,076
Three persons' voices.

101
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,795
Louder, let me hear it.

102
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,461
Brother, stop waiting...

103
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,693
All things prepared?

104
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,534
Of course.

105
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,273
Then, I have to make a call.

106
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:03,977
Not here.

107
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:05,349
Make sure no one bugging.

108
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,759
Find a place in TST.

109
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,018
Make sure everything is fine.

110
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,886
No wasting time. Get going.

111
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,799
Three persons.

112
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,506
They're coming out.

113
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:30,938
Copied.

114
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:32,377
You don't deserve this.

115
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,574
It's you who doesn't deserve it.

116
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,567
Check the number plate
and follow the van.

117
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,869
You stay here, I'll go and take a look.

118
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,372
Right.

119
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,604
Let's go.

120
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,610
We now start the car.

121
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:52,386
Yes.

122
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:53,887
Where are you going?

123
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,594
To take a look.
Be careful.

124
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:56,657
I will.

125
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,292
I see.

126
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,333
Detective Chan,
they've shaken off our unit.

127
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:03,431
They'll come back.

128
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:04,831
Call them off.

129
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:07,803
Come back here.

130
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,783
Don't shoot! It's me!

131
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,144
Be quiet.

132
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:04,685
You scared me.

133
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,595
I fell over.
Someone's up there.

134
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:25,238
Hold it!

135
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:29,910
Turn around.

136
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,021
Police! Who are you?

137
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,023
The guy must be deaf and dumb.

138
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:46,971
Did you see three men
come through here a few hours ago?

139
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:54,669
You ask him.

140
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,481
Do you work here?

141
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:08,688
Do you sleep here?

142
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,296
Right. I got an answer

143
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,130
but I have no idea what it means.

144
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,560
You ask him.

145
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:21,795
Take him to the station.

146
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,036
It's OK. You're coming with me,
just for questions.

147
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,577
Come, it won't cost anything.

148
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:29,903
No need to lock.

149
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:36,119
You don't need those.

150
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,713
He's deaf.

151
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:43,188
Are all these toys in here yours?

152
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:19,886
Stop!

153
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:20,921
He can't hear you.

154
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:33,266
Help me find my gun.

155
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:51,385
Sir! Are you all right?

156
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,490
There's a deaf-mute running around,
find him.

157
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:55,824
Right!

158
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,368
I didn't know he could fight.

159
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:00,400
Neither did l. Go and find my gun.

160
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,628
Ok.

161
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,404
If we can find the backing to finance

162
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:07,804
the buyout of Indian Ocean Bank,

163
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,916
it'll be a welcome addition
to our portfolio.

164
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,674
Mr Fung, telephone.

165
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,379
I said no calls.

166
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,219
I know, but it's that man again.

167
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:20,013
Jimmy.

168
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:23,416
Excuse me.

169
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:37,867
You called the cops.

170
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,309
No, you must be mistaken.
We haven't...

171
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:43,746
Cut the crap.
We knew you'd go to the cops.

172
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:05,226
But we won't change our minds at all.

173
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:06,793
After 12 p.m. tomorrow,

174
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,271
if you still agree to pay
the $20 million,

175
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,634
publish an ad for your company in one

176
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:15,072
of the newspapers tomorrow morning.

177
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,003
Again.

178
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,405
Where was the call from?

179
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,474
It was a modified mobile

180
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:21,675
so we couldn't trace it.

181
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:22,947
We knew you'd go the cops.

182
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,582
But it doesn't change things.

183
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,581
We'll show what we can do

184
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,452
with our explosives at 12 tomorrow.

185
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:29,950
We won't waste time

186
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,020
bargaining with you again.

187
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:33,830
Don't worry, they're bluffing.

188
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:35,555
We've sent extra officers

189
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,100
to protect your buildings.

190
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,559
You'll be fine.

191
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:42,362
Listen,

192
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,873
this blackmail has gone on
long enough. It's time to act.

193
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,204
Fey,

194
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,939
long time no see.

195
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:55,442
Polar Bear.

196
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:57,984
This is Ken.

197
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,715
I didn't grass you up!

198
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,692
Really?

199
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,753
Why did they turn up after you got caught?

200
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,221
Why did they let you go so easily?

201
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,592
Because they couldn't keep me
with no evidence.

202
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,031
I didn't grass you up, I swear!

203
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,533
It makes no difference,

204
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:16,831
we've made other arrangements.

205
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,498
Where are we going?!

206
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:19,532
You'll find out.

207
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,201
Miss Wong. What is it?

208
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:22,936
We've checked the mail.

209
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,738
Thanks.

210
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:25,772
And these are for you.

211
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:27,774
Who sent that?

212
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,377
Don't know. Someone special?

213
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,112
If you don't know, who would?

214
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,679
Thanks.

215
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:39,489
Plant this bomb

216
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,163
and we're even.

217
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,791
Do the job or you're finished.

218
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,593
Where shall I put it?

219
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:47,627
I'll tell you later.

220
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,129
Let's go.

221
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,239
Roger. Thanks a lot.

222
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:01,808
Ready.

223
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:08,391
I'm a cop. What's this?

224
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,250
I'm a cop.

225
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,541
I.D. card

226
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,035
What?

227
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,070
Nothing.

228
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,205
Nothing.

229
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,987
CID. Your case.

230
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,490
Well?

231
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:53,860
Nothing.

232
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,198
Ok.

233
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:56,963
What's that?

234
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,070
Excuse me, CID. May I see your bag?

235
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:13,913
The red bag.

236
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:14,948
Excuse me, CID.

237
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:29,963
Make it quick.

238
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,568
It should be fine.

239
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:36,842
Here's the mail, sir.

240
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:40,773
Roger.

241
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,309
Do you think it's a bluff?

242
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,555
I hope so, but we can't be sure.

243
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,420
Talk to you later. Yes?

244
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,356
Tell her he's coming.

245
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:58,291
Roger.

246
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,262
Ka-kui, May's downstairs.

247
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,834
She wants to talk to you urgently.

248
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,965
Thanks.

249
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:11,079
May. What's the matter?

250
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,845
I've written a letter for you. Bye.

251
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:20,752
May. You came all this way
to give me this?

252
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,991
It's important so keep it safe. Bye.

253
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,589
Oh, yeah, where's the scooter?

254
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,034
We didn't get along so I sold it.

255
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:38,231
I'll follow her.

256
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,846
I have my backup units in position.

257
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,859
Yes. I think they're bluffing.

258
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,288
Then we should depend on the police.

259
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:58,484
All right.

260
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,254
What is going on?

261
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:06,092
Get an ambulance.

262
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,160
Get the fire extinguisher.

263
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:09,073
Call Mr. Lam.

264
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:25,878
Why this happened?

265
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:34,621
Go investigate.

266
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,690
Stay calm.

267
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:36,666
Don't panic.

268
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:37,690
Ka-kui, come with me.

269
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:38,725
Call the fire department. Come on!

270
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,274
Bring a fire extinguisher.

271
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,336
Come on. Put the fire out first.

272
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,071
Come on, get moving.

273
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,339
Ambulance here?

274
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:54,249
No.

275
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,275
Go make calls.

276
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,513
We need more help.

277
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:01,547
Phone, sir.

278
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:02,986
Bill, you take the phone call.

279
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:05,395
Ka-kui, meet me upstairs.

280
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:14,364
I thought you were supposed to protect me.

281
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,201
What's up?

282
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,107
Parcel bomb. Miss Wong lost an arm.

283
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:40,720
How's Miss Wong?

284
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,699
She's doing well.

285
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:45,092
The doctor said her arm would recover.

286
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,264
They'll do a skin graft
on her face later.

287
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:50,596
So we'll wait and see.

288
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:54,807
Wong's decided to pay up.

289
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,276
What am I going to tell Raymond?

290
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,542
Uncle Bill, that's the way it goes.

291
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:03,450
We said it'd be a tough case.

292
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:04,420
We're dealing with

293
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,083
an organised bunch of criminals here.

294
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,983
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

295
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,354
I don't like putting lives at risk.

296
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,925
Don't worry.

297
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,722
If they come and collect the money,
I'm sure we'll get them.

298
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:16,563
If I pass on what you said to Raymond,

299
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,797
he'll not be happy at all.

300
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,264
What we need is real action.

301
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,235
Sir

302
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:27,333
I guess you've seen the papers.

303
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,837
Now what do I tell the chief?

304
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,984
That's the way it goes.

305
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,449
We said it'd be a tough case.

306
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,126
We're dealing with

307
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,157
an organised bunch of criminals here.

308
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,429
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

309
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,462
I don't like putting lives at risk.

310
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,998
Don't worry.

311
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:57,270
If they come and collect the money,
I'm sure we'll get them.

312
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:58,464
All this is talk,

313
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,838
what we need is some real action.

314
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:14,249
Something's up. Raymond's in trouble.

315
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,020
That's the way it goes.

316
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:21,365
We said it'd be a tough case.

317
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,665
We're dealing with

318
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:24,994
an organised bunch of criminals here.

319
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:30,199
I wish they'd blown me up instead.

320
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,767
I don't like putting lives at risk.

321
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:33,433
Don't worry.

322
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:36,578
If they come and collect
I'm sure we'll get them.

323
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:38,212
I understand your situation

324
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:39,848
and I'll note it in the report.

325
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:43,416
Good luck with the case.

326
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,423
You come, too.

327
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:58,032
Why the long face?

328
00:25:58,269 --> 00:25:59,258
Did you two have a fight?

329
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:02,201
Right! But it's the last one.

330
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:17,610
Yes? I'll get him.

331
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:18,644
Hold this.

332
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,282
Ka-kui, phone.

333
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,516
Put it through.

334
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:25,418
Right. Put it through.

335
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:29,088
Hello. Ka-kui.

336
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,699
May's been kidnapped!

337
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:32,024
When?

338
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,469
We'd just left the shop

339
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:35,196
and someone lifted her into a van.

340
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:36,735
Who did it?

341
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:40,302
I don't know. But it must be
something to do with you.

342
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,412
Could it be those thugs again?

343
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:44,576
Chu Tu.

344
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,577
Ka-kui... Hello?

345
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:51,878
Ka-kui! What's up?

346
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:53,823
An old score.

347
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,248
Ka-kui!

348
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:56,883
What happened?

349
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:57,917
May is caught.

350
00:26:58,663 --> 00:27:00,961
What's the matter?
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

351
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,829
Our brothers...

352
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:02,924
Please stop.
He's a patient.

353
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:03,899
Let me finish.

354
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,335
We did what you asked.
That's why we deserve something.

355
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:07,937
You won't need
any money when you're dead.

356
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,809
Chu Tu!

357
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:27,847
Chu Tu! Hey, you!

358
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:05,985
Chu Tu! Chu Tu!

359
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,557
Where is May?

360
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:12,692
I don't know.

361
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,101
I didn't do anything. It's him.

362
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:17,933
Where the hell's May?

363
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,708
Stop it! He's sick.

364
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:22,201
Put him down.

365
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:24,372
Where did you take her?

366
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:25,742
I didn't take her.

367
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,973
Who did then?

368
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,349
I was very nasty to you before.

369
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:29,918
But now I'm sick and penniless.

370
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,917
Why would I take her?

371
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:34,954
He's got no money now.

372
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,353
It has nothing to do with us.

373
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,559
He made your life miserable.

374
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,095
We did it because of money.

375
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,555
Then who could it be?

376
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,131
There's a phone over there.

377
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:49,664
Don't die before you sign this!
Sign this cheque before you're dead.

378
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,809
You...

379
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:54,002
He's nearly dead, so I won't care.

380
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:56,203
If not, maybe I will.

381
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,649
Hello?

382
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:10,783
Ka-kui!

383
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:12,360
May!

384
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:13,959
You recognise her voice.

385
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,130
We're at the Hung Fung Industrial Building.

386
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:18,093
Who is this? What do you want?

387
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:21,071
Come alone or she's dead.

388
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:24,805
Wait!

389
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,166
I know where it is.

390
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:06,813
May! Are you all right?

391
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:11,243
Be quiet.

392
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:12,511
Are you all right?

393
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,679
I'm OK.

394
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:14,847
Why have you kidnapped her?

395
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,023
Ka-kui, by the time you read
this letter...

396
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:19,218
Stop!

397
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:20,694
...I've decided we should be apart.

398
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:21,887
No.

399
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,800
I don't think I'll see you again.

400
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:27,463
It's a love letter!

401
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,434
Just like they say,
Unlucky in love, lucky in money.

402
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,666
There's more.

403
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:34,767
Bastard!

404
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:38,939
When we met,
I thought you liked your job very much

405
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:42,209
and you'd be my Mr Right.

406
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:44,421
Now I realise the only thing

407
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:47,251
that matters in your life is your work.

408
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:51,428
I tell myself that what
made me fall in love with you

409
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:55,358
is also what
made me want to leave you.

410
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,567
Yeah, why? Why did you break up?

411
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:03,498
You told me that

412
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,069
you didn't want me involved with your work,

413
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:06,400
but I didn't mind.

414
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,307
You never spent
enough time with me.

415
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,210
Being with you was
the happiest time in my life.

416
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:14,348
But when you weren't there,

417
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:17,952
it was the worst time of my life.

418
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,417
That's not right.

419
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,820
If I didn't leave you,

420
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:25,823
I'd spend my life waiting
for you to come home...

421
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,093
Can't you stop it?!

422
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:32,862
She's crying!

423
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,226
So is he.

424
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,395
Keep reading, go on.

425
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,709
..because you can never stop
being a policeman.

426
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,603
a policeman who never stops.

427
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:45,807
We're in trouble.

428
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,381
I think it's the right decision.

429
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:54,848
Please forgive me for making
such a selfish choice, May.

430
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,820
What do you want?

431
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:03,733
We want you to help us get rich.

432
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:07,169
Our speciality is blackmail

433
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:12,169
and the hardest part of it is the pick up.

434
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:15,769
You'll collect the ransom for us.

435
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,969
No way!

436
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:18,304
You don't have a choice.

437
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:21,250
He said no.

438
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,252
I think you'll enjoy this.

439
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,354
Stop!

440
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,295
Don't!

441
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:40,465
Stop it! Please!

442
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:44,138
Stop it!

443
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:47,571
Please stop it!

444
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:49,907
Ka-kui, are you hurt?

445
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:52,872
Don't worry.

446
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:56,813
So you want to play the hero?

447
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,872
Now it's your turn.

448
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:30,476
Please don't!

449
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:44,757
You rotten swine!

450
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:48,027
Nice one!

451
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:49,862
Kill me if you have the guts.

452
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:51,233
So tough!

453
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:55,611
Really? Let's see if his girl
is tough, too.

454
00:33:58,516 --> 00:33:59,505
What do you want?

455
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:08,787
How's that?! How's that?

456
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:11,592
Enough! You've made your point.

457
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,086
Does that mean you'll do it?

458
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:17,596
Just let her go. I'll do anything.

459
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,065
We won't let her go

460
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:20,634
unless you help us.

461
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:22,466
What do you want me to do?

462
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:25,073
Collect the money for us.

463
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,333
You don't have any choice.

464
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:38,310
I'll do it.

465
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:39,611
Good man.

466
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,540
I wouldn't advise you to remove it.

467
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,717
Break one wire and the whole thing blows.

468
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:12,545
The same thing happens
if I press this button.

469
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:21,223
You'd better be careful.

470
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:39,838
Ka-kui.

471
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,809
Be careful.

472
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:46,245
I'll come back for you.

473
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,929
Ready?

474
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,064
He's on the line.

475
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:06,098
Trace the call.

476
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:07,232
I'll get Uncle Bill.

477
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:09,968
Is the money ready?

478
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,141
We'll collect it in 10 minutes.

479
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,639
It's ready.

480
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:14,840
Did you call the cops?

481
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:16,008
No.

482
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:29,755
Where's Ka-kui?

483
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,789
I can't find him.

484
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:33,594
How could he be so irresponsible?

485
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:34,626
I can't wait.

486
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,572
Don't take any risks.

487
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:37,996
Let's go.

488
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,813
You'll have 10 minutes
to get back here again.

489
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:50,579
No tricks.

490
00:36:50,988 --> 00:36:52,455
If we don't get our money,

491
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,618
your vest will go bang!

492
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:57,483
We'll be waiting.

493
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:00,185
Get going.

494
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:06,325
Good luck.

495
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:15,467
Yes?

496
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:16,502
Police officers.

497
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,675
Mr. Fung Chairman

498
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:21,940
You will pay me.

499
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,019
How you know?

500
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:25,544
Please sit.

501
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:29,186
You promised to bug

502
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,088
We could check it.

503
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,094
It's bad that you aren't that effective
when handling the bomb case.

504
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:36,255
We have everything ready.

505
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,823
Once they pay the money,
we will have our action.

506
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,095
Hope you won't do anything
to make anything worse.

507
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,032
Because this will encourage the bombers.

508
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:43,603
So they police couldn't help.

509
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,239
We could only depend on ourselves.

510
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:52,204
Ka-kui, the boss was looking...

511
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:55,013
Ka-kui! It's Ka-kui.

512
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:56,575
Ka-kui!

513
00:37:57,788 --> 00:37:59,153
Ka-kui! Out of my way.

514
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,520
Let me go!

515
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:05,285
Get out of my way!

516
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:08,861
Ka-kui!

517
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:12,624
Excuse me.

518
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,362
Ka-kui.

519
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,270
Ka-kui, where have you been?

520
00:38:19,543 --> 00:38:21,943
Never mind. I'm here to collect the money.

521
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:23,368
What?!

522
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,570
Is he your man?

523
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:25,582
Yes, he is.

524
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,776
Ka-kui, what's going on?

525
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:30,444
We don't have much time. The money!

526
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:39,551
What are you doing?

527
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:40,188
Ka-kui!

528
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,358
Move and I'll shoot you.

529
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:43,859
Don't pull the trigger.

530
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,258
No!

531
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:47,492
Don't push me.

532
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:51,606
If you shoot me, everybody here...

533
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:53,737
will be blown sky high.

534
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:00,075
If one wire breaks,
the whole thing will explode.

535
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:02,981
Ka-kui, what's going on?

536
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,051
Can't we work this out?

537
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:07,417
If I don't leave here in 10 minutes,
it will go off.

538
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,419
I don't have time!

539
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:23,395
Let him go. Please leave us.

540
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,167
Attention all units,

541
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:31,070
don't stop Ka-kui.

542
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,283
Ka-kui...

543
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:45,550
Don't follow me.

544
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:50,558
Ka-kui...

545
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:51,723
Get out of my way!

546
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:04,636
I think he did it.

547
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:05,671
Great.

548
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:08,507
Looks like he was followed.

549
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:09,541
Let's go.

550
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,537
Tell him to move up.

551
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,609
Give me the money.

552
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,317
I'm being followed.
Let me shake them off first.

553
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:49,147
Believe me.

554
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,358
Are the cops behind us?

555
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:10,973
Stay back! Don't come near.

556
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:22,851
Why did you stop here?

557
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,889
What are you doing?

558
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:30,956
What's going on?

559
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:32,593
A bomb's about to blow. Run!

560
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:34,764
A bomb! Run!

561
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:56,448
There's no cops!

562
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:58,151
I'll blow him to bits.

563
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,454
Wait! What about the money?

564
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:03,398
And you can't get a radio signal
in the tunnel.

565
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:04,790
What now?

566
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,996
We've got the girl. Don't worry.
Let's go.

567
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:08,226
Maybe we should split up.

568
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:45,891
Kill her if it goes wrong.

569
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,419
May.

570
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:55,229
Where is she?

571
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:18,850
Look, he's back.

572
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,525
I told you he wouldn't play tricks.

573
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:49,080
May!

574
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:56,254
Quiet.

575
00:46:05,942 --> 00:46:08,035
Freeze! You're under arrest.

576
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:11,010
Really?

577
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:13,311
Come on then, arrest us.

578
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:14,873
Don't move.

579
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:16,675
Move and I'll shoot you.

580
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,180
You think so? You'd have to shoot fast.

581
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:22,986
There are three of us.

582
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,849
Think about it.

583
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:26,920
If I don't shoot you,
you'll only spend years in jail.

584
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:28,188
And then you'll be a reformed person.

585
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:29,999
That's better than dying in this condition.

586
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:34,092
We are ready.

587
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:36,199
We want to be rich.

588
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,737
Yes.

589
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,933
But you are way too cruel.

590
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,304
What is cruel?
Fortune Maker

591
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,811
In this society,
only if you do something good to the society,

592
00:46:45,115 --> 00:46:47,276
everyone will help you.
You will be repaid.

593
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:48,406
Then you will be rich.

594
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:52,717
And you will have new outlook.
That's what you could do.

595
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,216
Yet, now what you have done,

596
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:55,823
has harmed the society.

597
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,115
This is against everyone's benefit.

598
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:58,792
What does that mean?

599
00:46:58,862 --> 00:46:59,851
Look.

600
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:00,658
Beside you guys,

601
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:01,789
who will think you are doing the right thing?

602
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:03,295
Who would think of your purpose?

603
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:07,530
You are right.

604
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,597
Yes.

605
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:13,533
That doesn't sound too bad,

606
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,211
we might take your advice.

607
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:18,071
But we're still young.

608
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:20,114
After we did our time, we'd all be old men.

609
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,508
Don't push me!

610
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,688
Run! This is a fireworks factory.

611
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:49,621
May!

612
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,655
I'm over here!

613
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:52,457
Are you all right?

614
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:00,737
Ka-kui, be careful!

615
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:25,556
Good work!

616
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,200
Ka-kui! Come here!

617
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:37,302
There's the rubbish chute.

618
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:51,716
There's an exit.

619
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:55,620
May, you go first.

620
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:03,061
It looks too high.

621
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:04,972
Just jump.

622
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:27,485
Ka-kui, are you all right?

623
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:31,665
I'm fine. Get out of here, May.
As far as you can.

624
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:32,857
Be careful.

625
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:49,228
Dad.

626
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,600
Do you want to try this yourself?

627
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,672
You want some more? Take this.

628
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:56,136
And more, bastard.

629
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:57,973
Want some more?

630
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:00,578
You want some more? Here!

631
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:07,645
Bastard!

632
00:54:07,957 --> 00:54:14,795
More?

633
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:56,260
Shit. Not enough...

634
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:45,718
Ka-kui!

635
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:56,087
Stop crying, OK?

636
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,691
Look, the fireworks are beautiful.
