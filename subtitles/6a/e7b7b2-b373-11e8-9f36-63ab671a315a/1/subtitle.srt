Never. Not once!</i>

31
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,535
<i>Then why are you in mourning?
Because I've never met him.</i>

32
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:54,055
It's amazing. I had no idea
my own funeral could be so delightful.

33
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:57,655
- It certainly brought your career
to a happy end. - End?

36
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,260
You'd spoil any party,
even a funeral.

37
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,620
No, no, no, my friend.
This is a great sight.

38
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,820
Women and women and women.

39
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,140
The eternal hunger
of women for love.

40
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,300
I pretty much
have all my stuff.

41
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,420
Looks like you got a love letter
from one of your other girlfriends.

42
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,780
I don't have
any other girlfriend, Sherry.
Come on!

43
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,620
All right. I get it.

44
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,620
No, you don't.
But it's okay.

45
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,060
That's the way you are.
You're never going to change.

46
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,020
I just don't think
I want to be with an—

47
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,780
an over-the-hill Don Juan
anymore.

48
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,020
What do you want, Sherry?

49
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,980
<i>What do you want, Don?</i>

50
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,620
I mean, I'm like your mistress,

51
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,700
except you're not even married.

52
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,580
L- Look at your friend Winston
next door.

53
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,700
It looks like
they're having a great time.

54
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,580
Don't you ever want
to have a family?

55
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,220
Well, is that what you want?

56
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,020
I don't know what I want,
but I just want to figure it out
by myself.

57
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,260
By yourself.

58
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,180
Yeah.

59
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,860
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

60
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,660
<i>Sherry?</i>

61
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,420
<i>What are you but a female?
Same as you!</i>

62
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,700
<i>Nobody asked you.
He never kissed you.
It was an impudent lie!</i>

63
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,180
<i> Yes, it was a lie.
Don Juan told me so himself.
It was only publicity.</i>

64
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,100
<i>He did not!
Don't you—</i>

65
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,260
<i>And who are you to give orders here?
Who am I?</i>

66
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,660
Don Juan said I was the girl
whose kiss he'd been seeking
on a thousand women's lips!

67
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,460
I was the only one. He'd never love
anybody else in his life!

68
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,820
<i>Ha! He loved you so much that he went
straight from you to another woman.</i>

69
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,260
<i>He loved me!
And loathed young women like you.</i>

70
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,940
<i>Cat!
Cow!</i>

71
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,340
Snake!
Pig!

72
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,740
Goat!
Weasel!

73
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,460
Worm!
No, no, no, no!

74
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah?

75
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,060
Hey, Winston.

76
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,020
You at work?

77
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,860
It's Saturday. Of course. Yeah.

78
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,780
No, I just got up.

79
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
What, you can't access the site?

80
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,980
Yeah. All right. I'll be right over.

81
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes. Coffee would be good.

82
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,340
Will it be a cup
of Ethiopian coffee?

83
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,340
Okay.

84
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,220
Good morning.

85
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,180
<i>Morning, Don!</i>

86
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,540
Hey, you two.
Keep your eyes on the Cheerios.

87
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,700
<i># Galloping donkey #</i>

88
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,940
How's the sweetest grape
on the vine?
I'm good.

89
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,300
Winston is in the back,
on his computer,

90
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,260
in his office.

91
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,620
<i>Irie.</i>

92
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,580
Thank you, Don.

93
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,300
What's up, Winston?
Hey, Don. Listen.
I can't seem to access this site.

94
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,340
I- I need your computer expertise.
Yeah? What is it?

95
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,020
It's like a whole system
for breaking down the plots
of detective fiction...

96
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,060
or the solution of crimes.

97
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,300
Y— Click.

98
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,020
Yes. You see?

99
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,380
And click. I tried before.

100
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,860
Stay calm.
Click. Uh—

101
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,100
Go get 'em, Sherlock.

102
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,060
Cool, cool, cool.

103
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh, this is my kind
of information, man.

104
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,140
I love the Net.

105
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,740
The whole world of information—
through the wall, click.

106
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,980
You sure you don't want
a computer at your house?
No.

107
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,940
Seems awful strange to me.

108
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,540
A man who made all of his money
off of computers doesn't want
to have one in his house.

109
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,900
Oh!

110
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,500
Cool. Cool.
This is fascinating.

111
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,100
Supposedly, you can use this
to write a mystery novel...

112
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,300
or to solve
a complicated crime.

113
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,780
If—

114
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,940
Don.

115
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,860
You all right?

116
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,780
What?

117
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,700
Is something wrong?

118
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,300
Well, it's probably nothing.

119
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,180
Uh, a love letter
from one of your lovely ladies.

120
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,540
Something like that.

121
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,700
I'll read it to you.

122
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,940
"Dear Don, sometimes life
brings some strange surprises.

123
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,580
"It's been almost 20 years
since we've seen each other,

124
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,060
"but now there's something
I need to tell you.

125
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,660
"Years ago, after our story ended,

126
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,980
"I discovered I was pregnant.

127
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,660
"I decided to go through
with the pregnancy,
and I had a baby, a son.

128
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,660
"Your son.

129
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,660
"I decided to raise him by myself
because our time together...

130
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,460
"had come to a close.

131
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,900
"My son is now almost 19.

132
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,860
"He's somewhat shy and secretive,
unlike you,

133
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,220
"but a sensitive, wonderful person.

134
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,620
"A few days ago he left
on a mysterious road trip,

135
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,820
"but I'm almost certain
he's searching for his father.

136
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,500
"I've told him almost nothing about you,

137
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,060
"but he's resourceful and imaginative.

138
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,820
"Anyway, if this is, in fact,
your correct address,

139
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,740
well, I just felt
I should let you know."

140
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,980
There's no signature...

141
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,300
and no return address.

142
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,140
Hey, congratulations!
You're a father.

143
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,660
Uh, you're really upset by this.
C- Can I see it?

144
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,860
Your address is handwritten,

145
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,900
but printed.

146
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,220
Red ink on pink paper.

147
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,860
Typewriter.

148
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,460
<i>A red ribbon. Curious.</i>

149
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,900
"Dear Don, sometimes"—

150
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,820
Hmm.

151
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,620
Damn. This postmark
is too faint to read.
That's fucked up.

152
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,540
Tsk-tsk.

153
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,660
And you have no idea
who this is from?

154
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,940
Nope.

155
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,900
None.

156
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,020
But from all I know,

157
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,900
you are like, uh—
like Don Juan or something.

158
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,020
Don Juan.

159
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,700
I gotta go.

160
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,100
You want me to keep the letter
for forensic evidence or... clues?

161
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,260
Or— Don.

162
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,780
Hmm.

163
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,140
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

164
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,100
I see that.

165
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,380
It's kind of lonely in here, man.

166
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,420
Do you mind?

167
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,660
Is Sherry coming home?
No.

168
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,420
She left.

169
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,340
<i>What do you mean, "She left"?
She went on a trip?</i>

170
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,140
No. I mean, she left.

171
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,660
Sorry, man.

172
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,180
Yeah, me too. I think.

173
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,820
Well, but knowing Sherry,
she probably hasn't played
her last card yet. Right?

174
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,740
Probably not.

175
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,940
Anyway, you've never had trouble
finding interesting females.

176
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,500
I mean, uh, that's the way your life
has been though. Right?

177
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,860
You're like, uh— like Don Juan.

178
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,180
Winston, please stop saying that.

179
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,060
Hey.

180
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,500
About this letter—
I did examine the postmark
under my microscope.

181
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,980
<i>And it is too faint to read,
but the stamp—</i>

182
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,980
it's got on it a woodpecker.

183
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,180
<i>What does that mean to you?
Anything?</i>

184
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,900
Well, what I think we should do...

185
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,100
is to narrow down the possibilities.

186
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,220
Winston, this is probably
someone playing a joke on me.

187
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,980
If not, then...

188
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,900
whatever.

189
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,260
It seems so unfair—
someone to write a letter like this...

190
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,420
and-and-and not sign it?

191
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,900
Don't you want to know
who is the mother of your son?

192
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,940
My hypothetical son?
No, Winston.

193
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,860
<i>I don't, okay?</i>

194
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay.

195
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,540
<i>Then we can just drop it.
We can?</i>

196
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,500
We can, of course. Okay.

197
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,700
<i>Good.
It's dropped.</i>

198
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,580
But then how can you ignore
something like this?

199
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,980
- You need to treat this as a sign.
- What kind of sign?

200
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,980
<i>Of the direction of your life.</i>

201
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,460
Of this present moment.

202
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,300
<i>You need to solve this mystery...</i>

203
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,860
and find out which of your women it was
that you impregnated with your semen
20 years ago.

204
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,820
Winston.

205
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,220
<i>What happened to
that groovin'CD I burned for you?</i>

206
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,100
Here it is. Do you mind?

207
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,740
Ah, that's nice.
Ethiopian sounds.

208
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,820
It's good for the heart.

209
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,740
Look, come over tomorrow
for, uh, Sunday brunch,

210
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,860
and, uh, we'll talk a little further
about our investigative plan, huh?

211
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,860
So I'll leave that right there.

212
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Go home
and leave me alone.

213
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,180
Okay, man. I love you too.

214
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,660
I think your father's real name
is Sam Spade.

215
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,060
My father isn't Sam Spade.

216
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,220
No? Think he's Sherlock Holmes?

217
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,660
No.

218
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,220
Well, I know he's one
of those famous detectives.
Mike Hammer!

219
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,380
No, not Mike Hammer.

220
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,300
Oh, I know.
He's that Dolemite guy. Right?

221
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,100
No, not Dolemite.
No?

222
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
He's down.

223
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,780
Keep your eyes open.
He may be Dolemite.
No!

224
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,740
Mona,

225
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,660
thank you.

226
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,500
That was so delicious.
You're welcome. Anytime.

227
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,460
Really?
Mm-hmm.

228
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,220
What time's dinner?

229
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,820
You are the most perfect woman
in the world.

230
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tell you something.
That's mine.

231
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,060
Come, come, come.

232
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,300
No cigarettes.

233
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,140
That's where you get
your appetite.

234
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,140
Your woman cooks too good.

235
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,220
I'd like to look
at that pink letter again.
Let me see it.

236
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,100
I burned it last night—
microwave.
Yes, little Rita?

237
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,180
Papa, you're smoking again.

238
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,580
No, no, no. This is just herbs.
It's just a little Cheeba. Hmm?

239
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,580
Let me see that.

240
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,860
<i>He's right.
It's just cannabis sativa.</i>

241
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,860
You see?
Just a little indigo, baby.

242
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,260
'Cause Mama says,
"No more smoking tobacco anymore."

243
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,580
Yeah, I know.
I gave it up.
Never!

244
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,340
Never!
No more tobacco. I promise.
Okay.

245
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,220
Come, come, come, come.
Let me see this mysterious pink letter.

246
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,980
Okay. What you have to
do for me is make a list.

247
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,180
A list.

248
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,260
I need the possibilities
of who the mother might be.

249
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,340
You give me a list
of all your girlfriends
from back then,

250
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,620
and then I can plan everything.

251
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
Uh, I think I'm going home,
Sherlock.

252
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Just destroy that letter
when you're through with it,
will you?

253
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,540
Work on that list.

254
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,780
Hello, Winston?

255
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,500
What list?

256
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,980
<i>No, haven't even thought about it.</i>

257
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,980
Are you on a cell phone?

258
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,500
Yeah. Is it okay if I run in
and grab that list?

259
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,060
Sure. Why not?
Great. Hold on a second.

260
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,980
Any other info
on where they might be?

261
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,180
Not really.
That's where they lived
or their families lived.

262
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,500
That's all I can remember.
Good. Cool.

263
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,820
Okay. Sorry about that.
It's okay.

264
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,780
Look, man. I'm all over this.

265
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,700
The day after tomorrow,
I'll have everything ready.

266
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,700
Knock yourself out.

267
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,220
Don, man,
my lunch break's almost over.
Sorry. What's up?

268
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,180
Look, I got all the info right here,
based on your list,

269
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,100
plus the whole plan.

270
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,660
You got addresses,
married names,

271
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,780
in some cases even their jobs.

272
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,740
I've got some sad news though.
What?

273
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,100
That girl named Michelle Pepe?

274
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,820
She died in a car accident...

275
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,740
<i>five years ago.</i>

276
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,380
I found the name of the cemetery
where she—well, where she is.

277
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,580
Little Michelle Pepe?

278
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,260
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

279
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,220
<i>But the other four—
I got all their info.</i>

280
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,060
Well, that's...
very impressive, Winston.

281
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,540
I really don't know
why you did all of this.
What am I supposed to do about it?

282
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,020
Look, your whole trip—
it's all planned.

283
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,340
Booked reservations, rental cars.
Everything you need.

284
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,220
- All you have to do
is give them the credit card.
- What are you talking about?

285
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,060
You go visit them.
You go to their houses.
You see them.

286
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,060
You bring flowers, pink flowers.
You're just checking in.

287
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,740
Just checking in.

288
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,460
<i>I even got maps.
Everything you need.</i>

289
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,820
And I burned you a new CD, see?

290
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,060
<i>That's traveling music.
That I'll take.</i>

291
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,820
Uh, just coffee, please, Avis.
Thank you.

292
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,300
A few tips though.
Dress conservative, a little classy.

293
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,220
Don't give anything away.

294
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,260
And always, always bring flowers.
Pink flowers.

295
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,220
<i>And look for clues about your son—
photographs, anything.</i>

296
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,820
<i>Or hints, like pink stationery
and red ink.</i>

297
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,300
<i>Handwriting, if possible.
And find that typewriter.</i>

298
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,500
Bring me that typewriter,

299
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,180
and then I can forensically
match the type...

300
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,100
to the letter.

301
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,820
You're insane, Winston.

302
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,580
Even if you could possibly
rope me into this nonsense,

303
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,540
which you can't,

304
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,660
I'm not a detective,
I'm not a private eye
in one of your crime novels.

305
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,260
Forget it. No fuckin' way.

306
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,460
<i>What, after all the work I've done?
Well, you do it.</i>

307
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,020
You take the trip.
I'll pay for it.

308
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,940
<i>Me? Impossible.
I've got threejobs and five kids.</i>

309
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,620
<i>And, besides, it's your life.</i>

310
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,020
I've merely prepared the strategy.

311
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,300
But only you can solve the mystery.

312
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,380
And why is that?

313
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,820
Because you understand women.

314
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,620
Let me ask you something.

315
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,100
Suppose I took
this ridiculous trip,

316
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,300
and say this kid really exists,

317
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,060
and he shows up...
while I'm gone.

318
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,540
Don, don't worry.
I'll monitor your house every day.

319
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,100
Yeah? Then what?
What do you do?
If he shows up?

320
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,460
He shows up.
Don't worry.
I apprehend him.

321
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,660
Oh, okay. Great.
You apprehend him.

322
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,140
Look, I've got seven minutes
before I'm due to punch in.

323
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,460
Tomorrow morning,
on my way to the plant,
I will drop you at the airport.

324
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,900
No problem.
I got you an early flight.

325
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,340
It's not gonna happen.
No way.

326
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,420
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning
at 7:00 a.m. Sharp.

327
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>#I want you #
#And I want you #</i>

328
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,580
<i># The right way
I want you #</i>

329
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,820
<i>#Listen, but I want you
to want me too #</i>

330
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,180
<i># The right way, babe #</i>

331
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,020
<i>#Just like I want you #</i>

332
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,940
<i># Ooh-hoo, ooh #</i>

333
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,260
<i>#I'll give you all the love #</i>

334
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,940
<i>#I want in return #</i>

335
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,900
<i>#Sweet darling #</i>

336
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,980
<i>#But half the love #</i>

337
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,700
<i>#Is all I feel #</i>

338
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
<i># Ooh-ooh-ooh #</i>

339
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,340
<i>#Don't play with something #</i>

340
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,020
<i># You should cherish for life #</i>

341
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,940
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

342
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,900
<i>#Don't you wanna care #</i>

343
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,180
<i>#Ain't it lonely out there #</i>

344
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,780
<i>#I want you #</i>

345
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,820
<i># The right way, baby #</i>

346
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,940
<i>#I want you, babe #</i>

347
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,140
<i>#But I want you
to want me too, baby #</i>

348
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,940
<i># Got to, got to, got to #
# Want you to want me too #</i>

349
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,860
<i>#Love me too #
#Baby #</i>

350
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,540
<i># Oh, the way that I love you #
#Just like I love you ##</i>

351
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,900
<i> My mom won't let me wear a bikini.
I can't believe your mom
let you come on this trip.</i>

352
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,860
<i>Oh, she doesn't know.
I mean, she knows, but she thinks
that I'm with your family.</i>

353
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,220
<i>No, she wouldn't have let me come,
and you would have been
totally mad at me.</i>

354
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,660
<i>What if she calls my mom?
She's not gonna call her.
She thinks that she's here.</i>

355
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,260
See, it's perfect.
No, it'll be fine. Don't worry.
Wait, wait, wait. What?

356
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,660
Don't even worry about it.
Do I need to call my mom? 'Cause
my mom will totally lie for you.

357
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,300
<i>I want to go to the party tonight,
and I really want to be able
to meet some cute guys.</i>

358
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,420
That guy is so cute
that's sitting behind me.
Can you see him?

359
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,180
<i>Oh, my God.
He's really cute though.
Don't stare at him.</i>

360
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,140
<i>He is cute.
He looks like a supermodel.</i>

361
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,340
<i>No, he looks like the Calvin Klein model
that's on the side of the bus.
Oh, my gosh. He's so cool.</i>

362
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,740
<i>He's totally staring at us right now.
Think Ally will take us to get something
to eat before we go? I'm starving!</i>

363
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,500
<i>That's why you need
the mix-and-match
for when you get fat.</i>

364
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,140
<i>Oh, my God. I know!
We're such heifers.
You get the bigger sizes.</i>

365
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,460
<i>I look so fat.
Doughnut girl.</i>

366
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,260
<i>Look for clues,</i>

367
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,180
<i>like a typewriter,
like something pink.</i>

368
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,740
<i>This will be very easy.</i>

369
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,300
Hi, Laura. It's me, Don.
Remember me?

370
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,020
Hi. Who are you?

371
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,420
Don Johnston.
Really?

372
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,220
You're Don Johnson?
Yeah— No.

373
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,220
Johnston with a "T."
Oh.

374
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,300
Uh, does Laura Daniels,
who was formerly Laura Miller,
live here?

375
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,180
Yeah. That's my mom.

376
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,220
Well, I'm a very old friend of hers,

377
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,940
and I haven't seen her
in, um, in over—

378
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,940
Well, come on in.

379
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,540
So, my mom'll be home from work soon,
so just sit down. Here.

380
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,500
Make yourself comfortable.

381
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,460
So, my name's Lola.

382
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,980
Well, sometimes people call me Lo,
but my really real name is Lolita.

383
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,900
Lolita?

384
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,140
Yeah.

385
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,060
Well, I-I don't—
Do you want something?
'Cause we've got Popsicles.

386
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,900
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

387
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,020
<i>Lolita.
Yeah?</i>

388
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,620
<i>Do you have
any brothers or sisters?
Why?</i>

389
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,020
Do you think I need some?

390
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,540
Oh, wait, that's my phone.

391
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,860
Just—Just stay there.
I'll be right back, okay?

392
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,220
<i>Okay.</i>

393
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,420
<i>#And it looks so high #</i>

394
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,420
<i>#And it looks so wasted #</i>

395
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,460
<i>#And, baby, I know why #</i>

396
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,420
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

397
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,940
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

398
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,660
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

399
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,300
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

400
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,580
<i># Take my money #</i>

401
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,460
<i># Take my time #</i>

402
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,220
<i># Take my sister #</i>

403
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,060
<i>#I don't mind #</i>

404
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,340
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

405
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,980
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba #</i>

406
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,620
<i>#Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ##</i>

407
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,100
That's so crazy.

408
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,460
Really?

409
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,260
<i>That's so sick.</i>

410
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,860
He didn't. Wait. Hold on.
My cell phone's ringing. Hello?

411
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,420
<i>Yeah. I know. I just talked to her.</i>

412
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,500
That's crazy, right?

413
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,460
<i>I know.</i>

414
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,420
Can I help you with something?

415
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,060
Donny, is that you?

416
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,180
Hey, Laura.

417
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,100
What are you doing here?

418
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,740
We're having chicken for dinner.

419
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,180
That was quite an outfit
you weren't wearing earlier.

420
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,460
Well, here we are.

421
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:55,180
<i>Then Larry exploded
in a ball offlames at the track.</i>

422
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,580
That happened,
and now it's just me and Lo.

423
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,900
It was even on TV.

424
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,340
I'm sorry.

425
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,060
Lo, your head looks
just like a pineapple.

426
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,860
- Mom!
- Doesn't it?

427
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,620
Yeah, it does look like a pineapple.

428
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,140
So, what, uh—

429
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,820
Where do you work?
Oh, Mom has her own business.
Right?

430
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,740
Yeah.
Really?

431
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,180
I'm a professional
closet organizer.

432
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,460
Come on.
No, I organize people's closets.

433
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
I even do their drawers.

434
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,860
I label everything.
I get them all organized.

435
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,140
I even color coordinate them.

436
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,540
Yeah.
And they pay her for that.
It's amazing.

437
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,220
Lolita, I said you— Lolita!

438
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,140
I said you could have a taste.

439
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,940
Now, come on.
That's enough of that.
That's not cool.

440
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,460
Lolita. Interesting choice
of name, Laura.

441
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,140
What?

442
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,140
<i>So, Donny, I heard you made it big
in business a few years ago?</i>

443
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,140
What are you into?

444
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,860
It was computers.
Oh, high-tech stuff.

445
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,900
More high tech
than pencils, I guess.

446
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,380
Mr. Fancy Pants!

447
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,780
<i>Yeah, my pants are fancy.
So what?</i>

448
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,860
So I see you're having
a yard sale?

449
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,180
Uh, you got me.
It's something we do
on Saturdays.

450
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah, Larry had all this crap
in the garage, and—

451
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,580
And then I got this neighbor
to paint a sign for us.

452
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,500
It's fun.

453
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,940
Are you gonna be selling
any old, uh, typewriters?

454
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,180
No.

455
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,660
Wh—
That's so 20th century.

456
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,460
Did you come all the way down here
to get a typewriter, Don?

457
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,900
What do you want a typewriter for?

458
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,100
An old friend asked me
if I would look around
for a typewriter.

459
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,660
So... I just remembered it.

460
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Well—

461
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,980
You know,
I forgot to make dessert.

462
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,940
Oh, Don doesn't like Popsicles.

463
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,620
Donny.

464
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,620
What are you doing here?

465
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,060
I was just looking
for a typewriter.

466
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,180
Oh.

467
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,700
I remember.

468
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,420
Bye.

469
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,340
Hey.

470
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,540
Bye, Don.

471
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,020
Good-bye, Laura.

472
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,460
<i>Come back sometime.</i>

473
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,380
<i>See you, Laura.</i>

474
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,620
Lo! Go.
Put some clothes on.

475
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,700
Can I help you?
Dora?

476
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,220
Yes.

477
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,420
It's me, Don.

478
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,020
Remember me?

479
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,940
Oh, Don!

480
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,940
What—What are you doing here?

481
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,420
I brought these flowers.

482
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,500
So beautiful.

483
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,940
Wanna come in?

484
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,620
So,

485
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,620
what brings you out here?

486
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,660
Well, I was kind of in the area,
so I thought I'd drop in.

487
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,020
I see.

488
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,300
How— How did you
track me down, exactly?

489
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,580
Uh, on the computer.

490
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,580
They can do anything.

491
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,060
Nice place you've got here.

492
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,020
<i>Oh, thank you.
It's a nice example.</i>

493
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,100
My husband and I
are in real estate.

494
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,500
<i>We sell landscape lots...</i>

495
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,820
and preconstructed designer homes.

496
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,420
Or do you already have this information
from your computer?

497
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,580
<i>No.</i>

498
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,380
Your card is pink.

499
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,740
Yes.

500
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,420
Ron, my husband, thought it would be cute
if mine were pink and his blue.

501
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,060
I like those pearis.

502
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,140
<i>Did I give you those?</i>

503
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,740
I don't think so.

504
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,580
<i>I should have.</i>

505
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,900
It's very strange,
your showing up like this.

506
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,260
<i>Yeah, it is strange.</i>

507
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,860
It's my husband.

508
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,460
<i>Hey! Where's my perfect little wi—</i>

509
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,420
<i>Well, what have we here?</i>

510
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,140
Hi. Don Johnston.

511
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,020
I'm a really old
friend of Dora's.
Oh.

512
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,820
<i>You don't look really old.
Just kinda old.</i>

513
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,100
<i>I'm Ron.</i>

514
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,580
<i>Don Johnston.
Mm-hmm.</i>

515
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,500
That's an old flame of yours,
right, honey?

516
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,740
Don just dropped in
completely unexpectedly.

517
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,900
<i>Wow! Nice to meet you, Don.</i>

518
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,060
Ron and Don.

519
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,380
Hey, uh, is Don gonna stay
for dinner? I hope.

520
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,980
No. I really couldn't.

521
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,180
Well, sure you could.

522
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,940
Right? Honey?

523
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,060
<i>Computers, huh? Wow.</i>

524
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,540
<i>That's gotta be a lucrative field.</i>

525
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,740
Yeah, I've done pretty well.

526
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,020
Hmm. Well, the real estate biz
has been very good to us.

527
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,940
<i>Right, hon?</i>

528
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,700
At first I had the idea
of going into bottled water.

529
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,020
I think in the near future,
water will be worth more
than oil or gold.

530
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,900
<i>Yeah. You're dying of thirst,
you can't take a swig of oil.</i>

531
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,820
Right?

532
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,700
Or gold, for that matter.

533
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,380
Boy, you are certainly
right about that.

534
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,660
But for right now,

535
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,140
we decided that real estate
and quality prefab homes...

536
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,420
was the right way to go.

537
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,540
And it has been
quite lucrative.

538
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,540
Hon, those are
beautiful flowers.

539
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,500
Mmm.

540
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,500
Hey!

541
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,460
Don, I want to
show you something.
Excuse me.

542
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,500
Isn't this
the coolest photo?

543
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,260
Wow. Yeah.

544
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,180
Yeah?
This is crazy, right?

545
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,220
My straight little Dora.

546
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,980
My adorable little Dora.
Mmm.

547
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,340
Young hippie chick.

548
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,540
That is great, Ron.
Now, could you please
put it back?

549
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,500
Sorry, baby.

550
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,820
Probably brings back
one or two memories, huh, Don?

551
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,060
I took that photo,
didn't I?

552
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,900
Mm-hmm.

553
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,780
Well, you know, it's strange...

554
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,940
how people's lives change,
isn't it?

555
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,740
So, any kids?

556
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,500
Well, that's—
that's kind of a touchy subject.

557
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,500
See, I always wanted
to have kids with Dora.

558
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,900
You know,
I mean, kids of our own.

559
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,260
<i>But she didn't, really,
so I respect that.</i>

560
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,780
Oh, I don't know if I would have
had the time and patience
to be a good mother...

561
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,260
to— to Ron's children.

562
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,420
I'm just happy to have my Dora.

563
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,020
What about you, Don?

564
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,980
You married?

565
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,700
No, I'm still a bachelor.

566
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,380
A bachelor?

567
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,300
Wow.

568
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,460
But any kids?
He said he was still
a bachelor.

569
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,660
Well, honey, you know—

570
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,020
You never know.
One or two could have gotten away.

571
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,700
No. No kids I know of.

572
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,420
Hello, Winston.

573
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,340
Just a crazy guess.

574
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,420
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing up here.

575
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,380
I'm gettin' nowhere.

576
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,940
Yeah, I saw her.

577
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,860
Yeah, I saw her too.

578
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,340
Yesterday.

579
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,020
No. No clues.

580
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,980
No typewriters.

581
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,340
Couldn't you have rented me,
like, a Porsche or some car
that I might really drive?

582
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,220
I'm a stalker in a Taurus.

583
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,940
I have done everything
that you wanted me to do, you know.

584
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,020
I- I-I've really had enough of this.

585
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,500
I think I oughta go back today.

586
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,460
Yeah, but l— I don't—
I don't think I wanna see her.

587
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,100
No, Winston—

588
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,420
Winston, let me—
let me talk to you later, okay?

589
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,660
Can I just—Yeah.

590
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,100
Let me talk to you later.
Please?

591
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,580
Okay? Thanks.

592
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,180
I'll talk to you in a while.
Okay?

593
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,540
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're now on our final descent.</i>

594
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,860
<i>Please return to your seats
and make sure your seat belts
are securely fastened. Thank you.</i>

595
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,460
I heard what you said.

596
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,540
And I heard
what Dr. Markowski said.

597
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,460
<i>You have to believe
in yourself.</i>

598
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,500
<i>I have a lot of respect for you.</i>

599
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,860
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

600
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,740
<i>I understand, and I'll try
to do better next time.</i>

601
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,660
Hi.

602
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:12,780
It takes a lot of courage
to say what you said.
I'm very proud of you.

603
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,620
<i>And I want you to know that
I think you're doing very, very well...</i>

604
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,660
<i>and I believe in you.</i>

605
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,220
Yeah, she definitely
speaks to iguanas.

606
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,540
<i>Okay. That's right.</i>

607
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,860
<i>Call back on Monday
and we'll happily schedule you and Iggy.</i>

608
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,780
Sure.
Mm-kay. Thank you.

609
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,260
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnston,
but Dr. Markowski
only takes appointments,

610
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,780
and she's in a session
right now.

611
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,060
Is your animal friend
with you?

612
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,940
Uh, no, I-I-I don't have
an animal friend.

613
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,620
I'm an old friend of Carm—
uh, Dr. Markowski's.

614
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,020
Um, Carmen has
a really tight schedule.

615
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,900
She may have a minute,
if you want to sit down.

616
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,060
Yeah, okay.

617
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,980
<i>No, no, no.
Of course I won't forget you, Cleo.</i>

618
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,140
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

619
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,540
<i>Thank you,
Dr. Markowski.
Mm-hmm.</i>

620
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,020
- Bye now.
- Bye, Cleo.

621
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,020
See you next week,
Mrs. Dorston.

622
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,260
So, what do we have next?

623
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,140
Don?

624
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,260
So, you're an animal psychic?

625
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,220
No.
I'm a communicator.

626
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,580
And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

627
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,500
When we were together,
you were so passionate
about becoming a lawyer.

628
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,500
I mean, you were...

629
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,740
very passionate.

630
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,420
Yeah, well,
passion's a funny thing.

631
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,740
<i>I have a doctorate
in animal behavior.</i>

632
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,380
But that was
sort of after the fact.

633
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,740
It's an odd story.

634
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,380
I'm getting into odd stories.

635
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,820
Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

636
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,660
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

637
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,340
except for my dog,
Winston.

638
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,900
Your dog's named Winston?

639
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,900
<i>Yes.</i>

640
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,820
<i>But then he died...</i>

641
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,780
suddenly.

642
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,060
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
It was, uh—

643
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,980
It was years ago.

644
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,220
But my new ability was this gift.

645
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,580
This gift from Winston.

646
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,380
All right,
you can come in again.

647
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,420
Anyway,

648
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,260
<i>after Winston died
I got this gift.</i>

649
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,660
<i>To—</i>

650
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,940
<i>To read animals' minds?
No. I told you—</i>

651
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,180
- No.
- I'm a communicator.

652
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,860
You see,
soon after Winston died...

653
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,500
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

654
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,940
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

655
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,100
And I don't
read animals' minds.

656
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,780
<i>But when they want
to communicate,</i>

657
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,340
<i>I can hear them.</i>

658
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,820
You know,
like you and I are talking.

659
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,980
<i>But we don't
read each other's minds.</i>

660
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,860
Is he saying something?

661
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,460
He says
you have a hidden agenda.

662
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,940
He— He said that?

663
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,420
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

664
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,420
<i>Animals can tell us
what they want,</i>

665
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,300
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

666
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,500
<i>Yes?</i>

667
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,940
Excuse me, Carmen,
but Mr. Renaldo and Skippy
are here for your next session.

668
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,860
Oh. Okay.

669
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,900
Um, give me
one more minute.

670
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:02,940
<i>Sorry, Don, but I really
can't keep Skippy waiting.</i>

671
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:08,220
Do you think you could tell Skippy
that you're just gonna walk me to my car?

672
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,300
How about later?
Wanna get a drink?

673
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,220
No. I don't drink.

674
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,140
Maybe get something to eat?

675
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,940
I don't, uh, eat.

676
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,620
You don't?

677
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,500
Uh, take a walk?

678
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,420
I know you walk.
I don't feel like it.

679
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,780
Do you have a typewriter?

680
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,780
A typewriter?

681
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,780
Are you married?

682
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,820
You know, I think you
should probably go now.

683
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,820
Oh, come on, Carmen.

684
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,340
Can't you answer me?
No.

685
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,500
"No," you won't answer me?

686
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,900
No, I'm not married.

687
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,780
I was though.

688
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,740
Any kids?

689
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,100
Yes.

690
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,580
<i>I have a daughter, Lianna.
She's 16.</i>

691
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,420
She's in Sweden.

692
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,500
Sweden.

693
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,860
Am I supposed to ask
about you?

694
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,780
<i>It seems like I've told you
my whole life story.</i>

695
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,700
<i>So—
Me? No.</i>

696
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,620
I'm not married.

697
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,540
<i>Of course you aren't.</i>

698
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,140
And I don't have any kids.

699
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,100
Do I?

700
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,060
How would I know that?

701
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,820
Sorry, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo
and Skippy have been waiting
in the session room.

702
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,140
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.

703
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,140
Okay.

704
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,780
Well, my time is really up.

705
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,980
So, good-bye.

706
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,980
<i>Bye, Carmen.</i>

707
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,980
<i>Mr. Johnston?
You forgot your flowers.</i>

708
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,620
Hey. Excuse me!
Excuse me.

709
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,340
Excuse me. Uh, do you know
where Atwood Road is?

710
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,940
I'm lost.

711
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,220
Oh!

712
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,140
<i>Hey.</i>

713
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,340
Hey, it's okay.

714
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,900
It's okay.

715
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,740
Can I help you?

716
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,820
Does Penny live here?

717
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,820
Who's askin'?

718
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:24,500
I'm an old friend of Penny's.
Don. Don Johnston.

719
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,100
She's in the house.
Go around there. A screen door.

720
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,060
Thanks.

721
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,420
Penny?

722
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,700
Hello?

723
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,540
- Penny?
- Yeah?

724
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,500
Donny.

725
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,220
<i>So, what the fuck
do you want, Donny?</i>

726
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,340
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by.

727
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,340
Just checking in.

728
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,300
Well, I don't remember
any happy ending
between us, Don.

729
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:03,180
No... reconciliation,
nothing.

730
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,780
<i>You left me, Penny.
Remember?</i>

731
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,220
Yeah.

732
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,220
Very clearly.

733
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,780
So, what is it you wanted?

734
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,860
Everything okay over there, Pen?

735
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,500
Not sure yet!

736
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,380
Goddamn it.

737
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,620
What is it you wanted?

738
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,020
Penny, do you—

739
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,300
Do you have a son?

740
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,980
Fuck you, Donny!

741
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,100
Danny, grab that fucker.

742
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,860
<i>Penny!</i>

743
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,020
Shut up.

744
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,980
I didn't say anything.

745
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,940
What the hell's
your fuckin' problem?
I was just leaving.

746
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,300
No, what are you doing
upsetting Penny like that, huh?
I just needed to ask her a question.

747
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,180
Yeah, I know
you asked her a question.
Now, listen.

748
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,020
I just don't think
it's very sensitive of you...

749
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,940
comin' out here
to try to hurt Penny's feelings,

750
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,540
you know,
to get back at her or whatever.

751
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,060
That just seems so rude.

752
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,940
You said all pink, right?

753
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,380
<i>It's best that they're all pink, yeah.</i>

754
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,780
Oh, you're very good
at this.

755
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,820
That's beautiful.
Thanks.

756
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,740
Are you okay?

757
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,580
Uh, it was just
a minor misunderstanding.

758
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,420
Mind if I take a look?

759
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,660
<i>Oh. That's nasty.</i>

760
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:44,060
Did you even wash it?

761
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,580
Sort of.

762
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,500
Let me take care of it.

763
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,020
What's your name?

764
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,780
Sun. Sun Green.

765
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,020
Sun Green?

766
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,940
Perfect.

767
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,860
What's yours?

768
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,780
Don.
Don Johnston.

769
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,820
Really?

770
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,580
<i>Don Johnson?
Johnston.</i>

771
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,540
With a "T."

772
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,620
So...

773
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,540
if I continue down this road,

774
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,140
I will find
the Riverview Cemetery?

775
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:39,260
Yeah. You just go down the hill.
You'll see the entrance on your right.

776
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,540
Thank you, Sun Green.

777
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,500
You're welcome.

778
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,220
Hello, beautiful.

779
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,460
Red ink on pink paper.

780
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,060
I don't know what I want.

781
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,220
<i>He says you have a hidden agenda.</i>

782
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,180
Fuck you, Donny.

783
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:01,180
Circle Drive, please.
No rush.

784
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,860
The wheel of fortune turns.
Round and round it goes.

785
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,940
Where it stops, no one knows.

786
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,540
Boy.

787
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,940
That's my report,
Sherlock.

788
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,860
The general outline
of what you put me through.

789
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,180
That's it?

790
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:01,500
And after all that,
you're still no closer to knowing
who's the mother of your son?

791
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,460
That's right.

792
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:07,020
But there was
that one typewriter.

793
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,500
And the pink motorcycle.

794
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,380
And it was Dora's pink,
uh, business card.

795
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,580
And-And-And Laura's
pink bathrobe.

796
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,980
I think this whole thing
is a farce, a fiasco.

797
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,980
As far as I know,

798
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,380
you may have written
that letter to me.

799
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,860
Look, I'm really sorry
that you got beat up and everything.

800
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:34,020
I- I-I-I feel that
it was somehow my fault.

801
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,020
It was.

802
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,660
Kind of strange, too, how, uh,

803
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,580
Carmen's magic dog
was named Winston.

804
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:48,500
Yeah—

805
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:51,540
Look, man, I really put
a lot of work into this thing.

806
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:55,420
I thought that it was
really important that you know
whether or not you had a son.

807
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,620
I mean, it's your life.
You got to live your life, right?

808
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,380
<i>I was living my life,
Winston.</i>

809
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,820
I still am.

810
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,860
What's this?
It's pink.

811
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:11,780
It's a note
I found in my foyer
when I got back.

812
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:14,820
Red ink on pink paper.

813
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,700
It's from Sherry.

814
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,620
What? From Sherry?

815
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,940
Why didn't you tell me?
May I see it?

816
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:26,940
Envelope and paper
not exactly the same size.

817
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,180
You know, the handwriting...

818
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:35,060
seems pretty close
to the address on the envelope,
but I can't be sure.

819
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,220
Sherry still likes you.

820
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,700
You think that Sherry
could have sent the first letter...

821
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,900
and made the whole thing up
just to fuck with you?

822
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,860
Who knows?

823
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,180
You know, I've got to go.

824
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:57,140
I think I have just enough time
to stop home
and compare the handwriting...

825
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:00,140
and then hopefully
punch in at work on time.

826
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,940
You coming?
No.

827
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,060
I just need a little break
from all of this.

828
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,860
Look, don't worry.

829
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,700
We're still going to
solve this mystery.

830
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,900
Didn't I see you
at the airport last night?

831
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:06,980
I don't know.
Did you?

832
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,900
Yeah.

833
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,100
You on a road trip?

834
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,100
Yeah.
Something like that.

835
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,460
You look hungry.
Can I buy you a sandwich
or something?

836
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,380
Uh, no, that's okay.

837
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,620
You can relax.
I'm not gay. I'm not a cop.

838
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,660
Just a guy who sees a guy
who might need a sandwich.

839
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,820
Okay. Thanks.

840
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,660
But could you get something to go?
I'd sorta rather stay outside.

841
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,580
Sure.

842
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,700
How about a nice
club sandwich?

843
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,660
I'm vegetarian.

844
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,700
You eat cheese?

845
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:47,500
Yeah, sometimes.
I- I like cheese.

846
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,140
Okay, I got it.
I'll be right back.

847
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,660
Thanks.
You're welcome.

848
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,060
Hey.

849
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,700
You found us a place.

850
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,820
All right.

851
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,220
Let's see here.

852
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,980
Big cheese and veggie sandwich...

853
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:55,980
with mushrooms.

854
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,620
Fries—
Mmm.

855
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,580
Extra large.

856
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,940
Two waters.

857
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:11,620
Two coffees.

858
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,420
My mom put that there...

859
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:24,420
<i>for good luck.</i>

860
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,180
Thanks for the food.

861
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,500
Ahh.
No problem, chief.

862
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,540
You called me chief?

863
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,740
Yeah. Why?

864
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,180
What happened to your eye?

865
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,820
I, uh—

866
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,860
I ran into somebody.

867
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,340
Somebody's fist.

868
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,940
You a gangster?

869
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,860
No. I wish.

870
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:11,420
No, I was, uh—
I was in computers.

871
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,940
Computers and girls.

872
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,700
What about you, chief?

873
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,700
I'm interested
in, uh, philosophy.

874
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,780
Philosophy and girls.

875
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,580
Sounds pretty good.

876
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:35,140
Think so?

877
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,460
So, uh,

878
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,860
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

879
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:55,780
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

880
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,460
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

881
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,860
You asking me?

882
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,260
Yeah.

883
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:10,220
Well—

884
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:16,180
The past is gone.

885
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,140
I know that.

886
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,020
The future...

887
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,100
isn't here yet,

888
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,100
whatever it's going to be.

889
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,380
So,

890
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,380
all there is is—
is this.

891
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,580
The present.

892
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,260
That's it.

893
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,420
Are you a Buddhist?

894
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,300
No. Are you?

895
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,660
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

896
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:01,260
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

897
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,260
No, I appreciate it.

898
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,740
I like what you said.

899
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,140
It's better than some, like,

900
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,300
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

901
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,380
Is that...

902
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,500
what your father's like?

903
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:30,260
Ah, that's not a good subject.

904
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,140
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

905
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,700
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

906
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,700
Hold on a second.
Wait.

907
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:43,500
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

908
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:48,860
What?
Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

909
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,100
Man, you're fucked up.

910
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,740
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!

911
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,180
