1
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,896
The entire tribe must not
be endangered. . .

2
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,524
. . .because of the defiance of
one person.

3
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,192
You must forget about him.

4
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,821
He was a wild spirit and this was
always to be his fate.

5
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,782
You talk as if he's already dead

6
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,709
Even if he does survive this time,
he's a greener. . .

7
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,420
. . .so set your sights elsewhere
for a husband.

8
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,131
I'll never set my sights elsewhere.

9
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,418
-This is all the medicine I could find.
-I'm sorry.

10
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,504
The gods took your father
in the night.

11
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:02,283
As long as we stay here, there'll
never be enough to eat. Never.

12
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,662
There may be other places
we could live where food is plentiful.

13
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,291
All it takes is one demon to follow
you back from the forbidden land.

14
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,126
Then we'd all be struck down.

15
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,836
Have you ever seen one?

16
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,338
Have you?

17
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,507
Has anyone here ever seen one?

18
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:18,966
A demon?

19
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,551
A monster!

20
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,969
A beast!

21
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,058
The stories are true.

22
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,852
The gods used to live here.

23
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,357
They watched over and protected man,
but man grew selfish. . .

24
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,692
. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .

25
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,403
. . .allowing the demons
to descend from the sky.

26
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,496
As survivors, we must dedicate
our lives to pleasing the gods. . .

27
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,500
. . .so that one day they will come back
and drive away the demons.

28
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,379
That is our fate.

29
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,508
Only if you believe in fate.

30
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,533
I'm sorry. I can't take you.

31
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,743
I can't handle myself
as well as a man?

32
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,870
-No.
-You arrogant greener.

33
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
You can handle yourself
better than most men. . .

34
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,751
. . .which is why you need
to help the village.

35
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,552
Your mother gave this to me
before she died.

36
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,054
She hoped it'd be passed
to your children.

37
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,435
It's for good luck.

38
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,863
Don't let anything happen
to you out there.

39
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,240
Easy!

40
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,289
Easy!

41
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,276
So you're the beast
we're all afraid of.

42
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,304
Not a lot of meat on a dragon.

43
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,981
You have been fortunate in the hunt.

44
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,316
I hope you thanked the gods.

45
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,487
-A nonbeliever.
-I believe what I can see.

46
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,784
A nonbeliever, huh?
You from the caves?

47
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,537
Probably never seen a god.
Would you like to?

48
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:20,165
-What do you know about gods?
-We've seen gods. Rock and I.

49
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,959
You lying thieves.

50
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,256
Wait a minute.

51
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,009
Wait a minute, we're hunting.

52
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,303
No time to show you gods with no food.

53
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,056
We need food. We must hunt.
Nonbeliever.

54
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,728
Wait.

55
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,613
First you show me the god.

56
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,949
Then we eat.

57
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,875
Look.

58
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,252
Frozen ones.

59
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,048
The way to the great god village
is marked by these frozen ones.

60
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,344
When the gods left this world,
they ordered man not to look at them.

61
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:17,514
Those that disobeyed were
frozen in place for all of eternity.

62
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,809
When the gods lived here
they could fly through the air.

63
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:25,522
They'd drive chariots in front
of special caves with golden arches.

64
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
Golden.

65
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,860
And the food would magically appear.

66
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,153
Magic.

67
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,571
Here!

68
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,868
The gods weren't allowed to fall
in love with mortal women.

69
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,870
This one did. . .

70
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,082
. . .and was left behind,
frozen as punishment.

71
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,754
Are you sure this was a god?

72
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:51,465
I thought you said you believe
what you can see.

73
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,061
If you need proof. . .

74
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,107
. . .when the sun goes down, you can see
the rest of the gods in the sky.

75
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,192
They're the bright lights.

76
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:15,447
The evil beasts hunt in the dark.
We need to find shelter.

77
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,616
There's a cave over here.

78
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,042
Look at those poor bastards.
They really angered the gods.

79
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,418
Carlo.

80
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,420
Let's eat.

81
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,979
Go. Go.

82
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,829
What's a "greener"?

83
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,206
The grass is greener
on the other side.

84
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,544
Always looking for something better,
something out there.

85
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,004
Maybe she was right.

86
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,510
God stone.

87
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,138
Sharp.

88
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,558
No, you keep it. You keep it.

89
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:28,687
Where we're from, a good woman
is a hard thing to find.

90
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,274
So if you were stupid enough
to leave a good woman behind. . .

91
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:36,194
. . .why don't you tell me where she is
so I can go get her for myself?

92
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,404
No!

93
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:22,074
Forget about me.
Get out of here. I can't move!

94
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,755
No!

95
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,636
Oh, heavenly gods!

96
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,840
Don't breathe the air!

97
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,384
It's poison!

98
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,391
My chest is on fire!

99
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,985
It helps you breathe. Take it!

100
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,487
I can't!

101
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,493
Get off my brother.

102
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:04,022
-What's he saying?
-Don't know.

103
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,484
Who's responsible for allowing
him to run around?

104
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:32,568
He shot the wrangler.

105
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:40,868
I'm a little pressed for time.
Save the going-away jokes for later.

106
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:43,037
No joke, sir. I swear.

107
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:45,748
The man-animal
got a hold of this gun.

108
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:47,500
Really?

109
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,002
Show me.

110
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:51,838
Sir?

111
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,468
Reach for the gun.

112
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,387
But, sir, I might get shot.

113
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:02,974
Sure, you might. And I might
suddenly grow a third arm!

114
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:04,517
But it shot the wrangler.

115
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,770
Any report filed today
still has my name on it. . .

116
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,732
. . .and you are out of your skull-bone
if you think I'm going to write. . .

117
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:15,403
. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the
cause of death unless I see it!

118
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,030
If I obey your command,
I may get killed.

119
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,950
If you don't, it's a certainty
you will be killed.

120
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,119
Reach for the gun.

121
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,258
Well, I'll be damned.

122
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,677
Teleportation sequence activated.

123
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,931
Teleportation sequence activated.

124
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:32,540
It is a pleasure to see you,
Your Excellency.

125
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:36,085
I would be honored to expedite
your clearance through security.

126
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:39,714
Please, call me Zete.
Does all of Earth look like this?

127
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:42,008
I'm afraid so, sir.

128
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:47,012
Pathetic. All the green
and the blue sky.

129
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:51,016
They told me this planet was ugly,
but this is one of the ugliest. . .

130
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:54,103
-. . .in the entire universe.
-I couldn't agree more.

131
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:58,733
I hate these puny, undersized planets.
The gravity is so different.

132
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,735
One does get used to it.

133
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,988
And the human-animals,
grossly undersized.

134
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,657
They don't make good eating,
Your Excellency.

135
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:09,243
-My executive assistant, Ker.
-Thank you.

136
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:13,330
He has been fully trained
to replace me as chief of security.

137
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:17,293
-As soon as my transfer goes through.
-Well, Ker. . .

138
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,880
. . .once we finish mining out
this miserable little planet. . .

139
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:23,007
. . .Let's do the universe a favor.

140
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:25,634
Let's exterminate the lot of them.

141
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,015
-Oh, you're too much.
-So they tell me.

142
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,142
Please, come this way.

143
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,356
Spy satellites recorded those.

144
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:42,860
-What is this species?
-According to the Clinko historians. . .

145
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:44,695
. . .the species is called "dog. "

146
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,655
-Dog.
-Yes.

147
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:50,367
Obviously the superior race,
having the man-animal chauffeur.

148
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:55,414
Well, dogs did prove to be
more cooperative than the man-animals.

149
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:58,834
They weren't as useful
when it came to manual labor.

150
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:04,798
I am honored by your visit,
Your Excellency.

151
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,175
Thank you, Planetship.

152
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:09,553
You'll be pleased. I approved
additional labor resources.

153
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,139
They'll be here
by the end of quarter cycle.

154
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,058
Thank you, Your Excellency.

155
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,310
Now, let's see.

156
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:21,774
Your long overdue transfer.

157
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:26,362
You must be looking forward to getting
off this disgusting excuse of a planet.

158
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:30,699
I just want to do whatever serves
the corporation best, sir.

159
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:33,661
Very admirable.
And I must say, you've done. . .

160
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,830
. . .a first-rate job here
as interim security chief.

161
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,333
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

162
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,085
I do what I can.

163
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:44,338
So we've decided to keep you
for another tour of service.

164
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:51,053
There must be some mistake.

165
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,056
Home Office does not make mistakes.

166
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:56,600
Of course not.
But have you looked at my file?

167
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:00,646
It explicitly says that this
is a temporary assignment.

168
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:10,114
Are you not aware that I graduated
top of my class?

169
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:11,657
Quite an accomplishment.

170
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:15,035
I don't mean to second-guess
the Home Office. . .

171
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,788
. . .but surely I could be
of better service--

172
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:22,793
Home Office is well aware of your
academic achievements and talents.

173
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:27,464
That's why we've decided not to keep
you here for another five cycles.

174
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:34,346
It's a joke.

175
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:37,850
Thank you, sir.

176
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,645
I don't know if I
could've kept my sanity. . .

177
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:43,814
. . .to be here another five cycles.

178
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:47,860
We've decided to keep you here
for another 50 cycles!

179
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,780
With endless options for renewal!

180
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,183
Those options, of course. . .

181
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:21,810
. . .being at Home Office's discretion.

182
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,270
Not yours.

183
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,607
The senator. . .

184
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,402
. . .has a lot of friends.

185
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:38,786
Would you please tell the senator. . .

186
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,914
. . .if I'd had even an inkling that
that was his daughter--

187
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,624
Watch your tongue.

188
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:49,505
The senator's exact words to me were,
and I'm quoting:

189
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,549
"If that blasted Terl tries
to talk his way out of it. . .

190
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:55,093
. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "

191
00:25:57,095 --> 00:26:00,933
But cheer up.
There's one bright side to this.

192
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:04,978
One day you're going to die,
and when you end up in hell. . .

193
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:08,440
. . .at least it'll be a step up
from this place.

194
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:07,124
You haven't left for Psychlo.

195
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:11,461
Your powers of observation
are simply startling.

196
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:13,547
Give me three pans to go.

197
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,635
I don't know what
you're so down about.

198
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,305
You still get to be head of security.

199
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:26,476
Which, from what I can tell,
is a pretty cushy job.

200
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,479
Well, I can assure you. . .

201
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:34,651
. . .that I was not groomed since birth
to have some cushy job. . .

202
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,779
. . .that even a moron like you
could perform.

203
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:42,117
While you were still learning
how to spell your name. . .

204
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:46,121
. . .I was being trained
to conquer galaxies!

205
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,541
To do anything less. . .

206
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,878
. . .is a disgrace
to my entire family line.

207
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:55,922
That'll be six credits.

208
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:57,591
Put it on my tab.

209
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,884
You don't have a tab.

210
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,719
I do now.

211
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,929
You're new here,
so I'll explain how it works.

212
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:46,306
I eat first.

213
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,974
Then my men eat.

214
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:51,269
If there's anything left,
you can share it with them.

215
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:53,605
That's how it used to work.

216
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,775
Greener, let's just stay alive.

217
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:58,026
You're right.

218
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,653
-So I'll fight you.
-No.

219
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,490
Without food,
we don't have strength to escape.

220
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:06,243
-So now we're escaping?
-I am.

221
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:07,452
Come if you want.

222
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:13,750
We fight, it's to the death.

223
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:38,108
Say your prayers to the gods!

224
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,849
We have enough problems without
killing each other over food.

225
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:17,188
From now on, we eat at the same time.

226
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:54,100
Sir.

227
00:30:58,897 --> 00:31:00,940
I was wondering when
you'd look at that.

228
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:06,071
It came in last week,
and I put it right in your box.

229
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,993
I've wasted my time, haven't I?

230
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:17,916
If you're going to lie to me, have
the decency to do a credible job. . .

231
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:20,794
. . .so I don't look like an idiot
for training you.

232
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:25,173
But I'm not lying. I put the photo
in your box as soon as it came in.

233
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:28,718
You are pathetic. You wouldn't last
one day at the academy.

234
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:32,138
-And I saw you.
-What?

235
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,227
You said:

236
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:40,980
"We use picto-cameras
to spy on other offices.

237
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:45,276
But under no circumstance
do we spy on our own office. "

238
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,737
That's right. We don't. I do.

239
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,156
Start talking.

240
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,952
The photo's from
last week's recon drone.

241
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,455
It shows a rockslide in the mountains.
It exposed a gold vein.

242
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,707
You were waiting for me to transfer. . .

243
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,085
. . .so you could turn it in
and get credit.

244
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:03,628
I didn't think you'd mind.

245
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:06,840
I don't mind. Turn it in. But before
you do, pretend you're not. . .

246
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:09,759
. . .a complete imbecile. . .

247
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:11,594
. . .and check the compo gradients.

248
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:17,851
It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .

249
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,981
. . .can get there without his breath gas
exploding. No way to mine the gold.

250
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:30,864
But what I do mind is that you
betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!

251
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:33,950
It's worthless! You said so!

252
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:36,619
But you didn't know it was worthless!

253
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,961
I would never hurt you, sir.

254
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,510
I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.
It's against regulations, sir.

255
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:56,890
I can make this up to you, sir.
I promise. I swear.

256
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,224
Please, sir.

257
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:03,646
You do not have to shoot me, sir.

258
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,993
Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?

259
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:19,662
Of course not.
We have work to do. Come.

260
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:25,501
Tomorrow morning, we must warn
the Planetship of the mutiny.

261
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,711
What mutiny?

262
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,756
The one you're going to pretend
is in the works. . .

263
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:34,218
. . .Like your life depended on it.
Because it does.

264
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:39,015
If the worker revolt takes place,
my informants tell me. . .

265
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:42,560
. . .that the first order of business is
to separate you from your head.

266
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:47,440
Which is why there will be no revolt.

267
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:51,569
I am authorizing you to use whatever
means necessary to prevent it.

268
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,449
The best way is to increase profits
and stop cutting the workers' pay.

269
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:58,826
Production equals profits.

270
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:02,789
And I've already ordered
as many new workers as possible. . .

271
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,540
. . .to boost production.

272
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:07,418
But we have to pay the new workers.

273
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:12,548
Maybe you were absent the day they
taught economics at the academy, Ker.

274
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:15,301
But nobody works for free.

275
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,470
Man-animals do.

276
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:22,058
What if we were to train them
how to mine?

277
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:30,191
Man-animals operating machinery?

278
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:33,486
Have you blown a head gasket?

279
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:38,699
I will be the laughingstock
of the universe.

280
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:41,160
So you should have me
take man-animals. . .

281
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,621
. . .with equipment,
out to a remote area. . .

282
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,958
. . .better that you don't know where,
and try and train them.

283
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,086
Have them do some test mining.

284
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:52,922
If it doesn't work out,
no one will know.

285
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:55,216
-Right.
-And if it does work. . .

286
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,593
. . .I will be vaporized.

287
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,554
It is against the law.

288
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,972
Regulations say. . .

289
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,393
. . .a Planetship faced with
a profit-threatening situation. . .

290
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:08,896
. . .is relieved
of all other ordinances. . .

291
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:13,484
. . .to pursue, to protect
and to acquire said profits.

292
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:14,819
There you have it.

293
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,037
We stick to the original plan.

294
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,373
Bring in new workers. . .

295
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:31,419
. . .and they go on half-pay
as soon as they arrive.

296
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,505
And that is final!

297
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:40,529
Run! Run!

298
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,753
Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.

299
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:45,302
Last time we didn't even stop timing
until its lungs burst.

300
00:37:45,553 --> 00:37:46,554
That's the wager.

301
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:56,939
No way this man-animal
lasts more than four minutes.

302
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,338
Help me!

303
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:23,257
I need your air!

304
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,442
The wager's off.
The damn thing cheated.

305
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:52,036
The Planetship is hiding something.

306
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,622
All we have to do
is find out what it is. . .

307
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:56,749
. . .then we'll have leverage.

308
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,251
And then we can get the gold.

309
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,629
What do you mean, we? It's my plan.

310
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:06,175
I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then
I'm getting off this stinking planet.

311
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:07,635
Come on, sir.

312
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,970
You gotta let me in on it.

313
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,765
I barely make any lousy credits
in this job.

314
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:16,185
And I've got five wives
to support, sir.

315
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:21,941
I don't know if I want
to partner up with an idiot.

316
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,110
How do I even know
you understand the plan?

317
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:34,411
We train man-animals
who don't need breath gas. . .

318
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:36,789
. . .to mine the gold for us.

319
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,376
But Home Planet owns this planet.
The gold belongs to them.

320
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,002
That's the beauty of it.

321
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,505
Home Planet doesn't know
the gold exists.

322
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:47,591
Those corporate crapheads
won't know we stole it.

323
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,843
It's the perfect crime, sir.

324
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:54,223
Putting aside the serious violations
of teaching mining to inferiors. . .

325
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:58,352
. . .and insulting corporate superiors,
each one punishable by death.

326
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,479
So it is my duty to report you. . .

327
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:04,525
. . .though you'll be vaporized, and
I'll have to train a new assistant.

328
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:07,778
But it's your stinking plan, sir.

329
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:10,197
So I'm glad I have
a recording of you. . .

330
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,533
. . .Laying out the plan
and my reprimanding you.

331
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,785
Think of it as part of your education.

332
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:17,746
Education, huh?

333
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:24,795
Never engage in a criminal activity
unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .

334
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:27,089
. . .in case you ever get found out.

335
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,008
Thank you. That's great.

336
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,219
But why do I have to be the patsy?

337
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:34,972
So you don't get any bright ideas
to get rid of Terl. . .

338
00:40:35,222 --> 00:40:37,266
. . .and keep the gold for yourself.

339
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,184
But I'd never double-cross you.

340
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:43,147
I've arranged that if any unfortunate
accident were to befall me. . .

341
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:46,692
. . .this would go
straight to the Home Office.

342
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:08,148
Double or nothing
I can blow off one of its limbs.

343
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:18,492
That one does seem to be unusually
intelligent and resourceful.

344
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,953
But it's also defiant.

345
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:23,038
We'll need leverage over it.

346
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:25,457
Leverage? Over a man-animal?

347
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,626
Man is a primitive species. . .

348
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:32,547
. . .so we'll need something primitive
for leverage. Like food.

349
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:35,717
What do you think a man-animal
would like to eat?

350
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:37,886
What would he consider a treat?

351
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:40,013
How the crap should I know?

352
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:42,391
There's no way of knowing that.

353
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:46,144
But before we educate it
on the machine. . .

354
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:49,690
. . .we'll take it to the mountains
with a couple of the others.

355
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,900
Let them think they've escaped. . .

356
00:42:52,442 --> 00:42:55,779
. . .and then we'll sit back
and watch it choose its favorite food.

357
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:57,823
Yes.

358
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:18,760
Look!

359
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,856
Three days, and they still haven't
eaten anything yet.

360
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,608
Precisely. Now that
the man-animals feel. . .

361
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,944
. . .that they have
enough distance from us. . .

362
00:43:36,194 --> 00:43:39,281
. . .soon they'll find
their favorite food and celebrate.

363
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:52,836
What is it?

364
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,504
Food. Food!

365
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:05,307
No spark, no flints, nothing.
You, Floyd?

366
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:07,934
Plenty to burn.
Nothing to start a fire with.

367
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:16,151
-That's their favorite.
-Of course it is.

368
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:19,488
-They could've selected anything.
-It's not cooked.

369
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:24,701
If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,
then our job is that much easier.

370
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:28,330
If they like their rat so much,
how come those two aren't eating?

371
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:33,001
Don't you know anything? The leader
of the pack always eats first. See?

372
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:43,011
We're really going to have
leverage over them now.

373
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,027
What are you doing?

374
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:11,164
They know about the camera.

375
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:13,166
Don't be a knot-head.
It's a man-animal.

376
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:15,669
It couldn't possibly know about it.

377
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:24,761
You sure called that one, sir.

378
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,763
No way they know about the cameras.

379
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:29,724
Move your fat ass
and let's go round them up!

380
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,143
Crap, lousy ceiling!

381
00:45:58,461 --> 00:46:00,547
Great. This is great.

382
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:12,600
What do we do now?

383
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:15,770
What are you thinking, Jonnie?
Don't even think about it.

384
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:19,691
You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.
You wouldn't live the jump!

385
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:22,402
You can surrender and rot
in those cages.

386
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:24,696
That's your choice.
I'm not going back!

387
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:27,741
The monsters catch us,
they'll take us to the mines.

388
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:39,753
Run!

389
00:47:14,746 --> 00:47:16,206
How do we know what he wants?

390
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:19,626
They made me do this before.
Follow me and you'll be fine.

391
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:32,347
Don't touch anything.

392
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:34,933
Get them mad,
think what they'll do to us.

393
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:05,380
Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .

394
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:06,923
. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .

395
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,510
. . .for I do not have the honor
to be a Psychlo.

396
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:12,178
I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.

397
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:19,602
As you are listening to me,
I most likely do not exist. . .

398
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:23,898
. . .as we may have been exterminated
like many other races. . .

399
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:27,068
. . .by the gas drones
of our conquerors.

400
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:29,529
Please forgive my pretension. . .

401
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:32,991
. . .as I try to educate you
in Psychlo. . .

402
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:36,536
. . .the noble language
of our superiors.

403
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:19,662
You understand?

404
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,624
You understand me?

405
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:27,837
Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?

406
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:33,926
Obviously, this is going
to take a while.

407
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:57,033
Jonnie! Jonnie!

408
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:02,080
Carlo! Carlo!

409
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:06,209
I know who they are and where they're
from. I can speak their language.

410
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:08,336
-Monsters?
-They're called Psychlos.

411
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:09,879
What did they do to him?

412
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:12,757
They made him look into a light,
a god machine.

413
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:15,218
It teaches.
It's a knowledge machine.

414
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:19,347
It sends pictures through your head
so fast, it's spinning.

415
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,307
Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.

416
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,895
No, I can't. I have to stay.
I have to learn more about them.

417
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:29,899
This may be our only way out of here.

418
00:50:45,706 --> 00:50:49,293
So this is the monster's language?

419
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:51,420
No, no. This is mathematics.

420
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:56,342
This is the unifying language
of the entire universe.

421
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,266
Look.

422
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:06,227
This symbol is called a triangle.

423
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:09,105
If all these sides are equal. . .

424
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:11,858
. . .then these three angles
must also be equal.

425
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:14,110
Equal to what?

426
00:51:14,735 --> 00:51:15,903
To each other.

427
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:19,282
It's the basic foundation
of Euclidean geometry.

428
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:22,118
Seems pretty hard to understand.

429
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,955
No, only at first. And then it
becomes clear in your mind.

430
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:28,207
I learned molecular biology.

431
00:51:28,457 --> 00:51:32,670
This is the symbol for water
and engineering.

432
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:37,842
See, a wing, see? And line
and form and artistic composition.

433
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:40,886
You see, this is a square,
like a cage.

434
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:45,433
I thought we were supposed to be
working on stuff to help us escape.

435
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:49,145
This will.

436
00:51:50,021 --> 00:51:51,480
All this will.

437
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:09,332
Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.

438
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:15,963
"The security chief should secure
the field vault. . .

439
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:19,216
. . .with an eight-digit
combination code. . .

440
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:23,637
. . .and do not use a personal
or employee. . .

441
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:25,222
. . .identification number. "

442
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:27,475
What's an identification number?

443
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:28,893
There.

444
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:31,020
-How many numbers is that?
-Eight.

445
00:52:31,354 --> 00:52:32,355
Eight?

446
00:52:33,105 --> 00:52:34,440
Eight.

447
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:44,492
It's more clever than that.

448
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,369
The question is, how clever?

449
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:48,704
Try the numbers backwards.

450
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:04,720
Look at this.

451
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:06,722
It's a recording machine.

452
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:16,023
This is how he watches us.

453
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:47,221
Stop! Chrissy, stop!

454
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:49,223
What if he's not dead?

455
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:52,226
Hope is an admirable quality,
but foolish isn't.

456
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:55,312
I can't give you permission
to go and get killed.

457
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:57,231
I don't need your permission.

458
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:01,861
I'm no longer a child.

459
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,461
Do you want lunch?

460
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:31,974
It's obviously too much
to ask a man-animal. . .

461
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:34,518
. . .to learn a language
as sophisticated as Psychlo.

462
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,980
What if it can understand
and it's pretending it can't?

463
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:40,316
-What the hell for?
-I don't know.

464
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:44,028
Maybe it's secretly listening,
trying to get leverage over on us.

465
00:54:44,528 --> 00:54:48,073
Man-animal getting leverage over
a Psychlo. That'll be the day.

466
00:54:49,825 --> 00:54:52,661
What if this one is
particularly stupid?

467
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,622
Maybe we should train another one.

468
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:57,124
No time. When they detect the gold. . .

469
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,877
. . .the Planetship will know
what we're doing.

470
00:55:03,797 --> 00:55:06,634
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

471
00:55:17,186 --> 00:55:18,270
It speaks Psychlo.

472
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:20,147
Go on, say something else.

473
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:22,483
You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .

474
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:25,486
. . .while you, you go
and get a transporter.

475
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,156
Because you've learned Psychlo
doesn't mean you are one.

476
00:55:29,365 --> 00:55:31,533
Follow my orders
or I'll have you killed.

477
00:55:34,995 --> 00:55:36,914
How exactly do you plan to do that?

478
00:55:47,466 --> 00:55:49,510
-Mickey, no!
-Mickey, no!

479
00:55:50,803 --> 00:55:55,307
If any of you rat-brains
knew anything about firearms. . .

480
00:55:55,933 --> 00:55:59,561
. . .you would know that you never
store loaded weapons.

481
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,146
You drop him now!

482
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:04,024
Drop him or I won't mine
an ounce of your gold.

483
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:08,320
I'll have you vaporized
and find someone else to mine it.

484
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:09,613
You don't have time.

485
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,366
You can't hide this
from Home Office forever.

486
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:18,372
A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.
That'll be the day.

487
00:56:24,586 --> 00:56:29,299
I think it's time that we show
our little friend a thing or two.

488
00:56:56,118 --> 00:56:58,412
As long as you cling to
the feeble hope. . .

489
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,539
. . .that you'll ever get
the better of me. . .

490
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:03,667
. . .you'll be distracted
from more important things.

491
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:05,794
Which is exactly why. . .

492
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:08,297
. . .I share the following with you:

493
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:11,633
When we attacked your planet. . .

494
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:16,471
. . .all your soldiers and all
their advanced technology. . .

495
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,016
. . .could only put up
a nine-minute fight. . .

496
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:21,226
. . .before they were exterminated.

497
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,939
Which is why man
is an endangered species.

498
00:57:27,649 --> 00:57:30,319
Everything you humans knew is here.

499
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,613
You can look at anything you want. . .

500
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:36,325
. . .because there is nothing
that will help you.

501
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,109
Satisfied?

502
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:12,778
Yes.

503
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,657
I have one more demonstration
for you and your friends.

504
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,837
You will be relocated
to a new mining site.

505
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:34,007
If any of you get any bright ideas
about escaping. . .

506
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:38,428
. . .keep in mind that although you
know nothing about firearms, I do.

507
00:58:38,887 --> 00:58:43,725
I graduated top marksman in my class.
I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.

508
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:45,394
Tell them what I said.

509
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:47,396
We try to run, he'll kill us.

510
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:50,315
-That's it?
-Yes.

511
00:58:51,233 --> 00:58:52,776
Allow me to demonstrate.

512
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,670
No! Wait!

513
00:59:28,937 --> 00:59:31,314
Let's give this demon
what it deserves.

514
00:59:31,523 --> 00:59:33,817
Kill it, I say! Destroy it!

515
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:36,069
Shoot! Shoot!

516
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:37,320
Why wait? Kill it!

517
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:39,030
Kill it. Then we'll run.

518
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,532
Then what?

519
00:59:40,866 --> 00:59:44,494
What kind of life is it to run?
Living in fear of being hunted?

520
00:59:45,162 --> 00:59:47,414
What about those we're leaving behind?

521
00:59:47,622 --> 00:59:49,416
There's nothing we can do.

522
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:51,209
Only the gods can free them.

523
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:54,921
You think the lights in the sky
are gods waiting to save us?

524
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:59,676
Do you? Those are planets,
planets like this one.

525
00:59:59,885 --> 01:00:01,887
The great villages were built by us.

526
01:00:02,554 --> 01:00:04,556
By men and women just like us.

527
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:07,517
Willing to fight to the death
for one thing:

528
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:09,269
Their freedom!

529
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:11,980
Do you think no one has tried?

530
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,941
You can't defeat them.

531
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:22,407
That is our fate.

532
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,578
Yes, we can. Yes, we can!

533
01:00:27,162 --> 01:00:28,705
But we have to go back.

534
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:31,208
We go back and learn
about their weapons.

535
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,920
Our race is slowly dying
and will be gone forever.

536
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:38,924
Let it be said that we took
this one chance and fought!

537
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:41,760
Are you with me? Are you with me?!

538
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:43,970
We fight!

539
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:48,600
If you're fighting the beast,
me and my men are with you.

540
01:00:48,808 --> 01:00:51,853
Thank you.
It's good to have friends out here.

541
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:54,022
May the gods be with you.

542
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:02,906
One as wise as you has ways
to stop me from shooting.

543
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:06,159
I know if I'd tried,
you would've killed me first.

544
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:16,962
Damn right, rat-brain! That's the
first intelligent thing you've said.

545
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:20,298
Rest break is over.

546
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:24,552
There's something I need you to see
so you're properly motivated.

547
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,283
You don't know her?

548
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:51,246
No, I don't know her.

549
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,417
She's one of the foulest
looking females I've ever seen.

550
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:57,502
While I tend to agree. . .

551
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:02,674
. . .it's obvious that you show a lack
of aptitude for strategic deception.

552
01:02:02,882 --> 01:02:07,429
On the other hand, what you show
marginal proficiency at is. . .

553
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:09,764
. . .drawing.

554
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:14,060
This was found when she was collected.

555
01:02:15,603 --> 01:02:19,399
The collar has enough explosives
to remove her head from her body.

556
01:02:19,607 --> 01:02:21,317
And this remote. . .

557
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:24,487
. . .will activate it
from anywhere on the planet.

558
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:27,907
So if you disobey me, let me
show you what will happen.

559
01:02:28,116 --> 01:02:29,784
Please don't harm her.

560
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:31,995
I believe you.

561
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:34,581
Don't worry, rat-brain.

562
01:02:34,914 --> 01:02:37,625
Every collar has its own frequency.

563
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:40,670
I'm not going to blow up
your little female friend.

564
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,174
Just. . .

565
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:47,385
. . .this one.

566
01:02:49,137 --> 01:02:50,513
You made your point.

567
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:52,765
I said I would mine your gold.

568
01:02:53,433 --> 01:02:55,226
Please don't kill him. Please.

569
01:02:59,314 --> 01:03:00,482
Fine.

570
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:05,487
Due to our new working relationship,
I will grant you this one request.

571
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:08,531
I won't kill him.

572
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,826
But you may never ask of me
anything again.

573
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:13,536
I promise.

574
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:20,251
As I've said, I won't kill him.

575
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,503
Yes, sir.

576
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:41,147
Stupid humans.

577
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,593
No, no, no.

578
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:12,720
What you did was right.

579
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:14,806
It was right for all of us.

580
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,809
Greener, you're a thinker. . .

581
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:20,311
. . .and the gods respect thinkers.

582
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:22,689
You didn't kill Sammy.

583
01:04:23,564 --> 01:04:26,275
Jonnie, this is not living.

584
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:29,195
This is. . .

585
01:04:29,988 --> 01:04:30,822
. . .cages!

586
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:32,198
Cages!

587
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:35,910
Even if we escaped and went back
to where we all came from. . .

588
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,370
. . .it'd be like you said.

589
01:04:37,578 --> 01:04:40,331
We'd be waiting for the Psychlos
to hunt us down.

590
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:43,960
I think that is not living either.

591
01:04:48,464 --> 01:04:50,383
We all chose to fight.

592
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,870
-Count us in too!
-What's going on?

593
01:05:19,078 --> 01:05:22,206
Someone knows how to speak
the Psychlo's language.

594
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:24,041
He's gonna help us fight.

595
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:21,724
Yes.

596
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:25,645
Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.

597
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:28,981
She's. . . .

598
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,359
His soon-to-be
newly acquired secretary.

599
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,861
-Yes.
-Really?

600
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:38,074
She's stupid enough not to be a menace,
pretty enough to be decorative.

601
01:06:38,282 --> 01:06:42,537
She gets drunk with economical speed
and has other advantages.

602
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,041
I can see that.

603
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,919
-Don't you have some work to do?
-No.

604
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:50,962
Ker?

605
01:06:51,212 --> 01:06:52,588
All right, sir.

606
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:56,842
Now, listen, missy. . .

607
01:06:57,051 --> 01:07:00,179
. . .I'm still waiting for
the Planetship's accounts.

608
01:07:03,057 --> 01:07:06,310
I had to go way beyond
the call of duty to get these.

609
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:09,689
I see. Well, that's why
I especially chose you.

610
01:07:10,189 --> 01:07:12,441
So you'll keep your side
of the bargain?

611
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:15,069
Which was?

612
01:07:15,403 --> 01:07:19,115
You said we'd have a huge house
when we go back to Psychlo next year.

613
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,742
-We're going to be rich, right?
-Right.

614
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,830
I am going to make you
as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .

615
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:28,833
. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.

616
01:07:42,346 --> 01:07:44,223
Well, isn't it interesting. . .

617
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:47,143
. . .that you have been keeping
two sets of books. . .

618
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:49,437
. . .and telling all the workers. . .

619
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:52,106
. . .that the planet has been
operating at a loss?

620
01:07:53,816 --> 01:07:57,653
I only claimed that it was
running at a loss. . .

621
01:07:57,903 --> 01:08:02,158
. . .to try and motivate them all
to work harder.

622
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:03,951
Oh, yes, of course.

623
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,579
And it had nothing to do
with the fact. . .

624
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:09,206
. . .that it allowed you
to cut the workers' pay. . .

625
01:08:09,457 --> 01:08:12,585
. . .and keep all the extra credit
for yourself. Did it?

626
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:16,714
That. Well, I can explain that.

627
01:08:16,922 --> 01:08:21,302
Well, unfortunately, the company
requires me to vaporize you.

628
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,055
On the other hand. . .

629
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,767
. . .I could understand someone
in your situation. . .

630
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:30,144
. . .being old and having no future. . .

631
01:08:30,394 --> 01:08:33,355
. . .coming up with ways
to solve your financial problems.

632
01:08:34,565 --> 01:08:37,193
-You can?
-Oh, yes.

633
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:40,029
It's really of no interest
to anybody. . .

634
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:42,615
. . .to have you not be Planetship.

635
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:46,911
But it would be prudent of you
to start to share your authority.

636
01:08:57,171 --> 01:09:01,258
But these forms are
all blank, undated.

637
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,386
You could put anything
you wanted on them.

638
01:09:04,637 --> 01:09:08,224
You would run the entire planet!

639
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:14,396
I would be nothing but a puppet.

640
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:17,691
Well, if you don't want
to do it that way. . .

641
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,027
. . .we could always do it by. . .

642
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:22,696
. . .the book.

643
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:33,207
What the hell does the Planetship
need with all this mining equipment?

644
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:35,209
That's not even the crazy part.

645
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,963
He's ordered me to take a group
of man-animals to a remote area. . .

646
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:42,466
. . .with the equipment to see
if they can be trained to mine.

647
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:45,886
Man-animals being able to mine?

648
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:47,304
Yes.

649
01:09:54,478 --> 01:09:56,605
Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.

650
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:58,399
Indeed.

651
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:00,276
But what can I do?

652
01:10:00,484 --> 01:10:02,403
An order is an order.

653
01:10:07,324 --> 01:10:09,410
You have a busy day, rat-brain.

654
01:10:09,618 --> 01:10:11,203
First, learning how to fly. . .

655
01:10:11,453 --> 01:10:14,498
. . .then on to the learning machine
for mining techniques.

656
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:45,404
Crash one more time. . .

657
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:48,907
. . .and your little friend
will no longer be among the living.

658
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:50,242
Again.

659
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,952
Again!

660
01:11:33,786 --> 01:11:37,247
Never underestimate what a little
leverage can do, rat-brain.

661
01:12:04,274 --> 01:12:05,609
That's good, man-animal.

662
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:09,446
This is the lever where
we mine the gold!

663
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:11,782
Lever! Up, down!

664
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:16,620
Warning: External sensors indicate
dangerous radiation levels ahead.

665
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:18,622
This is as far as I can go!

666
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:20,249
Land it!

667
01:12:34,972 --> 01:12:36,557
Meet me back here in 1 4 days.

668
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:38,934
I want the ship's cage
half-filled with gold.

669
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:46,775
And even though I won't be
at the mining site. . .

670
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:50,320
. . .I'll be watching you.

671
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:03,792
-How's your side?
-It's good. Good.

672
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,181
Next time, you fly.

673
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:32,654
No, no, no.
Even if we do mine enough gold. . .

674
01:13:32,863 --> 01:13:35,866
. . .we'll be lucky to fill
half of that cage in time.

675
01:13:36,074 --> 01:13:37,326
That's why we're not mining.

676
01:13:37,534 --> 01:13:41,079
What about the big uglies watching
us with that eye in the sky?

677
01:13:41,288 --> 01:13:43,582
Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?

678
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,251
We split them in half.
One group goes. . .

679
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,794
. . .and one group stays. . .

680
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:50,505
. . .and it looks as if
we're still working.

681
01:13:52,424 --> 01:13:56,386
But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days
to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.

682
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:58,847
There's a place called Fort Knox
where the gold's already been mined.

683
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:02,100
Listen, there will be no mining,
but we'll deliver it.

684
01:14:02,309 --> 01:14:06,063
Okay, so we have to pretend
that we're mining the gold.

685
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:10,776
We have to figure out where
we're gonna get the gold. . .

686
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:13,528
. . .then we have to get the supplies
to help our revolt.

687
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:15,197
Yeah.

688
01:14:15,405 --> 01:14:17,908
We barely have men to
do one of those things. . .

689
01:14:18,116 --> 01:14:20,035
. . .Let's alone all three.

690
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:24,915
It's good to have friends
on the outside!

691
01:14:43,016 --> 01:14:43,850
Come on!

692
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,895
If you two kept your eyes open,
that'd be a great help.

693
01:14:47,104 --> 01:14:50,148
Look for an ocean. If you see any,
we've gone too far.

694
01:14:52,442 --> 01:14:54,111
I think this is it.

695
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,113
I think we're in Washington.

696
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:58,990
-We're still in Colorado.
-That's impossible.

697
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:00,909
I've been watching,
we haven't crossed this line.

698
01:15:01,118 --> 01:15:03,036
You're not paying attention.

699
01:15:03,286 --> 01:15:06,998
Let him navigate and watch me.
You're gonna fly on the way back.

700
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:10,293
We couldn't have crossed
all these lines.

701
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:14,089
Well, we did. The lines must
have faded over time.

702
01:15:29,354 --> 01:15:32,566
This great village was the capital
for all our tribes.

703
01:15:32,774 --> 01:15:35,277
This is where our people's
history was buried.

704
01:15:45,704 --> 01:15:48,665
Here. When the Psychlos
attacked Earth. . .

705
01:15:48,957 --> 01:15:51,001
. . .they sent out flying gas drones.

706
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:54,880
Our ancestors must've made it out
into these remote radiated areas. . .

707
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:58,842
. . .and the only reason they survived
was because radiation is. . .

708
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,677
. . .Lethal to the Psychlos.

709
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:03,847
-And that was not good for them.
-That's good for us.

710
01:16:04,055 --> 01:16:06,975
Even if we fail, the people
will be safe if they stay--

711
01:16:07,183 --> 01:16:08,977
Safe from being hunted. . .

712
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:11,980
. . .but radiation is
also poisonous for humans.

713
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:14,691
So, you see, either way. . .

714
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:17,903
. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .

715
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:21,948
. . .the last of humanity
becomes extinct.

716
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,771
Based on what I've read about
Psychlo security. . .

717
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:54,189
. . .if we revolted. . .

718
01:16:54,397 --> 01:16:57,692
. . .only using weapons they don't
perceive as any real threat. . .

719
01:16:57,901 --> 01:17:00,403
. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .

720
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:03,740
. . .they'll just throw us
back in the cages.

721
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:05,158
But. . .

722
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:09,371
. . .we're gonna stage this revolt
inside the dome.

723
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:14,292
So the Psychlos are gonna have to
come inside the city to round us up.

724
01:17:14,918 --> 01:17:17,962
And that is when we blow the dome.

725
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,799
Carlo's gonna blow the dome.

726
01:17:21,049 --> 01:17:23,176
-They won't have masks.
-They can't breathe.

727
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:24,552
-They die.
-Carlo?

728
01:17:24,761 --> 01:17:27,722
-I'm gonna blow the dome?
-You're gonna blow the dome.

729
01:17:29,307 --> 01:17:32,435
Piece of cake.
Piece of cake, piece of cake.

730
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:38,775
But remember, as soon as
we blow the dome. . .

731
01:17:38,983 --> 01:17:40,944
. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.

732
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:41,986
What is that?

733
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:45,407
Thousands of gas drones and troops
will be teleported here.

734
01:17:45,615 --> 01:17:49,119
-We can't fight against that.
-Then what's the point?

735
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:52,664
If they send more monsters to Earth,
we get wiped out.

736
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:56,042
Well, the point is,
we don't let it get to stage 2.

737
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:58,837
We'll destroy their Home Planet
before it happens.

738
01:17:59,045 --> 01:18:01,840
-Their Home Planet?
-Their Home Planet.

739
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:06,344
We need some extra supplies
before we can do that.

740
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:08,972
Our first stop is a radiation bomb
storage bunker.

741
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,558
Is everyone clear?

742
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,602
Count us in.

743
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:47,802
-Look.
-Flying machines.

744
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:51,264
These are flying machines.
They're weapons of some kind.

745
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:55,351
Flying spears.

746
01:18:55,685 --> 01:18:57,937
I think there's a little more
to it than that.

747
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:17,248
It's a learning machine.

748
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,375
Teach us to fly.

749
01:19:38,269 --> 01:19:39,354
You're right.

750
01:19:39,604 --> 01:19:41,022
It's like breaking a horse.

751
01:19:41,773 --> 01:19:43,942
Can you teach your men to fly this?

752
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:47,070
-Piece of cake, piece of cake.
-Piece of cake.

753
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:49,030
-Try and keep it level.
-Jonnie!

754
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:50,490
-What is it?
-I think I found one.

755
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:53,618
Come on! Nuclear firebomb!

756
01:19:53,826 --> 01:19:55,161
Piece of cake.

757
01:19:56,204 --> 01:19:58,790
According to the book, there's
a firing mechanism. . .

758
01:19:58,998 --> 01:20:02,460
. . .that has to be in place before
it's operational.

759
01:20:23,022 --> 01:20:24,816
Don't touch the auto-sensor.

760
01:20:25,024 --> 01:20:26,567
What happens if we do?

761
01:20:26,776 --> 01:20:29,529
The bomb will explode. Big fire.

762
01:20:31,114 --> 01:20:33,116
Look. Greeners from this cave.

763
01:20:33,324 --> 01:20:34,992
Off. Off.

764
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:51,759
War--

765
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,885
--ning.

766
01:20:53,094 --> 01:20:54,846
Warning. Warning.

767
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,264
Warning.

768
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:59,100
Warning.

769
01:20:59,308 --> 01:21:00,435
Get it?

770
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:08,317
What does the auto-sensor look like?

771
01:21:08,609 --> 01:21:10,820
There's an illustration in Appendix A.

772
01:21:16,451 --> 01:21:17,952
What? What?

773
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,124
We don't have Appendix A.

774
01:21:31,716 --> 01:21:32,800
More books, Jonnie.

775
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:42,894
It's okay.

776
01:21:43,603 --> 01:21:46,314
I thought you said nuclear fires
were powerful?

777
01:21:46,522 --> 01:21:48,065
It's not nuclear. Mickey!

778
01:21:48,274 --> 01:21:49,525
Sorry.

779
01:21:49,734 --> 01:21:51,277
You're sorry. Mickey!

780
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:54,572
Stop touching things
and turn off the damn light.

781
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,781
Leave it on.

782
01:21:57,617 --> 01:21:58,868
Look.

783
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,542
Good work, Mickey.

784
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:08,753
You just found Appendix A.

785
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:27,104
Will this be enough to blow up
their whole planet?

786
01:22:27,313 --> 01:22:29,690
Radiation reacts with their
planet's atmosphere.

787
01:22:29,899 --> 01:22:32,902
-There's enough to destroy it forever.
-Let me do it.

788
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:37,406
Let me go there
and detonate the weapon.

789
01:22:37,698 --> 01:22:40,993
It's brave of you, Mickey,
but it's my plan, so I go.

790
01:22:41,202 --> 01:22:44,288
You're the only one who speaks
the monsters' language.

791
01:22:44,497 --> 01:22:46,499
You know things about them!

792
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,918
Listen. . .

793
01:22:49,126 --> 01:22:51,837
. . .without you leading this revolt. . .

794
01:22:53,297 --> 01:22:54,715
. . .we might not succeed.

795
01:23:46,517 --> 01:23:50,104
I hope their eye in the sky didn't
see the gold through the lead walls.

796
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:11,167
Start filling the cage.

797
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:15,212
We'll hide half and deliver
the other half to Terl tonight.

798
01:24:35,107 --> 01:24:36,650
Why is it in bars?

799
01:24:38,652 --> 01:24:40,196
I assumed, sir. . .

800
01:24:40,404 --> 01:24:44,408
. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement
wouldn't want raw ore.

801
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:49,830
Really?

802
01:25:01,383 --> 01:25:03,511
Since you have had extra time. . .

803
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:05,804
. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .

804
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:08,682
. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold
in seven days.

805
01:25:38,379 --> 01:25:40,881
He has no intention of sharing
that gold with you.

806
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,678
What the hell are you talking about?

807
01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:49,765
Why are you here?
You should be mining the gold!

808
01:25:49,974 --> 01:25:52,935
You really think the only reason
he made that recording. . .

809
01:25:53,143 --> 01:25:56,230
. . .was to have you as his patsy?
Do you, Ker?

810
01:25:56,855 --> 01:25:59,900
No. He has leverage over you. . .

811
01:26:00,109 --> 01:26:02,736
. . .and it'll guarantee you
never see an ounce.

812
01:26:03,988 --> 01:26:06,532
How do you know
about those recordings?

813
01:26:06,991 --> 01:26:08,617
It really is amazing. . .

814
01:26:08,826 --> 01:26:11,704
. . .the collection of discs
you find in Terl's personal vault.

815
01:26:27,386 --> 01:26:28,345
First, we trade.

816
01:26:28,554 --> 01:26:30,180
-The disc--
-I don't think so!

817
01:26:30,431 --> 01:26:32,808
Because if you don't give me
the disc now. . .

818
01:26:33,017 --> 01:26:34,727
. . .I will blow your head off.

819
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:57,040
You want to trade?

820
01:26:58,375 --> 01:26:59,543
Let's trade.

821
01:27:00,836 --> 01:27:02,087
Hooray!

822
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:06,759
Won't the Psychlo see
I'm not wearing the collar?

823
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:10,095
After tonight, won't matter
much either way.

824
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:14,141
Jonnie, I know you
don't believe in fate. . .

825
01:27:14,433 --> 01:27:16,685
. . .but I've always known
this was your destiny.

826
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,063
This is our destiny.
It's freedom for all of us.

827
01:27:20,606 --> 01:27:22,107
For our children.

828
01:27:23,525 --> 01:27:24,818
Children?

829
01:27:49,009 --> 01:27:50,260
Beautiful.

830
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:04,483
Quickly!

831
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:24,586
What if this one is
particularly stupid?

832
01:28:24,795 --> 01:28:27,297
There's no time.
When they detect the gold...

833
01:28:27,506 --> 01:28:30,092
... the Planetship will know
what we're doing.

834
01:28:34,638 --> 01:28:37,933
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

835
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:43,730
When they detect the gold, the
Planetship will know what we're doing.

836
01:28:46,233 --> 01:28:48,610
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

837
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:49,695
I've been thinking.

838
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:54,074
80/20 is a pretty fair
distribution of the gold.

839
01:28:54,783 --> 01:28:56,535
But I should get the 80% .

840
01:28:57,327 --> 01:29:00,747
And with my share, I'm gonna
fire all my wives. . .

841
01:29:00,998 --> 01:29:02,457
. . .and buy new ones.

842
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,711
Maybe pretty ones this time.

843
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,046
Ker-bango!

844
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,508
Congratulations.

845
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,886
You've learned how to get
leverage over someone, haven't you?

846
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,724
Which means I haven't wasted my time
training you, have I?

847
01:29:19,516 --> 01:29:21,435
-You're not upset?
-Don't be crazy.

848
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,812
You know how long I've waited
for this day?

849
01:29:24,062 --> 01:29:26,189
I know the perfect way to celebrate.

850
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:30,527
What are you doing?

851
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:33,071
You can't shoot me.

852
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,366
I made a copy and gave it
to someone for safekeeping.

853
01:29:36,575 --> 01:29:39,703
You are just too good of a teacher.

854
01:29:40,495 --> 01:29:44,708
How about giving your old teacher
a clue as to who this might be?

855
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:47,002
You insult yourself, sir.

856
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:48,587
You taught me better.

857
01:29:48,795 --> 01:29:51,006
How am I supposed to know who it is?

858
01:29:51,214 --> 01:29:52,758
I don't know.

859
01:29:52,966 --> 01:29:55,594
It could be anybody
on this damn planet.

860
01:29:55,844 --> 01:29:57,846
-It could be a mechanic.
-No.

861
01:29:58,096 --> 01:30:00,223
-It could be a concubine.
-No, no.

862
01:30:00,432 --> 01:30:02,851
It could be anybody
in communications.

863
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:03,935
Wrong!

864
01:30:04,186 --> 01:30:08,065
I hate these things. It's like
it's a test I'm not prepared for.

865
01:30:09,524 --> 01:30:14,237
Well, hell, it could even be
our friendly bartender!

866
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,120
Please. I made a mistake.

867
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,294
Now, give me the original disc. . .

868
01:30:29,503 --> 01:30:32,881
. . .then meet me at the teleportation
platform in two hours.

869
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,509
Sir.

870
01:30:45,977 --> 01:30:47,562
The control bunker's to the right.

871
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:48,939
Three guards left.

872
01:30:49,272 --> 01:30:52,150
Two from the guardhouse,
one coming from the north.

873
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:54,528
I'll take the guardhouse.

874
01:31:58,717 --> 01:32:01,511
Jonnie, the shooting's
triggered the alarm.

875
01:32:02,262 --> 01:32:05,724
Five guards from the south,
heavily armed and moving fast.

876
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,434
Between you and the bunker.

877
01:32:07,934 --> 01:32:09,144
Jonnie!

878
01:33:15,043 --> 01:33:18,463
The man-animals have escaped.
They're running into the city.

879
01:33:18,755 --> 01:33:21,800
Send some guards out
and round them up. I'm busy.

880
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:24,427
Don't bother me
with every little detail.

881
01:33:24,636 --> 01:33:26,096
Gotta round them up.

882
01:33:37,732 --> 01:33:38,817
Psychlos!

883
01:33:40,235 --> 01:33:41,528
Psychlos!

884
01:33:43,446 --> 01:33:45,406
7-7-3.

885
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:50,537
Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.
Can I blow the dome?

886
01:33:52,622 --> 01:33:53,665
Greener?

887
01:33:54,207 --> 01:33:56,209
What's going on? Talk to me!

888
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:59,003
It's Carlo. What's going on?
Talk to me.

889
01:33:59,212 --> 01:34:00,463
Hold on!

890
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:04,175
If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,
they'll send drones.

891
01:34:04,384 --> 01:34:07,720
Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,
because I've got company.

892
01:36:53,803 --> 01:36:54,637
Here they are.

893
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:25,167
Panther!

894
01:37:46,856 --> 01:37:49,317
Hang on. I'm right on his tail.

895
01:38:39,825 --> 01:38:41,619
You know what you gotta do.

896
01:39:10,022 --> 01:39:11,232
Greener, come on.

897
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,025
I've gotta blow this dome now!

898
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:15,569
I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.
Hang on.

899
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:17,154
I'm seconds away.

900
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:31,210
Jonnie, come on.

901
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,254
They're destroying the bombs.

902
01:39:33,546 --> 01:39:35,005
-It's now or never.
-Now!

903
01:39:35,214 --> 01:39:37,883
Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!
Go! Go! Go!

904
01:39:44,557 --> 01:39:47,351
Teleportation sequence terminated.

905
01:39:48,477 --> 01:39:49,979
Interrupting something?

906
01:39:50,563 --> 01:39:52,022
Jonnie? Jonnie?

907
01:40:25,181 --> 01:40:27,391
Why isn't it coming down?

908
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:30,728
The dome is holding!

909
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:34,148
-It's not working.
-It's only cracked!

910
01:40:38,986 --> 01:40:41,780
The dome isn't broken.
We can't hold out long.

911
01:40:44,742 --> 01:40:47,995
Attention! This is Terl,
your chief of security.

912
01:40:48,746 --> 01:40:51,957
Exterminate all man-animals at will.

913
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:53,667
And happy hunting!

914
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,600
Run! Run!

915
01:41:39,088 --> 01:41:40,381
What's with the dome?

916
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,093
Hold on, I'm taking it out now.

917
01:42:25,884 --> 01:42:27,302
Help us!

918
01:42:27,678 --> 01:42:28,804
They're killing us!

919
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:40,149
We're not gonna make it!
I think we should pull out!

920
01:43:00,669 --> 01:43:04,381
I'm blowing the dome. In five.

921
01:43:05,007 --> 01:43:06,133
Four.

922
01:43:12,556 --> 01:43:13,724
Three.

923
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,684
Two.

924
01:43:16,268 --> 01:43:17,144
One.

925
01:43:19,313 --> 01:43:20,856
Piece of cake.

926
01:43:49,384 --> 01:43:51,678
Everyone on the ground now! Go!

927
01:45:17,013 --> 01:45:19,683
Teleportation sequence activated.

928
01:45:21,643 --> 01:45:24,396
Teleportation sequence activated.

929
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:27,941
Psychlo War Center,
this is a stage 3 alert!

930
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:30,277
I repeat, a stage 3 alert.

931
01:45:30,485 --> 01:45:33,405
Initiate the gas drone
extermination sequence.

932
01:45:48,003 --> 01:45:50,422
You have been
quite a challenge, rat-brain.

933
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,841
You'll make a hell
of a conversation piece. . .

934
01:45:53,091 --> 01:45:56,344
. . .when you're stuffed
and hanging on the academy wall.

935
01:46:43,808 --> 01:46:45,519
Where's the rest of my gold?

936
01:46:45,936 --> 01:46:48,230
I'll exchange it for my woman's life.

937
01:46:48,897 --> 01:46:52,150
My life is over, but hers is
of no consequence to you.

938
01:46:53,235 --> 01:46:56,571
Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.
Now, where is it?

939
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:59,074
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

940
01:46:59,324 --> 01:47:01,701
Trust me, there's nothing I want more.

941
01:48:43,678 --> 01:48:45,472
Carlo came through.

942
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:48,076
Why don't you vaporize me?

943
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,960
Leverage.

944
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,675
If there are other Psychlo
colonies out there. . .

945
01:50:03,883 --> 01:50:06,761
. . .they'll send out gas drones
and exterminate us.

946
01:50:07,512 --> 01:50:10,515
But if they learn
that it was your greed. . .

947
01:50:11,307 --> 01:50:13,434
. . .that destroyed their Home Planet. . .

948
01:50:15,853 --> 01:50:18,314
. . .then all the credits
in the universe. . .

949
01:50:19,065 --> 01:50:21,567
. . .won't equal the bounty
on your head.

950
01:50:34,831 --> 01:50:38,668
But there is one thing you rat-brains
weren't smart enough to realize.

951
01:50:39,002 --> 01:50:40,336
Kill them.

952
01:50:54,392 --> 01:50:56,352
I fixed the problem with it.

953
01:50:57,645 --> 01:50:59,272
-It works now.
-You imbecile!

954
01:50:59,689 --> 01:51:01,774
What kind of game are you playing?

955
01:51:02,233 --> 01:51:06,738
Since I'm teaching them our technology,
they made me the head Psychlo.

956
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:12,952
Look at the bright side.

957
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:18,499
You may not be wallowing
in luxury on Psychlo. . .

958
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:23,421
. . .but at least you finally
got your gold.

959
01:58:49,575 --> 01:58:50,617
