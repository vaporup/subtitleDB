1
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,826
You're not making sense. You're not
saying things that mean anything.

2
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,288
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

3
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,664
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

4
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,458
A Lincoln is not better
than a Cadillac.

5
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,545
A Lincoln is better.
It's a better automobile.

6
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,632
Forget about it.
Cadillac got more acceleration.

7
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,134
It's got more power.

8
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,677
It's got better handling.

9
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,096
It's got more legroom.

10
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,015
- It's got more power.
- You just said that.

11
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,309
- Bingo.
- You just said, " More power."

12
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,019
- You're repeating yourself.
- I said that?

13
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,855
- You're getting senile.
- He's got me fucking aggravated.

14
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,983
Mercedes got it all over
both of them.

15
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,361
A Lincoln's like driving
a fucking water bed.

16
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,199
- A Mercedes.
- It's a good car.

17
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,208
- Who's that over there?
- Who?

18
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,877
The guy by the bar
with the mustache.

19
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,587
That's Don the Jeweler.

20
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,049
- Jilly brought him around.
- Jilly Four-Eyes?

21
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,136
Not Jilly Four-Eyes.
Jilly from Queens.

22
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,764
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.

23
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,684
Connected?
If I had a thing to lay off...

24
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,395
- He could lay it off?
- You got something?

25
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,398
- That ain't the question.
- You got something to lay off?

26
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,652
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay off.

27
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,738
All that money
you owe downtown...

28
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,157
You'd have to lay off
a Brinks truck.

29
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,870
- Sonny's in love.
- I think Lefty's in love.

30
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,997
I'll see you.

31
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,784
Were you asleep?

32
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,124
- Are you okay, honey?
- I'm okay.

33
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,088
Go back to sleep.
I'll call you tomorrow.

34
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,799
That's good, babe.

35
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,802
I'm sorry. I got to go back
to sleep. I'm so tired.

36
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,804
- All right.
- All right.

37
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,142
What?

38
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,979
Put the phone on your pillow.

39
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,566
I wanna listen to you breathe.

40
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,839
You Don the Jeweler?

41
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,304
There.
That's some beautiful thing.

42
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:39,358
- Why don't you give it to your wife?
- How am I gonna give it to my wife?

43
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,027
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?

44
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,696
- I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.

45
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,992
You for real?

46
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,038
I'm asking you to middle
a diamond for me here.

47
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,582
All I want from my end is 8,000.

48
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,543
And I'm saying to you...

49
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,255
Give it to somebody that don't know
better because that's a fugazy.

50
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,756
All right?

51
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,885
That's a fugazy?
How do you know?

52
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,222
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- These are fake.

53
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,765
I know what a fugazy is.

54
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,894
Hey, pal...

55
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,398
You want to see something?

56
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,900
I'll show you something.

57
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,945
There you go. Nice stone.
That's a beautiful thing.

58
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,242
But it's not my thing.
What about this?

59
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,581
Try and sell it. Be a dunsky.
Give it a shot.

60
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,375
You're calling me a dunsky?

61
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,752
You know who I am?

62
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,088
Left, have a spritzer.

63
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,757
You want to embarrass yourself
with this thing?

64
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,595
Embarrass myself?
My family, my children...

65
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:54,433
My mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city.

66
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,312
In all the five boroughs,
I'm known. Forget about it.

67
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,608
I'm known all over
the fucking world.

68
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,278
Anybody ask anybody
about Lefty...

69
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,947
from Mulberry Street.

70
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,618
- You're pissing up the wrong tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.

71
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,411
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going?

72
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,954
Sit down there.

73
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,127
You're gonna walk out on me?

74
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:25,589
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

75
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,258
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

76
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,636
Let's get your car.
Come on.

77
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,950
- Put the window up. I'll catch a draft.
- I'm getting cancer over here.

78
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,328
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?

79
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,289
You a cop?
Don't ask so many questions.

80
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,376
I earn the money I'm earning,
I can't tell a fucking zircon?

81
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,838
- There's good money in it?
- What?

82
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,176
- Jewels?
- Thank you.

83
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,012
If you know what you’re doing,
there is.

84
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,934
Let's go to 23rd and 8th to find out
if you know what you’re doing.

85
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,859
You owe me eight grand.

86
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,114
Hold on. Wait.
I gave you the diamond.

87
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,491
Who's this guy?

88
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,536
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?

89
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,707
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?

90
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,376
- You know.
- Don’t you tell me what I know.

91
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,337
- You know what you did.
- One of you has to be wrong.

92
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,216
That's a Tiffany diamond.

93
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,552
Left, that is my wife's
fucking diamond ring.

94
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,387
- It's a fugazy.
- What is your problem?

95
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,849
- Come on.
- Eight thousand dollars.

96
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,645
Let me talk to this guy
for a second.

97
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,650
Go have a drink.
Let me talk to the guy.

98
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,194
Come on.

99
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,408
I got a black belt.
If you fuck--

100
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,126
This guy will kill you.
You understand?

101
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,712
We have two minutes
to figure a way out of this.

102
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,882
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

103
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,426
- Sorry won’t do it.
- I don't want to die.

104
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,305
- Yeah? What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.

105
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,307
Give me the keys.

106
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,060
All right.

107
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,689
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.

108
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,317
Lefty's stuff.
All right. Good.

109
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,528
That's for the drinks, pal.

110
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,129
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.

111
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,466
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.

112
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,260
All right.

113
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,428
You scared that guy though.

114
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,308
That cracks me up.

115
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:27,729
I got 26 hits under my belt,
and he's scared of you. Fuck.

116
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,774
- Pull over. I've gotta do something.
- Right here?

117
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,485
All right.

118
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,156
Give me a hand with this.
Pull this out.

119
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,827
- You're taking the whole thing apart.
- There ain't nothing under the dash.

120
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,329
I didn't hear a thing.

121
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,331
There it is.

122
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,669
- I can go up the back.
- What are you doing down there?

123
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,173
- Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?

124
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,301
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

125
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,971
- Did I say you got a wire?
- Say it to my face!

126
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,182
I think you owe me an apology.

127
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,019
Ain't the question.
I lost a screwdriver here.

128
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,521
- You lost what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.

129
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,149
You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?

130
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,235
You'll find it again.
It's down there.

131
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,823
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.

132
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,785
- I got the Fleetwood Brougham.
- Is that right? With the velour?

133
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,829
Forget about it.

134
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,874
Are you married?

135
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,879
- I got a girl in California.
- That's good.

136
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,840
She should stay in California.

137
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,009
Keep your eye off your balls.

138
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,387
- You're right.
- I'm always right.

139
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,475
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.

140
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,520
All the way up the line:
connected guy to wise guy...

141
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,563
to skipper to boss.

142
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:55,359
- I know that.
- You know? What do you know?

143
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,237
It's kind of like the army,
a chain of command.

144
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,242
The army?
It ain't nothing like the army.

145
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,244
The army is some guy
you don't know...

146
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:09,122
sending you out to kill
some other guy you don't know.

147
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:18,048
- You wanna check in with me tomorrow?
- All right.

148
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:25,055
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.

149
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,434
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- So long.

150
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,310
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.

151
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,314
He keeps to himself.
He's a jewel guy.

152
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,233
- Where's he from, Jilly?
- Florida.

153
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,946
But where in Florida?
The beach?

154
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,990
No, not the beach.

155
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,491
I don't know.

156
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,121
Wherever the fuck the Dodgers
have spring training.

157
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:35,292
- He's a stand-up guy?
- I knew him. I didn't fuck him.

158
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,465
Come here!

159
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,348
What do you say,Jilly?
How are you?

160
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:53,644
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me.

161
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,230
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that.

162
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,315
If you do, one of us
is gonna whack you out.

163
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,984
- That's not good.
- All right.

164
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,029
Go back to your bath.

165
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,532
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.

166
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,373
When I introduce you...

167
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm gonna say,
"This is a friend of mine."

168
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,545
That means you're a connected guy.

169
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,673
If I said instead,
"This is a friend of ours,"

170
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,342
that would mean
you're a made guy.

171
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,970
" Friend of mine."
" Friend of ours."

172
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,181
- What do I call you?
- Keep your mouth shut about me.

173
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,724
Don't say--

174
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,854
You got a couple of fazools?

175
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,398
I got some things
I gotta take care of.

176
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,400
What do you want?
A hundred?

177
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,236
What are you doing?

178
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,530
Wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.

179
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,908
Wise guy carries money
in a roll. Like this.

180
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,911
Beaner on the outside.
Like that. Come on.

181
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,790
That mustache--

182
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,419
You gotta get rid of that mustache.
That's against the rules.

183
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,254
And get a pair of pants.

184
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,215
This ain't a fucking rodeo.
Dress like I dress.

185
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,218
This is my family.

186
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,388
- More, even, than my own family.
- Is that right?

187
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,767
- I don't got a family.
- You don't?

188
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,437
I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

189
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,231
Ain't the question.
Even if you had a family.

190
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,694
If this is your family,
then this is your family.

191
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,696
You know what I'm saying?

192
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,116
I'm freezing my balls off.

193
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,993
Why do we stand outside
all day in the cold?

194
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,748
- Gotta show the flag.
- The flag of Antarctica.

195
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,459
- What's going on?
- Lefty, what do you say?

196
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,754
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.
- How you doing?

197
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,923
The good news is my dick
is now a Popsicle.

198
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,139
- Hi, Sonny.
- Sonny, how you doing?

199
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,641
Sonny Red.

200
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,521
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

201
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,984
Just stand there
and look dangerous, friend.

202
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,278
He does look dangerous,
don't he?

203
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,614
You gonna make this week's vig?
I hope so.

204
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,825
I don't wanna come looking for you.
You hear me?

205
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,540
Come on, Bruno.

206
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,584
I just shit in my pants.

207
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,337
It's the boss, Donnie.

208
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,876
Joseph, the Bureau
wants your autograph.

209
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,170
- What's that you want me to sign?
- Forget about it.

210
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,338
- Forget about it is right.
- Listen.

211
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,884
They want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.

212
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,096
How do they even know about it?
Did you rat me out?

213
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,182
I didn't rat you out.

214
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,396
- Show-and-tell.
- Nice.

215
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,567
- What?
- He wants me to shave.

216
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,277
Who? Ruggiero?

217
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,907
Regulations. Here.

218
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,869
You know something?

219
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:42,164
I got him.
I got my hooks in the guy.

220
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,215
Cloaked by the high grasses of the African savanna...

221
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,927
the stalking cheetah moves stealthily towards his prey.

222
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,938
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?

223
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,607
- I'm Donnie.
- Tommy. How are you?

224
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,443
- Good.
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.

225
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,362
Benny's watching TV.
You met Tommy?

226
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,905
We met. Thank you.

227
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,158
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.

228
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,702
- Donnie's here.
- Too late.

229
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,704
The cheetah springs.

230
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,541
Benny loves animals.

231
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,129
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen.

232
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,550
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.

233
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,886
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.

234
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:42,307
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.

235
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,309
Wait a minute. Here.

236
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,111
I'm sorry, Left,
but I'm in a little bit of a rush here.

237
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,281
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

238
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,825
That's really nice of you.

239
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,913
Wow. Look at this.

240
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:09,585
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.

241
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,337
- Happy holidays.
- Where you going?

242
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,214
I thought you was an orphan.

243
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,468
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't want to spoil your day.

244
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,345
Come on.

245
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,017
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.

246
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,811
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?

247
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,648
All they know is manicotti.
A hundred years, they'll be manicotti.

248
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,026
You never ate coq au vin?

249
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,196
Here we are.

250
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,324
Can of collagen,
can of tomatoes.

251
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,204
- Punch of salt.
- " Punch"?

252
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,708
- Punch or pinch?
- Punch.

253
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,335
Not pinch.

254
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,421
- Did I say, "pinch" ?
- You said, "punch."

255
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,757
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense.

256
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,054
- You got all this?
- I can't cook special like Benny.

257
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,014
Shut up, Annette.
Forget about it.

258
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,684
Wherever you go,
the best cooks are men.

259
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:12,147
On Mars, the best cooks
are gonna be men. That's a fact.

260
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,567
Wait till you taste
this coq au vin.

261
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:19,196
It's gonna melt in your mouth
like Holy Communion.

262
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,906
What the fuck is that?

263
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,908
Annette, get that.

264
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,248
- Thank you.
- Sure.

265
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,291
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure.

266
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,585
She's a good woman.

267
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,796
One broad,
that's enough for anyone.

268
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,340
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple hours.

269
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,264
Merry Christmas.
Donnie, take care.

270
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,766
You too.
Take it easy.

271
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,940
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?

272
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,859
What can you do?

273
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,071
- Give him a smack once in awhile.
- I got bruises on my hands.

274
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:07,619
You don't know my worries.
I can't do right by Annette.

275
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,122
I ain't got three bucks.

276
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,458
I put a bet on a horse, that horse
don't do what it's supposed to do...

277
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,961
Like everything else in my life.

278
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,463
I got cancer of the prick.

279
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:22,593
My ex-wife lives in this building.
Can you believe it? I run into her.

280
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:26,263
I need three spritzers
afterward to calm down.

281
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,390
What are you talking about,
"cancer of the prick"?

282
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,101
It's cancer of the prick.

283
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:35,105
You didn't know that?
I'm in the medical books for that.

284
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,650
I got this boat too,
this Bertram.

285
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,695
Fifty-footer with twin Chryslers.
I had to get rid of it.

286
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:45,282
The money I owe Sonny Red.
The vig alone is $3,000.

287
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,785
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno, that's his son.

288
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:53,165
- I'd like to put a dent in his head.
- You don't do that.

289
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,793
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I wish I could.

290
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,837
You wish?

291
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,173
A guy like you
doesn't touch a made guy.

292
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,512
You know what I did yesterday?

293
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,140
I went in front
of all the skippers...

294
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,018
that cocksucker Sonny Red,
all of them.

295
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,897
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?

296
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:22,528
- I think I do.
- You ain't got no fucking idea.

297
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,698
Nobody can touch you now.
I'm your man.

298
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:30,536
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.

299
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,038
So keep your nose clean...

300
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,208
be a good earner,
follow the rules...

301
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,711
and, who knows, maybe one day
when they open the books...

302
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,339
you get straightened out.

303
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,385
Become a wise guy, a made guy.

304
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,012
Come on.
Lift your glass.

305
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,978
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.

306
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,022
- All right?
- All right.

307
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,692
All right.

308
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:07,030
- Thanks a lot. That was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple, please?

309
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,075
I'll get it back to you.
You got it here.

310
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,077
Here you go.

311
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,248
I'll get back to you on this.
Call me tomorrow.

312
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,749
All right.

313
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,467
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.

314
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,933
I was working.
Nothing I could do.

315
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,644
Working.

316
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,146
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.

317
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,316
Where's the kids?

318
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,318
They couldn't wait anymore.

319
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,112
That's nice.

320
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,657
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.

321
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,327
- Is that your way of apologizing?
- You know I'm sorry.

322
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,996
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.

323
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,167
Be sure to introduce yourself.
They might think you’re a salesman.

324
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:47,172
- If you knew what I was doing today--
- I don't know...

325
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,174
because you don't tell me.

326
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,677
It's for your own protection.

327
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,641
As if any of this is for me.

328
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,935
You're getting the checks, right?

329
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:05,148
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Don't say it like it's nothing.

330
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:10,821
- It's not a husband.
- A lot of women would disagree.

331
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:15,158
Is that what you do
with all your time?

332
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,203
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I won't dignify that.

333
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,706
Seven days a week,
I'm out there busting my ass...

334
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,834
- and this is the shit I come home to.
- You said it would be three months.

335
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,378
- It's going on two years
- How do you find anything?

336
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,881
- You got cereal on three shelves.
- Shit.

337
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:33,010
You got cereal over here.
Put stuff away.

338
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:37,681
- It's my job. Quit my job?
- What about my job?

339
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:41,518
Christmas Day you don't show up
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.

340
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,688
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.

341
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:47,399
Just leave it alone.

342
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,902
It would be easier
if you tell me what goes on.

343
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,446
- What do you do?
- Please leave me alone.

344
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:07,544
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don’t you pick them up?

345
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,087
Where's Sherry?

346
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:16,220
- Sherry is with her boyfriend.
- What?

347
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,764
She's at her boyfriend's.

348
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,308
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 1 2,Joe.

349
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:25,604
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- You can't drop from the sky...

350
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,898
- Like God and bark orders!
- I am the husband and father!

351
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,942
- I put food on that table!
- Undercover husband!

352
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,985
What do I get for Christmas?
Empty fucking house!

353
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,531
I'm here.

354
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,745
I wanted to be alone with you.

355
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,456
Oh, God.

356
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,773
What happened to your mustache?

357
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,987
- The Bureau made me shave it off.
- They did?

358
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,782
It was the only thing
I liked about this job.

359
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:24,496
- Sherry's got a boyfriend?
- She does.

360
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,623
Nice kid.
He's so nice.

361
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,336
He's on the wrestling team.

362
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,964
I'll bet
he's on the wrestling team.

363
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:37,301
Kerry's doing the catechism.
So sweet.

364
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,596
And they're swimming.

365
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,515
Coach says he's never seen
nothing like it.

366
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:49,021
There's a meet Saturday.

367
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,198
What am I gonna do?
We'll see.

368
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,632
You know I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.

369
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,678
I'm not worried about me.

370
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,391
Come here.

371
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:55,087
All right,
what's going on, kids?

372
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,881
Am I getting the silent treatment?

373
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,221
I'll make a bet with you.

374
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,767
I'll bet you $20...

375
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:13,105
that you can't get through this meal
without saying three words.

376
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:17,109
- All right?
- You lose.

377
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,450
What did she say?

378
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,091
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?

379
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:46,054
Every morning you're  reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?

380
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,307
Look at this. Oh, fuck.

381
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,268
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked.

382
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,811
The fucking boss.

383
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,314
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked...

384
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:58,817
- then your life gets turned around.
- Tell me where we're going.

385
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,945
- I got sent for.
- What does that mean?

386
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,200
What do you think it means?

387
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,660
You don't want to go,
I'll turn around.

388
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,829
Are you gonna take a left
off the bridge?

389
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:15,334
- Not here, after the bridge.
- I gotta go. You get sent for, you go.

390
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,336
Sonny sent for me.

391
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,463
I'm sick with this--

392
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:23,133
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?

393
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,970
Not Sonny Red.
Sonny Black.

394
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,348
What are you doing?
Put the fuck--

395
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:31,433
You wanna kill me
with that draft?

396
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,189
Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?

397
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,024
Right. What friend?

398
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,151
Ain't the question, friend.

399
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,196
The whole time Sonny Black's
in the can...

400
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,199
he's got a family,
he's got a mistress.

401
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,742
He's got a mistress
for the mistress.

402
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,328
I watched out for all of them.

403
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,873
I was the only one.
Nobody else gave a fuck.

404
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,167
200 fazools,
week in, week out.

405
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,379
Why are you worried then?

406
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:05,008
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your head.

407
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:09,179
- Explain it to me.
- I know how a hit gets set up.

408
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,349
You think I don't know that?

409
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:16,520
How many times I been on the other end
of that phone? Twenty-six times.

410
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,565
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends--

411
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,109
Donnie, I got sent for.

412
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:26,113
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead...

413
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,156
and it's your best friend
that does it.

414
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:48,093
Anything should happen to me...

415
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,929
make sure Annette gets the car.

416
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:11,617
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise

417
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,328
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.

418
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,788
Look at this hand.
This ain't a hand.

419
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,126
This is a fucking deformed
Creature from the Black Lagoon's claw...

420
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,628
I got here.

421
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,136
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.

422
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,640
Gin.

423
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,316
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise neither.

424
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,110
- It's gin.
- You got two sevens.

425
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,987
I had three sevens.

426
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:53,659
Nicky, I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.

427
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,328
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.

428
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,330
I had three sevens.

429
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,166
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

430
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,504
That fucking boots. Two hundred
in action, and we got five?

431
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:09,508
- We're taking a beating this week.
- Let's go for a ride.

432
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,468
I got a new car.

433
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:21,812
- Can you believe the ride on this car?
- That was something about the boss.

434
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,898
- We all gotta go sometime.
- I got a date in Jersey tonight.

435
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,484
- Which broad is this?
- The one from the calendar.

436
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,070
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1 978.

437
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:34,199
- Why's he looking in the mirror?
- What are you doing, Left?

438
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:38,871
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm checking my lipstick.

439
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:49,047
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something or what?

440
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,758
- You, wait in the car.
- What?

441
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,510
Watch the car.

442
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,203
Fuck! Shit!

443
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,917
I think I shit in my pants.
What is this?

444
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,253
He's supposed to go
to a animal trainer somewhere.

445
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,089
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.

446
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:34,593
- Either that or he’s just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?

447
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,429
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.

448
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:41,266
- For me?
- I know how you feel about animals.

449
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,393
It's a gift from me.

450
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,395
It's for me.

451
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,943
I got the power.
Now you're under me.

452
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:54,530
- What do you mean?
- Sonny got upped.

453
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,949
You got upped?

454
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,119
Rusty's running everything
from the can.

455
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,121
Sonny Red's got Little Italy.

456
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,083
- I got Brooklyn.
- That's why you sent for me?

457
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,422
Did you think
you was gonna get whacked?

458
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:17,636
Lefty thought
he was gonna get whacked.

459
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,263
Congratulations. Come here.

460
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,476
Good stuff.

461
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:37,865
Sonny Black they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.

462
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:42,452
Thirty years busting my hump. For what? A lion.

463
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,290
I'm like the invisible man
in this thing.

464
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:49,459
Five hours ago, you thought
you was gonna get whacked.

465
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:54,006
- Did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.

466
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,216
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?

467
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,054
You're right.
I misunderstood.

468
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,348
Thirty years I'm earning.

469
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:06,018
Any work to be done,
call Lefty.

470
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,811
I never complained.

471
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,856
Twenty-six guys I clipped.

472
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:15,027
Do I get upped?
No, they pass me by.

473
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,364
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.

474
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,658
Sonny was probably in on
whacking the boss.

475
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,994
Of course he was.

476
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,498
Whacking the boss.

477
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,709
Another think I get left out of.

478
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:34,379
But let me tell you what.

479
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,048
Look at that.

480
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:40,219
I wish I had that boat again,
that Bertram.

481
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,726
I'd get in my car with a net,
I'd drive down to the pier...

482
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,854
I'd get on that boat,
and I'd go.

483
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,234
East, west, north, south,
nobody ever find me.

484
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:00,405
Look at this thing.
It's a fucking insult.

485
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:04,076
Happiness

486
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,579
You're full of sweet surprise
and happiness

487
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,707
You fill my hot desire

488
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,251
More

489
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,550
Andover

490
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,593
Andover again

491
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:25,389
Keep that goodness coming

492
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:32,104
Let's go! Come on!

493
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,288
Let's go!

494
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,292
Come on!

495
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,175
I gave it to him!

496
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:31,181
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus, no, Sonny! Please!

497
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,724
All right.

498
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,082
Fuck.

499
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,945
Sonny, come here.

500
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,619
Good seeing you.

501
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:38,123
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best on me.

502
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,168
Get him a tailor too.

503
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:20,916
- What do you say, Kurt?
- How's it going?

504
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:24,086
This is Dean Blanford
from Washington.

505
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,589
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.

506
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,634
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy--

507
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:34,847
- Even I forget my own name.
- Is that so? Is it hard to cash checks?

508
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:45,148
You said that part already.
What's next?

509
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,443
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit...

510
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:52,990
headquarters transferred me up here
to Sin City.

511
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,951
What for?
You wanna keep an eye on me?

512
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:59,329
To make sure you receive
the proper support.

513
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:04,334
And to make sure, in all the hubbub,
there are no missed opportunities.

514
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,879
" Missed opportunities"?
Like what?

515
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:10,883
We have an agent in Miami
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.

516
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,677
His operation
is potentially very sweet.

517
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,014
Problem is it's languishing right now
and needs jump-starting.

518
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,349
The Bureau would like you
to go down there...

519
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,436
and see if you could interest
your mob friends.

520
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,606
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo--
- I won't vouch for nobody I don't know.

521
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,526
I was hoping we'd get off
on the right foot.

522
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:34,156
What's the big deal? You just vouch
for the guy. Sit in the sun for a week.

523
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:37,659
- I vouch for him, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.

524
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,204
You're not the only one
risking your life.

525
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:45,083
Oh, boy.
Well, I'll let you know.

526
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,670
I'll get back to you.

527
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,634
He'll let us know?

528
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,890
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.

529
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:05,062
My wife says Japanese is very in.
She read about it in Parade. Very big.

530
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,068
Have seat. Take off shoes.
Please.

531
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:14,571
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.

532
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:17,449
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding?

533
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:19,493
Take off your pants.
What the fuck is that?

534
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:25,624
- It’s Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?

535
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,585
- I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.

536
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:31,004
I ain't taking
my fucking shoes off.

537
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:34,174
- What?
- When in Rome--

538
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:40,597
Who won the fucking war?

539
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,599
What war?

540
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,643
We did.
Do you want to fight it again?

541
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,104
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.

542
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:50,232
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.

543
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,442
I want to eat sometime tonight.

544
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,653
Take off your shoes
or I'll chop off your feet.

545
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:59,575
Do you want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?

546
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:04,079
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.

547
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:07,624
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this prick?

548
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:10,127
I ain't doing it.

549
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,471
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take his shoes off, Mr. Moto.

550
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:26,894
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.

551
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,354
You must take off your shoes.

552
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,201
- You fuck.
- Get him down!

553
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:46,455
- You like shoes?
- Let me get in there.

554
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:59,551
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

555
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:09,645
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

556
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:13,315
- Watch him!
- Stupid fuck!

557
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,694
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie!
Kick him!

558
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,613
Get those fucking gooks!

559
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,741
Don’t you move, you fuck.

560
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:21,550
Cigars. Up the block they sell for $50
a box. We could sell them for 25.

561
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:25,220
You give a few of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.

562
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:27,764
Should give three quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.

563
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,266
I doubt it.

564
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,768
I got a guy that's got
this load of Sergio Valentis.

565
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,229
A dime on the vig.

566
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,357
- What do you got on the street?
- Hundred grand.

567
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:41,695
That should be 250
by the end of the year.

568
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:44,990
I can get these real cheap,
and I got a guy who can move them.

569
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:50,829
- Will you fucking stop that?
- How else am I supposed to open this?

570
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,249
Open sesame!

571
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,293
- A score's a score.
- I got 1 00 pairs.

572
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,300
Sonny Red's got a million dollars
a month with his trucks in Jersey.

573
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,802
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.

574
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:09,097
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.

575
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:14,269
I know a guy in Florida.
He says it's wide-open down there.

576
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,399
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.

577
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,820
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.

578
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,948
The economy has to be good
for us to make any money.

579
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:28,492
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?

580
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:31,453
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.

581
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:35,499
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.

582
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,503
Here you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same nickel.

583
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,674
You're from Florida, Donnie?

584
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,676
Lot of parking meters
down in Florida.

585
00:48:55,936 --> 00:49:01,692
You guys think this is funny?
I'm the skipper now.

586
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,861
I gotta answer!

587
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:08,031
Fifty grand a month
I kick up to Rusty. Every month!

588
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:10,868
One day, I'm gonna die.

589
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:15,831
I'm gonna be here in the same room
with all these same fucking guys...

590
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:20,335
talking about
the same fucking scams...

591
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,087
that never amount to nothing!

592
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,722
That's how I'll know
I've been sent to fucking hell.

593
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:34,766
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.

594
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:48,363
I tell you right now, we better start
earning or somebody's gonna get clipped.

595
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:56,079
Why did you inject that
with Florida?

596
00:49:56,205 --> 00:50:00,083
- I didn't inject nothing.
- You injected that.

597
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,878
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason.

598
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:06,215
- I was making conversation.
- Mr. Smart Conversation...

599
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:12,137
you tell me what happens
if Sonny Black decides to go to Florida?

600
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,140
Who said he's going to Florida?

601
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:19,478
Donnie, don't think you could
pull the wool over my eyes.

602
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,022
I see you siding up
to Sonny Black.

603
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:25,234
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it. Come on.

604
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:28,278
I ain't siding up
to Sonny Black.

605
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,281
He goes to Florida,
you're responsible...

606
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,575
and I'm responsible
because I represent you.

607
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,619
Left, come on.
I was just bullshitting around.

608
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,747
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.

609
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,750
Sonny Black
is one big, fat, fucking...

610
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:45,128
- snake in the--
- Snake in the grass.

611
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:47,923
You can't say that now.
Sonny Black is a skipper.

612
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,633
You don't open your mouth
about him.

613
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:55,180
Lefty, this fucking guy, Richie,
calls me up, he says...

614
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:58,433
"I'm getting hassled by a couple
of half-assed wise guys."

615
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:01,603
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.

616
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,897
- He's got this nightclub there.
- A nightclub?

617
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,358
Got a singles bar
near the beach.

618
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,944
I got two grenades in my house.

619
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,364
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up.

620
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:16,785
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.

621
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:55,699
Come on!

622
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,369
Come on, Four!

623
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,049
- Shit.
- That was in!

624
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,384
Bullshit.

625
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,596
Don't push me!

626
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:33,195
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you--

627
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,786
Jesus Christ.

628
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:45,916
Half-hour.

629
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,252
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know.

630
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:58,846
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

631
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:08,272
Don, you brought the cavalry.

632
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:12,818
- Richie Gazzo.
- How you doing?

633
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:14,528
Oops! I'm late!

634
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:18,782
You guys got a chance to work
on your suntans out here.

635
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:34,339
King's Court,
where every man is a king.

636
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:39,094
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You'll plotz.

637
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:43,473
Ask him why this place
is such a dump.

638
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:49,313
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.

639
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,648
I had to shut the doors.

640
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,859
These bums had their hands
in my pockets.

641
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,528
200 bucks for this,
300 bucks for that--

642
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,655
I got a wife that does that.

643
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:03,994
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

644
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:08,332
- Step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.

645
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,547
What kind of a man has a malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.

646
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,008
- I'm telling you this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?

647
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:23,680
When I knew him before,
he was all right.

648
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:27,184
I'm making an introduction. You have
to make the decision about the joint.

649
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,732
This would be something, you know?

650
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,236
We had my own lounge down here,
me and you.

651
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,697
- You know?
- What about Sonny?

652
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:43,867
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?

653
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,704
Come on.
Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

654
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:51,708
I guess
if everything worked out...

655
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,794
we could send
a few fazools up there.

656
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:01,218
Thirty years
I'm busting my hump.

657
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,720
What do I got?

658
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:07,224
Even a dog gets a warm piece
of the sidewalk.

659
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,354
I ought to show something
for what I did.

660
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:14,314
Definitely.

661
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,567
This ain't New York down here.

662
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:22,072
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.

663
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:27,411
Down here, a guy like me
could sit down with the boss.

664
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,081
You know what I'm saying?

665
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:34,835
Get out from under,
be a free agent again.

666
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:39,715
I'm telling you,
nothing but right.

667
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:22,466
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.

668
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,801
- You have to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that.

669
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,804
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

670
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:31,141
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day.

671
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:34,019
Santo Trafficante
is the boss of Florida.

672
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:36,897
- Did you know he sits on the Commission?
- I knew that.

673
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,316
- Good.
- It's up to an 80-foot boat.

674
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,319
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

675
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:46,406
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.

676
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,492
This is important!

677
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:50,786
Ninety-footer, actually.

678
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,829
I came here
and vouched for this guy.

679
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:55,832
I'm gonna take Trafficante out
in a rubber ducky?

680
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:59,169
- We'll have to wash your mouth out.
- Does Sally Paint glass...

681
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:03,173
- report to Nicky or Nicky Cigars?
- Nicky Glasses.

682
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,595
As I was saying, we've got
to fold Sonny into the RICO--

683
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,389
I need a boat
for this fucking sit-down!

684
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,933
I'm a Mormon, mister.
Now clean it up!

685
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,060
I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.

686
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:17,104
I'm not getting anything here.

687
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,757
I'm worried.
He's getting strung out.

688
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:51,388
We can get what we want.
Fuck him.

689
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,558
There it is.

690
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:01,106
Just moving behind,
nice and slow.

691
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,068
Count it, my friend.
Go ahead.

692
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:07,279
It's all there.
No bullshit.

693
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,741
We're bueno?

694
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,912
Pleasure doing business
with you, caballeros.

695
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:19,958
O, Columbia
the gem of the ocean

696
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,753
The home of the brave
and the free

697
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,804
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

698
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,244
Mommy, I need some help.

699
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:57,871
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.

700
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:00,207
- I'm in Florida.
- Why are you in Florida?

701
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,668
I don't know.
I'm hunting for turtles.

702
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:05,546
What do you think I'm doing
in Florida? I'm working.

703
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:08,799
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

704
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,302
Young lady,
you are wearing this coat.

705
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,388
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?

706
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,139
Is everything all right?

707
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:17,933
Would it matter if I said no?

708
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:21,061
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

709
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:25,148
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns."

710
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,655
How can John Wayne die?

711
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,200
Fucking Indians got him.

712
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:41,832
Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand. Look at that.

713
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,427
Let me talk to Kerry
about her Communion.

714
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,013
Oh, my God,Joe.
She doesn't want to do it.

715
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:58,182
What do you mean?
She ain't got no choice.

716
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:01,643
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone.

717
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:04,938
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?

718
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:07,024
I don't know.
She's acting out or something.

719
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,650
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.

720
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,945
I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.

721
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:14,573
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start in with your sister.

722
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:17,326
- I have to go.
- What?

723
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,870
I love you. Shit.

724
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,247
Was that Richie on the phone?

725
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,249
What did Sonny say?

726
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:29,213
- You told Sonny about the club?
- I thought you did.

727
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:33,133
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.

728
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:51,568
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around...

729
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,862
since the Moustache Petes.

730
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,864
You have to respect the man.

731
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:58,784
- You get that boat yet?
- I'm working on it.

732
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:02,788
Don't tell me no.
You have to get that boat.

733
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:06,667
I reached out already. His man says,
" Lefty, he loves boats."

734
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,419
I told him 1 00-foot boat.
I'm on the clothesline now.

735
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,922
I'm working on it.

736
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:15,551
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Since when did I disappoint you?

737
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,428
Forget about it. What's this?

738
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:21,431
Look at that.
Same thing we call each other.

739
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:23,976
Friend of mine, friend of ours.
Good.

740
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,271
But there's the double meaning.
You get it?

741
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:31,817
Know what I mean?
A boss appreciates a thing like that.

742
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,195
- Like the irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.

743
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:38,156
Forget about it.
You put a beaner inside here...

744
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,367
then he knows
these are men of men.

745
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,328
You see, if I work out
the strategy right...

746
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,789
you gotta hold up
your end now.

747
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,291
- You know?
- I know.

748
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,963
How much is this?
Donnie, you got something on you?

749
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:55,299
- What are you doing there?
- How about five dollars?

750
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:01,930
- You're doing an amazing job.
- What?

751
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:05,809
- I mean, we all think so.
- Absolutely.

752
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:11,064
For crying out loud.
Fuck.

753
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,985
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

754
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:18,238
What's " Forget about it"?
What is that?

755
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:23,160
" Forget about it" is like...

756
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,163
if you agree with someone.

757
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:30,167
Like, " Raquel Welch is one great piece
of ass." " Forget about it."

758
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,879
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac"?

759
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:39,384
But then if something is the greatest
thing in the world, like...

760
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:43,847
"Those peppers! Forget about it!"
You know?

761
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:46,683
It's also like saying,
"Go to hell."

762
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:50,020
Like,
" Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker."

763
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:51,897
And Paulie says,
" Forget about it."

764
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:02,324
Sometimes it just means
forget about it.

765
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,953
All right. Thank you very much.
I got it.

766
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:10,040
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty--

767
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:12,125
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.

768
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:16,880
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it--

769
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:21,718
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?

770
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:27,266
- They got a boat down here.
- What?

771
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:29,560
That's right.
It's Abscam.

772
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:32,729
Are you trying to get me killed
with that fucking suit...

773
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:34,982
that purple fucking car?

774
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:37,025
Don't say the word "plotz."
You understand?

775
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:41,947
Get in the back.

776
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,128
Wait a minute.
I'll be there.

777
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:05,721
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty,
a friend of ours.

778
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:10,309
I don't know what to say. To me,
this is a great moment in my life.

779
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:12,895
It's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

780
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:16,064
That's the boat I arranged for you.

781
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:20,736
It's got everything. Got a full bar,
any kind of music you want.

782
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:23,488
You wanna make a telephone--
It's got telephones.

783
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:26,033
- Any questions, you ask me.
- Where's Sonny Black?

784
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,998
Everybody out.
Come on, baby.

785
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:36,293
- It's beautiful!
- What did I tell you?

786
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:43,592
You brought the family.
Hey, Paul, what do you know?

787
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:46,595
- What do you say, Paulie?
- Where's Gilligan?

788
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,849
That's what I call a boat.

789
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,853
Here.

790
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:38,021
Sure you can operate here.
You gotta show a little respect.

791
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,731
I don't even wanna look at you.

792
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:24,193
- You know where the bow is?
- What did I do now?

793
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,236
You stabbed the wrong guy
in the back.

794
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:29,990
What are you talking about?
You think I said something to Sonny?

795
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,075
Go to the bow.
I'm staying in the stern.

796
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,204
Go to the bow.
Stay there.

797
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:37,748
I'm so disgusted with you,
you know that?

798
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:41,627
- You just said it.
- Just so you know.

799
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,975
- How you doing?
- That Trafficante is something else.

800
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:01,438
- Is that right? Is he a good old guy?
- Forget about it.

801
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:04,775
That motherfucker had this
all to himself for 50 years...

802
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:07,528
and it's still a cow town.

803
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:11,073
This could be like Vegas down here.

804
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:14,117
Forget about Sonny Red
and his trucks in Jersey.

805
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,787
This is all I want: Florida.

806
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,791
Tell you something. Sonny Red
is freezing his nuts off right now.

807
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,546
That's for sure.

808
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:28,799
All I need is the start-up money
from Rusty...

809
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,801
and then we all get rich.

810
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,845
Are we heading back
to New York soon?

811
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:36,473
Not you. I want you
to represent me down here.

812
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:39,935
I want you to be my man
in Florida.

813
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,230
Get that club going.
You know, Kings Court.

814
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,658
You didn't think
I knew about that, did you?

815
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:59,079
I'll send the lion down here
with you.

816
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:02,332
Keep that big pussy
in the parking lot.

817
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:06,962
Yeah. You know, Sonny, I really
appreciate the offer and everything...

818
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:09,464
but I have a lot of things going on
in New York.

819
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:13,719
- I'd like to keep them going.
- Lefty's a dynamite guy.

820
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,597
He looked after me
when I was in the can.

821
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,640
That's something
I don't forget...

822
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,185
something I will
never, ever forget.

823
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:25,522
He's a stand-up guy.
He really cares about you too.

824
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,984
I know he does.

825
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:32,070
The problem is that you think
he's helping you...

826
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:35,199
but he's hurting you.

827
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:39,036
He gets those
two or three wines in him.

828
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,079
You know what I'm saying?

829
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,835
I don't want to step
on nobody's toes.

830
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:50,255
- If it wasn't for Left, l--
- That's it. Look.

831
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:54,635
You belong to me now.

832
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:58,263
That's it.

833
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,442
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

834
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,365
- You believe that?
- Jesus Christ, they're killing me.

835
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:20,244
- Come here.
- Santo, this is Donnie.

836
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:23,580
- He's a friend of ours.
- Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.

837
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,459
- This is Johnny.
- How you doing?

838
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,181
- Give my best to Joe.
- I will.

839
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:44,101
Snowed in.
Can you believe that?

840
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:48,105
Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he's stuck at an airport.

841
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,109
That's for his own protection.
I'll see you later.

842
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:55,112
- I hate flying.
- I know you do. Be safe.

843
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,366
Oh, sweetheart.

844
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,163
Honey.

845
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:11,211
Your father
is so proud of you.

846
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:17,050
I'm going upstairs.

847
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,561
Goddamn it,Joe.

848
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,944
The number you have dialed
has been changed.

849
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:40,115
The new number is unpublished
at the subscriber's request.

850
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,726
Get us checked in over there.

851
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,193
- Stick around. I'm getting a paper.
- All right.

852
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:25,202
Jesus, Joe,
that's U.S. Attorney Holtman.

853
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:28,789
The guy on the right.
What are we going to do?

854
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,459
Shut the fuck up.
I'll take care of it.

855
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:40,676
Anything goes wrong down there...

856
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:44,513
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?

857
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:47,474
I don't want to come down here
and iron anything out.

858
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,560
You got your plane tickets?

859
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:56,233
- Remember me? Southern District--
- What kind of fucking shit--

860
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,572
- What are you doing?
- Fucking grabbed my cock. What the fuck!

861
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:05,534
Shut up. He's working.
Keep your mouth shut.

862
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:08,495
Fucking degenerate bastard.
What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.

863
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:11,874
I want that club up and running. I don't
care how long it takes. Understand?

864
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:14,334
Here comes a fucking cop.
Get the hell outta here.

865
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:17,796
Have a safe trip.
You have the tickets and everything?

866
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:25,095
Get on the phone. Get me
on the next flight back. Understand?

867
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,015
Don't call me Joe again. I'll cut
your fucking throat. Understand?

868
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:30,058
You piece of shit.

869
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:07,471
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.

870
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:15,562
- Who made you?
- God made me.

871
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:19,107
- Why did God make you?
- God made me to show His goodness:

872
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,276
to make me happy
with Him in heaven.

873
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,321
- Where is God?
- God is everywhere.

874
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,163
Sweet dreams, angel.

875
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:17,249
I want a divorce.

876
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,213
He comes home at all hours
without announcing where he's been...

877
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,049
for the last three months.

878
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:30,554
You know what he does?
He rearranges the cabinets.

879
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,391
He remakes the bed.
He vacuums the entire house.

880
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:38,562
Do you know another man that vacuums?
It's abnormal.

881
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:42,816
Changing the phone number and not
telling your husband is pretty normal.

882
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,778
- I don't exist, you don't exist.
- So now I know how it feels.

883
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,989
Now I know how you feel.

884
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,742
I'll tell you something.
It felt good.

885
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,204
Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.

886
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:57,915
Now I know how it feels
to be strong.

887
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,211
- You love control, don't you?
- My God.

888
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:06,006
Just listen. Otherwise you just
play out the old pathology.

889
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,552
You were saying Joe leaves.

890
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:12,930
Yes, he leaves.

891
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:18,727
He leaves me with the house
and the kids...

892
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,647
and the bills,
but not a husband.

893
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:26,443
I want my husband.

894
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:34,159
What do you think
you're running from?

895
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:39,665
I ain't running from nothing.

896
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:45,838
You hear yourself?
The man I married was a college man.

897
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:50,300
Being the distancer forces Maggie
into the role of the pursuer.

898
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:52,761
This gives you a feeling of power.

899
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:58,141
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie
for fulfilling her intimacy needs--

900
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:01,270
I'm an undercover agent
for the FBl, Doctor.

901
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:04,106
You and your Mafia faggots
can go screw each other.

902
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:08,318
- I'm not doing it anymore.
- I hope you can help her out.

903
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:10,153
Obviously, she's very sick.
You can see that.

904
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:13,448
Obviously,
I'm the sick one.

905
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:15,617
- You.
- Now...

906
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:20,539
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
are Joe's intimacy days.

907
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:24,126
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday
are Maggie's.

908
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:28,463
Now, on your day,
you make an intimacy request.

909
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:31,175
" Rub my back" or...

910
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:34,595
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"

911
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:37,639
You sit around in your safe,
little, fucking house...

912
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:39,975
with your safe, little,
fucking station wagon...

913
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,186
and your safe, little friends.

914
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,813
You dream up the next hundred-dollar
head fuck.

915
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:47,816
- "Will you rub my back?" What a fazool.
- You're an animal.

916
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:50,110
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?

917
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,990
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?

918
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:57,034
It's very intimate.

919
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,536
He can take the bill he's sending me
and shove it up his ass.

920
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:02,122
You know why we went to him?

921
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:05,501
I was hoping he could find one
good reason for me not to leave you.

922
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,419
I don't have one anymore.

923
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,509
What? You gonna leave me?

924
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:17,054
You gonna leave me, Maggie?
You don't leave me.

925
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:30,692
- What's the matter?
- Where are you?

926
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:38,534
I'm in New York.
I had to come back. Why?

927
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:41,912
- It's Tommy.
- What happened?

928
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:45,165
Can you give your sister
some vegetables, honey? Thank you.

929
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:48,210
Not with your fingers, sweetie.
What else do you need?

930
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:57,594
We did fractions today in class,
you know?

931
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,930
Did you? Fractions?

932
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:04,017
- I got a 95 on my test.
- Of course you did.

933
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:14,236
- What's going on?
- Donnie, what are you doing here?

934
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,280
You belong in Florida.

935
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:18,490
I checked in with Annette
and she said something--

936
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:22,119
- You called her from Florida?
- I was here. I had some things to do.

937
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,788
You gotta go back. Come on.

938
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:27,499
What happened to him?
Will he be all right?

939
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:29,459
Do I know?

940
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:33,005
They got 1 2 diplomas on the wall,
and they can't tell you a thing.

941
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,050
Forget about it.
Tommy gets out of this Bellevue...

942
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,469
he'll go right back
to fucking up.

943
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,346
What did he do?
Did he overdose?

944
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:43,640
That ain't the question.

945
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,809
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

946
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:51,899
About five million tubes.
They have a machine breathing for him.

947
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:54,651
Where's the doctor?
You want me to talk to him?

948
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,155
You gonna break his legs?

949
01:18:58,197 --> 01:19:00,991
Do you want me to do something?
I'm here.

950
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:04,036
I want you to go back down
to Florida.

951
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:08,123
You belong to Sonny now.
Believe me.

952
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:09,791
I came to be with you.

953
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,086
- You're my man. I'm here for you.
- I don't want you here!

954
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:18,675
You and Tommy is both peas in a pod.
You don't listen.

955
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,762
You got your own ideas.

956
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:24,681
You do what you wanna do up on your
high horses. Everything's a joke.

957
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:35,859
- Get back to Florida. Get on a plane.
- I ain't going.

958
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,402
- Forget about it.
- Go on!

959
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:43,867
I'm staying.
You wanna kick the shit outta me?

960
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,869
I'm gonna be right here.
All right?

961
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:01,927
Twenty-eight years.

962
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:05,806
You can read it
on his birth certificate.

963
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:09,393
Bellevue Hospital.
Now he's back, in there.

964
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:13,730
I'm out here,
worried to my fucking death.

965
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:18,068
He's asleep in there,
same as 28 years ago.

966
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:22,531
With the same expression.
He's made no progress.

967
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:26,410
He ain't got no respect.

968
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:31,456
He's my son.

969
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:36,920
His heart stopped.

970
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:40,299
Like a watch.

971
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:43,177
That's what the doctor said.
Just like a watch.

972
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,220
They had to wind it back up.

973
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,307
Who knows?
Maybe next time...

974
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,769
they can't.

975
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:19,254
He'll be all right.

976
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:23,008
It'll be all right.

977
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:26,803
I love you, Donnie.

978
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:53,830
All right!

979
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,168
How you doing, Nicky?

980
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,925
Look at this place.
It's unbelievable.

981
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:06,969
- Beautiful.
- Feel lucky tonight.

982
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:08,637
Opening night.

983
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,265
This place is a goddamn palace,
for Christ's sake.

984
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:23,318
Terrific, Sonny.
I love it.

985
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:29,408
How you doing?
Having fun?

986
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,874
Let's try another one.
Again.

987
01:22:57,352 --> 01:22:58,812
I like it.

988
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:00,856
I like it big time.

989
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:15,412
Okay, Donnie,
this is the take.

990
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:17,581
- Put this bag someplace safe.
- All right.

991
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:19,124
Chicken taco.

992
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:34,598
Just turn real slow.

993
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:39,686
Is there a problem?

994
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:43,148
- What's your name, boy?
- Donnie Brasco. What's yours?

995
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:47,611
- Why are all you New York Guineas here?
- Your missus invited us.

996
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:56,495
Gentlemen, we're running a charity
event here. We have a permit.

997
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,705
You have a permit for the lion?

998
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:08,966
Break it up!

999
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,896
You fucking pig!

1000
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:38,537
I guess you didn't ever think
of paying these guys off, did you?

1001
01:24:38,662 --> 01:24:41,999
Where am I gonna get money
to bribe cops? Nobody authorized that.

1002
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:09,193
You know how fucking embarrassed
I am?

1003
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,946
The old man's people down here.

1004
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:17,576
I have to be in my house a year
with the shades drawn.

1005
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:25,417
Where's that bag?

1006
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:29,880
They got it.
They got everything.

1007
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,222
That's Rusty's money.

1008
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:45,729
- Sonny, I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

1009
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,607
Sit down.
Shut the fuck up.

1010
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:56,573
I gotta go back to New York
like this.

1011
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:58,742
Make this right with Rusty.

1012
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:03,288
Face that cock sucker
Sonny Red.

1013
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:06,250
You know,
I gotta say something.

1014
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,627
Usually, the cops
are so fucking dumb...

1015
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:12,256
it takes them three months
to get wind something's going on.

1016
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:17,761
Then they gotta get a warrant
and do their whatever with pictures--

1017
01:26:17,803 --> 01:26:20,639
- Surveillance.
- They gotta surveillance.

1018
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:24,768
Three months taking pictures.
All this time.

1019
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:27,104
How do these cops know so much?

1020
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:30,065
- We just opened the fucking doors.
- What are you saying?

1021
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:32,276
There's gotta be a snitch here.

1022
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:49,585
All right, so there's a snitch.
We find him.

1023
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,545
We cut his prick off.

1024
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:54,798
Leave it in his mouth.
Leave him on the street.

1025
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:08,937
- Did you bust it up good?
- We busted it up.

1026
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:11,356
He's out of business.
You understand?

1027
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,483
I'm listening.

1028
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:16,945
That punk is finished down here.
That's it.

1029
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:20,324
That's great.
I can't believe it.

1030
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:23,160
Look, I'll talk to you later.

1031
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:26,955
- Give me some of that cheese.
- They busted up the club.

1032
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:29,666
- Take this taste out of my mouth.
- There you go.

1033
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,169
Now he has to answer
for what happened.

1034
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:35,756
- You gonna send for him?
- He sits down with us...

1035
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:38,884
it's done.

1036
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:42,679
- The whole fucking crew.
- I'll dust off the guns.

1037
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:16,088
Napkins and tablecloths,
500 scoot.

1038
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:20,217
"500 scoot"?
Down in Florida, it's 500 an hour.

1039
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,886
You like it down there so much,
why don't you go buy some oranges?

1040
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,138
- What do you have, Bullfrog?
- Dime on the vig.

1041
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:29,768
I'm doing the best I can, Sonny.

1042
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:33,397
- What do you have, Nicky?
- I got a guy boosted 30 tickets...

1043
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:37,818
- to Chaka Khan at the Garden.
- What about Florida?

1044
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:41,738
I thought we weren't
supposed to talk about Florida.

1045
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:47,828
- You never got nothing going on?
- Nothing ever panned out for me.

1046
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:49,413
I couldn't catch a break.

1047
01:28:51,373 --> 01:28:53,250
What did I just say?

1048
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:09,433
Paulie, I got a truck load
of razor blades.

1049
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:11,894
What am I gonna do
with razor blades?

1050
01:29:11,935 --> 01:29:14,271
You know how many razor blades
fit in a truck?

1051
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:16,940
I got a guy who works
in the warehouse...

1052
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,026
has the art collection
of the Shah of Iran.

1053
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:21,987
A sit-down where?

1054
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:39,463
That was Sonny Red's guy. Wants
to have a sit-down in Little Italy.

1055
01:29:39,505 --> 01:29:41,298
I got sent for.

1056
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,678
Come on.

1057
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:58,357
Paulie, we'll take your car.

1058
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,319
That cocksucker Sonny Red
is gonna rub my nose in Florida...

1059
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:04,404
- because of a fucking rat!
- Forget about it.

1060
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,742
You ride up front.

1061
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:10,827
You know what to do
when you find that rat, Left?

1062
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:12,829
Maybe I found him already.

1063
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:22,464
Where we headed, Sonny?
Little Italy?

1064
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:27,010
Our guy says they got a stop
to make first. You know what I mean?

1065
01:31:08,844 --> 01:31:10,220
Let's go.

1066
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,398
Where you going?
Wait in the car.

1067
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:17,955
Come on.
We still gotta get downtown.

1068
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,624
- How long will this take?
- I got them in my laundry room.

1069
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:23,460
- The .22s?
- Bruno said you want the 9 millimeter.

1070
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,337
Meanwhile, where the fuck is he?

1071
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,632
In bed with some broad with more hair
on her lip than he's got on his head.

1072
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,801
- He's your kid.
- Don't remind me.

1073
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:32,678
You think that's funny?

1074
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,639
- I don't think that's so funny.
- All right.

1075
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,478
- You don't want to listen.
- That's not funny.

1076
01:32:41,603 --> 01:32:45,148
- A son should respect his father.
- You think that's funny?

1077
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:49,945
Shit. The bulb is out.
Watch your step, guys.

1078
01:32:49,987 --> 01:32:52,656
Big fucking surprise
from a fucking spider.

1079
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:56,326
- Nothing like Sonny Black's surprise.
- You can say that again.

1080
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:59,955
Put one right here.
He'll never know what hit him.

1081
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:03,500
- Goddamn right.
- I'll blow his brains right there.

1082
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:49,087
Come on!
Get him off!.

1083
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:52,549
- Get him off of me!
- Take my arm. Take my hand.

1084
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:56,428
Jesus Christ.

1085
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:01,850
Paulie, go get Donnie.

1086
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,288
What's going on?

1087
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:31,588
- Is everything all right?
- What?

1088
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,308
Get out.

1089
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:11,336
Get down there.

1090
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:16,550
The meek want to inherit the Earth,
they'll have to get in fucking line!

1091
01:35:27,019 --> 01:35:29,146
Look what I found.

1092
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:30,689
Them or us.

1093
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:35,319
- You got Big Trin.
- I'll get a hernia.

1094
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:39,072
Shut the fuck up.
Donnie will help you.

1095
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:47,039
Come on, Donnie.
Help me filet this fat fuck.

1096
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:07,851
All right, come on.
We got work to do.

1097
01:36:46,849 --> 01:36:49,560
There was a rat in Florida.

1098
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:56,733
- Nicky wasn't a rat.
- You don't mention his name, all right?

1099
01:36:56,859 --> 01:37:00,779
That's what we said.
We don't mention his name.

1100
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:03,323
Tell yourself
whatever you have to, Left.

1101
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:06,869
I'm not telling myself.
You was down there.

1102
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:09,788
- You have eyes.
- After 20 years, you whack him...

1103
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:11,915
just like that over a lounge?

1104
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,753
- That's beautiful.
- The man held out on a coke deal.

1105
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:19,423
What does one thing
got to do with the other?

1106
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:21,967
He could have got whacked out
just for that, for your information.

1107
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:25,429
- There wasn't a rat in Florida.
- There was a rat.

1108
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:31,059
- Richie fucked up paying off the cops.
- What do you mean?

1109
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:33,729
That's why the club got busted.
Richie didn't pay off the cops.

1110
01:37:36,356 --> 01:37:38,734
Nicky didn't have anything
to do with it.

1111
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:41,570
You don't mention his name.
That's the rules.

1112
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:44,281
- Fuck the rules.
- That's the rules, Donnie.

1113
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:51,246
- Say his name.
- Come on.

1114
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:53,957
Come on. Nicky.

1115
01:37:54,124 --> 01:37:56,460
Say " Nicky."

1116
01:37:56,585 --> 01:37:59,963
You can't say his name because
you know I'm right. Say it!

1117
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:04,009
Say his name!

1118
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:08,847
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.

1119
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,978
Who the fuck am l?

1120
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:19,650
Who am l?

1121
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:24,655
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

1122
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:28,992
And so was he and so are you.

1123
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:34,331
Quit riding the brake.

1124
01:38:58,021 --> 01:38:59,398
Boss.

1125
01:39:10,325 --> 01:39:12,369
Congratulations.

1126
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:34,558
- Oh, God.
- Everything's okay, Maggie.

1127
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:38,896
If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?

1128
01:39:39,021 --> 01:39:41,231
Mind if we come inside,
Mrs. Pistone?

1129
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:43,483
I'm not sure. That depends.

1130
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:46,570
Standard procedure is that
he checks in with us every day.

1131
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:50,657
- Maybe he misses a day or two, but--
- It was three weeks ago.

1132
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:54,578
I want you to tell me
where my husband is.

1133
01:39:57,873 --> 01:40:01,084
- I demand that you tell me!
- We can't because we don't know.

1134
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:05,422
If he gets in touch with you,
you have to talk sense into him.

1135
01:40:05,506 --> 01:40:07,799
Mrs. Pistone, please help us.

1136
01:40:07,883 --> 01:40:11,094
You want me to help you?

1137
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,765
You want me to help the FBI
that used my husband and sucked him dry?

1138
01:40:18,185 --> 01:40:20,771
You don't care whether
he's dead or alive, do you?

1139
01:40:20,896 --> 01:40:23,148
You want him to follow procedure.

1140
01:40:23,232 --> 01:40:25,275
Follow procedure
so you can cover your asses.

1141
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:29,279
There is a war going on in the Mafia
family where Joe is undercover.

1142
01:40:29,404 --> 01:40:31,907
Three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered.

1143
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:36,119
He's right in the line of fire
because he's one of them.

1144
01:40:36,245 --> 01:40:40,499
Who he's with and who he's close to--
They're all the top dogs now.

1145
01:40:42,584 --> 01:40:46,630
- It's not a problem we anticipated.
- We have got to pull him out.

1146
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:50,008
You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.

1147
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:52,052
You think so?

1148
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,308
He was here a week ago.

1149
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:03,480
He snuck into the house
after I was asleep.

1150
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:09,528
He didn't even wake me up,
didn't even say hello to me.

1151
01:41:13,407 --> 01:41:16,159
He came to get his sport coat.

1152
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:32,718
Let's take a walk.
Come on.

1153
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:39,349
What are we doing?

1154
01:41:39,474 --> 01:41:43,395
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.

1155
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:50,777
Here it is. Sonny Red's kid,
Bruno, has disappeared.

1156
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:56,366
As long as he's on the loose,
ain't none of us safe.

1157
01:41:56,491 --> 01:42:00,370
- Right?
- You got no idea where the guy is?

1158
01:42:00,495 --> 01:42:04,917
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He'll turn up somewhere.

1159
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:10,005
Anyway, we got the contract.

1160
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:16,428
Now, this thing gets done right...

1161
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:20,390
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.

1162
01:42:20,516 --> 01:42:23,602
You know what that means?

1163
01:42:23,727 --> 01:42:25,312
What?

1164
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:30,776
- It means I can't fuck it up.
- You read my mind.

1165
01:42:30,859 --> 01:42:34,488
- You can't fuck it up.
- I won't fuck it up.

1166
01:42:40,536 --> 01:42:42,788
You'll be a made guy, Donnie.

1167
01:42:45,374 --> 01:42:47,251
All right.

1168
01:42:50,295 --> 01:42:53,590
Come on.
Let's go back inside!

1169
01:42:58,804 --> 01:43:00,264
What?

1170
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:05,102
I'm freezing here!

1171
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:12,985
You know that boat
you used to have?

1172
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:15,112
The boat?
What about it?

1173
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:20,284
How much is a boat like that?
What doyou think?

1174
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:23,453
You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300 used.

1175
01:43:23,537 --> 01:43:25,998
Why are you asking me
about boats?

1176
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:29,126
- I was just curious.
- You're curious about boats?

1177
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:31,795
It's ten degrees out here.
I'm freezing.

1178
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,465
You're asking me about boats
after what we just said?

1179
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:39,303
- You losing your marbles on me?
- I'm all right.

1180
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:43,348
Don't ask questions like that.
That's crazy.

1181
01:43:43,432 --> 01:43:47,436
You hit this cocksucker and leave him
in the street. Come on.

1182
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:53,377
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

1183
01:44:53,502 --> 01:44:55,629
I'm looking for something.
I'll be right in.

1184
01:44:56,797 --> 01:44:58,340
That won't work anymore.

1185
01:45:01,635 --> 01:45:05,222
- Where is it?
- There's $300,000 in that bag.

1186
01:45:06,515 --> 01:45:11,937
- How do you know?
- I counted it.

1187
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:15,065
You counted it?

1188
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:17,901
- It's none of your business.
- Stop it.

1189
01:45:17,985 --> 01:45:20,946
It's in my house. Who would believe
it wasn't my business?

1190
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:23,448
I want that fucking bag.

1191
01:45:23,532 --> 01:45:28,078
FBI men do not walk around
with $300,000 in a bag.

1192
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:31,623
- Joe, you could go to jail for this.
- Fuck! Nobody's going to jail.

1193
01:45:31,665 --> 01:45:34,626
Did you think
about your children for a second?

1194
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:36,753
- You don't know what you're saying.
- I don't?

1195
01:45:36,837 --> 01:45:40,799
- The bag belongs to somebody else.
- Does it? Who?

1196
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:44,761
- Just some fucked-up guy.
- A fucked-up guy needs $300,000?

1197
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:48,056
That's right.
Where's the goddamn bag? Shit!

1198
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:50,434
You're becoming like them.

1199
01:46:29,932 --> 01:46:34,478
You know how I make it
through my days?

1200
01:46:34,603 --> 01:46:38,649
I pretend I'm a widow
with medals and scrapbooks...

1201
01:46:38,774 --> 01:46:40,317
and memories.

1202
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:45,572
I pretend you're dead.
That's how my life makes sense to me.

1203
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,369
Go away. Stay away.

1204
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,179
Why do you hate me
when I love you so much?

1205
01:47:14,643 --> 01:47:17,688
You think I hate you?

1206
01:47:17,813 --> 01:47:19,690
I don't hate you.

1207
01:47:25,946 --> 01:47:28,699
This job is eating me alive.

1208
01:47:28,824 --> 01:47:30,868
I can't breathe anymore.

1209
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:37,040
If I come out,
this guy Lefty dies.

1210
01:47:39,126 --> 01:47:44,006
They'll kill him because he vouched
for me, because he stood up for me.

1211
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:48,385
I live with that every day.

1212
01:47:50,012 --> 01:47:52,973
That's the same thing as if I put
the bullet in his head myself.

1213
01:47:55,684 --> 01:48:00,606
I spent all these years trying
to be the good guy in the white hat.

1214
01:48:02,024 --> 01:48:03,734
For what?

1215
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:08,071
For nothing.

1216
01:48:12,534 --> 01:48:15,913
I'm not becoming like them.
I am them.

1217
01:48:56,411 --> 01:49:00,541
- Where you been?
- Look...

1218
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:02,960
- I gotta see you.
- You're right.

1219
01:49:03,085 --> 01:49:05,796
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?

1220
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:09,091
- He's on a boat on Staten Island.
- I'll pick you up.

1221
01:49:09,174 --> 01:49:12,219
We don't have time.
You meet me there.

1222
01:49:36,285 --> 01:49:39,329
Bruno's here.
He's down the end of the pier.

1223
01:49:40,956 --> 01:49:44,376
We'll wait here
while he has his drink.

1224
01:49:44,459 --> 01:49:47,880
Let him get a little sleepy.

1225
01:49:47,963 --> 01:49:51,842
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?

1226
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:56,889
Nice.

1227
01:49:56,972 --> 01:50:01,351
Forget about it.
One thing I know is boats.

1228
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:05,189
I'd like to pop him, throw him
in the water, take the fucking boat.

1229
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:12,863
You said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again...

1230
01:50:12,946 --> 01:50:17,034
you'd drive down to the pier
with Annette and just go.

1231
01:50:17,117 --> 01:50:20,579
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody 'd ever find you.

1232
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:24,041
That was before.
Don't remind me about that now.

1233
01:50:24,166 --> 01:50:27,085
- I'm just saying--
- I don't want to think about that.

1234
01:50:27,127 --> 01:50:29,713
Did you mean it?

1235
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:33,175
Am I Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?

1236
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:38,889
- I'm saying, what if?
- What if.

1237
01:50:39,014 --> 01:50:43,936
I got a couple jewel things
going on the side there.

1238
01:50:43,977 --> 01:50:45,938
Maybe I could get the money
for you.

1239
01:50:50,025 --> 01:50:53,570
- You'll find money for me to get a boat?
- Maybe.

1240
01:50:55,531 --> 01:50:57,491
That would be real generous.

1241
01:50:57,574 --> 01:51:03,288
What if I could hand you
a bagful ofmoney right now?

1242
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:05,582
You know what I'm saying?

1243
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:10,671
You could leave this life.
You said it yourself, Left.

1244
01:51:10,754 --> 01:51:14,508
You don't move up. Every day
you're looking over your shoulder.

1245
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:16,718
- Listen to me.
- No more bullshit.

1246
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:20,138
- Get out of this life, Left.
- I'm gonna show you something.

1247
01:51:20,222 --> 01:51:23,767
- What?
- I want you to look at it carefully.

1248
01:51:25,394 --> 01:51:30,148
Then I want you to think
very carefully...

1249
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:32,943
about what you say to me.

1250
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:39,283
That's a federal boat.

1251
01:51:49,084 --> 01:51:52,045
- I don't think that's the same boat--
- That's the same boat.

1252
01:51:52,129 --> 01:51:56,300
It's got the name on it.
The Left Hand. Like my name.

1253
01:51:58,093 --> 01:52:00,262
That's that Abscam boat.

1254
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:07,811
You think I knew that was a federal
boat? You think I'm a fucking rat?

1255
01:52:09,104 --> 01:52:12,274
How many times I have you
into my own house?

1256
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:19,156
- Twice a week, at least. Why?
- There it is.

1257
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:22,951
I cook for you.

1258
01:52:24,453 --> 01:52:27,497
If I had any money,
I'd give you--

1259
01:52:27,623 --> 01:52:30,501
I never had any money,
but if ever I had...

1260
01:52:30,626 --> 01:52:33,545
a hundred bucks in my pocket,
I'd give you fifty.

1261
01:52:35,631 --> 01:52:38,675
- You did.
- If you're a rat--

1262
01:52:49,144 --> 01:52:53,732
If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
mutt in the history of the Mafia.

1263
01:52:53,815 --> 01:52:56,360
Even if this thing
is a federal boat, Left...

1264
01:52:58,654 --> 01:53:00,113
they scam all the others.

1265
01:53:00,197 --> 01:53:02,824
They didn't scam us.
You know what I'm saying?

1266
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:08,288
We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.

1267
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:14,711
How do you know
that we walked away from it?

1268
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:17,589
We're sitting here, right?

1269
01:53:17,673 --> 01:53:23,220
They tried to outsmart us, but we
out smarted them. We beat the agents.

1270
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:30,811
You gotta believe me.

1271
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,078
Let's go do this work.

1272
01:53:48,203 --> 01:53:50,080
Get this over with.

1273
01:53:56,679 --> 01:54:00,453
I push him in a bag.

1274
01:54:01,319 --> 01:54:02,443
Don't freeze up.

1275
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:04,364
Will you freeze up?

1276
01:54:04,598 --> 01:54:06,726
- Not a guy is freeze up.

1277
01:54:07,078 --> 01:54:10,089
- Did I say you were a rat?
I can't believe I said that

1278
01:54:10,237 --> 01:54:11,682
- Forget about it.

1279
01:54:12,476 --> 01:54:15,487
I'll never say you're a rat.
I'm your best friend.

1280
01:54:17,916 --> 01:54:19,922
All right. Let's go do this thing.

1281
01:55:01,502 --> 01:55:03,332
Come on, Donnie.
Come on.

1282
01:55:16,753 --> 01:55:18,848
#FBI! Freeze! #

1283
01:55:20,843 --> 01:55:21,487
Shit!

1284
01:55:25,666 --> 01:55:26,824
Don't say nothing, Donnie.

1285
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:35,763
Don't tell nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing.

1286
01:55:35,742 --> 01:55:39,244
- It'll be all right
- Fuck you. I'm not coming you.

1287
01:55:39,421 --> 01:55:40,915
You'll be out in 24 hours.

1288
01:55:42,038 --> 01:55:42,819
You're all right.

1289
01:55:43,838 --> 01:55:46,735
- It's over, men.
- Don't say nothing to them, Donnie.

1290
01:55:47,553 --> 01:55:48,349
It's over, Joe.

1291
01:55:52,562 --> 01:55:57,915
#Urgent. A exécuter sur-le-champ#

1292
01:55:59,226 --> 01:56:02,984
#L'opération D. Brasco est terminée#

1293
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,743
#Je répète: terminée#

1294
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:33,788
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco.

1295
01:56:34,281 --> 01:56:35,502
That's not his real name.

1296
01:56:37,784 --> 01:56:40,233
Thruthfully he has been an FBI agent all along.

1297
01:56:44,186 --> 01:56:46,872
You can contact me here,
if you wanna talk.

1298
01:57:37,658 --> 01:57:39,219
Could believe those fucking guys?

1299
01:57:41,007 --> 01:57:42,374
There's no way Donnie is an agent.

1300
01:57:44,595 --> 01:57:45,877
It's a bluff.

1301
01:57:47,379 --> 01:57:49,838
They bow theirselves. They set the bow up.

1302
01:57:50,717 --> 01:57:52,385
Don't think Donnie is a rat

1303
01:57:58,180 --> 01:57:59,439
What it sets me doing,

1304
01:58:01,371 --> 01:58:02,481
It ain't not Donnie.

1305
01:58:05,647 --> 01:58:07,304
Right. It ain't not Donnie.

1306
01:58:30,887 --> 01:58:35,088
#Hyenas kills many young cheetas
and more than one could even overcome#

1307
01:58:34,968 --> 01:58:35,600
# the mother. #

1308
01:59:04,618 --> 01:59:06,224
- What's up to me?
- No.

1309
01:59:10,282 --> 01:59:11,236
- I gotta go see.

1310
01:59:11,846 --> 01:59:12,774
- So late?

1311
01:59:13,883 --> 01:59:14,763
What am i gonna do?

1312
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:17,526
Who knows?

1313
01:59:18,878 --> 01:59:22,116
Don't wait up for me tonight.
I don't know how long it'll gonna be.

1314
01:59:22,779 --> 01:59:23,611
And listen to me...

1315
01:59:29,845 --> 01:59:30,764
If Donnie calls-

1316
01:59:32,762 --> 01:59:33,580
- tell him...

1317
01:59:39,801 --> 01:59:40,945
if it's gonna be anyone,

1318
01:59:42,863 --> 01:59:44,325
I'm going up to see him.

1319
01:59:45,388 --> 01:59:50,740
- All right? You look beautiful. Goodbye
- Bye, Ben.

1320
02:01:38,963 --> 02:01:40,463
Excuse me, mrs. Pistone.

1321
02:01:48,606 --> 02:01:50,032
To FBI-agent Joseph D. Pistone,

1322
02:01:53,856 --> 02:01:57,529
in grateful recognition of meritorial service,
allow me to present

1323
02:01:58,293 --> 02:02:01,564
this medal
and this check for 500 dollars.

1324
02:02:03,876 --> 02:02:05,109
- Congratulations again, son.

1325
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:06,552
- Congratulations, Joe.

1326
02:02:09,443 --> 02:02:11,395
- Take good care of him.
- I will.

1327
02:02:49,414 --> 02:02:53,387
Joe...
It's over.

1328
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:57,269
Come on, honey.
Come home.
