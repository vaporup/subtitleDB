Mm.

3
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,325
I had a beautiful dream.

4
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,788
We had two little children.

5
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,832
Twins.

6
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:08,379
If we have children,
would you like it if they were twins?

7
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,923
Mmm. Mm-hm.

8
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,591
Yeah.

9
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,885
Twins.

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,888
Sure, why not?

11
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,266
One for each of us.

12
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,065
Mm.

Morning, Donny.

29
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,465
Ready to roll, Paterson?

30
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,591
Yeah.

31
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,750
Yeah, but you gotta
know more, tell me.

32
00:06:57,377 --> 00:07:01,338
Well, Hurricane Carter,
he was a famous boxer.

33
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:05,384
And he lived right back there.
Paterson, baby.

34
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:08,470
He looked just like
Denzel Washington, too.

35
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,680
They locked him up.

36
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,182
Why'd they lock him up?

37
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,851
They say he shot some people up

38
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,145
with a shotgun in a bar and all that.

39
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,398
I know he didn't do it.

40
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,400
Then they finally let him out, right?

41
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,694
Yo, years later, though. But yeah.

42
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,406
You think before all that,
Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?

43
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,491
I don't know.

44
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,877
What are you gonna
be for Halloween?

45
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,088
My mom found this picture
on Instagram

46
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,758
of these kids, they were shadows.

47
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,428
So they crept up next to kids, other kids,

48
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,846
and they used to spook 'em out

49
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,973
and look like shadows.

50
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,100
One year, I was actually a subway surfer.

51
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,852
You can buy that one?

52
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,104
Um, no, I built it.

Because of the bake sale
this weekend, I thought that

89
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,286
if my cupcakes sell really well,

90
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:04,372
it might be kind of a sign.

91
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,458
Sign of what, honey?

92
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,627
My dream!

93
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:11,296
To have my own cupcake business, of
course.

94
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,632
Oh, that'd be nice.

95
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,765
- Thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

96
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,768
I made these myself. What do you think?

97
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,020
Oooh, yeah. That's really good.

98
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,189
I painted them.

99
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,025

a really great sandwich.

Good. I'm glad.

103
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,793
Did you get a little writing done?

104
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,090
I did, yeah.

00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,552
You know, darling,

106
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,348
I really think you should do something
about those beautiful poems.

107
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,350
They should belong to the world, you know?

108
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,561

Well, now you're trying to scare me.

109
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,565
I am not! I'm serious, you big dumbbell.

110
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,244
Do you think having such wonderful feet
helps you as a bus driver?

00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,876
Mmm, yeah, maybe.

113
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,921

114
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,632

115
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,429
- Just remember.
- What?

116
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,056
Cupcakes. We could be rich from cupcakes.

118
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,977

- Got him right here, baby.

166
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,664

00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,421
My car needs a transmission job.

187
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,964
My wife wants me to take her to Florida.

188
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,758
But I'm behind on the mortgage payments.

189
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,468
My uncle called from India
and he needs money

190
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,428
for my niece's wedding,
and I got this strange rash

191
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,181
on my back - you name it, brother.

192
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,767
- How 'bout you?
- I'm OK.

193
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,478
- OK, well, have a nice day.
- OK, you too.

194
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,022
Yeah. I doubt it.

195
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,269
You know the...
that cute little brunette

196
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,812
from the, uh, from the doughnut place?

197
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,689
Yeah, yeah. She's pretty hot.

198
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,816
Yeah. Turns out
she lives in my neighbourhood.

199
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,359
Yeah. The other day,
I come home from work.

200
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm, you know, tired,
I'm having a beer, all right?

201
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,905
I hear a knock at the door.

202
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,782
- I open it and it's her!
- Really? Oh, man!

203
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,618
She is all made up,
looking, like, really good.

204
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,994
So what happened?

205
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,704
Well, we just talked there at the door

206
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,832
for like a while, you know,
and she was, like, laughing a lot.

207
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,961
She was, you know,
making eye contact, you know...

208
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,756
- I... She wanted to hang out.
- So then what?

209
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,550
Well, we just, you know, we had,
like, a really nice conversation

210
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,885
and then, you know,

211
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,596
I-I-I was really tired and everything.

212
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,724
I hadn't really showered or anything,
so she left.

213
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:07,892
She left?

214
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,353
Yeah, but you know...

215
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,021
I mean, I know what she wanted. Right?

216
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:15,107
Yeah. Yeah, for-for sure, Jimmy.

217
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,734
These females are outta control.

218
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,278
- Right.
- You know?

219
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,450
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,994
They're out of control.

221
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:37,880
Yeah. Well, I-I had a similar thing
happen last week, man.

222
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,548
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, check this out.

223
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,842
I'm at Larry's barbecue party
on Sunday, right?

224
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:45,054
- Larry had a barbecue?
- Yeah, the barbecue party.

225
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,099
And, uh, I'm just standing out there
on the deck, right?

226
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,475
And I'd already eaten a lot,

227
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,477
and I'm just having a beer, right?

228
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,606
And you know that blonde friend
of Larry's girlfriend, um, Rita?

229
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,233
- I'm not sure you met her.
- I don't know Rita.

230
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,735
Well, she is, like, super hot! Right?

231
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,487
- Oh, yeah.
- And just like, stacked too.

232
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,156
Just beautiful curves. Like an animal.

233
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,075
And, you know, she comes over to me

234
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,952
and she asks me what I'm doing later!

235
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,371
- All right.
- Yeah, right?

236
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,081
Yeah, so we talk for a little while.

237
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,917
And, uh, she was like,
really flirtatious too, man.

238
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,377
- OK.
- You know. Yeah.

239
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,588
And finished my beer, and, oh, man, you know,

240
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,674
I had to get up early
for work the next morning

241
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,717
and all that, so...

242
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:23,968
- You split?
- Yeah.

243
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,720
Yeah.

244
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,471
But it was... it was cool, though.

245
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:32,476
Uh, I mean, I knew
exactly what she wanted, right.

246
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,355
And I got her number, too.
She gave me her number.

247
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,816
So did you call her?

248
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,027
No, not yet. No. Mm-mm.

249
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,029
No, cos I figured I'd wait a couple of days.

250
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,363
- All right.
- You know.

251
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,700
- OK.
- But I should call her, though.

252
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,161
- Yeah.
- I should.

253
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,459
You, uh, you workin'
late tonight?

254
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,044
Yeah.

255
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,339
- Yeah, I need the overtime.
- Yeah, me too.

256
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,211
<i>Another One.</i>

257
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,422
<i>When you're a child,</i>

258
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,007
<i>you learn there are three dimensions -</i>

259
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>height, width and depth.</i>

260
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,557
<i>Like a shoebox.</i>

261
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,017
<i>Then later, you hear</i>

262
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,187
<i>there's a fourth dimension -</i>

263
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,189
<i>time.</i>

264
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,400
<i>Hmm.</i>

265
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,402
<i>Then some say</i>

266
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,988
<i>there can be five...</i>

267
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,908
<i>six, seven...</i>

268
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,953
Are you OK down here, honey?

269
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,414
Uh, yeah.

270
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,916
Yeah, I'm finished for now.

271
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:27,151
Now, darling...

272
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,236
you have two important things
to talk about before

273
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,530
you and Marvin go out for your walk.

274
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,283
Oh, OK. Two important things.

275
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,410
One's about you and one is about me.

276
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,330
OK.

277
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:43,375
One is about your writing,
and you know what it is.

278
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,919
Oh.

279
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,005
Please. Please make some copies.

280
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,258
You know that I know
that your poetry is really, really good.

281
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,093
And that some day, you might just decide

282
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,471
to let the world get to read it.

283
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,515
- Laura, I really don't...
- No.

284
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,352
Look me in the eye for a second.
Look me in the eye.

285
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,481
You are a great poet.

286
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,277
All your poems
are still in that one notebook.

287
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,320
Your secret notebook.

288
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,322
My secret notebook, yeah.

289
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,033
So will you finally just go

290
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,660
to the Xerox place or something?

291
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,496
Please. Just do it.

292
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,082
It would take about ten minutes
to make a copy

293
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,959
of your entire secret notebook.

294
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,669
Well, I think it'd take
a little longer than ten minutes.

295
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,255
OK. OK. 15 or 20 minutes.

296
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,382
I would even do it for you.

297
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,135
Baby, I've been asking for a year, at least.

298
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,221
Yeah, you have.

299
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,725
Well, maybe I can do it this weekend.

300
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,854
You promise?

301
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,192
Y-Yeah, OK.

302
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:53,862
Thank you. I'll feel so much better.

303
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,453
What was the...
What was the thing about you?

304
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,163
Well, it's not

305
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,625
as important as that, but...

306
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,961
I've been thinkin' about music lately,

307
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,589
and, and then I saw this guitar

308
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,967
on YouTube that Esteban demonstrates.

309
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,679
And it's in black and white.
It's called the Harlequin.

310
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,682
And it's so fantastic that I think I really need

311
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,268
to learn to play the guitar.

312
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,186
And it comes with... comes with lessons

313
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,896
and DVDs and instructions,

314
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,232
so in no time at all, I could be playing away

315
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,651
and realising my dream.

316
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,528
I-I... Which dream is this?

317
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,365
Don't be silly. To be a country singer.

318
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,535
Maybe even a big star,
like one of the greats

319
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,330
like Tammy Wynette

320
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,915
or... or Patsy Cline.

321
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,835
And I can wear black and white

322
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,213
and have my own distinctive style.

323
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,342
I have a very strong visual style,
as you know.

324
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,053
Yes, you... Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

325
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,264
Yeah, definitely.

326
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,601
Well, y-you really need this guitar?

327
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,479
Oh, yes. And they say it's so important

328
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,106
to learn new things as you get older.

329
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:16,236
And, well, music, you just don't know
where it could lead.

330
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:21,408
And it's only a few hundred dollars.

331
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,786
I know it's expensive, but we can pay

332
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,831
a little each month
and free two-day shipping.

333
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,209
A few hundred dollars?

334
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,213
It comes with lessons,
instruction books, a tuner

335
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:38,884
and, um, extra strings
and a hard case and everything.

336
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:42,430
Well, I think, um, maybe...

337
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:49,311
Maybe you could be, uh,
a country singer some day.

338
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,354
- Really?
- Yeah.

339
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,022
I wouldn't put it past you.

340
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,692
Oh, honey, thank you!

341
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,653
Thank you. I love you.

342
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:05,285
And I love you too, handsome.

343
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,830
Who's going out with Daddy?

344
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,874
Who is my good boy going out with Daddy?

345
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,668
Marvin's going out with Daddy.

346
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,046
Yes. Who is going out with Daddy?

347
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,633
Yes, good boy. Good boy.

348
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,442
Oh, look at that. Look at that right there.

349
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,195
That's cute, right? That's an actual creature.

350
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,414
Hey, yo!

351
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,751
Yo, my man, let me holler
at you for a minute!

352
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,086
Hey, yo, that's
a English bulldog, right?

353
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,505
Uh, yeah.

354
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,258
Yo, I told you, man.
Them dogs are poppin' right now.

355
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,510
Yo, that dog mad expensive, right?

356
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,804
Yeah, well...

357
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,347
expensive to feed.

358
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,599
You hear this guy, yo?

359
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,184
Nah, I feel you, though, but, man,

360
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,103
dogs like that get jacked,
y'know what I mean?

361
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,440
Like, dog-jacked, my G. You feel me?

362
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,487
Oooh, hear that little guy, man?

363
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,490
Dog-jacked?

364
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,241
Well, it gives me something
to look forward to, then, I guess.

365
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,535
All right, money.

366
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,287
Hey, yo, be safe out here, a'right?

367
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,457
And cuff that dog. It's real out here, bro.

368
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,292
All right.

369
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,595
I'm gonna cuff you, Marvin.

370
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,651
OK, Marvin. Don't get dog-jacked.

371
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,453
Paterson, I got something weird.

372
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:15,290
- Maybe for the wall. Maybe...
- What's this?

373
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,543
You know this cat? Iggy Pop?

374
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,545
Oh, yeah, Iggy and the Stooges.

375
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,464
"Paterson, New Jersey
Teenage Girls' Club

376
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:25,676
"names singer Iggy Pop world's sexiest
man."

377
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,971
- "June, 1970."
- Does it go up?

378
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,641
Uh, yeah. Sure, why not? It's Paterson.

379
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,226
All right.

380
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,814
All right. Iggy Pop on the wall.

381
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,983
- Iggy.
- Hey, Doc?

382
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,609
Who's that, who's that,
right next to Uncle Floyd

383
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,361
holding the guitar?

384
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,488
I finally got you. Well, that's new.

385
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,032
But that's Uncle Floyd Vivino's
little brother Jimmy.

386
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,535
He's a band leader
on the Conan O'Brien show.

387
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,496
That's a little past my bedtime.

388
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,082
Hey, Marie. Another ginger ale?

389
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,252
- Thanks, Doc.
- You know Paterson, right?

390
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,505
Umm, not really, but...
we've seen each other.

391
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,216
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey-hey-hey, Marie.

392
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,052
- You drive the bus, right?
- Yeah, I do.

393
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:12,180
Your name really Paterson,
or they just nickname you that?

394
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:16,560
Uh, no, my real name is Paterson.

395
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,811
Well, that's kind of crazy, right?

396
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,856
Yeah. Right.

397
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,651
Oh, shit.

398
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,487
Everett still not gettin' it.

399
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,323
Not yet, the numbskull.

400
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,367
I've been breaking up with him
for two weeks now.

401
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,827
What am I gonna do?

402
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,579
Marie, baby, I need to talk to you.

403
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,788
- No!
- Please.

404
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,290
Just talk to me for a few minutes.

405
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,459
No, Everett. We've talked enough.

406
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,545
- More than enough.
- Please.

407
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,721
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey, Everett.

408
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,224
Thanks, Doc.

409
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,576
Man, what would you do?

410
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,413
You love somebody...

411
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,292
more than anything
in the whole damn world.

412
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,879
You... worship her.

413
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,424
You don't wanna be alive without her

414
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:34,097
and... she says she doesn't want you.

415
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,642
You're just...

416
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,063
dirt.

417
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,904
Damn, brother. You should be an actor.

418
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,451
I am an actor.

419
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:10,590
Oh, yeah, that's... that's real funny.

420
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:14,678
A man dying of heartbreak.
That... that's hilarious.

421
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,350
No. We are sympathetic.

422
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:24,564
Have another drink, Everett, on the house.

423
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,818
Thanks.

424
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,194
Good morning.

425
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,916
- You up?
- Uh-uh.

426
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,118
<i>Another One.</i>

427
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,828
<i>When you're a child,</i>

428
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,372
<i>you learn there are three dimensions -</i>

429
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,917
<i>height, width, and depth.</i>

430
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,086
<i>Like a shoebox.</i>

431
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:56,339
<i>Then, later, you hear
there's a fourth dimension -</i>

432
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,217
<i>time.</i>

433
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,845
<i>Hmm...</i>

434
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:06,267
<i>Then some say
there can be five, six, seven...</i>

435
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,812
<i>I knock off work,</i>

436
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,607
<i>have a beer at the bar.</i>

437
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,903
<i>I look down at the glass and feel glad.</i>

438
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,513
All right, watch out, watch out, watch out...

439
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,352
<i>Poem.</i>

440
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,104
<i>I'm in the house.</i>

441
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,773
<i>It's nice out.</i>

442
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,191
<i>Warm.</i>

443
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,569
<i>Sun on cold snow.</i>

444
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,947
<i>First day of spring</i>

445
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,658

446
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,369
<i>My legs run up the stairs</i>

447
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,746

448
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:55,126
<i>my top half here writing.</i>

449
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,076
- Hello, darling!
- Hello, honey.

450
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,705
- I'm painting!
- Hello, Marvin.

451
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,292
I see that.

452
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,423
What do you think?

453
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,218
Doesn't it make everything more
interesting?

454
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,973
- Yeah, it's very interesting.
- How was your day?

455
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,893
Eh, the usual.

456
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,063
Get any writing done?

457
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,982
I did, a little, yeah.

458
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,695
I'm working on a poem for you.

459
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,658
A love poem?

460
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:13,536
Yeah, I guess if it's for you, it's a love poem.

461
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:17,957
It's kind of inspired by our,
uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.

462
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,459
Really?

463
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,711
Does it mention the little megaphone shape

464
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,213
the letters make?

465
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:26,257
Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.

466
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,343
How beautiful.

467
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,346
I can't wait to read it when it's done.

468
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,518
I also painted new shower curtains.
You should see them.

469
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,062
Oh, OK.

470
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,108
You know what else I did today?

471
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,818
You, uh, planted an unusual

472
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,277
vegetable garden in the back yard?

473
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,030
No, silly! That you have to do in the spring.

474
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,990
- Oh.
- No, I ordered my present

475
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,201
that's from you.

476
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:54,911
P-present that's from me? What?

477
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,789
The guitar! The Esteban Harlequin model.

478
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,165
- Oh.
- I'm so excited.

479
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,750
It comes in two days.

480
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,753
I didn't get to speak to Esteban
on the phone, though.

481
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,172
Well, I'm sure he's really busy, honey.

482
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:09,467
Don't make fun of me. Hey, look out, though,

483
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,178
cos Nashville, here I come!

484
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,013

00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,932

486

We're having something new!

487
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,770
- What is it?
- Quinoa!

488
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:24,357
It's like a grain, sort of like couscous,

489
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:25,859
but different.

490
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,944
I read that it came from the ancient Incas.

491
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:30,071
A-And it's really good for you.

492
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,282

535
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,300
First, he goes out and gets a bazooka,
puts the bazooka on his shoulder.

536
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,552
He walks out there, the bear comes up,

537
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:42,722
taps him on the shoulders and says...
you don't come here.

538
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:26,410
I like how you smell
when you come home at night.

539
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:31,290
- What do I smell like?
- Mmm.

540
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:36,211
You smell faintly of...

541
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:39,631
of beer.

542
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,651
Mmm.

543
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,998
How do you say his name
again? It's like Gae-tan...

544
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,250
<i>- </i> It's Gaetano Bresci.
- That sounds interesting.

545
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,503
Yeah, he, um, he co-founded
this anarchist newspaper here

546
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,923
in Paterson, but it was in Italian, um,

547
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:29,216
called <i>La Questione Sociale.</i>

548
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,636
<i>- La Questione Sociale.</i>
- Yeah.

549
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:33,971
He was born in Italy,
but he lived here.

550
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,599
He was a weaver, an anarchist weaver.

551
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,560
This was in the 1890s.

552
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,854
And at that time in Italy,
people were starving.

553
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:44,065
When they demonstrated,
this Italian general

554
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:46,817
had them fired upon with,
like, muskets and cannons,

555
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,612
which, of course,
resulted in a bloody massacre

556
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:51,739
with, like, a hundred people dead.

557
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,616
Was Gaetano Bresci there?

558
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,618
No, he was here in Paterson.

559
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,912
But when he heard that the King of Italy,

560
00:49:57,913 --> 00:49:59,538
King Umberto the First,

561
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,957
decorated this fucking general

562
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,376
for bravely defending his royal house,

563
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:05,461
Gaetano Bresci went over to Italy somehow

564
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,798
and he shot Umberto the First
four times with a revolver.

565
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,008
Whoa. Did they kill Bresci?

566
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:14,303
No, they captured him
and they put him on trial with, like,

567
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,180
a famous anarchist lawyer and everything.

568
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:18,349
But since there was
no capital punishment in Italy

569
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:22,395
at that time, like 1900,
I mean... nor is there now.

570
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:23,938
You can't be a member
of the European Union

571
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,773
if you practise capital punishment, of
course.

572
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:28,109
- Yeah, not like here.
- Yeah.

573
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,654
Anyway, they sent Gaetano Bresci
to, like, this prison island

574
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:34,699
where they put all the other anarchists,
and after, like, a year,

575
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,909
he was found dead in his prison cell.

576
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,661
Murdered?

577
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:40,913
Well, yeah,
most likely by the guards.

578
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:43,958
But, there's a possibility
that he committed suicide.

579
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:46,086
Whoa, Gaetano Bresci.

580
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:53,092
Do you think there are any other anarchists
still around in Paterson?

581
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:56,512
You mean besides us? Not likely.

582
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:57,972
Hey, what time is your first class?

583
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,473
It's at 10:00.

584
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,393
- Wanna grab a coffee?
- Sure.

585
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,213
<i>Glow.</i>

586
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:33,591
<i>When I wake up</i>

587
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:35,342
<i>earlier than you,</i>

588
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,095
<i>and you are turned</i>

589
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,638
<i>to face me,</i>

590
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,515
<i>face on the pillow</i>

591
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,809
<i>and hair spread around,</i>

592
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,605
<i>I take a chance and stare at you,</i>

593
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,566
<i>amazed in love and afraid</i>

594
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:53,027
<i>that you might open your eyes</i>

595
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:56,822
<i>and have the daylights scared out of you.</i>

596
00:51:56,823 --> 00:52:00,076
<i>But maybe with the daylights gone,</i>

597
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:01,994
<i>you'd see how much</i>

598
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:04,663
<i>my chest and head</i>

599
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,208
<i>implode for you, their voices</i>

600
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:11,879
<i>trapped inside like unborn children</i>

601
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,173
<i>fearing they will never see</i>

602
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,717
<i>the light of day.</i>

603
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:18,719
<i>The opening in the wall</i>

604
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,808
<i>now dimly glows, it's rainy, blue and grey.</i>

605
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:27,686
<i>I tie my shoes and go downstairs</i>

606
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:30,065
<i>to put the coffee on.</i>

607
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:41,051
It's all warmed up for you, Donny.

608
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,305
All used up's more like it.

609
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,974
You OK?

610
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:49,852
Well, since you asked, no, not really.

611
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,145
My mother-in-law is moving in.

612
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:53,147
The cat got diagnosed with cat diabetes.

613
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:55,858
And the medicine,
you know, it's all so expensive.

614
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,943
And now, my daughter started
taking violin lessons

615
00:53:57,944 --> 00:54:00,237
and I'm losing my mind
with the sound of that.

616
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:03,657
What can I say, Paterson?

617
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,660
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, just my burden, I guess.

618
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:10,497
- My particular burden.
- OK.

619
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,334
I'll see you tomorrow.

620
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:49,703
Excuse me. Are you OK here, all alone?

621
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,790
I'm fine. I'm just waiting
for my mom and my sister.

622
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,376
She's upstairs, in that building over there.

623
00:54:55,377 --> 00:54:58,879
Do you mind if I sit down
till your mom comes down?

624
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,297
Sure.

625
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,758
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

626
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:06,095
- Are you a bus driver?
- Yeah.

627
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:10,140
Do you ever drive
one of those accordion buses?

628
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,852
Articulated.

629
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:17,064
Accordion.

630
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:19,608
No, I just drive the regular ones.

631
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,068
Did you ever drive a fire truck?

632
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:23,404
No, just, uh, buses and cars,

633
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:28,910
and, uh, I drove a big truck
a few times, but, uh, that's it.

634
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:43,173
Are you, uh, interested in poetry?

635
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:45,009
- Uh, actually, I am, kind of.
- Really?

636
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,886
- Yeah.
- I write poetry.

637
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,181
I keep it all in this notebook.

638
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,267
Secret notebook.

639
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:55,853
- Oh, you're a poet.
- Yeah.

640
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,688
That's great.

641
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:01,150
- Would you like to hear one?
- Sure, sure.

642
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:04,361
It doesn't really rhyme, though.

643
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:06,322
That's OK. I kind of like them
better when they don't.

644
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:07,948
Yeah, me too.

645
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:12,202
OK. This one's called "Water Falls".

646
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:14,914
Two words, though, like that.

647
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,377
"Water Falls", OK.

648
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,212
OK.

649
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,006
"Water Falls".

650
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:26,342
"Water falls from the bright air.

651
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:28,510
"It falls like hair,

652
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,264
"falling across a young girl's shoulders.

653
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:33,849
"Water falls,

654
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,352
"making pools in the asphalt,

655
00:56:36,353 --> 00:56:40,439
"dirty mirrors with clouds
and buildings inside.

656
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,733
"It falls on the roof of my house.

657
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,695
"It falls on my mother, and on my hair.

658
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,407
"Most people call it rain."

659
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,453
That's a beautiful poem.

660
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,747
- You really liked it?
- Yeah, I really do.

661
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,165
I think it's beautiful.

662
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:01,293
"Water Falls". Thank you.

663
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:04,129
It doesn't rhyme exactly.

664
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,341
No, but the first two lines do,
in a nice way.

665
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:10,010
And some nice little
internal rhymes too, I think.

666
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,429
Internal rhymes.

667
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:15,058
Oh, my mom's done.

668
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,812
That's my sister. We're twins.

669
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:24,316
It was nice to meet you.

670
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:26,193
Nice to meet you too. Nice to meet a...

671
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:28,320
nice to meet a real poet.

672
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,911
Do you like Emily Dickinson?

673
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:38,539
I do, yeah. She's one of my favourites.

674
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,127
Awesome, a bus driver
that likes Emily Dickinson.

675
00:57:57,434 --> 00:58:01,020
"Water falls from the bright air,

676
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,027
<i>"falls like hair,</i>

677
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:12,740
<i>"falling across a young girl's shoulder."</i>

678
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:27,088
I'm so excited to see
what you'll think.

679
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:34,261
Some fresh basil.
I grew it myself on the windowsill.

680
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:36,305
W-we're having pie for dinner?

681
00:58:36,306 --> 00:58:39,308
Yeah, but a dinner pie.

682
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:40,602
Oh.

683
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:44,521
What do you think's inside?

684
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,565
Uh, inside the secret pie?

685
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:49,818
Uh, I don't know. Fish?

686
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,362
No, not fish, silly!

687
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:55,115
- Want me to tell you?
- Uhh, yes, please.

688
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:57,576
OK.

689
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,913
Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.

690
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,126
- Seriously?
- Yeah, baked into a pie.

691
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:08,879
Doesn't it sound delicious?

692
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,673
You love Brussels sprouts
and you love Cheddar cheese.

693
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:15,053
I do, yeah.
No, that sounds very original.

694
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,515
Is it a new recipe you found?

695
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:21,350
No, I made it up.

696
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:23,227
Secret pie.

697
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:25,229
I made a small one for Marvin.

698
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,980
He really seemed to like it.

699
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:46,250
Mm-hm, secret pie.

700
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:48,378
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

701
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,215
Speaking of secret pie,

702
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:56,594
I wanted to tell you something
about your secret notebook.

703
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:00,055
- What?
- Did you ever hear

704
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:03,475
of the old Italian poet
called Pet-ra-rch, is that it?

705
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:06,645
Mm, Petrarch. He perfected the sonnet.

706
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:09,648
Um, I read online
that one of his early books of poems

707
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,525
was called <i>The Secret Book.</i>

708
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:13,443
Just like yours.

709
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:14,987
I didn't know that.

710
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:16,321
You read that?

711
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,532
You just happened upon it online?

712
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:21,201
And also that he wrote all his love poems

713
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,662
to a beautiful girl called,

714
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:26,248
ta-dah, Laura.

715
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:27,666
That's true.

716
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,251
So you have many things in common

717
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,088
with other great and famous poets, you see.

718
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:38,469
Do you like it there?
It's the waterfalls, your favourite place.

719
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:44,224
I'm not sure.

720
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,351
Yeah, it's nice there.

721
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:49,146
So remember,
you promised to finally make copies

722
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:51,315
of your poems this weekend.

723
01:00:51,316 --> 01:00:53,775
I will, as soon as I have some free time.

724
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,694
You promised me. This weekend.

725
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,905
I will, no, I-I promised.

726
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,034
So why don't you recite me something?

727
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:06,121
Just a few little lines,
maybe from the love poem.

728
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:10,542
Well I- I can give you
a few lines I didn't write.

729
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:14,630
Are they by your hero,
Carlo William Carlos?

730
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:17,549
William Carlos Williams.

731
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,636
I know, darling. I was teasing.

732
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:26,017
No, it's a poem by a... by a girl I met.

733
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,353
A girl you met?

734
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:30,687
Yeah, no, like a little girl.

735
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,689
Like a t... like a ten-year-old girl.

736
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,858
Oh!

737
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:36,443
She was on the bus?

738
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:38,362
No, I met her on my way home from work,

739
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,322
near the old factories.

740
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:45,077
She was waiting for her mom
and her sister and...

741
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:47,037
and I noticed she had a notebook of poems,

742
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:50,082
and she read one to me.

743
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,751
From her own secret notebook?

744
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:55,504
Yeah, exactly.

745
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:57,548
The picture of the falls made me think of it.

746
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:02,010
I just remember how it started.

747
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:04,305
"Water falls from the bright air,

748
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,308
"falls like hair,

749
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,354
"falling across a young girl's shoulders."

750
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,191
Nice.

751
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,069
Almost like one of yours.

752
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:23,156
Did she have long hair?

753
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,242
Uh, she did, yeah.

754
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,869
Hmm.

755
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:33,417
Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?

756
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:36,211
For my cupcakes, remember?

757
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:38,380
Saturday is my turn on the baking booth

758
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,257
in the farmer's market.

759
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,092
I remembered this morning that,
oh, my God,

760
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,970
it's the day after tomorrow.

761
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,100
I have so many cupcakes to make. Oh, my!

762
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:55,189
- You don't like your pie?
- No, I do, yeah!

763
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:32,100
Our own Romeo and Juliet.

764
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:35,437
Or, maybe, more like
Antony and Cleopatra?

765
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:37,522
Speaking of Romeo and Juliet,

766
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:39,066
Abbott and Costello.

767
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:43,195
Look, Lou Costello has got to be

768
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:45,197
the most famous person from Paterson.

769
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:48,325
Yeah, probably, yeah. I mean, he...

770
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:51,369
he's got that statue
and he's got his own park.

771
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,371
Right, I mean,
Alexander Hamilton has a statue,

772
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:56,917
others got statues but not their own park!

773
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:59,169
Hell, even Fetty Wap don't have no park.

774
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:04,175
Yeah, Lou Costello.

775
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,262
I wonder where Bud Abbott was born?

776
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:11,556
Uhh, that I know.

777
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,724
Jersey, also.

778
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:15,644
Asbury Park. Uh, 1895, maybe.

779
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,813
- You knew that?
- Oh, hell, yeah, man.

780
01:04:17,814 --> 01:04:19,397
I know a lot of shit about a lot of shit.

781
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,235
And Lou Costello.

782
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:25,278
- "Who's on first?"
- Uh, who's on first,

783
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,947
what's on second,

784
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,492
- I don't know's on third...
- Wait, who's on first?

785
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,620
Who's on first?

786
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:36,498
Who's on first?

787
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:38,416
I'll tell ya who's on first.

788
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,544
And I'll tell ya what's on second too.

789
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,420
But you ain't gonna wanna know.

790
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,713
I can explain, sweetheart.

791
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,174
No, let me explain.

792
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:48,927
That is my cookie jar money.

793
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,179
That is money I've been saving up

794
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,183
so I could get my hair fixed
to go to your damn niece's wedding.

795
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,853
That is my money. Mine!

796
01:04:57,854 --> 01:04:59,980
I promise, I will replace it.

797
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:03,900
I-I will replace it after
this weekend's chess tournament.

798
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:07,487
Chess tournament?

799
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:11,283
Doc, you gonna need a chess tourniquet

800
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:13,494
if you don't put that damn money back.

801
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:42,148
You OK, Doc?

802
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:47,777
Paterson, you still don't got a cell phone?

803
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,696
Uh, no... no, I don't want one.

804
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:50,947
It would be a leash.

805
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,116
What about the better half? She got one?

806
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:56,828
She's got one, yeah.
And a laptop. And an iPad.

807
01:05:56,829 --> 01:05:58,580
She doesn't want you to get one?

808
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:04,420
No, no, she's OK about it.

809
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:08,883
She understands me really well.

810
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:13,262
Lucky guy.

811
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,394
You don't listen to me at all!

812
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,648
The friendship can be folded
into something greater.

813
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:26,692
I don't want to fold it
into something greater!

814
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:32,614
Hey, Doc, what d...
what does Abbott and Costello

815
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,659
have to do with, uh, Romeo and Juliet?

816
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:39,579
- Wait, wait, wait, please.
- Everett!

817
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,540
I would rather drop dead.

818
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:05,063
Is there anything we can do?

819
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:09,067
Nah, I always say, don't try to change things,

820
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:11,737
or you'll make them even worse.

821
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,907
- Good morning!
- Morning.

822
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,374
You're up late, honey.

823
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:09,085
Your silent, magic watch
didn't wake you up.

824
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,047
Yeah, it was a little late today.

825
01:08:12,048 --> 01:08:15,925
Well, some days,
something inside just doesn't wanna get up.

826
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:17,344
Ever feel like that?

827
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:20,431
Today.

828
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,643
Oh, my. I have so much to do.

829
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:28,396
I know it's silly, but I'm so excited

830
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:30,774
about the new farmer's market.

831
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:33,735
Because if my cupcakes are a big
sensation,

832
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:37,363
then I might be on my way
to a very successful business.

833
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:40,700
That would be amazing, honey.

834
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,619
And you know what else?

835
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,871
My guitar should arrive today.

836
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:48,209
My Harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban.

837
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:53,588
Is Esteban gonna deliver it personally?

838
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:54,964
Who knows?

839
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:01,639
Mmm, smells good.

840
01:09:09,814 --> 01:09:11,732
I like your technique.

841
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:38,050
<i>The Run.</i>

842
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:50,103
<i>I go through</i>

843
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:53,023
<i>trillions of molecules</i>

844
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:57,610
<i>that move aside</i>

845
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,531
<i>to make way for me,</i>

846
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,659
<i>while on both sides,</i>

847
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,995
<i>trillions more</i>

848
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:09,790
<i>stay where they are.</i>

849
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,543
<i>The windshield wiper blade</i>

850
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:15,796
<i>starts to squeak.</i>

851
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:19,133
<i>The rain has stopped.</i>

852
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:21,886
<i>I stop.</i>

853
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,894
Morning, Donny.

854
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:32,061
You OK?

855
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:33,731
No, not really.

856
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,943
You don't even wanna know.

857
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:21,152
<i>I go through trillions of molecules</i>

858
01:11:21,153 --> 01:11:22,612
<i>that move aside</i>

859
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:24,447

866
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,257
<i>On the corner,</i>

867
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,884
<i>a boy in a yellow raincoat</i>

868
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:46,971
<i>holding his mother's hand.</i>

869
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:53,012
I think it's probably best if we, uh,

870
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:56,099
stand as far away from the bus as we can.

871
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,726
It's not gonna catch on fire or anything, is it?

872
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:00,770
It could explode into a fireball!

873
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:03,064
Oh, no, ma'am.
It's just an electrical problem.

874
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:04,774
What's gonna happen to us now?

875
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:06,359
Are we stranded here?

876
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,695
Oh, no, no, no.
Another bus will come get us shortly.

877
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,657
Dear God.

878
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:21,541
I think we'll just gather up over there,
if you don't mind, thank you very much.

879
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:26,129
OK, people. Let's join
the rest of the passengers, if we could.

880
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,089
- Did we run out of gas?
- No, plenty of gas.

881
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,550
It's just, uh, an electrical problem.

882
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:33,344
Sabotage, probably.

883
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:36,305
OK, let's... let's come over here.

884
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,141
Another bus will come get us in a minute.

885
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:42,311
OK everyone, I... I apologise again
for this inconvenience.

886
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:44,230
I think it's best if we wait
here for a few minutes

887
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:48,360
and, uh, I'll call now for a replacement bus.

888
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:56,325
- Don't you have a smartphone?
- Uh, no I-I don't.

889
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:57,785
I don't, not with me.

890
01:14:57,786 --> 01:14:59,662
Would you like to use my phone,
Mr Bus Driver?

891
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,206
Oh, if you don't mind. Thank you.

892
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:04,041
So, what's gonna happen to this bus?

893
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:07,211
Um, well, a... a big truck is gonna come

894
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:08,754
and tow it back to the depot.

895
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:10,798
- Awesome.
- Thank you very much.

896
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:12,300
- I can't wait to see the truck.
- OK, I'll just be over here.

897
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:13,634
I apologise again.

898
01:15:28,484 --> 01:15:32,778
Hi, this is Paterson, bus 23,
I have a situation.

899
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,489
<i>Third, second and first.</i>

900
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:37,825
<i>Third, second, first.</i>

901
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,286
<i>Pluck all those strings together.</i>

902
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,580
<i>There you have your first chord.</i>

903
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:35,359
Surprise!

904
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,238
Just sit down, darling,
for a second, and listen to this.

905
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:40,782
OK.

906
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:56,464
♪ I've been working on the railroad

907
01:17:56,465 --> 01:18:00,760
♪ All the livelong day

908
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:04,639
♪ I've been working on the railroad

909
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,894
♪ Just to pass the time away ♪

910
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,440
Well, that's as far as I got so far.

911
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:15,983
But it's pretty amazing, right?

912
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:17,318
For someone who never played before?

913
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:18,944
It's very amazing.

914
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,488
You just learned all that today?

915
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:23,658
Yeah, from these instructional DVDs.

916
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:26,327
And I've been baking all day too.

917
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:28,120
Well, I'm very impressed.

918
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,664
Isn't she beautiful?

919
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:32,500
Yeah, you two were made for each other.

920
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,169
What's it called again? The... the Jester?

921
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,505
- No, the Harlequin.
- Harlequin.

922
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:39,424
And thank you, my love.

923
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:45,221
You look a little drained.

924
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:46,639
You're home a little late.

925
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,599
Was your day OK?

926
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,185
Well, it was until the bus broke down.

927
01:18:51,186 --> 01:18:53,562
The bus broke down? Was it dangerous?

928
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,857
No, it was just, uh, just sputtered out.

929
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:58,651
It was an electrical problem.

930
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,653
Electrical problem?

931
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:03,364
Could it have exploded into a fireball?

932
01:19:03,365 --> 01:19:05,783
No, no.

933
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:08,077
It's just an old bus.

934
01:19:08,078 --> 01:19:09,995
Well, I think they should get their best driver,

935
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,206
who's also a great poet, a brand-new bus.

936
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:13,582
It's the least they could do.

937
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,376
The city of Paterson?

938
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:16,753
Not likely.

939
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:20,298
Well, honey. I'm just glad you're OK.

940
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,302
Maybe you should get a smartphone.

941
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,721
Just for emergencies.

942
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:28,723
You know I don't want one.

943
01:19:28,724 --> 01:19:31,642
The world worked fine
before they even existed.

944
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:34,896
I know, darling,
but sometimes they make things easier.

945
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,941
Honey, since the kitchen's a mess

946
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:41,610
with all my baking going on,
couldn't we order out?

947
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:43,863
Like, a pizza?

948
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:47,158
- Pizza's fine with me.
- Great.

949
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,577
Then after dinner,
while you and Marvin go out,

950
01:19:49,578 --> 01:19:52,163
I could practise just a little more.

951
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:54,583
I wanna learn the rest of that song, at least.

952
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,522
The Harlequin.

953
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:35,748
So what'd they do?
Send a mechanic, uh, on site

954
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:37,458
or tow the motherfucker or what?

955
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,710
Yeah, yeah.
They come and tow it back to the depot,

956
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,463
and they send a replacement bus
for the passengers.

957
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:44,340
Man, that could've been a lot worse.

958
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,884
Damn thing could've exploded
into a fuckin' fireball!

959
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,477
Hey, Doc,
if you're not doing anything tomorrow,

960
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:58,646
they're having
the new outdoor farmer's market again.

961
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:01,273
And I know for a fact
there's gonna be

962
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:05,611
some fantastic cupcakes
for sale in the bakery booth.

963
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:10,199
Oh, tomorrow's, uh... tomorrow's Saturday.

964
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,452
I got that big chess tournament
goin' on over there in Camden.

965
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,663
Oh, right, right.

966
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:17,832
OK, well, good luck.

967
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,750
Yeah, thanks.

968
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:21,335
Hey, fellas.

969
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:23,420
- Hey, Marie.
- Hey, shortie.

970
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,589
How you and, uh, Romeo doin'?

971
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,675
Please, Everett!

972
01:21:27,676 --> 01:21:29,301
And we're not doing.

973
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:31,262
If anything, he's acting worse.

974
01:21:31,263 --> 01:21:33,722
But I think the key word is acting.

975
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:37,560
Well, how well do you really know him?

976
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:39,228
We've known each other since we were
kids.

977
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,312
And I really do care about him.

978
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:41,814
It's just...

979
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:43,732
this whole girlfriend thing was a big mistake.

980
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,151
Obviously.

981
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:48,696
It's cool. He just needs to act out.

982
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:50,823
He's always been that way.
He needed some kind of drama,

983
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:52,199
and then he gets over it.

984
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,201
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

985
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:55,995
If you ask me, everything he does is crazy.

986
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:01,333
Speak of the devil.

987
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:03,627
Baby, I need to talk to you for a minute.

988
01:22:03,628 --> 01:22:05,504
Everett, why can't you
just forget about me?

989
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:08,633
- Because I am in love with you.
- Well, you can't have me.

990
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:16,683
OK.

991
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:22,355
OK.

992
01:22:27,235 --> 01:22:30,280
OK, then nobody move!

993
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:40,414
If I can't have you, then I guess nobody can.

994
01:22:40,415 --> 01:22:41,916
Everett.

995
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,334
Stop acting crazy.

996
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:45,878
Crazy? You wanna see crazy?

997
01:22:45,879 --> 01:22:48,048
I'll show y'all crazy!

998
01:22:54,012 --> 01:22:55,847
Smooth move, Paterson.

999
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:04,104
You damn chucklehead.

1000
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:06,357
Comin' in here. Clearin' out my place.

1001
01:23:06,358 --> 01:23:09,736
I oughta kick your black ass.

1002
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:29,463
Without love,

1003
01:23:29,464 --> 01:23:32,342
what reason is there for anything?

1004
01:23:44,396 --> 01:23:47,189
Thanks, Paterson.

1005
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,441
That was very heroic.

1006
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,026
Yeah, wow. OK.

1007
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,444
I don't know.

1008
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:54,279
If it wasn't for you,

1009
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,281
crazy motherfucker
might have shot himself to death

1010
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:58,117
with a piece of foam.

1011
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,360
Good morning.

1012
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,822
What time is it?

1013
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:39,284
- It's Saturday morning, baby.
- Oh.

1014
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,704
You were out a little late last night.

1015
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:46,623
Yeah.

1016
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:49,544
There was, umm...

1017
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:54,339
an incident at the... at the bar.

1018
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:58,218
Incident at the bar? What happened?

1019
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:00,179
Well...

1020
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,056
- Oh, a guy had a gun.
- What?

1021
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:04,016
Well, he had what I thought was a real gun.

1022
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:05,559
And he threatened this girl and...

1023
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,394
Oh my God! He threatened a girl?

1024
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:09,188
He threatened to shoot himself.

1025
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:11,774
All because he's in love with her.

1026
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:14,777
It's complicated. Anyway, I tried to stop him
and I knocked the gun away

1027
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:17,237
and turns out it was a toy gun

1028
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:18,782
that shoots little foam pellets.

1029
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:23,118
Sure looked real, though.

1030
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,204
Oh, honey.

1031
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:28,499
Oh, that's so frightening.

1032
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,002
You acted so heroically.

1033
01:25:34,923 --> 01:25:37,466
I told you that place could be dangerous.

1034
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,302
I mean, anyone could
just walk in there any time

1035
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,137
with a shotgun or something.

1036
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,430
Now you see what I mean?

1037
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:45,307
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1038
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:47,727
But it was only... it was only a toy gun.

1039
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,230
Why are you up already?

1040
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:53,065
It's Saturday.

1041
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:55,984
I have to get my cupcakes
to the farmer's market.

1042
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:58,113
- Remember?
- I do now.

1043
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,827
I smell cupcakes.

1044
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,462
Mmm, still smell a hint of beer.

1045
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,938
Wow!

1046
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:35,232
This looks fantastic, baby.

1047
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:37,735
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1048
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:45,242
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair?

1049
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:46,995
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair, huh?

1050
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:52,291
William Carlos Williams?

1051
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:55,003
Oh, no, uh, Carlo William Carlos.

1052
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:00,632
Will you read me
that one I love so much?

1053
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,050
"This Is Just To Say"?

1054
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,803
Comin' up.

1055
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,103
"This is just to say

1056
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,150
"I have eaten the plums
that were in the icebox

1057
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:21,820
"and which you were probably
saving for breakfast.

1058
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:24,031
"Forgive me.

1059
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:26,825
"They were delicious,

1060
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:30,829
"so sweet and so cold."

1061
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:34,208
- Oh, I love that poem.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

1062
01:27:34,209 --> 01:27:36,376
And some of yours are just as good.

1063
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:37,545
Well...

1064
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,966
Now, remember your promise.

1065
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:44,593
I promised.

1066
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:46,136
I better get going.

1067
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:48,847
Could you put the rest in the boxes?

1068
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:50,141
Sure.

1069
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:13,372
OK.

1070
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:14,915
This is the last of 'em.

1071
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,250
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

1072
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:18,543
All together like this, they look great.

1073
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:21,630
- I'm so excited.
- Good.

1074
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:23,715
OK, they should be good,
if you just drive slowly.

1075
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:25,301
Yeah, yeah. I... I will.

1076
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:32,266
You're not taking him with you?

1077
01:28:32,267 --> 01:28:35,227
Oh, honey, I can't.

1078
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:37,605
Maybe you could
take him for a walk later, huh?

1079
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:41,233
Love you.

1080
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,235
Yeah, love you.

1081
01:29:02,297 --> 01:29:03,715
All right. Come on, Marvin.

1082
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:26,070
Come on, Marvin.
Can't we stop here for a second?

1083
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,625
<i>Pumpkin</i>

1084
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,503
<i>My little pumpkin,</i>

1085
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:48,885
<i>I like to think about other girls sometimes,</i>

1086
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:51,887
<i>but</i>

1087
01:29:51,888 --> 01:29:54,306
<i>the truth is</i>

1088
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:58,269
<i>if you ever left me,</i>

1089
01:30:01,773 --> 01:30:05,943
<i>I'd tear my heart out</i>

1090
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:12,033
<i>and never put it back.</i>

1091
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:18,664
<i>There'll never be anyone like you.</i>

1092
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:23,293
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

1093
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,222
- Honey?
- Down here.

1094
01:30:39,352 --> 01:30:42,397
- How'd it go?
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy!

1095
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:48,568
You won't believe this, but I made $286.

1096
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:50,028
Wow.

1097
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:51,696
My cupcakes were a huge hit.

1098
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,115
Everyone's talking about them.

1099
01:30:53,116 --> 01:30:54,825
That's fantastic.

1100
01:30:56,077 --> 01:30:57,745
Marvin!

1101
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:18,181
$286 cash money, baby.

1102
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:19,975
Wow!

1103
01:31:19,976 --> 01:31:22,644
I know it's no big deal.
It's just silly cupcakes.

1104
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:24,354
But I'm quite proud of myself.

1105
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:26,231
Oh, yeah, you should be.

1106
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:27,816
Can we celebrate?

1107
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:30,235
Uh, yeah, sure. What should we do?

1108
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:32,988
- First of all, I'm gonna treat.
- OK.

1109
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:35,657
I'd like to go to dinner
and then go to the movies.

1110
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:39,202
We haven't gone to the movies in so long.

1111
01:31:39,203 --> 01:31:41,830
Uh, yeah, no... no we haven't.
What should we see?

1112
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:43,540
You know that one theatre at the mall

1113
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:46,460
now shows old scary movies
on Saturday nights?

1114
01:31:46,461 --> 01:31:48,128
We could see an old scary movie.

1115
01:31:48,129 --> 01:31:49,963
I'm gonna get changed and get ready.

1116
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:51,090
I'm very proud of you.

1117
01:31:53,551 --> 01:31:55,969
And you, my little man.

1118
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:59,390
You're gonna have to stay here
and guard the palace.

1119
01:32:05,897 --> 01:32:06,981
Honey, should I change my shirt?

1120
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:11,194
That'd be nice.

1121
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:22,621
This is so much fun.

1122
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:25,583
It's like, you're living in the 20th century.

1123
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:35,342
This is Mr Parker, Lota.

1124
01:32:35,343 --> 01:32:38,303
How do you do? Don't be afraid.

1125
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:40,180
How do you do?

1126
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:43,183
Mr Parker has come to us
from over the sea.

1127
01:32:43,184 --> 01:32:45,560
She's a pure Polynesian.

1128
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:48,647
The only woman on the entire island.

1129
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:51,608
Well, uh, I'll leave
you two young people together.

1130
01:32:51,609 --> 01:32:53,486
I've got work to do.

1131
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,116
Won't you sit down?

1132
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:03,328
You come from the sea?

1133
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:07,083
Well, around it.
Three days on an upturned lifeboat.

1134
01:33:09,085 --> 01:33:12,338
- You go away?
- Tomorrow morning.

1135
01:33:14,674 --> 01:33:17,009
I wish you would not go away.

1136
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,724
Oh, that's very nice of you, but I must.

1137
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:28,395
You'll come back? Again?

1138
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:30,898
Well I-I don't know.

1139
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:36,444
How does it happen
that you're the only woman on this island?

1140
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,073
Did, uh, Dr Moreau bring you here?

1141
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:44,245
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.

1142
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:48,290
Quickly, please!

1143
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,460
Get out!

1144
01:33:57,258 --> 01:33:59,718
They're vivisecting a human being.

1145
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:03,096
They're cutting a living man to pieces.

1146
01:34:03,097 --> 01:34:04,724
Now I know about his natives.

1147
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:08,810
They're his victims.

1148
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:11,605
I did love it that it was in black and white.

1149
01:34:11,606 --> 01:34:14,190
Yeah, yeah, I haven't...

1150
01:34:14,191 --> 01:34:16,319
I haven't seen a black-and-white movie
in a long time.

1151
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:20,780
My favourite part was when the lead guy

1152
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,699
kissed the wild panther girl.

1153
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:26,703
You look... you look like her.

1154
01:34:26,704 --> 01:34:28,205
You do. You guys could be twins.

1155
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:36,713
Well, thank you for treating me
to dinner and a movie.

1156
01:34:36,714 --> 01:34:40,133
I'm happy I could.

1157
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:43,053
- We should do it every weekend.
- Yeah.

1158
01:34:43,054 --> 01:34:46,556
Now that you're
the cupcake queen of Paterson.

1159
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,809
Cupcake queen of Paterson.

1160
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,186
I love it.

1161
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:52,271
Thank you.

1162
01:35:04,408 --> 01:35:06,160
What is this?

1163
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:08,954
Marvin?

1164
01:35:11,749 --> 01:35:15,086
Marvin, did you do this?

1165
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,348
Oh, my God!

1166
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:30,308
It's...

1167
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:31,686
It's your notebook.

1168
01:35:34,689 --> 01:35:36,023
It's what?

1169
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:39,318
Your poems.

1170
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:44,824
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1171
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:54,499
I don't know what to even say.

1172
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:59,338
You... you usually keep your notebook
down at the basement.

1173
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:06,470
I guess I left it up here on the sofa.

1174
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:11,809
That stupid dog.

1175
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:15,980
He's gotta be put out in the garage.

1176
01:37:18,667 --> 01:37:21,377
Honey, it's so early.

1177
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:22,963
It's Sunday.

1178
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:26,509
Please, come back to sleep.

1179
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:31,638
Please, baby.

1180
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:33,765
I will, I will, baby.

1181
01:37:33,766 --> 01:37:35,726
Ye-- Go back to sleep.

1182
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,937
I don't like you, Marvin.

1183
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:15,283
Marvin, didn't I put you in the garage?

1184
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:18,536
No, it's OK,
I let him back in when I went outside.

1185
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:21,039
No, he's going back out there!

1186
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,583
Come on, Marvin!

1187
01:39:24,293 --> 01:39:26,920
No! You're staying out there!

1188
01:39:42,227 --> 01:39:45,397
I wish you would have read me
some of your most recent poems.

1189
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:49,567
Maybe I could've remembered them.

1190
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:50,694
It's OK.

1191
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:53,864
They were just words...

1192
01:39:56,659 --> 01:39:57,952
written on water.

1193
01:39:59,662 --> 01:40:01,664
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1194
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,460
I saved all the pieces.

1195
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:11,339
Maybe, somehow,
they could be puzzled back together,

1196
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,883
with a computer programme, or something.

1197
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:22,810
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

1198
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:28,314
Should I play you the song
I've been learning on my guitar?

1199
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:31,025
Oh, no, that's OK.

1200
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:35,154
Th... I appreciate the offer,
just, maybe, not right now.

1201
01:40:35,155 --> 01:40:36,156
OK?

1202
01:40:40,411 --> 01:40:43,121
Maybe you just wanna be left alone?

1203
01:40:43,122 --> 01:40:44,706
Should I go out for a while?

1204
01:40:44,707 --> 01:40:47,084
Oh, n-n-no, no. No, it's OK.

1205
01:40:55,676 --> 01:40:58,511
Maybe I'll go out.

1206
01:40:58,512 --> 01:40:59,888
Take a little walk.

1207
01:41:55,194 --> 01:41:57,737
Paterson. It's you.

1208
01:41:57,738 --> 01:41:59,656
Hello, Everett.

1209
01:42:02,743 --> 01:42:06,579
I'm sorry about the other night.

1210
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,457
I kinda lost myself.

1211
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,210
Yeah.

1212
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,464
It's OK. Are you doing better now?

1213
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:20,969
Yeah, I guess so.

1214
01:42:27,768 --> 01:42:30,103
You OK?

1215
01:42:30,104 --> 01:42:32,105
You look a little low yourself.

1216
01:42:32,106 --> 01:42:33,732
Yeah, yeah.

1217
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:39,028
I'm OK.

1218
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:41,447
Well, it's like they always say.

1219
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:45,326
"The sun still rises every mornin'
and sets every evenin'."

1220
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:48,163
- Always another day, right?
- Yeah.

1221
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,417
So far.

1222
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:55,003
So far, yeah.

1223
01:42:58,966 --> 01:43:03,761
So, I guess I'll see you around, then.

1224
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:05,764
- Yeah, yeah, take care.
- Yeah, you too.

1225
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,580
Excuse me, please.

1226
01:44:12,581 --> 01:44:15,041
Allow to sit?

1227
01:44:15,042 --> 01:44:16,626
Uh, yeah.

1228
01:44:16,627 --> 01:44:18,170
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1229
01:45:01,922 --> 01:45:03,631
Excuse me.

1230
01:45:03,632 --> 01:45:06,217
Maybe not acceptable behaviour,

1231
01:45:06,218 --> 01:45:10,973
but may I ask if you from here,
in Paterson, New Jersey?

1232
01:45:12,015 --> 01:45:13,474
Am I?

1233
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:16,227
Uh, yeah.

1234
01:45:16,228 --> 01:45:17,771
Yes I am. I was born here.

1235
01:45:19,022 --> 01:45:20,731
Excuse me again.

1236
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:25,152
But, are you knowing the great
poet, William Carlos Williams?

1237
01:45:25,153 --> 01:45:27,030
Here in Paterson, New Jersey?

1238
01:45:30,033 --> 01:45:33,494
Well, I'm aware of his poems.

1239
01:45:33,495 --> 01:45:35,414
Excellent.

1240
01:45:41,044 --> 01:45:46,383
May I ask if you too are a poet
of Paterson, New Jersey?

1241
01:45:48,468 --> 01:45:51,847
Uh, no.

1242
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:53,973
No.

1243
01:45:53,974 --> 01:45:55,267
I see.

1244
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:03,275
I'm a bus driver, myself.

1245
01:46:04,735 --> 01:46:06,736
Just a bus driver.

1246
01:46:06,737 --> 01:46:08,697
A bus driver in Paterson.

1247
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:11,241
Ah.

1248
01:46:13,952 --> 01:46:15,911
This very poetic.

1249
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:17,496
Well, I'm not so sure 'bout that.

1250
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:21,959
Yes. This could be poem
by William Carlos Williams.

1251
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:30,343
Did you know interesting
French artist Jean Dubuffet

1252
01:46:30,344 --> 01:46:36,724
was meteorologist on top
of Eiffel Tower, Paris, in 1922?

1253
01:46:36,725 --> 01:46:39,352
- Very poetic.
- Yeah.

1254
01:46:39,353 --> 01:46:42,271
Yeah, Jean Dubuffet.

1255
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:44,691
Yeah, he was, uh, he was a meteorologist.

1256
01:46:46,526 --> 01:46:51,113
This I learn from poem
by your interesting poet,

1257
01:46:51,114 --> 01:46:53,366
Frank O'Hara of New York City.

1258
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:56,369
Yeah, I read that, too.

1259
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,621
I like Frank O'Hara.

1260
01:46:58,872 --> 01:47:03,709
The... the New York School.

1261
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:04,920
Ah ha.

1262
01:47:14,513 --> 01:47:16,431
I guess you really like poetry, then?

1263
01:47:17,724 --> 01:47:19,142
I breathe poetry.

1264
01:47:23,855 --> 01:47:25,649
So, you write poetry?

1265
01:47:26,358 --> 01:47:27,484
Yes.

1266
01:47:31,363 --> 01:47:33,447
My notebooks.

1267
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:34,658
Ah, yeah.

1268
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:38,495
My poetry only in Japanese.

1269
01:47:39,371 --> 01:47:40,872
No translation.

1270
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:45,334
Poetry in translation is like

1271
01:47:45,335 --> 01:47:48,087
taking a shower with a raincoat on.

1272
01:47:51,174 --> 01:47:52,676
I see what you mean.

1273
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:59,181
I hope this isn't, um,
inappropriate behaviour,

1274
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:02,768
but may I ask what you're doing
here in Paterson?

1275
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:06,105
I come here to see city
of your interesting poet,

1276
01:48:06,106 --> 01:48:07,898
William Carlos Williams,

1277
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:11,819

here in Paterson, New Jersey.

1278
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:14,155

- Yeah, yeah. He lived here.

1279
01:48:14,156 --> 01:48:15,739
He was a doctor.

1280
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,575
Ah ha.

1281
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:20,412
"Ah ha," what?

1282
01:48:21,955 --> 01:48:26,126
Also Allen Ginsberg is growing up here.

1283
01:48:27,377 --> 01:48:29,004
Also Paterson, New Jersey.

1284
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,882
Yeah, that's true.

1285
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:51,817
I leave here tomorrow.

1286
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:53,402
Nice to meet you.

1287
01:48:53,403 --> 01:48:58,240
Oh, nice to meet you. Are you...
you're going back to Tokyo?

1288
01:48:58,241 --> 01:48:59,533
No, Osaka.

1289
01:48:59,534 --> 01:49:02,828
Oh, Osaka. What I meant.
Have a good trip.

1290
01:49:02,829 --> 01:49:03,830
Thank you.

1291
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:07,125
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

1292
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:21,931
A gift.

1293
01:49:21,932 --> 01:49:23,557
A gift?

1294
01:49:23,558 --> 01:49:25,851
Yes.

1295
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:29,856
Sometime empty page
present most possibilities.

1296
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,157
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

1297
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:52,170
Excuse me!

1298
01:49:53,338 --> 01:49:55,215
Ah ha!

1299
01:50:06,977 --> 01:50:08,937
Ah ha.

1300
01:50:51,062 --> 01:50:52,981
<i>The Line</i>

1301
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:57,110
<i>There's an old song</i>

1302
01:50:58,445 --> 01:51:03,282
<i>my grandfather used to sing</i>

1303
01:51:03,283 --> 01:51:05,452
<i>that has the question,</i>

1304
01:51:07,162 --> 01:51:12,041
<i>"Or would you rather be a fish?"</i>

1305
01:51:12,042 --> 01:51:15,377
<i>In the same song</i>

1306
01:51:15,378 --> 01:51:17,963
<i>is the same question</i>

1307
01:51:17,964 --> 01:51:22,093
<i>but with a mule and a pig,</i>

1308
01:51:24,304 --> 01:51:28,766
<i>but the one I hear sometimes</i>

1309
01:51:28,767 --> 01:51:31,268
<i>in my head</i>

1310
01:51:31,269 --> 01:51:35,064
<i>is the fish one.</i>

1311
01:51:35,065 --> 01:51:38,568
<i>Just that one line.</i>

1312
01:51:40,862 --> 01:51:43,740
<i>Would you rather be a fish?</i>

1313
01:51:45,367 --> 01:51:50,455
<i>As if the rest of the song</i>

1314
01:51:51,706 --> 01:51:54,626
<i>didn't have to be there.</i>
