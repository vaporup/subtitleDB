all that nefarious.

<i>That's because when
my editor at Time Magazine</i>

529

what I was reporting on,

530
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:07,887
he butchered the article.

531
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,256
JIM: Then why not get rid
of the article entirely?

532
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,758
Well, it's in the group's
best interest to have

533
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,228
a little bit of information
out there about themselves.

534
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,630
A total media blackout
is a void

535

just asking to be filled
by fertile imaginations.

536
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,834
I wouldn't be surprised that,
in the very near future,

537
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:27,172
that Tarsus purposely
lets a little bit
of information out there--

538
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:30,141
um, news story,
press release,

539
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:33,078
something that
has the appearance
of being objective,

540
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,313
but has been
engineered by them.

541
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:38,483
JIM: So that they can
control the message?

542
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:40,952
And it also acts
as a little bit of a warning.

543

of how powerful they are.

ever contact you

00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:02,273

549
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:05,509
Couldn't honestly say.

550

But your friend
may have tried to contact me.

551
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:10,214

that my article

552

is the only mainstream
document out there

553
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:16,587
that people can find
actual information of Tarsus.

554
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:18,689
But the truth is,
most of these guys
have monikers

555
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:21,225

too suspicious ever to meet.

all of this leading?

What is it specifically

558
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,766
that the Tarsus
organization is after?

559
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,137
Three words:
new world order.

560
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,674

not the law of the jungle,
governs the conduct of nations.

and we will be,

A new world order
is likely to emerge

01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:49,410
Hello?

1059
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:51,812
[ breathing nervously ]

1060
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:53,180
Hello?

1061
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:55,615
[ panting ]

1062
01:13:01,322 --> 01:13:03,724
Guys? [ laughs ]

1063
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:15,202
[ breathing nervously ]

1064
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:36,989
[ horn sounding ]

1065
01:13:38,992 --> 01:13:40,459
[ man shouts
indistinctly ]

1066
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:41,594
[ all shouting ]

1067
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,962
AARON:
What the fuck?

1068
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:43,963
No, no, no, no!

1069
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:44,830
Wait, wait, wait!

1070
01:13:44,832 --> 01:13:46,465
Okay, wait!
Wait! I'm sorry!

1071
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,100
I'm not a part of this!

1072
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:49,468
I'm not a part of this!

1073
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,569
[ men shouting ]

1074
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:52,071
[ Aaron shouting ]

1075
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:53,973
I'm sorry!

1076
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:55,241
Help!

1077
01:13:55,243 --> 01:13:56,308
[ men shouting,
horns blowing ]

1078
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,310
AARON: Oh, no!
I'll just go!

1079
01:13:58,312 --> 01:14:00,046
[ branches snapping ]

1080
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:02,581
[ men shouting ]

1081
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:06,618
[ horns blowing ]

1082
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,920
[ knives clanking ]

1083
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:16,661
[ Aaron groans, falls ]

1084
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:18,229
[ silence, static ]

1085
01:14:18,231 --> 01:14:20,331
[ men shouting ]

1086
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,801
MAN:
Brother! Down here!

1087
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:24,803
[ horns blowing ]

1088
01:14:41,253 --> 01:14:43,687
[ Aaron panting ]

1089
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:51,795
[ shouting and horns
fade into distance ]

1090
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:56,900
[ Aaron breathing nervously ]

1091
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:06,810
[ crickets chirping ]

1092
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:10,013
[ Aaron breathing nervously ]

1093
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:38,174
[ footsteps ]

1094
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,305
[ silence ]

1095
01:16:12,241 --> 01:16:13,742
[ crickets chirping ]

1096
01:16:13,744 --> 01:16:16,411
[ Aaron breathing ]

1097
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,881
[ footsteps ]

1098
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,302
[ footsteps climb
to window ]

1099
01:16:41,304 --> 01:16:42,937
[ panting ]

1100
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:45,105
[ whispering ] Oh, God.

1101
01:16:45,107 --> 01:16:46,307
My God.

1102
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:47,541
Oh, my God.

1103
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:49,276
[ running footsteps ]

1104
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:55,115
Jim!

1105
01:16:55,117 --> 01:16:57,117
Aaron.

1106
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,485
[ horn blows, men shouting ]

1107
01:16:58,487 --> 01:17:01,222
AARON: No!
No no no no no no!

1108
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:02,723
[ knives clanging ]

1109
01:17:02,725 --> 01:17:06,060
[ Aaron whimpering ]

1110
01:17:06,062 --> 01:17:07,127
Aah!

1111
01:17:07,129 --> 01:17:09,163
Get the fuck
away from me!

1112
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:11,297
[ men shouting,
knives slashing ]

1113
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:19,639
[ intermittent static ]

1114
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:21,941
[ silence ]

1115
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,877
[ static ]

1116
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:27,614
[ video rewinding ]

1117
01:17:27,616 --> 01:17:30,016
[ Aaron screams
in slow motion ]

1118
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:33,720
[ men shouting ]

1119
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:39,192
[ keyboard clicking ]

1120
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:50,769
The core value
of the Tarsus Club is
communications--

1121
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:53,005
communications
between governments,

1122
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:55,173
businesses, individuals.

1123
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:58,610
And, of course, we're
living in the golden age
of communications

1124
01:17:58,612 --> 01:18:00,045
because of globalization.

1125
01:18:03,216 --> 01:18:06,018
Unfortunately, with
the rise of the Internet,

1126
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,886
there's a dark side
to globalization.

1127
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:10,956
Essentially, that is
that anyone with a crazy idea

1128
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:14,526
can communicate it
to millions of people
like a virus.

1129
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,995
And the Tarsus Club has been
the target of these viruses,

1130
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,998
including these
crazy conspiracy theories.

1131
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,166
Well, actually,
it's become something

1132
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:24,068
of a cottage industry,
I think,

1133
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,770
within
conspiracy circles

1134
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:28,239
to break in
to Tarsus meetings.

1135
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:31,242
In fact, we've grown
so accustomed to it
over the years

1136
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:34,912
that, uh,
it's almost become
part of the ritual

1137
01:18:34,914 --> 01:18:38,049
to scare people off
who try to break in.

1138
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:42,720
JIM: I was
taken to a back room.

1139
01:18:42,722 --> 01:18:45,923
I was told
to let them know

1140
01:18:45,925 --> 01:18:48,192
where the rendezvous point
was with Aaron.

1141
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:51,128
We were questioned
for a very long time,

1142
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:55,433
but, uh, eventually
security let us go.

1143
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:57,134
Even after Aaron realized

1144
01:18:57,136 --> 01:19:00,104
that they were
just scaring him,

1145
01:19:00,106 --> 01:19:02,906
he was still very upset.

1146
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:08,111
I think Aaron
had been traumatized
by what had happened.

1147
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:10,113
That was the last time
I saw him.

1148
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:18,321
JENSEN:
To the people screaming
about conspiracy...

1149
01:19:20,891 --> 01:19:23,927
I'll let them in
on a little secret.

1150
01:19:24,795 --> 01:19:26,396
It's true.

1151
01:19:26,398 --> 01:19:29,833
Global leaders do
get together and collaborate.

1152
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:33,036
Many of them, including
my boss, Murray Chance,

1153
01:19:33,038 --> 01:19:36,005
are working hard
to create a new world

1154
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:37,841
where all nations
and all people

1155
01:19:37,843 --> 01:19:41,143
can come together
in one global community.

1156
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:44,480
That's what it's all about,

1157
01:19:44,482 --> 01:19:48,484
the creation
of a single global community.

1158
01:19:49,753 --> 01:19:51,387
And if
that's a conspiracy...

1159
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:59,128
If that's a conspiracy,
well, then, yes, we're guilty.

1160
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:03,298
Hi, bud.

1161
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,037
NICOLE:
Just for the record,

1162
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:12,141
where do you think
Aaron went?

1163
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,179
JIM:
I guess he ended up...

1164
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:25,620
in the same place
Terrance did, didn't he?

1165
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,976
And I just hope wherever they are,
they both feel free.
