1
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,016
Come, come.

2
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:03,213
You have authorization
to dress him like that?

3
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:04,970
Oh, yes, sir.

4
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:07,853
Circus ape, huh?

5
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,988
The only one ever to have been
trained as a bareback rider

6
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,080
in the entire history of the circus.

7
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:15,001
Circuses are past history.

8
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,172
Not while I live and breathe.

9
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,131
Go ahead, Senor Armando.

10
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:21,051
Thank you.
Come, come.

11
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,374
Come, come.

12
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,590
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

13
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,045
But try to walk a little more like
a primitive chimpanzee.

14
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:54,181
Your arms should move up and down
from the shoulder, like so.

15
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,537
Yes, that's better.

16
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,704
After 20 years,
you've picked up evolved habits from me.

17
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:04,491
That could be dangerous.
Even fatal.

18
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,414
Armando, I don't understand.

19
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,000
Now listen to me Caesar!

20
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:10,824
There can be only one
talking chimpanzee on Earth,

21
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,898
the child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

22
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,584
who came to us years ago
out of the future and were brutally murdered

23
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:21,265
for fear that one very distant day
apes might dominate the human race.

24
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,132
Yeah but outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.

25
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,826
And we must keep it that way
for the fear remains.

26
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:31,509
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.

27
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,919
- I--
- Shh!

28
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,508
Come, come.

29
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,170
Attention, attention.
This is the watch commander.

30
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:57,025
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.

31
00:04:57,092 --> 00:05:00,443
Repeat. Disperse apes
gathering in the mall.

32
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:04,709
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

33
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,270
Repeat.

34
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:10,306
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

35
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,193
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

36
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,634
Repeat.

37
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,000
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

38
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,496
Attention, attention.
This is the watch commander.

39
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,415
Attention, attention.

40
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,224
Disperse unauthorized
ape gathering at the foot of ramp six.

41
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,488
Repeat.
Disperse unauthorized ape gathering

42
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,410
at the foot of ramp six.

43
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,609
No citation or fine in this instance.

44
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,751
Repeat.
No citation or fine in this instance.

45
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,928
But how did it happen?

46
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,375
Shh.

47
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,057
Go!

48
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,011
Go!

49
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,221
No!

50
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,569
No!

51
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:39,947
Aah!

52
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,709
Go.
You go.

53
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,359
But you said humans
treated apes like pets.

54
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,565
They did, in the beginning.

55
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:02,933
- They've made slaves of them.
- Shh!

56
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:14,875
They all died eight years ago,
every dog and cat in the world.

57
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,795
It was like a plague.

58
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,677
The disease that killed them
was a mysterious virus

59
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:22,110
brought back from outer space
by one of the astronauts.

60
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,990
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- No, no, we were immune.

61
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,911
And so were simians,
even the smallest.

62
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,831
That's how it began--

63
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:32,892
humans wanting little pets
to replace those they'd lost.

64
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:36,576
When people realized
how quick they were to learn,

65
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,500
how easy to train,

66
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:42,341
the pets became larger and larger

67
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,862
until now...

68
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:47,009
It's monstrous.

69
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:53,793
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.

70
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,755
Yes, Lisa.

71
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,100
A Young Queen Falls
for Mrs. Riley.

72
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,466
No!

73
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,638
Lisa.

74
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,519
Yes?

75
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:31,343
Could you be so kind
as to display it in your window?

76
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,590
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,735
Attention.

78
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:42,386
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

79
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,142
will be terminated in 10 minutes.

80
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,584
Repeat.

81
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,986
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

82
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,868
will be terminated in 10 minutes.

83
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:01,435
Thank you, Frank.

84
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:06,721
Now that I know
they won't kill me,

85
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,642
I don't enjoy them.

86
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,756
Well, for heaven's sakes, a circus.

87
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,319
[Growling, Snarling]

88
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,570
Home, Lisa.

89
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:00,563
Yes?

90
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,095
Oh, I was wondering,

91
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,368
would you be kind enough
to display these posters?

92
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,251
Stop it!

93
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,625
No, Zelda.

94
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,515
Home, Zelda.

95
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,422
I'm sorry, Mrs. Riley.

96
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:16,350
I'll comb you out in a minute.

97
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,871
I want to be combed out now.
I have to go to a luncheon.

98
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:20,123
Thursday, then.

99
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,720
Thursday.

100
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,129
Oh, I'm out of raisins.

101
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,049
- Take mine.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:29,891
Why stir 'em into something like that?
The pigment is in synthetic alloy.

103
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,900
You're over tipping.

104
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,250
Yeah, but it'll come back.

105
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,212
[Crash]

106
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,620
No!

107
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,030
No, no!

108
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,807
I told them to condition them to fire.

109
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,333
Attention, attention.

110
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,188
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza

111
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,839
will be terminated in five minutes.

112
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,846
The labor demonstration
will be terminated

113
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,447
in five minutes.

114
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,107
Failure to comply with this order

115
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:04,554
can result in a one-year suspension
of your right to bargain collectively.

116
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:06,001
What's his job?

117
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,856
He's a messenger.

118
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:09,900
For the governor, so get!

119
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,981
Hyah! Get!

120
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,461
Go! Go!

121
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:15,021
Otto, no!

122
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,136
Otto, no, no.

123
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,183
- [Groaning]
- Otto, no, no.

124
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:21,495
- Otto, no.
- [Groaning Continues]

125
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:23,864
Stop this at once, all of you!

126
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,786
Mr. MacDonald, we were just--

127
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,682
I saw what you were doing. Sedate
the animal and get him out of here.

128
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,968
Who's that?

129
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:33,045
MacDonald, the governor's
number-one assistant.

130
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:35,224
He love apes or something?

131
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,182
Don't it figure?

132
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,990
Hold him, Bill.

133
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:42,552
Aah!

134
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,055
Lousy human bastards!

135
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,549
Who said that?

136
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:55,430
I did.

137
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,793
He's a performing ape for my circus.

138
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:01,378
- A talking ape?
- No!

139
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,873
That's impossible.
It was I who spoke.

140
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:07,908
Didn't sound like you.
Yell "lousy human bastards."

141
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,315
That's not what I said.

142
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,236
That's what I heard.

143
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:15,172
Yell "lousy human bastards!"

144
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,036
Lousy human bastards.

145
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,992
We said yell!

146
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,650
Lousy human bastards!

147
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,756
- Yeah. Yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.

148
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,194
That's right.
The ape spoke.

149
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,689
No, they're mistaken.

150
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:31,410
I admit my behavior was inexcusable,
and I am deeply sorry, but--

151
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:35,058
- We better take him to headquarters.
- You're right.

152
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,404
Otto, no!

153
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,254
No! Otto, no!

154
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,010
[Groans]

155
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,273
Move him out.

156
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,530
Oh, Armando, forgive me.

157
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:14,113
Oh, no, no. You only said out loud
what I was thinking.

158
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:17,414
I'm sorry.
I was so angry.

159
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:20,897
I might have bluffed it through
if you hadn't run away.

160
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,305
Now they'll suspect
you're understanding all that was said.

161
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,147
Armando,
let's go back to the circus.

162
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:28,774
No, no, no.

163
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:29,893
Please.

164
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,203
That's the first place they'll look.

165
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,665
Here's what we'll do.

166
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,590
- I'll go to the police.
- Oh, no, no, no.

167
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,631
It's the only way.

168
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:59,764
I'll say I couldn't find you,

169
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:03,861
that, uh, you've run away before,
that big cities frighten you.

170
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,748
- But where would I go?
- You wait right here.

171
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,945
- If this works,
I'll be back by nightfall.
- But what if it doesn't?

172
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:13,397
- What if they don't let you go?
- They will. They will.

173
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:19,132
But just in case,
if I am not back by then,

174
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:23,459
these steps go down to a tunnel
that leads to the harbor.

175
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,558
Cargoes of apes
are frequently unloaded at night.

176
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,564
You must infiltrate
one of them.

177
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:32,355
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked.

178
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,977
- You'll have to
get rid of these clothes.
- I don't want to.

179
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,864
We must have an alternate plan.
Don't you see?

180
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,037
Right now,
the only safe hiding place for you

181
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:45,963
is among your own kind.

182
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:01,873
I shouldn't be long.

183
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,767
Why would you say "human"?

184
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,904
That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.

185
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:23,074
I didn't say "human," Mr. Governor.
I said "inhuman."

186
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,999
"Lousy inhuman bastards."

187
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:28,742
And by the blessed St. Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.

188
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,665
I run a circus, and--

189
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,804
- We know that.
- From 20 years back.

190
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,731
From the year, Senor Armando,

191
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:37,699
when the two talking apes
arrived and conceived a baby

192
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,353
whose survival could have threatened
the future of the entire human race.

193
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:45,221
Mr. Governor, it's my understanding
the baby was shot dead.

194
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,184
Or so it was believed.

195
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,104
However, ever since this morning

196
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,553
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.

197
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:56,044
They could have switched their baby
with one from a zoo.

198
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:57,940
Or perhaps a circus.

199
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,632
Surely you can't be serious.

200
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:03,566
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.

201
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,961
This is a recording
of the recommendations

202
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:11,060
made to the then president
of the United States

203
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:14,329
by the chairman of
the presidential committee.

204
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:21,461
We believe that the talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

205
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,510
have come from the future.

206
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,723
We believe their spoken testimony

207
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,062
that some2,000years hence,

208
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,409
their descendants will have
all but exterminated the human race.

209
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:36,097
The female ape
is now pregnant with child.

210
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,949
The commission therefore recommends

211
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:44,198
that the ape child's birth
should be prevented,

212
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,134
and that both the male and the female

213
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,855
should be rendered incapable
of begetting another.

214
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:59,276
But, Mr. Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,

215
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:01,230
and every circus,
including my own.

216
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,151
Where a small chimpanzee was found.

217
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:06,032
The only chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus,

218
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:08,586
and legally certified
to have been born

219
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:13,035
a month before the talking apes
arrived on earth.

220
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,963
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew.

221
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,063
- I've searched everywhere.
- Senor Armando!

222
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,268
Let me remind you

223
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:25,298
of the seriousness
of our problem.

224
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,232
Now, your circus travels
mainly in the provinces?

225
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,965
Yes, sir.

226
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:32,945
Undoubtedly, you are unaware

227
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,567
of the rising tide of disobedience
and outright defiance

228
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:41,014
among the servant apes
in our cities.

229
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:44,350
Mr. Governor, many of the reported
offenses have been proved minor.

230
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,766
That ape who was killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,

231
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,599
would you call his offense minor?

232
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,294
No, I would not.

233
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,885
He physically assaulted his own master.

234
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:56,292
But only after what must
have been severe provocation.

235
00:17:56,358 --> 00:18:00,482
The ape's body was covered
with bruises from a beating.

236
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,552
Which he no doubt richly deserved.

237
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,684
How many more out there
are just like that ape,

238
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,244
all burning with resentment,

239
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,033
all waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence,

240
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,622
with enough will to lead them?

241
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:20,551
Waiting for an ape
who can think, who can talk.

242
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,956
Senor Armando,
has your ape ever talked

243
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:30,409
or shown any signs
of being articulate?

244
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,818
Never in my presence
or anyone else's.

00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:42,512
These figures seem inflated.
Did you double-check them?

358
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:44,367
- Yes, sir.
- Then triple-check them.

359
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:45,778
No. Come.

360
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,179
Hold all calls, Miss Greer.

361
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,060
Here's the IQ profile on all apes
tested in the last four weeks.

362
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,461
It's risen by 3 2/3 points.

363
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,463
Show that to Mr. MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.

364
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:59,352
I assembled that data, Morgan.
You summarized the wrong part.

365
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:02,386
As a result, their work output
has increased about the same percentage,

366
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,656
which I thought the governor
might regard as good news.

367
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:08,059
We'll go over that later.

368
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:13,495
No.

369
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,183
Watch.

370
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,036
Do.

371
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,496
[Shrieking]

372
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,951
No, no, no.
Clean, clean.

373
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:02,343
The little fellow's
not so bright after all.

374
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,617
No, but then brightness
has never been encouraged among slaves.

375
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:08,206
Oh, don't be so touchy,
Mr. MacDonald.

376
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:11,890
All of us were slaves once,
in one sense of the word or another.

377
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:14,709
We can send him back
for reconditioning.

378
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,336
That isn't necessary.

379
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:18,743
You're quite right,
Mr. MacDonald,

380
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,680
but not for any of your
bleeding-heart reasons.

381
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:24,822
Reconditioning.
That's all you ever think of.

382
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:28,952
If we took every ape who muffed
an assignment or disobeyed an order

383
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:30,877
and sent him back
for reconditioning,

384
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,464
Ape Management would become
impossibly overcrowded.

385
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,707
It's the only thing
that has any effect.

386
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:39,673
- Just makes them worse.
- Some of them couldn't be worse.

387
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:42,529
I've been having
a comprehensive list compiled.

388
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,930
- Mr. Governor?
- Yes? What is it?

389
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,773
- It's time for your meeting
with the defense council.
- I'll be along in a moment.

390
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:51,654
- Defense council?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

391
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,535
Has this anything to do
with the list you just mentioned?

392
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,456
You'll be given full details.

393
00:32:56,521 --> 00:33:00,778
Meanwhile, we're going to recondition
this little fellow ourselves.

394
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:03,178
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr. Breck.

395
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:06,060
Well, I'm going to revive
a charming tradition

396
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,941
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife

397
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:10,862
and let you name yourself.

398
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:43,539
Caesar.

399
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,037
A king.

400
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:51,830
[Buzzer]

401
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,034
Yes?

402
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:59,005
They're waiting for you
in the council chamber.

403
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,963
We'll never make a bartender
out of Caesar.

404
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:06,237
Have him detailed
to the command post.

405
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:23,167
[Both Grunt]

406
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,656
[Whimpering]

407
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,995
No.

408
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:54,091
Attention. There are reports of
unescorted apes in the plaza.

409
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:56,270
Investigate.

410
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,829
No, no, when you're deciphering,

411
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:03,191
the internal indicator
is the second code.

412
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:07,512
- It hasn't been declassified yet.
- Can I help you?

413
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:09,717
This ape's been assigned
to the command post.

414
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,641
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.

415
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:15,189
- Start him off in the files.
Low priority traffic.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:18,557
First check the priority,
then the action addressee.

417
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:20,116
Do.

418
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,280
Lisa.

419
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:26,719
Lisa!

420
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,460
Ah, Senor Armando.

421
00:35:39,526 --> 00:35:41,382
Guards, you may go.

422
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,488
- This way, Senor.
- Sit down, sit down.

423
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,415
We have good news for you.

424
00:35:47,657 --> 00:35:49,032
Good news?

425
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:51,488
Yes.
You're to be released.

426
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:55,754
Inspector Hoskyns and I have come to
believe that your ape is not the child

427
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,156
of the two talking chimpanzees.

428
00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:01,998
You found him?

429
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:04,782
Not yet, but he'll turn up.

430
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,752
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

431
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:10,314
Please forgive us.
It was unavoidable.

432
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:12,242
Oh, yes, yes.

433
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:16,207
Then I'm free to go?

434
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:20,239
As soon as you sign
this sworn declaration.

435
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,639
What does it say?

436
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:27,480
Only what you've been saying-- that the
circus ape is incapable of human speech

437
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:30,679
and to the best of your knowledge
has never uttered a word.

438
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:33,715
- Certainly.
- Excellent.

439
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:38,230
We'll check this with the authenticator.
Then you'll be free to go.

440
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:43,386
- The, uh, authenticator?
- Oh, it's just a formality.

441
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:47,233
Sit back down, please.
It'll just take a moment.

442
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:03,485
What does the authenticator do?

443
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,693
It makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.

444
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:10,505
You said the first time you heard
the name Cornelius was in this office.

445
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,223
Was that true?

446
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:24,111
No.

447
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,249
Now, there.
You see?

448
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:29,290
But that's not really
a mark against you.

449
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:32,179
You most probably heard it
somewhere else before.

450
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:35,955
Now, about your statement,
sworn statement,

451
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:39,798
that the circus ape
is incapable of speech.

452
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:42,253
No.
I won't submit to this.

453
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,735
You will.

454
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:47,315
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!

455
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:48,761
Sit back, please.

456
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,642
No. No.

457
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,880
- Guard!
- No!

458
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:55,772
No.

459
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:01,437
Hell no!

460
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,521
I knew that circus owner was lying!

461
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:17,413
- He fell to his death accidentally.
- While trying to escape.

462
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,814
He knew he'd been exposed.

463
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,056
[Hissing]

464
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:32,259
Aah!

465
00:39:44,297 --> 00:39:46,818
Attention. Attention.

466
00:39:46,891 --> 00:39:49,001
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

467
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:51,173
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

468
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:55,914
a number of servant apes
from households throughout the city

469
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,811
who had gathered clan destinely
in the unused building

470
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:01,578
on the outskirts
of the east sector.

471
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,517
Property owners are firmly warned

472
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:06,927
that they bearsole responsibility

473
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:10,290
for the behavior and whereabouts
of their servant apes.

474
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:43,836
[Grunting]

475
00:40:57,253 --> 00:41:00,800
[All Hooting]

476
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:02,082
Frank.

477
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:08,808
Frank.

478
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:16,645
- [Grunts]
- No!

479
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,780
"One dozen steaks, New York cut,

480
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,270
for Mrs. Van Thal."

481
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:46,200
Yeah, OK.

482
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:48,601
Add one gallon of k--
No.

483
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,054
Two...

484
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,034
gallons...

485
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:57,241
of kerosene.

486
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:11,641
Mr. Governor,
the latest ape disobedience figures.

487
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:14,946
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.

488
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,534
It couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr. MacDonald.

489
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:20,707
Arrange for distribution
of the Achilles' List,

490
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:23,111
copies to each police precinct.

491
00:42:23,176 --> 00:42:26,472
Details are to be left
to the individual commanders,
but I want every ape on that list

492
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:31,177
rounded up and delivered to
the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.

493
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:34,147
I'm sorry, 309.
The cages are full.

494
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,036
We cannot accommodate any new intakes

495
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:39,175
until after Tuesday's auction.

496
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:41,832
I repeat that.
After Tuesday's auction.

497
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:50,923
"Collect one repaired Colt .45."

498
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,843
Add...

499
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:59,410
100 rounds ammunition.

500
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:10,000
The Achilles' List,
referring to our Achilles' heel,

501
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:12,826
contains the name of every ape
who over the past year

502
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,933
has been guilty of overt disobedience.

503
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:19,961
- The charge against them is nonsense.
- It will do for my purposes.

504
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:24,026
They constitute the hard core of our
problem, and I'm going to crush them.

505
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:27,394
You will only further
aggravate the problem.

506
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:32,447
This action is folly,
and I wish to protest it
in the strongest possible terms.

507
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,852
Very well, Mr. MacDonald.

508
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,918
Your protest has been duly noted.

509
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,498
From now on, you have one assignment--
to find that talking ape.

510
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,378
[All Shrieking]

511
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:55,941
[Buzzer]

512
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,601
What is this?
A red alert?

513
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:00,046
Sort of.

514
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:04,270
Ape Management computer's
come up with a rather intriguing error.

515
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:06,672
Shipment 507-l for Indonesia

516
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:09,073
comprised three orangutans
and one chimpanzee.

517
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,569
So?

518
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:14,387
There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.

519
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:16,396
Yes, sir. One moment.

520
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,805
State Security Chief Inspector Kolp
on line three.

521
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,245
Yes, Inspector?

522
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:24,088
Give me the Indonesian file
for last month.

523
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:27,602
That's 507 ex-Borneo.

524
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:29,846
Right, Inspector.
Let me check.

525
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:33,179
507 ex-Borneo.
Yes, sir.

526
00:44:33,245 --> 00:44:35,318
That chimpanzee was sold
to Governor Breck.

527
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,245
Just as I first thought!

528
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:40,126
We've had him under our noses
all the time!

529
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:43,936
I'll have the ape executed immediately
on your verbal orders alone.

530
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:46,271
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.

531
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:48,892
Get Mr. MacDonald
at the command post.

532
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:50,873
Suppose he won't speak?

533
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:52,836
I don't understand.

534
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:56,197
What the chief inspector means is,
there'd still be a doubt.

535
00:44:56,262 --> 00:44:59,133
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.

536
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,215
We'd like to close the file.

537
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:04,257
You shall.
I promise you.

538
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,665
Reconditioning applications
are made in triplicate.

539
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:09,994
A disturbance in the north plaza?
What kind of disturbance?

540
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,120
MacDonald speaking.
Yes, sir.

541
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:17,900
You want me to turn
Caesar over to Kolp?

542
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,422
He's on your Achilles' List?

543
00:45:20,496 --> 00:45:24,043
Mr. MacDonald,
do not question an order.

544
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:26,798
No, I'm not questioning the orders.

545
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:32,468
I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.

546
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:37,645
Yes, sir.
I'll do just as you say.

547
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,159
Come.

548
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:03,424
No, this goes
to Traffc Control!

549
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,240
Take it easy.
They can't read.

550
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,162
Not yet, they can't.

551
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:12,483
Do!

552
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,511
Mr. MacDonald,

553
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,722
are you near a phone?

554
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,881
Mr. MacDonald,
it is imperative

555
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:25,922
that you get to a phone.

556
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:30,605
Come in, Mr. MacDonald.
Do you hear me?

557
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:33,972
Get to a phone and come in.

558
00:46:34,997 --> 00:46:36,853
Now come in.

559
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:40,853
Yes, Mr. Governor?

560
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:43,092
Kelp is on his way.

561
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,682
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir.

562
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:49,530
- I'll keep a lookout.
- Notify me the moment he's handed over.

563
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:51,930
Yes, sir.

564
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:11,199
I wish...

565
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:15,524
I wish there was some way we could
communicate so you'd understand that l--

566
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:22,112
I understand,

567
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,040
Mr. MacDonald.

568
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:32,802
Yes, l--

569
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:35,299
I'm the one they're looking for.

570
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:48,754
I never believed it.
I thought you were a myth.

571
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,334
Well, I'm not.

572
00:47:52,405 --> 00:47:55,221
But I will tell you
something that is.

573
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:57,622
The belief that
human beings are kind.

574
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,597
No, Caesar.
There are some--

575
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:02,488
A handful, perhaps, but not most.

576
00:48:02,553 --> 00:48:06,264
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.

577
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:10,106
We can't do that
until we are free.

578
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:13,948
How do you propose
to gain this freedom?

579
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:18,456
By the only means left to us--
revolution.

580
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,016
But it's doomed to failure.

581
00:48:21,088 --> 00:48:22,911
Perhaps.

582
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:24,701
- This time.
- And the next.

583
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,553
- Maybe.
- But you'll keep trying.

584
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:32,193
You above every one else
should understand.

585
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,077
We cannot be free
until we have power.

586
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:38,820
How else can we achieve it?

587
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:48,617
Go!

588
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:05,900
Mr. MacDonald, I have an order to have
the ape Caesar taken into custody.

589
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:07,826
I know.
I've been looking for him.

590
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,834
- He's not in the command post?
- No.

591
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:14,033
Issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes.

[Shrieking]

594
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:02,529
I still don't see why
he made a run for it.

595
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:04,929
It's really quite simple.

596
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:07,100
The ape has intelligence.

597
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:09,376
He learned Armando was dead.

598
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:12,707
He assumed the man
betrayed him under torture.

599
00:51:12,774 --> 00:51:15,558
But we don't do that to humans.

600
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:22,948
Now.

601
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:33,605
Talk!

618
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:47,618
That's incredible.

619
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:51,174
Well, there's your proof.

620
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:52,872
We're convinced, Mr. Governor.

621
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:56,392
It's fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

622
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,319
Have it say something else.

623
00:53:02,003 --> 00:53:03,912
You heard the governor.

625
00:53:06,932 --> 00:53:08,143

[Growling]

627
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:18,003
- We could persuade him.
- No.

628
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,922
He's not responsible for what he is.

629
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:22,808
Still, seeing him there,

630
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:26,138
it's like looking
at some deadly bacillus

631
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:31,192
and knowing you've got it
bottled up at last.

632
00:53:34,431 --> 00:53:37,433
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.

633
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:42,941
I have authorization here from the
governor to have this beast destroyed.

634
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,385
I'll notify the vet.

635
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,036
He is wired for electrocution,
isn't he?

636
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:50,819
- Yes.
- Well, then electrocute him now.

637

- He's dead.
- Good.

641
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,541
Very good work, Inspector.

642
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,463
What happened to Mr. MacDonald?

643
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:47,384
I'm afraid his sensibility--

644
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,305
Ah, there you are.

645
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,510
- Is it over?
- Yes.

646
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,896
It's over.
Shall we go back to work?

647
00:55:57,174 --> 00:55:58,700
Lisa.

648
00:57:32,412 --> 00:57:33,819
All keepers and handlers,

649
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,274
attention, attention.

650
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:38,205
All keepers and handlers.

651
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,954
There's $50,000 worth of apes
in jeopardy.

652
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:44,287
Get them out of here alive.

653

Ohh!

656
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:31,141
Yes!
Commander, I understand the situation.

657
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:34,345
Assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them.

658
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:39,885
Order full mobilization
of all security forces--

659
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,741
police, militia
and reserve defense units.

660
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:44,777
Cordon off every entrance to the city.

661
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,666
Our control method is to include
tear gas and sedation darts?

662
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:52,370
There will be but one control method--
shoot to kill.

663
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,347
A small group of apes

664
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:56,278
scheduled for intensivere conditioning

665
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,678
have escaped from Ape Management.

666
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:00,719
Until they've been
rounded up by police,

667
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:03,729
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors.

668
01:00:03,802 --> 01:00:07,348
A further announcement will be made
as soon as recapture is effected.

669
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:09,875
I guess here it is.

670
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:14,614
Ape Management
is in the hands of the apes.

671
01:00:14,686 --> 01:00:17,884
Many officials are either dead
or held hostage.

672
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:21,749
The main band of rioting apes are at
this very moment marching on the city.

673
01:00:21,825 --> 01:00:24,642
It's been established that the ape mob

674
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:28,320
is under the command of
a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee

675
01:00:28,388 --> 01:00:30,145
who has...

676
01:00:30,213 --> 01:00:32,043
acquired the power of speech.

677
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:34,856
That idiot!
Get out a retraction immediately!

678
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:38,636
Announce that the talking ape
has been apprehended and put to death.

679
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:42,053
...the child of the two talking
chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira,

680
01:00:42,128 --> 01:00:44,944
who came to us from outer space
20years ago.

681
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:49,648
As such, he constitutes a threat
to the future to the whole human race.

682
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:15,219
Governor Breck has just issued
this order to all civilians.

683
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:17,269
Go to your homes.

and lock your doors.

01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:22,079
Above all, do not panic.

686
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:25,461
Repeat. Go to your homes,
stay in your homes

687
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:27,326
and lock your doors.

688
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:29,304
The situation can be controlled

689
01:01:29,379 --> 01:01:34,236
provided our defense forces
are given complete freedom of movement.

from pets into slaves?

Because your kind
were once our ancestors.

like the emperor moth

against flame throwers?

And, in that smoke,
from this day forward,

817
01:18:53,059 --> 01:18:58,363

and conspire and plot and plan

of man's downfall,

and self-destructively

turns his weapons against his own kind,

821
01:19:08,072 --> 01:19:11,008
the day of the writing in the sky

under radioactive rubble,

out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.

01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:28,212
We shall build our own cities in which
there will be no place for humans

Now we will put down our weapons.

836
01:20:53,818 --> 01:20:57,529
We have passed through
the night of the fires,

837
01:20:58,843 --> 01:21:01,877
and those who were our masters

838
01:21:01,949 --> 01:21:04,852
are now our servants!

839
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:09,019
And we, who are not human,

840
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:13,627
can afford to be humane.

841
01:21:13,697 --> 01:21:16,698
Destiny is the will of God,

842
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:21,562
and if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,

843
01:21:21,636 --> 01:21:23,841
it is God's will

844
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:28,516
that he be dominated with compassion

845
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,454
