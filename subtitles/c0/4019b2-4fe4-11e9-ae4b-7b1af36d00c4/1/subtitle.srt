1
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,602
Nanny, what's with the young miss?

2
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,702
Such innovative style?

3
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:15,896
Just spicing up the routine

4
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,507
We've been here at least 100 times
this month

5
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,804
It gets boring
she needs stimulation

6
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,121
Make way... make way!

7
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,485
Make way!

8
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:39,694
Oh no! It's her again!

9
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,094
You can't see me...

10
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,202
None of these fortunetellers
are any good and it stinks

11
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,030
Foo, right?!

12
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,669
Yes, ma'am

13
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,870
Let's just go home

14
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,142
Hey, Chan

15
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,581
Still trying to set me up?

16
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,848
You're just too picky

17
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,390
Sit...

18
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,698
These beauties are all
from out of town

19
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,358
Have a nice chat

20
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:21,539
Miss, what's your profession?

21
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,037
I'm an escort,

22
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,302
But I don't worry, I don't do sex

23
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,842
So what do you do?

24
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,913
Drinking games!

25
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,494
Sir, what do you do?

26
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,356
A question for me?

27
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,629
I'm a poet

28
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,335
How does a poet make a living?

29
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:38,561
By publishing

30
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,534
How many books have you published?

31
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:42,372
None... yet

32
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,633
So, you're really a bum?

33
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,442
Remember to invite me to your funeral!

34
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:48,909
I'll definitely be there!

35
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,410
You're too picky

36
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:53,312
How will you get a wife?

37
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:06,829
Let me do the introduction!

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,726
No, we kids can take care of ourselves

39
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:14,832
Bro, even you're better looking
than he is

40
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:18,235
Not by much, it's just the hair

41
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,505
Who are you?

42
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,946
I'm her brother,

43
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,948
Also known as Beijing's Best Dressed

44
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,211
Super Double Blades...

45
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,348
Brave heart...

46
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,288
Stop!
Can't possibly remember all that

47
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:37,128
Good! Straightforward!
I dig your style!

48
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:38,461
Cheers

49
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,234
What's your name?

50
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,458
Flying Cloud

51
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:45,897
Any alias?

52
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,094
Spiderman!

53
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,441
I like you!

54
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:52,833
Cheers!

55
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,645
Why Spiderman?

56
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,781
Cause it sounds cool

57
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,483
Good! Fair enough!

58
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,812
I like you, too!
Bottoms-up!

59
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,920
Miss Liu, am I suitable?

60
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:16,193
You're strong, talented...

61
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:19,428
funny and macho...

62
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,095
a natural leader...

63
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,266
Overall, a pretty good catch

64
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,441
Keen observations. Well said

65
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,809
But this entourage...

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,845
to bring all these bodyguards...

67
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:32,641
it feels like an invasion
not a courtship

68
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:35,718
My boys are my best advisers

69
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:39,489
You need advise in picking a wife?

70
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,317
For reference

71
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,722
You're suspicious, paranoid
and indecisive

72
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,863
Bad-tempered
probably have sleeping disorders

73
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,567
You're brave but indecisive

74
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,703
You've got a lot of bodyguards...

75
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,567
which shows that you're really a coward

76
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,572
I'll marry you right now

77
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:58,801
Look, who's indecisive now?!

78
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,069
Marry me?

79
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:01,941
What do you love about me?

80
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,776
Eh.... can't find the words...

81
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,042
I just want to get close to you

82
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,845
Not close enough for you?

83
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,249
How close do you want to get?

84
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,718
Skin to skin, if you know what I mean

85
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,293
Over tea? You outta of mind?

86
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,430
Check please

87
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:24,498
Ms. Moth Liu

88
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,433
Thank you, six dollars

89
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,403
She's paying. She asked for the check

90
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:41,877
Bottoms up!

91
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,118
Good luck...

92
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,349
finding a man who'll have you...

93
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:47,918
BITCH!

94
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,492
You sonofagun!

95
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:56,826
Fat spider! I'll squash you

96
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,034
I'll never marry you. Fat Spider!

97
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:01,901
Fat Spider!

98
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,017
Sir, your sister is in trouble...

99
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,778
Help her!

100
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:16,118
Let's wait and see

101
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,122
Her temper will get her killed
one day

102
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,360
Maybe he's the man to subdue her

103
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,133
Damn!

104
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,400
Mister, lend me your washboard

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,791
Stop!

106
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:34,499
Stop!

107
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:56,279
Looks like blood will be shed today

108
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,019
Hey, stop messing around

109
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:03,751
I can squash you with a finger...

110
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:05,956
but if you hold me hostage...

111
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:07,961
maybe we can force my sister
to marry you

112
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,465
Take my blade and gently slash me...

113
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,466
she'll have to say yes to save me

114
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:13,798
See, I'm really on your side

115
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:19,578
Ms. Moth Liu!

116
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,177
If you don't marry me
I'll kill your brother

117
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,146
Sis, he risks his life for you

118
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,750
He really loves you!

119
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,214
I'll slaughter him now!

120
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,685
Hey! That's a deep cut!

121
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,692
Sorry, I got too excited

122
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:38,022
Sis, listen! These may be my last words

123
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:41,159
True love is hard to find

124
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,198
When love comes knocking, you can't...

125
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,495
Sir, let's stop the bleeding first

126
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,432
I'm OK!

127
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,443
Sis, calm down!

128
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,114
There'll always be someone better but...

129
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,874
it's really time you settle down...

130
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,348
and marry someone like Spiderman here

131
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:01,953
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,885
He's an ass. I'll never marry him!

133
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,782
Even if you're not ready to settle down

134
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,583
at least set him down

135
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:12,491
Dear Ms. Hercules...

136
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:16,866
don't mind me

137
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,937
The scenery up here is fantastic

138
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,333
In fact, I'm enjoying the cool breeze

139
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,337
I'm not in a hurry, take your time

140
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:28,639
It's getting a bit stuffy

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,286
Excuse me... it... sounds like

142
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,082
I may fall soon!

143
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,522
Are you marrying me or not!

144
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,059
The country is at war...

145
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,699
and you able-body warriors...

146
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,402
are killing each other...

147
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,195
Personal vendettas
when your country is at war

148
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:30,375
Have you no shame?

149
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:31,838
The heavens is...

150
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,170
weeping at your folly!

151
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,944
What are you mumbling about?

152
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,678
Put simply, what l'm saying...

153
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,650
We're being invaded and
instead of fighting the enemies...

154
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:46,087
you're here killing each other instead

155
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,316
Say, if your mom asks you to study...

156
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:48,925
would you go play football instead!

157
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:49,822
Where's your priority!

158
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:51,290
Defeating the true enemy...

159
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,963
that's real courage

160
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,092
I understand now

161
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,261
How dare you drag my mom into this...
want to die?

162
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,368
You're so dumb!

163
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,099
You ignorant pig
He's trying to explain

164
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,705
Mr. Cloud! Stop...

165
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,971
First: It's obvious
you're not her man

166
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,082
Second: This scholar
is sabotaging our plan

167
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,785
I wonder what his motives are...

168
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:14,850
Third...

169
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,646
I'm bleeding to death! It's over

170
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,618
I'm fainting...

171
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,955
The country needs me. I'm going!

172
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,098
Sir, thanks for your advise!

173
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,766
See you!

174
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,336
Hope not!

175
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,070
When will there be peace again?

176
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,543
What happened to brotherly love?

177
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,440
What's your name?

178
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:47,207
Last name's Chan

179
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,887
Parents liked the seasons

180
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:51,516
Spring Chan?

181
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,054
Seasonal Chan!

182
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,956
And you?

183
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,193
Last name's Liu. My mother liked...

184
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,193
moths to flames

185
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,557
Flaming Liu?

186
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:03,692
Moth Liu!

187
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,234
Pleased to meet you!

188
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,436
Pleasure's all mine

189
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,430
Obviously

190
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,903
Your words...

191
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,669
are more convincing than my fists

192
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:16,641
I'm impressed

193
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,610
I'm more than a man of words

194
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,582
I'm a philosopher, too

195
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:25,489
I'm off, see you again soon

196
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,494
Come see for yourself!

197
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,329
The latest autographed
Poet Soo poster

198
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:40,094
They're authentic signatures

199
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,738
Who else has a beard like that?

200
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,168
Ake your time, calm down...

201
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,803
Let go of my hand

202
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,309
Soo, I love you!

203
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,572
Come see for yourself!

204
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,283
Calm down, take your time...

205
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,245
Look at you, your mascara is running

206
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,248
Miss, do I look terrible?

207
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,549
No, no, you've got style

208
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,793
Soo'll be impressed

209
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,255
But Soo doesn't even know me

210
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:03,756
I'd be impressed if he does

211
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,574
Your idol must be an incredible man

212
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,182
Wow, even the Emperor's here

213
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:31,883
Cousin!

214
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,716
Cousin Long, what're you doing here?

215
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,985
Soo's a pal and I'm the event sponsor

216
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,026
Ladies and gentlemen!

217
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:44,101
The Valentino of poetry!

218
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,136
Sponsored by Long Far Pharmaceuticals

219
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:56,840
Let the Love Forever Reading...

220
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,516
begin!

221
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,334
Soo Tung Bo!

222
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,714
Soo Tung Bo!

223
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,248
How're you doing!

224
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:38,786
Good!

225
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:39,686
And you!

226
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:43,954
And you! Great!

227
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:48,000
And you! Great!

228
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:51,635
Friends in the back!

229
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:58,501
Sipping wine and

230
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,216
Waiting for the moon

231
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:07,843
don't know when...

232
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:12,424
I dream of...

233
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:17,426
riding on the wind...

234
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:22,191
lonely is the night...

235
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:26,835
dancing in the dark...

236
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:31,338
with shadows around me...

237
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:36,072
feels like heaven...

238
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:47,084
sleepless is the night

239
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,420
no hate...

240
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,157
just regrets howling at moon...

241
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,865
Soo, I love you!

242
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,802
If only your love is forever...

243
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:05,941
that love will conquer all...

244
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,840
the future is unpredictable...

245
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,994
Wow, what a group

246
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,761
Even the Emperor is here!

247
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,857
A round of applause for my friend

248
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:28,262
The special guest of the evening
Seasonal Chan!

249
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,495
A feast in the palace to honor me

250
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,223
Your majesty, I love you!

251
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,074
Seasonal Chan

252
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,860
Good evening

253
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,997
You were fantastic!

254
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,302
That was a disaster

255
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,500
perhaps, maybe...

256
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:58,372
Maybe my style is too post-modernist

257
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,478
to understand

258
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,150
Did you understand my performance?

259
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,177
Sure

260
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:08,719
Your words were from your heart
I feel it

261
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,654
Your style is creative and alternative

262
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,124
One day, they'll learn
to appreciate your talent!

263
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,425
You flatter me!

264
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,931
I found something unique in your work

265
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:28,837
There's innocence, depth...

266
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,045
and meaning

267
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,144
If you work harder

268
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,077
One day, they'll love it, too!

269
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,095
The perfect match...
go get married!

270
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,897
Sure, a good match!

271
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,362
You howling your crazy songs

272
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,505
And she waving her crazy glowing stick

273
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,232
my head's still spinning from it

274
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:34,406
The perfect odd couple

275
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,439
Perfectly odd!

276
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:38,144
Perfectly odd!

277
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,371
I order you to get married!

278
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,048
Your names?

279
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:43,147
Seasonal Chan!

280
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,080
And you?

281
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,148
Moth Liu CHAN!

282
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm so lucky...

283
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,625
Miss is back!

284
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,299
Where were you last night?

285
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,024
We're all worried sick!

286
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,403
Got married last night!

287
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,604
To him?

288
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,882
Brother-in-law?

289
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:51,150
Cousin only

290
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:52,182
Brother!

291
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,752
What's your name?

292
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:55,581
Chan

293
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,280
Chan what?

294
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,082
Seasonal

295
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:57,951
Got it!

296
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,956
Got what?

297
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,296
Thank you for marrying my sister

298
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:03,954
May the heavens bless you
with good health

299
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,531
Sister sold-- no refund, no exchange

300
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,029
Thank you lord!

301
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,634
Hey, what's this! Talk to me!

302
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,029
Savior...

303
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,931
My cousin married you already

304
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:14,166
you'll protect her

305
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,235
Sure!

306
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:19,071
You've got to take care of her health

307
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:24,313
Here are some medicines for her!

308
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,647
This will improve her chi!
Guaranteed to work

309
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:28,981
Make her eat more!

310
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:34,620
This is for you
1000-year-old ginseng

311
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,026
You'll need it to survive her beatings!

312
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,065
Swallow it and it'll save your life

313
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,235
But...

314
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,505
it's too big to swallow!

315
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:47,274
Ground it, just suck, don't swallow

316
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Come

317
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,666
This is my house

318
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,773
Stop, let's get off here

319
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:57,713
Honey, help me down, thanks

320
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,112
My wife!

321
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:06,686
Seasonal, Seasonal!

322
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:08,516
Come here!

323
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,417
You're finally a star

324
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:14,962
The Emperor blessed your marriage

325
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,199
Can I have your autograph?

326
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:21,564
I love your work, you're great...

327
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,909
Master, welcome home

328
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:37,552
A woman just landed in our front yard...

329
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,590
Master, who's that?

330
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,560
The mistress!

331
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,122
Madame!

332
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:49,832
Hurry!

333
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:51,495
Good day, madam

334
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:53,671
I'm your butler Wong Choy!

335
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:54,836
Good!

336
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,303
Long live your majesty!

337
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,776
Long live your majesty!

338
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:07,678
Impressively trained!

339
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:09,213
Please rise...

340
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:11,217
Thank you!

341
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:13,320
Miss, where should we put Baby?

342
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:17,693
Ma'am, here's all the household
accounts...

343
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:18,725
All the accounts

344
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:19,887
all yours

345
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:20,894
Very good

346
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,326
Thank you, ma'am!

347
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,031
Stop calling me ma'am
It makes me sound old

348
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,133
Call me something else!

349
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:29,395
Master!

350
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:32,372
No, my husband is the master
of the house

351
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,079
You're She-master and
he'll be He-master

352
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:39,714
Tell me, does he...
have a girlfriend?

353
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:41,949
He-master says

354
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:43,916
we're not to speak of his affairs

355
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:45,417
We cannot divulge his secrets

356
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:46,784
Loyalty, I like that!

357
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:48,124
Here's your reward!

358
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:49,787
Thank you, She-master!

359
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:52,485
I'll leave you, He-master

360
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,531
What's wrong?

361
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:02,795
Will you hit me?

362
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,066
Not unless you did something wrong!

363
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,973
If I do, you must have done
something wrong

364
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:11,809
What are your definitions of wrong?

365
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,914
From now on
you'll love no one but me

366
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:15,414
You'll spoil me; never lie to me

367
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:16,915
Fulfill all your promises

368
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,849
Always tell me the truth

369
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,581
Never argue with me, have faith in me

370
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,523
Protect me, stand up for me

371
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:25,752
Share my laughter

372
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:27,794
Wipe away my tears

373
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,398
Promise that I'll always be only one
in your eyes

374
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:30,794
The only one in your dream

375
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,298
The only one in your heart!

376
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:33,769
Simple enough

377
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:36,062
Can you do this?

378
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:37,771
Sure!

379
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,141
Look, a beauty

380
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,750
Snow White from a distance...

381
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:52,286
Wicked Stepmother up close

382
00:25:57,028 --> 00:26:01,624
Chan, the Club is hosting
a Persian Night soon!

383
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,398
You're teasing me?

384
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,805
Don't you have errands to run?

385
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:10,672
You're pushing it

386
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,802
This is male bonding time
women should go home

387
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:15,604
Let's drink, brother Soo!

388
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,438
Go home and make dinner!

389
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:21,717
Don't worry

390
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,615
We've got a really good cook

391
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,317
A sharp tongue

392
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:29,151
Tame her now or it'll be too late

393
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:32,387
Tong, get the 9th concubine
to come here right away!

394
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,328
9th concubine!

395
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:41,895
Coming! Coming...

396
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,412
What took you so long?

397
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:49,578
I was taking a bath

398
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:50,942
Go home now...

399
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,547
Not bad, come and go as you please

400
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,051
Impressive

401
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:01,315
You can do it, too.
Try

402
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:14,839
Honey

403
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:27,810
Please go home

404
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:32,648
Are you deaf

405
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:35,525
We'll trick her

406
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,757
Are you a man? Where's your dignity!

407
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,696
You can't even stand up to your woman

408
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,034
We despise you!

409
00:27:46,237 --> 00:27:47,704
We despise you!

410
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:50,505
Got it...

411
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,609
Even I despise myself!

412
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:54,869
I'm not a man

413
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,909
Can you slap me again?

414
00:27:57,148 --> 00:27:58,706
Sure, despicable!

415
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,611
We despise you!

416
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:05,952
Honey, I'll run along now...

417
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:08,250
I'll be the perfect wife...

418
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,356
and always give you face

419
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:14,697
I'll go home now and run really
really fast

420
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:16,433
You have fun

421
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:24,502
Persian night promotion, 20% off
Free fruit plates, too

422
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:25,267
Do they take cards?

423
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:25,966
What kind of cards?

424
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:26,643
Birthday cards!

425
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:27,770
They'll give you free wine for cards!

426
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:34,975
Cheers!

427
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:36,886
What a treat...

428
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:44,795
Persian pussy cats!

429
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:54,866
You're Soo's family?

430
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,370
I'll show you and beat you up!

431
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:07,281
Seasonal Chan!...

432
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:10,521
Seasonal Chan!...

433
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:13,185
Seasonal Chan!...

434
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:15,155
Seasonal Chan!...

435
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:16,824
Master Soo!

436
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,187
Where's Seasonal Chan!

437
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,263
Brother Soo? What's wrong?

438
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:24,934
Seasonal, look for yourself
my entire household...

439
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:27,036
Over twenty of them were beaten up
by your wife

440
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:29,365
Look what she did!
How do you propose to settle this?

441
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:30,435
You see for yourself!

442
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,082
Good God...

443
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,629
If I slapped you, hit me!

444
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,666
Not my wives,

445
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:36,135
My children, my family!

446
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:03,461
Sammi...

447
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:08,030
How can you hit a helpless puppy!

448
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,263
Does she have a heart?

449
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:14,639
Brother Soo...

450
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,972
Your wife, your call

451
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,840
If you still consider me a friend

452
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,345
Give me justice, show me you're a man

453
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:22,051
Punish her and make her pay!

454
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:39,230
Why! Why did you do this!

455
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:46,171
Why...

456
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:49,105
Say you're sorry!

457
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,339
If you want me to stop beating you
say...

458
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:55,942
Tell me you're sorry!

459
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:05,026
Ouch! You're hurting me!

460
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:06,127
They are innocent

461
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,025
Why did you beat up his family?

462
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:10,430
Only I can hit you, no one else!

463
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:13,161
What gives you the right
to beat up others?

464
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:14,530
Why are you so self-righteous...

465
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:15,898
And I can't punish you?

466
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:17,098
You're just a bully!

467
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:25,341
Help! Help...

468
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:27,808
Help!

469
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:31,287
Who do you think you are!

470
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:36,259
Help! Mom, help!

471
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:40,123
Moth Liu, I'll make you pay
for hurting...

472
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:42,390
every concubine, every child

473
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,625
and the dog. What do you have to say?

474
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:47,027
Nothing, I didn't do this!

475
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:49,206
I only kicked down your front door

476
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:51,138
Are you kidding

477
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,002
I didn't come all the way
in the middle of the night...

478
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:55,178
to weave a tale for your entertainment

479
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:58,682
You don't frighten me...

480
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:01,248
nor am I the least bit amused

481
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:02,817
Do you think
I can be so easily bullied?

482
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:04,722
Don't push me!

483
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:15,597
She beat me up! She beat me up!

484
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,166
Now, I'll really give you
a good lashing!

485
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:19,697
She beat me up...

486
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,567
Honey, calm down!

487
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:23,604
How?!
I'm burning like the torches!

488
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,209
Torches don't fuel tempers

489
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:27,639
I'm fuming!

490
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:29,979
I've something to say!

491
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,709
Mister and ma'am, I'm sorry!

492
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:38,316
Me, mister? How old are you?

493
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:41,055
Abnormal growth hormones...
I'm only 14!

494
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:45,722
What do you want to say?

495
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,789
Ma'am didn't hit me!

496
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:51,259
So what caused your injuries?

497
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,502
Auntie...

498
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,638
Hit me when she crashed into the wall!

499
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:01,670
You're Soo's family!

500
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,006
Creditors!

501
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:06,009
Wrong person!

502
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:08,082
Uncle went mad and
pushed me to the ground!

503
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:10,713
Cousin slammed the stool on my head!

504
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:21,231
We came all the way
in the middle of the night

505
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,664
To frame you

506
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:26,400
Good boy, honesty is the best policy

507
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:27,766
Next time, remember to shave
before you go out!

508
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,907
Got it?

509
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:30,898
Soo

510
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:32,940
I beat up my wife for nothing

511
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:35,443
You owe me one

512
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,442
Your wife started all this

513
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,277
Unless she apologizes
our friendship is over!

514
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,577
So drastic!

515
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,120
My family's looking to me
for justice

516
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:47,052
Give me face?

517
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,590
OK?

518
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:55,593
OK! Let the ceremony begin!

519
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:07,702
You alright?

520
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:09,914
Silly girl, that's a dangerous spot!

521
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:19,349
Seasonal Chan! You're a sissy!

522
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,049
Will you promise

523
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,557
You'll never beat up anyone again
especially me?

524
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:26,427
No!

525
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,790
Hand me your favorite thrashing rod!

526
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:31,332
No, please

527
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,800
The rod!

528
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:40,906
Honey, the rod

529
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:45,380
So your friends are more important

530
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:46,381
Give me your hand!

531
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,218
One Two

532
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,886
Don't move

533
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,180
One

534
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,017
Two Three

535
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:58,361
Let's go inside!

536
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:00,322
Thank you. Honey!

537
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,160
You'll not to leave the house
without my permission!

538
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:02,766
That's tough!

539
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:03,557
I hold you responsible
for the He-master!

540
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:05,229
I swear I'll hit you, too!

541
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:08,502
Help! Help!

542
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:10,174
Close the door first! He-master!

543
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,333
Help! Help!

544
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:13,702
Help! Help!

545
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,568
Honey, let's go walk the dog!

546
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,018
Honey,

547
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,550
You should read more

548
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:57,346
Knowledge will give you wings!

549
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:03,551
Your daddy's so cool!

550
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,067
Go sleep in the bed
you'll catch a cold

551
00:37:18,644 --> 00:37:20,509
Honey

552
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:24,244
Come on...

553
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,455
He-master

554
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:44,197
Where do you think you are going?

555
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:49,438
Wong, let me go out

556
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,768
I need to have some fun!

557
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:56,308
What do you think I am?

558
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,418
I'm only loyal to you!

559
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:04,451
Wong! Master!

560
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:08,185
Are you setting me up?

561
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:11,059
Master, I'm on your side

562
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,457
I've to understand the enemy

563
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:14,495

564
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,997
Then, I can save your ass

565
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:20,469
- Wong
- Yes, master

566
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,141
I can't leave you behind and
sneak out alone

567
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,277
Why don't you come and
have some fun too

568
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:27,104
Let's go

569
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,308
No, you need to stay behind and
watch her

570
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,413
OK, sir

571
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,317
Almost time...

572
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:35,311
For anesthesia smoke

573
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:06,716
Soo!

574
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,614
A hug?

575
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:11,187
Your wife may hit you for this
aren't you scared?

576
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,454
Yes, but you'll protect me

577
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:17,184
It's no fun without you!

578
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,761
Let's go then

579
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:23,162
Told you he can't resist
the temptation!

580
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,098
Honey,

581
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:34,370
Wong!

582
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:37,643
Good morning! She-master!

583
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,080
Good morning! She-master!

584
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,983
He-master went to the Club!

585
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,850
There are tons of She-Masters
there tonight!

586
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:51,852
Hey, bottoms-up!

587
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,088
Let's make them drink!

588
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:56,426
- They're so boring; make them drink
- Sure...

589
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,035
We're cool naturally!

590
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:00,000
We can just sip!

591
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:00,969
OK!

592
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,764
Moth Liu is coming!

593
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,539
Moth Liu loves beating everyone up!

594
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:08,406
Where's she?

595
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:10,315
Gottcha!

596
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:11,516
It's not funny!

597
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,183
You're scared away all the girls!

598
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,516
It's not funny!

599
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,722
If it weren't for you
where'd we get all these chicks!

600
00:40:57,296 --> 00:40:59,264
You're a pal!

601
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:04,334
Chan...

602
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:06,128
Where's your girl?

603
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,905
Why are you all alone!

604
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,103
I want to go home

605
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:12,709
I miss my wife

606
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,570
But you're humping!

607
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,939
Yeah, so what?

608
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,638
I'll find you a check!

609
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:21,443
Too kind of you

610
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,514
You look like a beauty!

611
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,753
Sit here...

612
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,520
Closer

613
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,592
Stop humping!

614
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:41,071
Nice to knead you

615
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:42,735
Knead me?

616
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,208
What's with you?

617
00:41:52,618 --> 00:41:53,915
Let's belly-dance!

618
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:03,853
Moth Liu's here!

619
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:04,960
Moth Liu?

620
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:09,198
You're ruining the party...
wait, stop!

621
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:12,494
Sir, are you alright?

622
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,035
I'm fine.... you run along now

623
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:15,171
Moth Liu is coming

624
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:17,976
No one is coming

625
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:20,334
Are you sure?!

626
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,473
Not again?

627
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,250
Who's Moth Liu?

628
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:30,352
Why are you so scared?

629
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:35,121
Drink

630
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:55,243
I'm spinning

631
00:42:56,481 --> 00:43:00,508
Hurry. I wanna...

632
00:43:02,988 --> 00:43:04,353
You bastard! Belly-dance!

633
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:09,520
Honey, I'm home... sweet dreams

634
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:12,089
Honey...

635
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,859
You screw around and
you miss your wife?

636
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:18,000
You're getting a good deal!

637
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,169
Sure...

638
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:24,439
I fell in love the first time
I saw you

639
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,806
I knew I would spend the rest of
my life with you

640
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:31,477
Only you can...

641
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,942
Make me a better person

642
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,917
Only...

643
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,757
Only if you'd not hit me
or anyone else again...

644
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,830
I'm scared, honey...

645
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:49,333
Honey...

646
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:53,936
My head's hurting. I'm in pain...

647
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,373
Honey...

648
00:43:58,577 --> 00:43:59,669
Honey

649
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:08,115
Are you really drunk?

650
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:09,911
Of course I'm drunk

651
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:15,282
Why else would I confess to you?

652
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:18,624
Really trashed...

653
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:23,127
Honey, where are you?

654
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,462
Right here, right next to you

655
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:30,297
Tired, sleepy...

656
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:31,840
Sleep now, sleep!

657
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,691
Wong, how did I get home last night?

658
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:58,327
Good morning!

659
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:03,539
Good morning!

660
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:07,742
Your outfit --- cleaned and ironed!

661
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:09,837
Burn it, burn it...

662
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,151
Wong, come here

663
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,922
What's up with you?

664
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,151
She-master has ordered me to dance

665
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,090
For the rest of the month

666
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,956
Where's the nearest cliff?

667
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:26,688
Why?

668
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:27,796
I want to jump off it

669
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,433
Just run for your life!

670
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:32,634
You think I can escape?

671
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:41,877
Honey!

672
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,613
So healthy... morning exercises!

673
00:45:46,185 --> 00:45:48,449
Yes, good for your health!

674
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:56,390
No, no, honey

675
00:45:57,696 --> 00:45:58,720
Shut up!

676
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,227
Honey

677
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,231
You like to watch belly-dance?

678
00:46:05,437 --> 00:46:06,461
Not really

679
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,533
It's OK, if you like it...

680
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:10,301
Wong will perform you during the day

681
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:12,602
I'd personally perform for you
every night

682
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,335
No, it's OK...

683
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:16,612
Promise me

684
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,316
You'd not mess around again

685
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:19,916
OK...

686
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,680
I have faith in you

687
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:25,320
Finally, one big happy family

688
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:27,889
Can I make a request, honey?

689
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,286
I'll kill him now!

690
00:46:29,628 --> 00:46:32,256
He-master, stop...

691
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:40,196
His majesty needs your service

692
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:42,637
Long live his majesty!

693
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,740
Who'll volunteer to test the new drug?

694
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:46,608
I will!

695
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:48,640
You, come here

696
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,314
Go with the imperial doctor

697
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,149
The tests are finished!

698
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:02,151
Let's have the report

699
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:05,625
This is Lucky

700
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:09,127
This is Lucky's puppy lover

701
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:11,769
and now is his wife

702
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,267
They've sworn that

703
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:17,033
They'll always love each other

704
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:21,077
Lucky's favorite food is his wife's
tea-flavored eggs!

705
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,611
Come, Mrs. Lucky

706
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:29,087
Lucky cannot recognize his wife

707
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:32,621
After drinking the Love Eraser

708
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,756
Lucky...

709
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:36,052
Lucky...

710
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,696
Lucky!

711
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:40,523
Majesty, with this magic drug

712
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,668
Our army will be invincible!

713
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,769
Love unites men

714
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,565
Without love

715
00:47:49,842 --> 00:47:52,003
What's there to fight for?

716
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:56,141
I order this drug be banned forever!

717
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:58,715
Majesty, what wisdom!

718
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:07,925
- Watch it, it hurts...
- It's good for you

719
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:08,923
Bro, what's with you?

720
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:12,357
I walked into a bank robbery

721
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:13,929
I'm fine, I'm fine

722
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,326
Really?

723
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:17,128
But, don't you have
to make a delivery today?

724
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:19,334
Yeah

725
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:24,937
Honey

726
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,509
Honey

727
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:29,273
You're another's wife and
you still have to work for me

728
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,039
I feel bad

729
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,544
Honey, I'll be back soon

730
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:36,084
Three days, I promise

731
00:48:36,755 --> 00:48:37,585
Hurry!

732
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:44,823
Honey!

733
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:47,160
Honey!

734
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,891
The sun is setting

735
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,107
Honey, while you're gone
I'll write a book

736
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,303
When you come back
you'll be the first to read it

737
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:03,310
What's your theme?

738
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,006
A secret

739
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:10,586
You've seen my family jade charm

740
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,483
Your mom gave it to you?

741
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:16,221
You want to give it to me?

742
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:19,397
Don't, the charm is to protect you

743
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:24,259
Why don't we split it in half...

744
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,765
And we'll both be protected

745
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,743
Mom!

746
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:48,492
It's OK, it seals our love

747
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,792
I'll be back soon!

748
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,290
OK

749
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:09,407
Ghost story,

750
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:00,026
Bunny!

751
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:04,628
Where?

752
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,007
A meek little thing!

753
00:51:17,816 --> 00:51:21,343
Chop, chop, chop. You chop, I chop...

754
00:51:21,587 --> 00:51:23,714
I only invited you to snack

755
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:24,718
Why did you bring...

756
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,787
this scary Taoist monk!

757
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:27,855
He's an old friend

758
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:30,586
He came for my famous dish
you've a problem?

759
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,993
Bring the rabbit!

760
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:36,427
OK!

761
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,712
Gentle sir

762
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:08,889
Gentle sir

763
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:10,532
Bunny demon?

764
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:11,962
The fire's cackling

765
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:13,796
Bunny demon!

766
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,371
Skin it before you season it

767
00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:17,598
I said Demon!

768
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:20,377
Demon, I'll cook the demon!

769
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:25,377
Help!

770
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,551
Help...

771
00:52:32,224 --> 00:52:34,886
Demon...

772
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,862
It's gone...

773
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:02,983
Stupid, get out of the way!

774
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:05,247
Help!

775
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:06,515
Wait for me...

776
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:08,916
Demon!

777
00:53:09,328 --> 00:53:10,989
Help me!

778
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:19,129
Gentle sir, let me explain...

779
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:22,204
You and I were once deities

780
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:24,204
You were the God of Virgins

781
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,967
I was the Goddess of Innocence

782
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:29,912
We were tricked by the God of Peaches

783
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:32,945
And banished from heaven

784
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:35,676
Zeus took pity

785
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:37,184
And granted us seven lifetimes

786
00:53:37,456 --> 00:53:38,923
as man and wife

787
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:42,488
This is the seventh lifetime

788
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:45,819
If we don't consummate our love,

789
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:50,265
I'll reincarnate as a dog

790
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:55,366
Can you not take pity on me?

791
00:53:57,009 --> 00:54:00,968
Sir, it's only a one-night stand

792
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:06,443
But... you're a bunny

793
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,253
Inside and out, from top to bottom

794
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,888
I'm a beautiful young girl

795
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:14,383
Can't you see?

796
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,390
Be gentle to your servant girl

797
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,832
After tonight

798
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:26,897
When the sun rises

799
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,806
I'll vanish forever

800
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,270
Never bother you again

801
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,770
Servant girl, the sun's out

802
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:02,338
Hurry, get out of here

803
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,304
Before you vaporize

804
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:04,941
Shush!

805
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:09,239
Maids!

806
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:11,013
Maids?

807
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,182
What?

808
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:16,515
Good morning, princess!

809
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:17,986
OK, OK, rise!

810
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:21,158
It's all because I admire your talent

811
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:23,486
So I came up with this scheme

812
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:28,497
If only you're single

813
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:31,067
Then I didn't have to work
this hard to get you

814
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:45,777
You're really the princess?

815
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:50,080
So what about last night?

816
00:55:50,322 --> 00:55:51,789
I'll explain

817
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,457
The breeze was my chi

818
00:55:57,696 --> 00:55:59,220
The demon...

819
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,626
there were five of us

820
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:03,693
The princess included!

821
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,795
Bought the bunny at the market

822
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,332
I'd swear we didn't see anything

823
00:56:22,221 --> 00:56:25,884
Life in the palace is boring

824
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:29,888
You artists lead such an exciting life

825
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,023
I really envy you

826
00:56:33,866 --> 00:56:34,890
Safe journey, princess!

827
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:01,793
Savior!

828
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:04,992
Brother-in-law, so early?

829
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,189
Surprise!

830
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:09,099
Honey!

831
00:57:19,512 --> 00:57:20,501
Honey!

832
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,279
Honey, did you miss me?

833
00:57:22,715 --> 00:57:23,841
Of course, honey

834
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,017
Missed you so much!

835
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,120
So did she, she really hurried back

836
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:30,720
She rode all day and all night

837
00:57:30,957 --> 00:57:32,982
She hasn't even eaten or showered

838
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,057
Brother!

839
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:36,485
Skipping a meal may keep you slim

840
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:38,095
But skipping a shower, take a bath

841
00:57:38,297 --> 00:57:39,787
Why don't I fix you a bubble bath

842
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:41,566
Do I stink? Not really

843
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:42,598
Let me see

844
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:45,571
Even your sweat is sweet

845
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:48,128
How sweet is it?

846
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,709
Sweet as roses

847
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,979
Honey, don't bathe again!

848
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:56,110
He-master!

849
00:57:57,717 --> 00:57:58,877
Someone's looking for you!

850
00:58:07,426 --> 00:58:08,415
I don't know her,

851
00:58:08,661 --> 00:58:10,060
tell her to go away

852
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:11,261
Close the gate and let the dog out!

853
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:26,242
The dog's out!

854
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,042
Honey, let's go take a bath!

855
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,514
Who's she?

856
00:58:33,486 --> 00:58:35,351
Looks exactly like a kept woman

857
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:40,657
You really shouldn't have

858
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:42,985
I've nothing to say

859
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,722
Talk to me

860
00:58:46,632 --> 00:58:48,190
With regards to what happened

861
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,062
I have no comments at this time

862
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:53,831
Please accept my deepest regrets

863
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:54,869
but I believe...

864
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,599
this incident will not change our love

865
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:58,174
Over the long run

866
00:58:58,444 --> 00:58:59,342
Tell me!

867
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,441
The princess pretended that
she was the bunny demon

868
00:59:03,649 --> 00:59:04,775
And tricked me into saving her

869
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,508
from reincarnating as a dog

870
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:09,320
What a fantastic tale!

871
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:11,350
Did you sleep with her?

872
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:17,886
Yes or no?

873
00:59:36,982 --> 00:59:39,576
Do you know
what makes marriage sacred?

874
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,312
Keeping your promises

875
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,470
Brother...

876
01:02:52,545 --> 01:02:54,240
What crime did you commit?

877
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:58,046
None of your business, old man!

878
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,615
Even if I tell you, can you save me?

879
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:03,216
Neighbors confide in each other

880
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,056
I've done nothing wrong

881
01:03:07,693 --> 01:03:11,561
Nine out of ten say
that they're innocent

882
01:03:11,797 --> 01:03:12,957
Here's one for you:

883
01:03:13,198 --> 01:03:16,292
Compromise and learn to forgive

884
01:03:16,936 --> 01:03:20,133
It's the only way to be free

885
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:24,598
And live a happy life

886
01:03:26,645 --> 01:03:29,011
So how long have you been here
Mr. Forgiveness?

887
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:32,714
Thirty odd years

888
01:03:34,253 --> 01:03:36,050
Thirty odd years?

889
01:03:36,288 --> 01:03:37,778
See how compromise has locked you up

890
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,057
It freed you?

891
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:43,494
Moth, the Emperor has punished
the princess

892
01:04:43,773 --> 01:04:45,434
And he has planned some amends

893
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:49,003
I have one good and one bad news

894
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:52,807
The good news is the princess
will marry Chan as a concubine

895
01:04:52,982 --> 01:04:54,847
You'll still retain your position
as the wife

896
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,918
Bad news is you have no say in this

897
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:03,091
Sister, forgive me, some tea

898
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:06,893
Say yes, you can't win every time

899
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:08,025
You can torture her

900
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:09,663
after the wedding

901
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:12,094
Once she's his, she's all yours, too

902
01:05:36,926 --> 01:05:39,724
Moth Liu, the Emperor's own sister
pours you tea

903
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:41,055
And you refuse?

904
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,691
It's tradition

905
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:47,826
that a man can marry many

906
01:05:48,103 --> 01:05:50,970
The princess is royalty

907
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:52,333
And she has agreed to be a concubine

908
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:55,042
And share your housework with you

909
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:57,677
What more can you ask?

910
01:05:58,113 --> 01:05:59,910
Bend and compromise!

911
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:03,845
A woman must stay faithful and true

912
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:05,553
And a man can marry concubines?

913
01:06:06,021 --> 01:06:08,148
Is one woman's love not enough?

914
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:13,185
When I go hunting

915
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:15,226
The lion is always accompanied

916
01:06:15,464 --> 01:06:16,761
by a pack of lionesses

917
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,225
I've never seen it otherwise

918
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:23,595
It's natural for women to obey men

919
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,897
Not other way around it

920
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,165
You compare men with beasts?

921
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:28,638
Aren't you stretching it?

922
01:06:28,911 --> 01:06:31,846
Miss Liu, look at your husband

923
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:34,413
He's handsome and talented

924
01:06:34,683 --> 01:06:36,776
He's a woman magnate

925
01:06:37,086 --> 01:06:39,554
Even if you keep the princess out

926
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:42,486
There'll be others, don't you see?

927
01:06:45,027 --> 01:06:48,656
I will fight anyone and everyone

928
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,631
I must accept this fate

929
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:55,567
He's my husband and this is my duty

930
01:06:56,572 --> 01:06:58,563
Even if I die fighting off other women

931
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:00,365
I will not complain one bit

932
01:07:02,244 --> 01:07:04,212
Don't worry, your majesty

933
01:07:05,514 --> 01:07:07,505
Moth Liu, I understand

934
01:07:07,716 --> 01:07:09,684
Fearless as you are, fierce as you are

935
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:11,979
Are you not afraid of the emperor?

936
01:07:12,187 --> 01:07:14,655
Sure, I'm afraid
I must fight for what's mine

937
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:17,423
Brave girl!

938
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:20,193
Aren't you afraid of me?

939
01:07:20,729 --> 01:07:23,254
I'm afraid that
you overestimate yourself!

940
01:07:23,532 --> 01:07:24,521
- You....
- Your majesty

941
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,759
I'm afraid that you'll force
your will on me!

942
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,667
- Your majesty...
- How dare you!

943
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:31,839
The emperor's furious

944
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,300
Emperor, cool your fury!

945
01:07:42,885 --> 01:07:43,874
Your majesty

946
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:46,916
Your majesty

947
01:07:49,124 --> 01:07:55,529
Your majesty, calm down...

948
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:58,522
Brother

949
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:07,401
Rise

950
01:08:08,911 --> 01:08:12,142
OK, get up, get up

951
01:08:25,828 --> 01:08:27,591
Shit! The lioness roars!

952
01:09:48,678 --> 01:09:50,612
Insult the emperor and
you'll drink the poison wine!

953
01:09:50,813 --> 01:09:51,677
Your majesty!

954
01:09:51,948 --> 01:09:53,245
It's really my fault

955
01:09:53,449 --> 01:09:55,974
I'll drink the wine for her!

956
01:09:56,152 --> 01:10:01,146
Emperor is a man of his words

957
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,687
My husband is the emperor

958
01:10:02,892 --> 01:10:03,984
I'll not let her get away with this?

959
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,092
Bring the poison wine!

960
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:09,423
Your majesty
may I have a pen and paper

961
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:13,294
This woman knows no shame

962
01:10:14,937 --> 01:10:16,165
I'll write the divorce paper myself!

963
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,737
What did I do...
why are you divorcing me?

964
01:10:25,114 --> 01:10:26,945
Your worst crime is...

965
01:10:29,151 --> 01:10:30,413
Loving me!

966
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:36,749
The Emperor...

967
01:10:36,926 --> 01:10:38,860
Why turn a wedding

968
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:41,121
Into a disaster?

969
01:10:42,098 --> 01:10:44,191
If you'll leave Seasonal now

970
01:10:44,467 --> 01:10:46,662
The Emperor will give you
the Love Eraser

971
01:10:46,902 --> 01:10:49,928
Drink it and you'll forget
the one you love

972
01:10:50,139 --> 01:10:52,972
After you drink it
you'll forget all about him

973
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:56,111
Drink it

974
01:10:56,379 --> 01:10:59,177
Drink it and
your pains will go away!

975
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,516
It's better to forget
than to be heartbroken!

976
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:23,335
Sister!

977
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,204
Don't you forget me!

978
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:29,376
We just grew up in the same house

979
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:31,945
I'm not your true love

980
01:11:32,348 --> 01:11:34,748
Remember me!

981
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:06,069
Seasonal Chan, when are you going
to marry the princess?

982
01:13:07,911 --> 01:13:10,311
If you don't, you'll be beheaded

983
01:13:10,513 --> 01:13:11,537
Straight to the guillotine

984
01:13:17,253 --> 01:13:18,743
I can never marry the princess

985
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:24,523
It takes two to tango,

986
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:25,921
two to fall in love

987
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:34,397
Gentle sir, your servant girl
can only hope

988
01:13:34,704 --> 01:13:36,695
That we'll meet again
in another lifetime

989
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:39,772
Thanks

990
01:13:42,578 --> 01:13:45,103
Moth Liu has forgotten everything

991
01:13:46,015 --> 01:13:49,075
Go to her, make her love you again

992
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:52,413
If you two fall in love again

993
01:13:53,423 --> 01:13:55,516
She'll only remember the good times

994
01:13:56,025 --> 01:13:57,049
Isn't that swell?

995
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:01,595
Thank you

996
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,132
What are you waiting for?

997
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:02,615
Good morning!

998
01:15:04,827 --> 01:15:05,987
Foo, good morning!

999
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:09,198
Nanny, good morning!

1000
01:15:09,432 --> 01:15:12,697
Baby, good morning!

1001
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:18,365
Why are you all so strange today?

1002
01:15:18,574 --> 01:15:21,839
Strange, no way...

1003
01:15:22,612 --> 01:15:24,375
Let's go out for breakfast
my treat

1004
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:26,103
OK!

1005
01:15:26,349 --> 01:15:28,044
What shall we do after breakfast?

1006
01:15:28,284 --> 01:15:30,149
Start a fight or something!

1007
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:38,986
Honey

1008
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:42,096
Looking for you?

1009
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:45,393
Moth

1010
01:15:52,842 --> 01:15:53,866
Honey

1011
01:16:16,432 --> 01:16:18,297
Bastard, who're you calling honey

1012
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:19,195
Do I look like an easy victim?

1013
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:21,360
No... no...

1014
01:16:21,737 --> 01:16:26,197
You OK? Are you stupid or what!

1015
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:28,536
She drank the Love Eraser
Why call her honey?

1016
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:29,971
And you had to give her a brick
to hit you with?

1017
01:16:30,146 --> 01:16:32,011
Not his honey, I'll hit you too!

1018
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:34,575
Don't talk to these assholes! Go away!

1019
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:35,645
You think this road's yours?

1020
01:16:35,852 --> 01:16:36,819
Yeah, you own this road or what?

1021
01:16:37,487 --> 01:16:38,454
I'll check the deeds right now

1022
01:16:39,956 --> 01:16:41,719
Are you OK?

1023
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,805
Thanks

1024
01:17:05,015 --> 01:17:06,107
Careful now

1025
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:13,353
Go!

1026
01:17:18,995 --> 01:17:21,395
We don't like you! Leave now!

1027
01:17:53,229 --> 01:17:54,161
Hate you!

1028
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:00,359
I have a suggestion

1029
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,367
Why don't we go to the Club instead!

1030
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:03,563
Yeah!

1031
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,729
Up yours!

1032
01:18:04,874 --> 01:18:07,172
Up where? Bring me a mat!

1033
01:18:07,711 --> 01:18:10,373
Art of War says:
stay still if your enemy's still!

1034
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:12,012
We'll camp out here

1035
01:18:12,282 --> 01:18:13,977
Together, like fools

1036
01:18:14,184 --> 01:18:15,708
Just sitting here
is not a solution, Soo

1037
01:18:15,919 --> 01:18:17,750
But sitting and drinking is

1038
01:18:17,987 --> 01:18:19,147
Cheers!

1039
01:18:19,456 --> 01:18:21,253
Cheers!

1040
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:22,186
Sit...

1041
01:18:52,522 --> 01:18:54,251
Sir, please come in

1042
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:08,230
My brother told me everything

1043
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:10,429
So we were married

1044
01:19:11,808 --> 01:19:13,503
Since your arrival

1045
01:19:13,676 --> 01:19:15,405
my family's been upset

1046
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:18,113
They're split into two groups

1047
01:19:18,314 --> 01:19:21,545
One group hates you and
my brother leads that faction!

1048
01:19:24,521 --> 01:19:27,251
The other thinks you've got a heart

1049
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:30,391
That's just Foo and Baby...

1050
01:19:31,227 --> 01:19:33,525
I want to put an end to this

1051
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:36,662
I've decided to get marry ASAP

1052
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:37,863
What?!

1053
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:40,733
Mr. Tien!

1054
01:19:43,273 --> 01:19:47,232
I was afraid you wouldn't come
with the rain and all!

1055
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:49,043
Get down! All of you!

1056
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,204
Put your hands on your head!

1057
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:56,483
Don't move! It's raining, go home!

1058
01:19:56,753 --> 01:19:59,813
I'd throw this lid at you!

1059
01:20:02,525 --> 01:20:03,992
Stop embarrassing yourself

1060
01:20:04,194 --> 01:20:05,821
Give it up!

1061
01:20:07,864 --> 01:20:08,956
I'll kill you!

1062
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,863
Seasonal...

1063
01:20:22,545 --> 01:20:24,638
Brother, I'll marry him

1064
01:20:26,282 --> 01:20:27,374
Marry me

1065
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,918
So when's the wedding?

1066
01:20:34,524 --> 01:20:36,048
Whatever you say!

1067
01:20:36,326 --> 01:20:37,691
Tomorrow's an auspicious day

1068
01:20:38,127 --> 01:20:40,721
I'm making soup, I need to go home
and watch the stove!

1069
01:20:41,297 --> 01:20:43,197
What kind of soup? Is it ready yet?

1070
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:44,392
The antidote for the Love Eraser!

1071
01:22:14,557 --> 01:22:16,184
The Emperor's orders!

1072
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,186
Long live his majesty!

1073
01:22:27,637 --> 01:22:29,002
Bride, let's go now

1074
01:22:47,757 --> 01:22:51,955
Master Soo, what's taking so long?

1075
01:22:52,195 --> 01:22:53,856
The order's coming! It's coming!

1076
01:23:01,204 --> 01:23:03,138
One order of steamed clams! Eat up!

1077
01:23:04,107 --> 01:23:05,233
Let's go...

1078
01:23:11,514 --> 01:23:11,980
Where's the antidote?

1079
01:23:12,215 --> 01:23:12,909
Here!

1080
01:23:13,149 --> 01:23:14,138
Soo, as a scholar like you

1081
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,908
Reduced to such trickery

1082
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:17,552
They'll make a mockery of you
do you know?

1083
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:19,481
We poets will die for romance

1084
01:23:19,655 --> 01:23:21,555
Nothing can stop me

1085
01:23:26,596 --> 01:23:27,426
Honey!

1086
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:29,557
Foo?!

1087
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:31,165
What happened to her?

1088
01:23:31,467 --> 01:23:32,491
What happened?

1089
01:23:32,769 --> 01:23:35,465
Master Tien fell in love with me

1090
01:23:35,638 --> 01:23:36,536
And...

1091
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:37,569
Where's my honey?

1092
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:40,367
She's hosting a fight to decide

1093
01:23:40,576 --> 01:23:43,170
Who she is going to marry

1094
01:23:44,714 --> 01:23:46,705
Seasonal!

1095
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:00,487
He-master!

1096
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,798
The only antidote

1097
01:24:03,066 --> 01:24:04,431
Down the drain

1098
01:24:18,748 --> 01:24:19,840
- Moth!
- What do you want?

1099
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:21,914
Honey!

1100
01:24:22,752 --> 01:24:24,219
Go...

1101
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:25,754
Honey!

1102
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,479
You again?

1103
01:24:28,691 --> 01:24:29,885
Yes, it's me again

1104
01:24:31,494 --> 01:24:32,893
- Honey...
- What are you doing here?

1105
01:24:33,062 --> 01:24:33,926
Haven't you caused her enough pain?

1106
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:34,619
What're doing?

1107
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:36,262
How can you let her do this?

1108
01:24:36,466 --> 01:24:37,865
What if she gets hurt?

1109
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:38,930
We thought about it

1110
01:24:39,135 --> 01:24:40,659
The men will fight each other, not her

1111
01:24:40,837 --> 01:24:42,896
Whoever wins will win her hand

1112
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:44,768
The best fighter is not the best lover

1113
01:24:44,974 --> 01:24:47,204
She'll never be happy
with a violent man!

1114
01:24:47,443 --> 01:24:48,205
Agreed!

1115
01:24:48,744 --> 01:24:49,972
And you made her happy?

1116
01:24:53,783 --> 01:24:54,545
He-master

1117
01:24:56,886 --> 01:24:57,978
I want to enter the fight

1118
01:24:58,154 --> 01:24:58,848
How many?

1119
01:24:59,055 --> 01:25:00,613
All ten of us

1120
01:25:00,857 --> 01:25:01,789
We do everything together

1121
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,856
We even share our wives...
eventually

1122
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:05,351
You're not qualified!

1123
01:25:05,828 --> 01:25:07,193
Can't you bend the rules

1124
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:08,720
I'm the famous poet Soo Tung Bo!

1125
01:25:08,998 --> 01:25:11,091
So what, I'm the infamous Nanny!

1126
01:25:11,801 --> 01:25:12,961
Beat up the nanny!

1127
01:25:13,136 --> 01:25:13,864
Infamous! We'll show you!

1128
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:16,261
What are you doing...

1129
01:25:28,217 --> 01:25:31,015
All contestants proceed
to the boxing ring

1130
01:25:35,124 --> 01:25:36,421
Seasonal He-master

1131
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:38,559
Don't do it!
Seasonal...

1132
01:25:38,794 --> 01:25:41,126
You'll die, don't go

1133
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:42,194
He-master...

1134
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:43,923
Seasonal, stop!

1135
01:26:05,154 --> 01:26:07,452
There're simply too many contestants

1136
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:10,456
The organizers have decided
to turn the event

1137
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,958
Into a group fight

1138
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:15,057
There's no time limit

1139
01:26:15,431 --> 01:26:17,661
The last one standing...

1140
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,765
And still standing after
I count to ten

1141
01:26:20,169 --> 01:26:21,864
Will marry my sister

1142
01:26:22,972 --> 01:26:23,961
Good!

1143
01:26:46,395 --> 01:26:47,362
What do you want?

1144
01:26:50,233 --> 01:26:51,427
He-master...

1145
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:55,561
Seasonal, get up!

1146
01:27:45,354 --> 01:27:49,017
- Seasonal, forget it...
- He-master...

1147
01:27:53,647 --> 01:27:57,174
I'm a mango...

1148
01:28:01,187 --> 01:28:03,451
M-a-n-g-o...

1149
01:28:57,111 --> 01:28:59,443
We're supposed to fight or what?

1150
01:29:16,263 --> 01:29:17,355
Stop!

1151
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:21,902
Illegal gathering
you can go to jail for this!

1152
01:29:23,604 --> 01:29:25,401
I order you to disperse now

1153
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:28,370
Or face the guillotine!

1154
01:29:35,516 --> 01:29:37,143
I told the emperor

1155
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:39,650
You kidnapped me and stole the antidote

1156
01:29:39,887 --> 01:29:40,876
No way?

1157
01:29:41,155 --> 01:29:42,019
Yup, I did

1158
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,822
But the emperor came up with this ruse

1159
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:46,516
to help Seasonal

1160
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:50,161
Cousin, announce the winner now!

1161
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:52,865
I still have to count to ten

1162
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:12,612
One

1163
01:30:15,756 --> 01:30:16,688
One

1164
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:20,850
Two

1165
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:26,360
Three

1166
01:30:35,743 --> 01:30:37,540
There's innocence

1167
01:30:37,745 --> 01:30:39,770
And depth in your work

1168
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:41,538
If you work harder

1169
01:30:41,816 --> 01:30:43,784
One day, they'll see it, too!

1170
01:31:35,569 --> 01:31:37,469
From now on...

1171
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,605
I will love you and only you

1172
01:31:43,844 --> 01:31:45,368
I'll spoil you

1173
01:31:46,647 --> 01:31:48,046
Never argue with you

1174
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:53,348
I will live up to...

1175
01:31:54,555 --> 01:31:55,954
Every promise

1176
01:31:58,926 --> 01:32:01,224
Never

1177
01:32:02,696 --> 01:32:04,459
Lie to you!

1178
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:09,631
From now on, you will love only me

1179
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:11,067
You'll spoil me. Never argue with me

1180
01:32:11,305 --> 01:32:12,670
You will always speak the truth

1181
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,636
Never lie to me!

1182
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:16,868
Never argue with me...

1183
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:17,909
Honey?

1184
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:19,439
I'll always protect you

1185
01:32:21,382 --> 01:32:22,474
Agree with you

1186
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:26,211
Believe in you

1187
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:31,523
I'll stand up for you...

1188
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:37,524
No matter when or where

1189
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,467
Laugh when

1190
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,365
Your laugh

1191
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:49,509
Wipe away...

1192
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:53,538
All your tears

1193
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:58,709
You'll be the only one in my eyes

1194
01:33:00,454 --> 01:33:03,821
The only one in my dreams

1195
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:10,463
Only one...

1196
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:16,131
In my heart

1197
01:33:21,976 --> 01:33:23,443
It's just that simple

1198
01:33:25,379 --> 01:33:26,812
Honey...

1199
01:33:28,282 --> 01:33:29,374
I'm sorry

1200
01:33:37,491 --> 01:33:39,857
Whether you remember me or not

1201
01:33:43,964 --> 01:33:45,727
You'll always be...

1202
01:33:48,736 --> 01:33:51,933
My beloved wife

1203
01:33:52,673 --> 01:33:54,971
Honey, don't leave me!

1204
01:34:02,316 --> 01:34:03,681
Honey...

1205
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:11,622
Honey...

1206
01:34:15,429 --> 01:34:16,589
Honey...

1207
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:22,096
Honey!

1208
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,396
Honey...

1209
01:34:25,539 --> 01:34:27,700
I've a confession

1210
01:34:28,876 --> 01:34:31,470
I've left the soup on the stove
all night

1211
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:33,374
Let's go home and put out the fire?

1212
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:34,569
Great!

1213
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:40,514
Sure...

1214
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:44,320
Does the Love Eraser really work?

1215
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:49,052
By the orders of the emperor
of course it works...

1216
01:34:53,634 --> 01:34:55,568
Honey! Honey...

1217
01:34:58,339 --> 01:34:59,499
Honey... Honey!

1218
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:02,301
Three months later

1219
01:35:02,509 --> 01:35:05,137
With my honey's encouragement
I finally published my first book

1220
01:35:05,379 --> 01:35:06,846
Come have a look

1221
01:35:07,114 --> 01:35:08,376
The Lion Roars is a real tear-jerker

1222
01:35:08,749 --> 01:35:11,013
Based on a true story,

1223
01:35:11,685 --> 01:35:15,416
You'll cry, I promise

1224
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:18,984
The book...

1225
01:35:19,226 --> 01:35:21,456
became very popular...

1226
01:35:21,795 --> 01:35:22,659
Whether you're taking a stroll...

1227
01:35:23,797 --> 01:35:24,786
Having lunch...

1228
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:27,593
In the toilet...

1229
01:35:28,936 --> 01:35:30,767
Giving birth

1230
01:35:32,172 --> 01:35:33,230
Hitching a ride

1231
01:35:33,507 --> 01:35:34,838
You can't put it down

1232
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:37,134
Some say my husband's book

1233
01:35:37,344 --> 01:35:38,777
Lacks depth

1234
01:35:38,946 --> 01:35:40,607
And sophistication

1235
01:35:42,449 --> 01:35:45,885
But I truly believe that years from now

1236
01:35:46,153 --> 01:35:47,142
They'll still remember...

1237
01:35:47,287 --> 01:35:49,585
our love story!
