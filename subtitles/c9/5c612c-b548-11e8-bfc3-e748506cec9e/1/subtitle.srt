1
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,685
Hi David, this is Charlie. I call to you
a happy birthday wish

2
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:31,715
Sorry to those tickets
could not give.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,325
I know you counted on me,
but my brother said ...

4
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:38,260
Call you next week.
We can also agree.

5
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,155
Have a good birthday.

6
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:42,272
You can reach me on my cell ...

7
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,648
You think you know all about pain?

8
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,389
Talk again with my second wife.

9
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:45,535
When she was 19, she became
between two fighting cats.

10
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,265
One attacked her, climbed on her,
like a tree.

11
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:54,650
Comments left on her thighs, breasts
and belly, you can still see.

12
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:59,305
There were 30 stitches needed.
She had high fever for days.

13
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,341
That is real pain, says my second wife.

14
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:18,240
If I replace the man
under the car could reach ...

15
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,844
I would have done that.

16
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,900
But also can feel his pain,
might have mitigated the mine.

17
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,491
It was the fiftieth.

18
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:34,385
A period of foreign
suppressions and secrets.

19
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,675
A period in which even the guilty
showed a rare innocence.

20
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,356
Remembering what happened.

21
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,092
Remembering what we had done.

22
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:49,427
I am now on the wrong side
of the fifty.

23
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,870
I earn $ 300,000 per year
Wall Street ...

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,552
twice married, no children ...

25
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,754
a house in the countryside,
a flat of the firm in the city

26
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,015
My current wife knows nothing af
of what happened many years ago.

27
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,352
I do not know whether I had ever
will tell.

28
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,921
Why should I?

29
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:23,012
Nothing in my life was still good
Since the summer of 1958.

30
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:30,215
When Ruth, Donnie, Willie, and we all
met with Meg Loughlin ...

31
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,853
and her sister Susan.

32
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,627
What are you looking for?

33
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,738
Crayfish.
- Can I look?

34
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:15,131
I'm Meg.
- I'm David.

35
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,957
What they are beautiful.

36
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,000
I catch them, look for some
and let them go.

37
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:25,458
Bite?

38
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:28,895
Sometimes.
Usually they try to run away.

39
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,709
Have you ever seen a crayfish?

40
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:44,368
There are none in New York.
Well lobsters. They can hurt you.

41
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,914
Can you as a pet?

42
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,102
They are there to eat.

43
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,205
Crayfish are also eaten.

44
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,805
In Louisiana and Florida and such.

45
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,146
So much to eat is not.

46
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,625
We will try some large
to catch.

47
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,024
Can I try it?
- Yeah.

48
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:06,706
What is that?

49
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,283
We have had an accident.

50
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:16,895
Do you have more scars?

51
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,734
A few, but this is the worst.

52
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,745
I have one.
A big one.

53
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,809
In my first attempt.

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,025
Good catch.
Did you know that they sometimes kill each other?

55
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,976
You could she recover?
- I always do.

56
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,655
I must go back.

57
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,131
But I wanted to look around.

58
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,610
We had never
talked.

59
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:01,047
Thanks, David, it was fun.

60
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:03,320
Where you going now?

61
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,865
We stay with our family,
the Chandlers.

62
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,552
The Chandlers? We are their neighbors.
- Goodbye, David.

63
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,685
BASED ON TRUE FACTS.

64
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:35,478
Yet one days longer with your sister
and you could call the mad house.

65
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,000
Will you help, David?

66
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:13,280
Hello, Woofer.
- Hi, Dave.

67
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,168
What's in that can?
- Pier.

68
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,196
Donnie is here somewhere?

69
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,858
You're crazy, Woofer.
Seriously disturbed.

70
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm black too.

71
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:35,675
I will complete this stabbing
to an ant war.

72
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,180
Want to bet who will win?

73
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:41,067
The red will win.
Red ants always win.

74
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,404
In there without calling.

75
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,847
Hey buddy, I am.

76
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,653
Are you there?

77
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:01,965
That was not funny.
- The face that you drew was.

78
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,801
Help me out with this.

79
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,470
In order to fastest.

80
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,972
Dwarf.
- Mormel.

81
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:22,435
So you've met her.
- Who?

82
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:25,860
Oh, your cousin.
Yes, in the rock.

83
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,090
She caught a crayfish
at her first attempt.

84
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,625
Yes, she is quite good at things.

85
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,585
She is beautiful, no?
- She's your cousin?

86
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:36,400
Step-niece. Ma says
The one difference.

87
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:40,060
She has one sister, huh?
- Susan? That is disabled.

88
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,480
She did thanks
that accident.

89
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,260
They should always very cautious steps.

90
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:48,689
She wears those things,
such as polio patients.

91
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,960
Both parents are dead.

92
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,280
Ma said that they were killed.

93
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,875
Ma says she does not know
who had aanreed.

94
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,711
In fact they were
hit by a Chrysler.

95
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,373
Therefore they are now with us.

96
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,278
Ma says Meg lucky.
That she has come good.

97
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:11,316
What do you louts here?

98
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,677
We go to the carnival.
They have them up this morning.

99
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:18,775
We shall see.

100
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:23,351
Another summer between children
and fairs. It can not go wrong.

101
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,234
There's dumb and stupid.

102
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,645
Keep your big mouth,
before I do that for you.

103
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,605
Dad wants to know where you go.
He says you've grounded.

104
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,595
Tell Dad to hell runs.

105
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:41,285
Now you're in trouble well.
I'll tell him.

106
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,940
Then tell him what you and Cheryl
you did yesterday with pillow.

107
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,629
Hey, fellas.
- Hello Willie.

108
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:52,480
How was the dentist?
- Shut up, idiot.

109
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:56,940
Ma was mad at you. She says that
it was your turn to babysit.

110
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:00,811
I am on, guys.
Time for some real action.

111
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,853
It is summer.
Why we played the game yet?

112
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,545
Are you sure she sees nothing?
- She sees no balls.

113
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,686
Ready to run away?
The big tree is the safe zone.

114
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:43,256
Stop it, Eddie. I know it's you.
- Shut up.

115
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,335
Hey, bitch.

116
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,045
Walk Donnie!

117
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:36,832
I got you.

118
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,100
What happens now?
- Now they tell the truth.

119
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,176
A person may ask. The rest looks on.
- I first.

120
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,540
Tell the truth.

121
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,634
Have you kissed a boy?
- No. But you do.

122
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:01,955
Tell us how you and Cheryl
playing with yourself.

123
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,450
We did not.
- Liar.

124
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,940
Have you ever sucked?

125
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,972
A thick, long, hot dick?

126
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,929
Hold on.
I tell Dad.

127
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,434
What is that?

128
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,241
Tell us what you bitches
those pillows did.

129
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,275
High, huh.

130
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,856
Beautiful.

131
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:38,465
Are we agreed on?

132
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,922
If you want me.

133
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:46,162
If you're afraid
it is not very.

134
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,469
Sure.

135
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,666
Forward.

136
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:03,773
It seems like I can fly
and the whole world.

137
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:07,581
My parents.

138
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:15,832
They always like to
bring to an amusement park.

139
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,055
That will now no longer come.

140
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,583
I heard what happened.

141
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,916
Sorry.

142
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:35,408
This is great, David.

143
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:39,154
You look as if you do
whole days doing.

144
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,322
Are you serious?

145
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,692
Of course.

146
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:46,420
I have two tickets,
if you want again.

147
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:47,997
Very happy.

148
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,943
But I had asked home
of Ruth.

149
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,826
Sometimes she's very funny.

150
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,148
Ruth is great,
exactly one of the gang.

151
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:20,085
What that whole fair miss,
hoochiecoo is an old-fashioned.

152
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,430
What is a hoociecoo?

153
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:25,608
Hoochiecoo.
You know, the hoochiecoochie ...

154
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:28,853
Dancing girls, Ralphie.

155
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:30,345
And the oddities show.

156
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,197
When I was as old as you,
those things still existed.

157
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,800
I once saw a man with three arms.
- Something does not exist.

158
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,945
Speak to your mother.
I really saw that.

159
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:41,863
I saw a man with three arms.

160
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,426
One was a tiny stump,
that came here.

161
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:51,094
What else did you see?

162
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,009
Things in bottles.

163
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,803
Stillborn babies.

164
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:59,009
Little things shrunk.
Cats and goats, everything.

165
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:02,930
When I was a little girl,
The fair was worthwhile.

166
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,740
Tell me more
hoochiecoo about that.

167
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:08,043
I still do not understand it well.
What should the proposals?

168
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,779
Dancing girls, I said.

169
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:16,890
Some were half naked.
In a very short skirt ...

170
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,960
and a tiny bra.

171
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:24,560
Or a jewel in the navel.
And painted dark circles.

172
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:27,337
Here and here.

173
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,929
What do you think that?

174
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:39,048
But something will our social committee
no sponsors. Not at all.

175
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:43,203
They would like to do that.

176
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:44,785
She would really like to.

177
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,860
But they all have one woman.

178
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,755
Drink your beer, boys.

179
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,970
Time to go to the carnival to leave.

180
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:58,088
We may not last night
not miss.

181
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:03,354
I go with the boys
get an ice cream at the fair.

182
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,375
Stay here for your
sister to care.

183
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,650
And stay out of the ice box.

184
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,304
You may not be too thick.

185
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:13,265
Especially if you once
hoochiecoo to the dance.

186
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,545
That I had heard.

187
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,350
Maybe I read it in Playboy.

188
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:31,444
You read that in Playboy
and I screwed all the bunny's.

189
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:34,155
My father buys every month
Playboy, asshole.

190
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,075
Have you seen that with Jane Mansfield?
- Yeah, I saw that.

191
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:42,770
The biggest tits I ever saw.
- Bigger than that of Carol Baker?

192
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:46,491
Greater than that of June Wilkinson?
- Bigger than Willie.

193
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,160
Where is Donnie?

194
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:52,108
He may not out of ma
before he has finished eating.

195
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,465
One of you has already seen a woman?

196
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,237
A real woman, I mean.
- Counts Meg them?

197
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,999
See anything?

198
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,545
I'm not even elbow.

199
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,855
Hey, wait.

200
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:39,476
To hell with her.

201
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:43,776
Maybe get her
to join the game.

202
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,295
Fucking assholes.

203
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,716
Piers.

204
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,434
I do this.

205
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,948
Look closely again, then
you do the rest.

206
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:25,105
Looks nice.
Greasy and flavorful.

207
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,747
Take this down.

208
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,394
Note that I want to keep the garden.

209
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:36,290
And not in the woods.
The wood for themselves.

210
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,381
I will not.

211
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,370
Are you dissatisfied because of
some worms, darling?

212
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,480
No, I just do not ...
- Have you ever.

213
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:52,832
Here we get a lesson
of femininity, boys.

214
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,407
The sensitive Meg.

215
00:19:55,426 --> 00:20:00,124
You know how girls do
sensitive, not?

216
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,428
And Meg is a lady.
Without doubt.

217
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,510
What am I in hell?

218
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:13,167
Am I not a lady you think then?
- No, I just wanted ...

219
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,630
Note well what you say.

220
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:19,300
I suffer no such insinuations
of a child ...

221
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:22,129
that not even her own face
can clean.

222
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:27,615
Scroll down and help your sister
with the laundry.

223
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:31,175
When you're done,
I show you something else.

224
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,905
My boys can handle this.

225
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,659
Right, boys.

226
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:43,253
A cheeseburger and a lemonade.

227
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,114
Hi Meg, how are you?

228
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:50,947
Want to buy me something?
I have not eaten in two days.

229
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,277
Can I still get one?

230
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,701
Why did not you eat?

231
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,676
I can not.

232
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:09,046
Why not?
- I can not.

233
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,490
I do not understand.
- Ruth says I am overweight.

234
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:20,459
That says it for you to tease.
- David No, she hates me.

235
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:22,157
Everybody hates me.

236
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,690
Why was she so angry last?

237
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:35,908
Maybe they just
irritable.

238
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,850
She was not accustomed to
girls in the house.

239
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,082
It is not just this once.

240
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,597
It happens all the time.

241
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,143
I can never do anything right.

242
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:59,448
When I lie in bed at night
I can think of nothing else.

243
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:09,857
Before we came here to
I painted.

244
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:12,567
Just in watercolor.

245
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,930
I do not think I
very good, but ...

246
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,833
My mother liked it.

247
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:23,569
I've tried, but I
here can not paint.

248
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,837
Because I know what Ruth would do.
I know what she will say.

249
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,372
She would look at me.

250
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:35,199
And say I'm a stupid weight
and my time trying to peel fresh.

251
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,564
That does not sound like the Ruth I know.

252
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:41,990
Come on, why do not you?

253
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:45,055
Why do not you paint watercolor
for Ruth?

254
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,755
She will love it.

255
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,601
I really can not.

256
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,221
Create one for me.

257
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:56,946
Would you really want?
- Very happy.

258
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,726
I make a painting.

259
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:12,505
And thanks for everything, David.
- Sure.

260
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:34,491
I do not want you hanging around outside.
I need your help in the house.

261
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,640
Better to continue immediately.
- Yes, Mrs. Chandler.

262
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:40,617
Aunt Ruth.

263
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:53,019
In hell, you even know?

264
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:57,484
Stupid bitch.

265
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:01,060
Dinner is ready.

266
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:05,708
Give the stuff here.
It will brains.

267
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:10,724
Hello there.
- Hello Mrs Moran. I'm Meg.

268
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,835
How nice to finally
meeting.

269
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:18,872
Want to come and eat?
- I can not, I ...

270
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:22,318
I did this to David.

271
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:33,337
Thanks, Meg.
- It is a bit stupid.

272
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:36,183
Throw it away but
if you do not like.

273
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,981
What have we here?

274
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,922
That is really nice.

275
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,822
She has something, right?

276
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:01,181
Mrs. Chandler is happy
to her house.

277
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,025
You must be David.
- Yes. Hi Susan.

278
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:22,820
Meg says you're nice.

279
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:27,389
What you got?

280
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,076
I have something for you.
- Turn off the TV, Ralphie.

281
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,596
What is it, David?
- A present.

282
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,381
Meg.

283
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,203
She has painted for you.

284
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,838
It is beautiful, Meg.

285
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:10,670
Do not kid me.

286
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:15,030
She made this for you, Davy.
- Surely not.

287
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,230
Just look.

288
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:20,379
It's a boy to a river.
Course is for you.

289
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:24,500
Take it. I will not.
- They made it real for you, Ruth.

290
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:26,515
She just wanted ...
- Do not, David.

291
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,557
Come learn something, guys.

292
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:31,512
Listen well.
This is important.

293
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,665
You just need love but are
for a woman.

294
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:38,165
Then she does all kinds
good things for you.

295
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,483
Look at David.

296
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:43,099
He was kind to Meg
and she gave him a painting.

297
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,782
That is what you got, huh David?

298
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,035
Is that all they gave you?

299
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,235
You're a bit young,
but these days you never know.

300
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:58,940
Today, girls
so easy. That is their problem.

301
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:04,350
Promise them a trifle,
and you usually get what you want.

302
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:07,551
Believe me, I know
I am talking about.

303
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,555
Look at your father, Davy.

304
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:12,730
He fucked half
the women in this city.

305
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,190
Everyone knows that.
Even your mother knows that.

306
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:16,985
Do not be ashamed.

307
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:22,345
He is at least a hard worker,
that his family maintains decent.

308
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:27,835
Your father would have his own business
when we married.

309
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:31,800
We would be richer than
my parents were when I was little.

310
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:35,893
And they were quite rich,
believe me.

311
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,534
And look what I got.

312
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:43,223
And that beautiful Irish bastard
Noorderzon to the left.

313
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:47,560
Believe me Fri
Girls are stupid.

314
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,625
Girls are easy.

315
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,248
Bitches.

316
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:55,178
Through and through.

317
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:00,570
Take this painting on back, Meg.

318
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:03,003
I know you've made for Davy.

319
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,739
And try to make me anything else wise.

320
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,499
What I would like to know, Meggie ...

321
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,129
What do you get to this?

322
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:18,361
We all know that David
a nice guy, but ...

323
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:21,165
From him you expect nothing.

324
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,606
I only hope that this painting
the only thing you gave him.

325
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,949
You have all men want in the house.
And that's not your painting.

326
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:41,360
If you guys now what they want
Makes no more than a slut.

327
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,354
You know what a slut is?

328
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,571
Can you, Susan?
Of course not, you're too young.

329
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:50,840
I will tell you what a slut.

330
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:55,775
This is someone who's legs
spreads open for a man ...

331
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:58,901
so he could slip inside.

332
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,761
Stop giggling, Ralphie.

333
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,135
Anyone who is a slut
deserves a punishment.

334
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,889
There will everyone in this city
to accept them.

335
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:12,597
I am warning you, darling.

336
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,400
If I notice that you hang the slut ...

337
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:21,043
your ass is a lawn
Aunt Ruth and the lawnmower.

338
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:25,029
Who wants a beer?

339
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:38,255
As if I am yesterday.

340
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:41,791
I always painted for my mother.
I also wanted to try.

341
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:48,065
I do not care what you
your mother did. You're a slut.

342
00:29:48,072 --> 00:29:52,684
Want to waste your time
a boy?

343
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:58,200
Hands off.
- You are a liar and a slut.

344
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:00,581
You can not forget your sister.

345
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,301
What an exemplary behavior.
- Yeah, I think the whole day to him.

346
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:11,087
So do you act so.
The whole day fantasizing about one boy.

347
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:15,322
Good night, girls.
It was blissful.

348
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,080
Hold on.

349
00:30:56,832 --> 00:31:00,259
Come watch, David.
She creeps.

350
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,018
Leave me alone, please.
- Grab her.

351
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,508
Why did you do that, bitch?

352
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:08,630
You've seen what he did.
- He did nothing.

353
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:11,890
You have his face scratched.
- I'm going to tell Mama.

354
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:15,150
I want nothing with you
face.

355
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:19,035
Your sister is a fucking whore.

356
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:23,065
Can someone tell me
what happens here?

357
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:26,306
Meg has Woofer attacked.
- She scratched his face.

358
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:28,545
Someone should have challenged her.

359
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:32,690
We were tickling her
and when she scratched in Woofers face.

360
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:34,882
You too, David?

361
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:40,468
Did you also tickled Megan?
- No, I just came inside.

362
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:45,470
I do not blame you, sweetie.
I suggest you just one question.

363
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:48,796
Where is she now?
- I do not know. She ran away.

364
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:51,566
Susan, you saw what happened here?

365
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:56,823
And you tried her
to stop when they hit Ralphie?

366
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:01,785
I could not.
- You had to try, sweetheart.

367
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,522
Meg is finally your sister.

368
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:09,503
Do you know what it means ...

369
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:15,340
the accomplice to
of someone doing something?

370
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:19,935
This means that you may owe.

371
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:23,885
Even though you yourself might
nothing specifically done ...

372
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:28,615
yet you somewhere complicit.
Do you understand me?

373
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,630
I will try to explain.

374
00:32:32,637 --> 00:32:34,921
You love your sister, right?

375
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:40,550
Because you love her,
it would also forgive you, no?

376
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:43,745
She wanted to hurt him.
She was just angry.

377
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:48,765
Of course.
But you forgive her, right?

378
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:53,480
So there you are totally wrong, sweetheart.

379
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:57,785
This Makes her accomplice.

380
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:01,670
What they did was wrong.
This is misconduct.

381
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:07,028
If you forgive her because of you
love her, you're wrong.

382
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:12,809
Go to on this side of the bed.

383
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,862
Pull your skirt up
and your underpants down.

384
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,588
Come on, do it.

385
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:23,012
Let Aunt Ruth not force.

386
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:27,150
Disobedience.
It also comes with.

387
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:30,300
I give it five for your complicity.

388
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:33,450
Ten Meg.

389
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:38,500
And another five for disobedience.
That makes twenty.

390
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,400
Stay here, guys.

391
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:41,840
Girls just cry.

392
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,995
There is nothing to do.

393
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,756
This is for her own good.
Your presence there contributes to this.

394
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:57,027
Dare not to touch her ...

395
00:33:57,593 --> 00:34:01,735
Not as fun as your little sister
be beaten.

396
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,382
Right, Megan.

397
00:34:03,537 --> 00:34:06,300
You might teach people
your own age to address.

398
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:14,509
Hold on, vixen.
- I'm not ready, sweetie.

399
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,488
Please stop.

400
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:32,128
You have two more credits.

401
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,780
Give me that ring, Meg.

402
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:40,285
That was my mother.
- Your mother is dead.

403
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,380
You live in my house,
I determine the rules here.

404
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,670
Give me the damn ring.

405
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:47,889
I gotta go.

406
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:56,980
This is only a small domestic
disagreement. It remains among us.

407
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,875
You saw what you saw ...

408
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,686
but nobody goes
else to.

409
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,998
Understood?

410
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:22,670
Hey guys, what do you want?
- A red popsicles.

411
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,985
For me a brown cow.
- Thanks, guys.

412
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:35,224
What time does the fireworks?
- Around half past eight, I think.

413
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,057
Come sit with us.

414
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:04,746
Donnie, get a few beers.

415
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:22,039
You sent a policeman
to my mother.

416
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,490
Sit down, Willie.

417
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:30,831
Sit down, I say.

418
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:37,007
What I wonder is
what you expected, Megan.

419
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:42,534
What went through your head?

420
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:48,770
Did you really think he is you
road would bring?

421
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:50,376
You and Susan.

422
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,868
You are away?

423
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:01,819
I assure you
that it will not happen.

424
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:08,476
He takes you nowhere,
because he did not care.

425
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,267
What's left?

426
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:15,153
What else can you do?

427
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:20,085
Did you think I scared him
would be?

428
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:36,212
The question is.

429
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,362
What do we do now?

430
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:47,055
Nothing on this man or to the
Any man scares me.

431
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:51,010
If you did not know, I hope
that you have by now.

432
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,287
But I can not even five feet
the police to let go.

433
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:59,355
So the question is ...

434
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,380
What do we do?

435
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:08,984
Was there a place where you
can go, I would send you there.

436
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:15,690
I is not stupid slut needed
to damage my reputation.

437
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:19,828
And they pay me enough
to be stabbing you in much trouble.

438
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:24,525
I will have another good
about it.

439
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:29,321
Go to your room.

440
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,818
I mean everyone.

441
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,175
You too, Davy.

442
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,034
Sorry, but I must
think hard work.

443
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:04,809
Would you go for a beer?
- No, thanks.

444
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:10,007
Tell your papa but not who gave it to you.

445
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:13,125
Thanks, Ruth.
- Aunt Ruth.

446
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,370
Have you even thought about?
- What?

447
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,482
Meg to the game
to participate.

448
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,846
We now have our own game.

449
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,299
I think not, David.

450
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:38,761
I stayed there so often before sleep.

451
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:40,643
The last time no longer.

452
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,735
Is it because Megan and Susan?
- Yes.

453
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:50,055
I do not understand.
For me this is the same as before.

454
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:54,815
It is not the same,
and you know well what is at stake.

455
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:57,945
I do not know, ma.
- What is it about?

456
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:02,768
He wants to spend the night there again.
- Besides?

457
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,428
Let him sleep.

458
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:11,845
You clearly know the latest
developments not.

459
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:16,358
When the Chandlers live now
two young girls.

460
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,785
Do not be silly, Robert.
- You're silly.

461
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:22,560
Is there any coffee?

462
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:33,817
Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

463
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,640
Now we are complete.

464
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:43,550
The game is something to tell.

465
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:46,360
What say?
- A secret.

466
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:50,135
Sounds good. But how do they
with the gag in her mouth?

467
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,150
They may still not
talk, Mom.

468
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:55,360
You want something, Meggie?
- No, she's not ready.

469
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:56,823
What happens now?

470
00:41:57,024 --> 00:42:00,656
Now we take a book.

471
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,780
Confession it.

472
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,287
Take a book down.

473
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:25,035
Let's see how long they stand it.
- It must have hurt after a while.

474
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:27,075
She is still too easy.

475
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,815
Should they not be allowed
to confess to?

476
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:34,785
No, not so fast.
Take away the other book, Willie.

477
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,913
We have to undress her.
- Yes, her dress.

478
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:47,250
Shut up.
- I do not think this is good ...

479
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:49,131
We got the admission.

480
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:52,667
Let her undressed.

481
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:55,555
That is the game, right?

482
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:58,227
Then we start it.
- I got it.

483
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:01,875
Want to save her clothes, ma?
But then I just underpants.

484
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,823
No, I do not care.

485
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,398
I want to hurt you.

486
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,866
But if you try something ...

487
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:19,428
I will have to.

488
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:22,140
Do not be stupid.

489
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:35,633
Please.

490
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,549
No stairs.

491
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,370
Ready to confess, Megan?

492
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,216
Let me do the rest.

493
00:44:30,957 --> 00:44:33,024
Then let her confess.

494
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:43,642
Now you can confess.

495
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:45,966
Get the ropes.

496
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,917
Do you untie my arms?
They really do hurt.

497
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,868
You get no more.
- Come, confession.

498
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,160
Tell us how you play with yourself.

499
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,403
You stick your finger in there might not?

500
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:10,427
Tell us what you do.
- In the sly.

501
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,014
Is David here?
- Yes, that is here.

502
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,220
Where is Susan?
- That there is.

503
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:27,020
The hell with Susan,
where is your confession?

504
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:29,216
I have nothing to confess!

505
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:37,753
Let me go.

506
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,575
Touch not that girl.

507
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,655
I do not want one of you
touch her.

508
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:47,490
One girl even if it is not proper.

509
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,425
Keep your hands off her.
Understood?

510
00:45:53,444 --> 00:45:56,245
First we have the gag
back into her mouth.

511
00:45:56,248 --> 00:45:57,858
That is totally disgusting.

512
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:03,965
So it is not dirty.

513
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:07,026
They may not all night
are called. Push him into it.

514
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:17,202
Maybe you have a slightly
thinking, girl.

515
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:19,430
About two things even.

516
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:20,562
First.

517
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:25,285
Your little sister before you can hang
instead of you.

518
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:26,570
And second.

519
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:31,625
I know what nasty things you did.
And I wanted them to hear from you sometimes.

520
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,180
Perhaps this confession
yet so no children's game.

521
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:39,125
Either I hear it from one ...

522
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,290
I hear either of the other.

523
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,465
Think about it.

524
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:07,507
I wonder how it feels.

525
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:12,555
As long standing position with hands
tied above her head.

526
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:17,466
It must hurt.

527
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:20,139
Terribly hurt.

528
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,827
Have you seen her?

529
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:26,519
How they looked.

530
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:30,690
Down there.
- I've never seen anything like it.

531
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,780
Let us go see what they make.

532
00:47:33,786 --> 00:47:37,300
Then we have another good look.
- Are you crazy? Mama would hear.

533
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:40,300
We can silently.
- Are you kidding?

534
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:43,555
Even if farting
under the sheets, they hear it already

535
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:57,908
Silence.

536
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,285
She'll want some water.

537
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,282
You idiot. If we give her water
we must remove the prop.

538
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:06,090
So what?
She will not make noise.

539
00:48:06,347 --> 00:48:09,520
You will make any noise he Meg?

540
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:12,645
Otherwise make your mom awake.

541
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:17,041
If they make noise, they find problems.
She is not stupid.

542
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,825
My arms and my shoulders
do so much.

543
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,397
Maybe we can ...
- A little.

544
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:47,150
On one condition.
- All you ask.

545
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,415
You must promise that you will not fight
and you will tell it to anyone.

546
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:51,652
Never.

547
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,511
What say?
- You know.

548
00:48:57,582 --> 00:49:01,268
We will hurt you,
we only want to touch it.

549
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:03,105
None of you will touch me.

550
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:07,425
Wrong. Who will stop us?
- I.

551
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:10,480
Really? How?

552
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,940
You will only get one chance to
touching me, you bastards ...

553
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,083
for I will start screaming.

554
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,910
That leaves the ropes where they are.

555
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:27,002
And you get back a lump in your mouth.

556
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:28,981
And that's that.

557
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:31,076
Well.

558
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,013
Gag me.

559
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:37,056
And then make out of here.

560
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:39,490
We do that.

561
00:49:39,525 --> 00:49:40,985
Open your mouth.

562
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:42,685
Remember our deal.

563
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,541
You got your water.

564
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:49,423
But we have not been.
Understood?

565
00:49:52,147 --> 00:49:55,381
Come on guys, learn the ropes
looser. Ruth will not see.

566
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:58,882
Look at her.
It takes long before the morning.

567
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:11,981
Goodbye.

568
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:26,532
Forward.

569
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:35,625
Eat your toast on, sweetie.

570
00:50:35,874 --> 00:50:41,607
Come on sweetie, eat some of.
- Better not.

571
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:44,875
I will not squander food, Meg.

572
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:46,840
I made that toast for you.

573
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:49,268
What do you want me to do?
Discard it?

574
00:50:49,604 --> 00:50:51,800
Put him there.
I eat it later on.

575
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:53,735
This attracts insects.

576
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:55,970
Cockroaches and ants.

577
00:50:55,977 --> 00:50:59,050
I do not want bugs in the house.

578
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,250
You must eat now.
While fresh.

579
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:06,685
I would eat it,
but I can hardly swallow.

580
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,785
I will drink tea.
Is that good?

581
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,640
Nobody has said
it would be easy.

582
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:17,215
You're a woman, Meg.
And that's not easy.

583
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:19,954
Eat.

584
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,140
You have broken my head, damn.

585
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:33,240
Do you think tea is cheap?

586
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:35,925
I've not broken.

587
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,630
What is this?

588
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:41,165
Who will clean up the mess?

589
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:44,015
I do though.
I promise.

590
00:51:44,022 --> 00:51:46,249
Susan, come here.

591
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:52,463
You love Meg down, the
case they mean or stupid to do.

592
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:56,047
Come stand here.

593
00:51:57,643 --> 00:51:59,915
So we clean the floor.

594
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:02,056
We start with the slut.

595
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,850
We will insert a new regulation.

596
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:06,385
Once you disobey ...

597
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:09,837
speaks to me, strengthens me energy,
anything, missy ...

598
00:52:09,872 --> 00:52:12,290
will pay them.

599
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:14,013
We will try that.

600
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:16,373
Do you think honestly, Suzie?

601
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:20,196
Do you think you should pay
for what your dirty sister doing?

602
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:23,861
No.
- Of course not.

603
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,065
But nobody says
that life is fair.

604
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:32,659
Put the dress the girl up
and pull her panties down to Mama.

605
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:06,240
Where you going?

606
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:07,550
I need help with my dad.

607
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:11,337
We will later play in the water tower.
Involvement

608
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:37,688
Have you ever seen a guy
a girl look whack?

609
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:42,625
I think so.
Drunks or children.

610
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,945
Have you ever wondered
or could do?

611
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:48,440
You mean if I got talking?

612
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,893
This is a difficult question.

613
00:53:56,093 --> 00:53:59,003
A woman is a man
sometimes rod hunting.

614
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:03,030
But you must always think
that the weaker sex.

615
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:05,243
And you're not tough.

616
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:12,340
But despite ...

617
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,956
I have seen women who
it deserved.

618
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:16,265
If you work in a bar that you see sometimes.

619
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,440
A woman has too much to drink.
She is bold and boisterous.

620
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:22,340
Sometimes they give a stab at the man
who is with her. What should they do?

621
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:23,803
Sit?

622
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,925
So he gives her a slap.

623
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,464
But you just said ...
- There are exceptions to the rule.

624
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,801
You should never hit a woman.

625
00:54:34,173 --> 00:54:36,598
And I care but
you never see it.

626
00:54:37,268 --> 00:54:38,925
But sometimes ...

627
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:42,475
you are bound.

628
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,005
Because they have driven too far.

629
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,687
But for both parties.

630
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,705
Good advice.

631
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:55,009
Keep your hands off and makes you
your own business. Man or woman.

632
00:54:55,317 --> 00:54:57,532
You will avoid problems.

633
00:55:33,722 --> 00:55:36,381
Hi, Susan.

634
00:55:38,488 --> 00:55:40,525
Ruth is here somewhere?

635
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:43,921
She is top of the rest.

636
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:52,775
I can not stop them.

637
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,296
Do you?
- I know.

638
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:01,376
I would do it I can.

639
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,077
Do not you think it enough?
- Not dicks.

640
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:24,197
Get up, piece of shit.

641
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:26,802
Your turn to tie her down.

642
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:41,022
Were you forget something, David?

643
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:39,573
Sorry.

644
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:44,600
I have something to say.

645
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,345
Stop moving.

646
00:59:30,745 --> 00:59:33,415
Good morning, David.

647
00:59:35,456 --> 00:59:39,847
Take a beer if you want.
- Maybe later.

648
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:45,671
Goddamn, Donnie.

649
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:54,224
Now we close fires.

650
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,441
Shut up.

651
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,904
Shut up or I'll do it again.

652
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:14,307
You go look.
Careful.

653
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:17,272
Did you hear me?

654
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:22,013
I said:
Shut up or I'll do it again.

655
01:00:24,128 --> 01:00:27,085
Do they handle
when someone at the door?

656
01:00:27,942 --> 01:00:30,110
Should you not control that, Ruth?

657
01:00:30,114 --> 01:00:32,423
Suppose again
Mr. Jennings is.

658
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,806
Who?
- The police, Ruth.

659
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:43,000
I can monitor her for you.

660
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:46,323
Her guard.
- To ensure that they are not running away.

661
01:00:49,553 --> 01:00:53,187
But monitor her.
Good idea.

662
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:04,930
If I hear a noise, I died
you both. I promise.

663
01:01:04,938 --> 01:01:09,080
Not simply punish, but murder.
Death.

664
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:14,554
Do you understand that, David?
Is that clear? Well.

665
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:16,880
Very good.

666
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:34,880
Here she comes.

667
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,315
Good afternoon, Mrs. Chandler.

668
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:40,830
I was in the neighborhood and come to see
how the girls go.

669
01:01:40,836 --> 01:01:44,295
That is kind.
They make it very well.

670
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,424
Come in, please.

671
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,555
The girls are going shopping.

672
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,945
Want a cup of coffee?
- No thanks, Mrs. Chandler.

673
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:04,409
Or a glass of lemonade?
It is such a hot day.

674
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,334
No thanks.

675
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:14,174
I will help you out, Megan.
I have some money saved.

676
01:02:14,608 --> 01:02:16,639
Everything is okay.

677
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:20,513
I make sure that nothing
Susan happens.

678
01:02:21,582 --> 01:02:26,852
And that is all right
when you return.

679
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:29,613
Go to the police.

680
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:32,574
And show them this.

681
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:38,893
Tonight.
I promise.

682
01:02:48,924 --> 01:02:51,240
He is my shadow.

683
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:53,555
Ms. Chandler, I ...

684
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,835
Everyone calls me Ruth.

685
01:02:56,332 --> 01:03:00,170
I got a call from
Ms Marina from the street.

686
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:02,420
Apparently, her eldest son, Tony ...

687
01:03:02,423 --> 01:03:05,485
We know Tony very well.
A very sweet boy.

688
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:11,319
He told his mother that his boys
Meg saw whack away.

689
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:16,245
You know that children always exaggerate.
It would have been a familieruzietje.

690
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:18,973
He told her that she
used as a punching bag.

691
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:22,024
Something my boys would never do.

692
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,845
How did he know?
- What did he know?

693
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:34,022
Did you tell him?
- As told? What do you mean?

694
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:35,950
Do not kid me, David.

695
01:03:35,954 --> 01:03:38,430
According to her ma told you that Jennings
at the door.

696
01:03:38,436 --> 01:03:39,985
How did you know that he was?

697
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,500
I assumed that.
- You had or guessed.

698
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:45,100
I just wanted Ruth ...
- What did you do to her?

699
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:49,156
I wanted her here wegkrijgen.
She looked exactly a zombie.

700
01:03:49,397 --> 01:03:51,709
She was indeed quite strange.

701
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,728
That is true.

702
01:03:55,523 --> 01:03:58,405
What happens to Meg?
- What do you mean?

703
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,962
We need something that burns
lubrication, for they become infected.

704
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,745
To hell with her.

705
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,842
I'm not quite finished with her.

706
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:12,555
But then ...

707
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,392
I am perhaps.

708
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:17,551
I do not know.

709
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:21,477
I just do not know.

710
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,913
Turn that TV softer, Ralphie.

711
01:05:51,245 --> 01:05:53,030
I will leave the back door.

712
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:57,788
They will think that I forgot.
Give me half an hour.

713
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:03,060
Here, take this.
- I can not do this, David.

714
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:06,795
If something goes wrong.

715
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,045
And they find it in me.

716
01:06:09,053 --> 01:06:11,825
Then they will know you were here.

717
01:06:12,877 --> 01:06:16,132
And then we never get any chance.

718
01:06:18,565 --> 01:06:20,608
Hide it for me.

719
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:22,410
Among the large stone.

720
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:31,435
You have really gone, believe me.

721
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:36,017
I'm so sorry.

722
01:06:37,475 --> 01:06:40,386
It is the last thing you did
that is important.

723
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:19,322
Come in and close the door.

724
01:08:54,808 --> 01:08:56,526
Stay here.

725
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,473
There good for you, girl.

726
01:09:07,636 --> 01:09:10,793
You will now have a disease,
but that's not bad.

727
01:09:10,797 --> 01:09:13,122
Today they
there treatments.

728
01:09:14,545 --> 01:09:17,474
I want my mommy.
- Shut up, dammit.

729
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:23,575
Who wants another round?
Eddie? Davy?

730
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:24,600
I want it.

731
01:09:24,604 --> 01:09:28,985
I do not know. So right after your brother.
That seems incest.

732
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,685
Come on, ma.
- No, not really.

733
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:34,654
It would be here hooker
do not care, but ...

734
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,963
it seems to me ...

735
01:09:37,283 --> 01:09:42,526
much more appropriate as it would be Eddie
or Davy.

736
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:48,381
Perhaps you are wise guys.
I would not touch her in any case.

737
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:51,490
But I'm just not a man.

738
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:54,785
I just want to cut her.
- Me too.

739
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:56,095
Cutting?

740
01:09:56,101 --> 01:10:00,055
Why let her fuck you Donnie?
- Shut up, I am talking to Ralphie.

741
01:10:00,778 --> 01:10:02,290
What do you mean cut, baby?

742
01:10:02,296 --> 01:10:05,861
Something in her letter, so everyone
knows that she is a whore.

743
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:15,593
We cut it, ma.

744
01:10:20,696 --> 01:10:23,469
This show you do not do?

745
01:10:24,105 --> 01:10:26,300
The boys have decided.

746
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,566
So we do it.

747
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:33,790
You know what that slut
wanted to do last night?

748
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:35,916
She tried to get out of here.

749
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:39,083
Someone left the door open.

750
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:44,590
We think it was Donnie.
He was here last.

751
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:48,360
And he's always been kind to her.

752
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,600
Why can not I?
- What then?

753
01:10:52,604 --> 01:10:53,880
Fuck her.

754
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:57,550
As I say, damn.
That's incest.

755
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:01,493
Would you mess your brothers in dirt?
You're disgusting.

756
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:04,487
Just like your father.
Say nothing to me.

757
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:06,362
This may not make you, Ruth.

758
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,001
No?

759
01:11:08,358 --> 01:11:10,150
This is not right.

760
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:14,134
Please tell me no
hear or what not, boy.

761
01:11:14,808 --> 01:11:18,650
Never say that to me.

762
01:11:22,413 --> 01:11:24,040
Here we go.

763
01:11:26,026 --> 01:11:28,135
We will have heat.

764
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:30,545
Otherwise she gets an infection.

765
01:11:35,051 --> 01:11:38,552
I'm outta here.
- You're not going anywhere.

766
01:11:39,854 --> 01:11:42,000
I want to see this.

767
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:44,500
Close your eyes, damn.

768
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,695
See?

769
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:40,885
That there forever, Meggie.

770
01:12:40,892 --> 01:12:43,097
You will never have married.

771
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:46,931
You will no
exposing your clothes.

772
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:51,202
That is best for you.

773
01:12:51,473 --> 01:12:53,166
No man will want you.

774
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,425
You will never have problems with children.

775
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:57,008
Price you happy.

776
01:12:57,857 --> 01:13:00,985
You liked to be nice to see.

777
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,870
To be sexy.

778
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:07,000
This world is a woman
more ugly.

779
01:13:10,874 --> 01:13:14,045
So many states they are no longer.
- I told you.

780
01:13:14,053 --> 01:13:16,349
A woman knows such things.

781
01:13:21,925 --> 01:13:24,288
She does not look out.

782
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:26,415
Fuck me.

783
01:13:26,418 --> 01:13:29,415
You would better her
hang again.

784
01:13:31,677 --> 01:13:33,082
Hold on.

785
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:38,595
We have ensured
that no man will want her.

786
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:40,829
But the problem is.

787
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:51,999
That Meg perhaps even
a man wants.

788
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:54,580
Then life becomes a torture.

789
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:58,969
A woman is not over her
a body man.

790
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:02,917
She wants him only
at a particular place.

791
01:14:03,296 --> 01:14:05,760
You know what I'm talking about?

792
01:14:05,764 --> 01:14:08,140
That'll come, dear.

793
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:12,008
A woman wants a man
between her legs.

794
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:13,939
In a small place.

795
01:14:14,106 --> 01:14:17,008
If you spot away ...

796
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:19,076
You know what happens then?

797
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,735
Then you take away her desire.

798
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:25,761
You take that away forever.
That succeeds.

799
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,105
In some countries they always do.

800
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:32,558
It is very common
as a girl a certain age.

801
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:37,173
In Africa, for example,
in New Guinea.

802
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:40,668
They find it even
a civilized custom.

803
01:14:41,013 --> 01:14:45,305
So I wonder
why would we not do?

804
01:14:45,802 --> 01:14:50,091
We just take
that one little spot away.

805
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,791
We burn it away.

806
01:14:52,898 --> 01:14:56,844
Then our work will be perfect.

807
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:05,815
What do you think you going?

808
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:09,655
Wanted this to your whore of a mother
to tell?

809
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:12,345
If you wanted to send Jennings agent?

810
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:14,695
Now hear her.

811
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:19,410
I do not know what to do with you
to do, but I find something.

812
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:23,840
Be happy that you have no place
as it has.

813
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:28,863
But you yourself have two boyfriends
where you can to make sure.

814
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,105
Tie him up, boys.

815
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,215
Where were we?

816
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,605
You hate me?
- Not at all.

817
01:17:47,128 --> 01:17:48,833
And even Meg.

818
01:17:49,662 --> 01:17:52,003
It's all my fault.

819
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:57,400
Without Meg yesterday i had to
run away and never return.

820
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,547
She has tried, Susan.

821
01:18:01,732 --> 01:18:03,550
But they have caught her.

822
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:06,828
She grabbed her when she came up
to fetch me.

823
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:11,470
She could not leave.

824
01:18:11,474 --> 01:18:13,353
I left the door open.

825
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:17,030
She would come and collect you later.

826
01:18:17,034 --> 01:18:19,585
Why is not immediately fled?

827
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:23,269
Probably because ...

828
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:27,183
It happens that Ruth ...

829
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:30,654
touching me.

830
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:34,590
At one time she did me bleed.

831
01:18:34,596 --> 01:18:36,004
I told Meg.

832
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:41,035
That was very angry and told Ruth
she knew what she did with me.

833
01:18:41,038 --> 01:18:43,902
And when Ruth began beating her.

834
01:18:43,912 --> 01:18:45,798
She hit her very much.

835
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:48,780
She had to run away without me.

836
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:51,982
I've never liked it
pain was made.

837
01:18:53,838 --> 01:18:57,790
Calm down, it will be fine.

838
01:19:00,688 --> 01:19:04,872
No Meg, do not.

839
01:19:06,626 --> 01:19:09,227
I'm here, and Susan is there.

840
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:16,375
It hurts so much.

841
01:19:16,383 --> 01:19:17,866
Do not move.

842
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:25,644
Sorry, Megan.

843
01:19:26,821 --> 01:19:28,926
I am so sorry.

844
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,537
It is good, Susan.

845
01:19:34,732 --> 01:19:37,817
We have tried.

846
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,000
Is it night?

847
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:44,120
Therefore, I think ...

848
01:19:44,123 --> 01:19:46,937
my parents are worried
if I did not come home.

849
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:51,625
I can not, David.
- Rest.

850
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:57,445
I have to find something that I
can hurt them.

851
01:19:57,452 --> 01:19:59,568
So we miscarry.

852
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:01,675
There is nothing.

853
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:04,699
You know how many times
I've tried?

854
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:06,460
There is something.

855
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:10,798
Maybe.

856
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:15,496
But there must have something else
done.

857
01:21:33,307 --> 01:21:35,430
Put the knife away.

858
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:37,458
Throw it away, I say.

859
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:44,261
Take him away.

860
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:01,525
What happened?

861
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:03,948
It was Ruth, Mr. Jennings.

862
01:22:04,362 --> 01:22:06,195
It was Ruth.

863
01:22:06,591 --> 01:22:08,974
She has done Meg.

864
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,811
Because that gave her problems.

865
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:14,665
Stay here with her.

866
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:45,480
Not talking.

867
01:22:46,742 --> 01:22:49,015
Would you do me a favor?

868
01:22:49,451 --> 01:22:51,266
Of course.

869
01:22:54,505 --> 01:22:57,858
Want the ring of my mother
return?

870
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,359
Thank you.

871
01:23:40,468 --> 01:23:44,043
I thought it was a dream.

872
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:51,779
That you tried to help me.

873
01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:56,695
A dream.

874
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:02,969
But it was no dream.

875
01:24:03,985 --> 01:24:08,221
You have not abandoned me.

876
01:24:13,088 --> 01:24:16,086
Do you mind?

877
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:27,023
Now she can ...

878
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:32,557
I do not hurt anymore.

879
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:43,333
You will now take care of me, right?

880
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:51,124
And Susan too?

881
01:24:59,156 --> 01:25:02,104
I do not think I will save.

882
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:07,224
I love you.

883
01:26:04,354 --> 01:26:06,685
The past always catches up to you.

884
01:26:06,687 --> 01:26:08,894
Whether you like it or not.

885
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:16,029
This can be a gift,
or a curse. If you allow that.

886
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:41,456
I will never be the gift
Meg Loughlin forgotten.

887
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:46,140
Although I am haunted by
the agony that I have failed ...

888
01:26:46,143 --> 01:26:48,330
