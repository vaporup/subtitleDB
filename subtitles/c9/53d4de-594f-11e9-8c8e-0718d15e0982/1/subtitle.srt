1
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,353
Jo, are you ready?

2
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:13,322
Hey, baby. No, no - um...
Yes, I'm all set.

3
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,115
Why don't you get something to eat?

4
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,368
Jo, we're already late.

5
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,516
Did you grab a bottle of wine?

6
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,206
If we get hitten, you could lose an eye.

7
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,920
Not todayÃ‰

8
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,674
How was your day?

9
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,075
My day was fine.

10
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,139
Thank you.

11
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,822
Michael where's the wine?
What?

12
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,117
Wine.
Shit!

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,819
Wait, wait, wait...

14
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,625
Hello!

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,922
You look nice baby.
Thanks.

16
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,519
Come.

17
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,000
I love you.

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,196
Oh, you didn't bring Sarah?
You didn't tell her?

19
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,719
See you in hour.
You should be finished by then.

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,116
Oh well, thank you for that!

21
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,036
Barbara! Hello!
Thanks for having us.

22
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,829
Come see me upstairs.
I will.

23
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,416
How long were you two together?
Three months.

24
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,252
Three months?
Three months already?

25
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,715
Talking to Monroe, I think we should schedule
another meeting for Monday.

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,301
Okay, let's just see how tomorrow goes.

27
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:42,779
I bet you didn't like Sarah either, did you?
I did! I said I did!

28
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,473
Yeah, but I don't think that you meant it.

29
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,951
Thanks.
Welcome.

30
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,394
Why's it so hard for me, Jo?

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,856
It isn't. I mean it can't be.
You haven't gone to the hard bit yet.

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,441
What it gets harder than this?
- Joanna?

33
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,027
Hello!
Hi, so good to see you.

34
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,904
Thank you for having us.

35
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,447
Andy...
Stuart...

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,119
Michael says you're working on a new book.

37
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,664
Michael always says that.

38
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,540
He's probably right.

39
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,585
I just don't know it?

40
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,969
Well, I got to go and talk to somebody.

41
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,341
Eat, I'll be here.

42
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,143
He hates me.
He's gonna fire me. I know.

43
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,220
You say that every week.
Yeah well, it's true.

44
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,972
But it hasn't been in the last two years.

45
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,842
Well maybe he's just waiting for the right time.

46
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:29,434
Hey do you want me to walk Lucy,
while you guys are away?

47
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,978
Yeah, that'd be great.

48
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,397
Where is Michael anyway?

49
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,116
Here he is.

50
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,517
Here he is, let's go!

51
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,489
Joanna?
Um yes no I'm going to go to the ladies.

52
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,409
I'll catch you up.
Okay.

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,065
I'm starving.

54
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,779
Hey, where have you guys been?
I got totally ambushed by Stuart.

55
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,400
The guy's hasn't talked to me in two weeks -

56
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,616
- and sees me with your wife,
and just lit up.

57
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,232
Laura, this is my Joanna.
Hello! Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,992
Joanna, this is Laura. She's our new designer,
who has worked for us.

59
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,170
Nice to finally meet you.

60
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:41,089
So Michael tells me you're a writer.
Yes, I am.

61
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,426
I've been meaning to order your book.
That's nice.

62
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,096
Oh! Look, look! Oh my god!
Neal he's trying with Cynthia again.

63
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,599
She's not going to go for it.
I know. It just won't work.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,091
Why not?
He's a good looking guy.

65
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,728
Why did you turn him down?

66
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,079
Speak of the devil...

67
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,198
Hey, Neal!
Had any luck with Cynthia?

68
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,999
Hi Joanna!
Hello.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Had any luck?
What?

70
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,780
You didn't really go to
"The Yogo" with her, did you?

71
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,825
She told you that?
She told me about that!

72
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,411
Still with Cynthia huh?
What? You're getting jealous?

73
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,332
So what's Laura's story ?

74
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,585
Stuart recruited her.
She seems to be good.

75
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,024
She's working the Monroe project with us.

76
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,110
Of course she is...

77
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,719
Try to get me some wine?

78
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,909
That's not funny.

79
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:01,803
There you go.
Hi. Would you like a drink?

80
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,231
Yeah, white wine please.
Sure.

81
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,134
Thanks.

82
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,451
Is she going to Philadelphia with you guys tomorrow?

83
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:14,249
Yeah.

84
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,978
And she was in LA with
Michael last month?

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,822
Taxi!

86
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,077
Have you been smoking?

87
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,457
You really going to attempt to give me
a grief about that?

88
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,035
What's wrong?

89
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,187
Nothing.

90
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,885
Have I done something wrong?

91
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,186
She is pretty.
Who?

92
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,651
You never mentioned that.

93
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,707
Laura?
Yeah, Laura.

94
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,877
I think you described her as "whatever".

95
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,922
I don't remember.
I bet.

96
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,055
You didn't tell me that she was in LA with you.

97
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,599
She's wasn't in LA with me.
We were just there at the same time.

98
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,268
Michael, face me!

99
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,897
You didn't tell me anything about her, before tonight,
but then I think you know that.

100
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,691
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,570
What did you think could happen tonight?

102
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,948
And seriously, did you think I just wouldn't notice?

103
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,617
Why would I think anything would make you notice her?

104
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,619
You're a terrible liar!

105
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,371
Might be because
I don't l lie.

106
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,707
She likes you,
and you like her.

107
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,208
Of course you don't want to talk to me
about it.

108
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,927
Where is this come from?
My eyes, Michael!

109
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,628
She's she the only one you talked to,
all night.

110
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,967
How many glasses of wine did you have
tonight, Jo?

111
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,795
Two and two sips.
Is that really your response?

112
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,330
You had more than that.

113
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:00,765
What are you?
The drink patrol?

114
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,977
Well remind me when we go out,
and I ask you not to have another.

115
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,521
You ask me why.
This is why.

116
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,066
You're kidding me, right?
Because it makes you like this, baby.

117
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,071
Michael without wine we would be in a
much shittier place.

118
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,867
Eleven hours a day.
Five, sometimes six days a week.

119
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:23,496
That's sixty hours a week with her,
three months now.

120
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:28,501
What is it you think I have done?
Check my phone, Jo.

121
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,996
And check my e-mails, check receipts, go on.

122
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,673
Not everyone gets caught, Michael.

123
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,886
Has she told you she's attracted to you?

124
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,971
Maybe, Joanna.

125
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,932
I don't let the conversation go there.

126
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,851
But she tried to, hasn't she?

127
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,604
But she tried to when you were
in LA together?

128
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,774
You do hours I do not know about,
with the people that you work with.

129
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,485
You go away -

130
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,072
- doing articles, all the time!

131
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,703
Have I ever given you a reason to stand here
feeling the way that I am right now?

132
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,650
I looked through a window tonight and I
saw something that I didn't need to see.

133
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,639
Couldn't you just have watched yourself
and spared me?

134
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,003
What the fuck are you doing!?

135
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,939
I want to charge the phone.
Why do you always have to use this one?

136
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,509
Why did you build a Berlin wall of freakin' magazines!?

137
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,724
I haven't done anything wrong,
and you try to pick a fight.

138
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,977
I spare you.

139
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,126
I would.

140
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,471
What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,161
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,009
Is she going to Philadelphia with you and Andy tomorrow?

143
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,461
Uh-huh, cause she's been working on
the Monroe properly with us.

144
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,006
Why? What does that look?

145
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,007
That looks sad, Michael.

146
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,888
There's nothing going on,  Jo.
Laura is just someone I work with.

147
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:10,152
It's not that I'm blaming you for being
attracted to her. She's... -

148
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:11,521
- attractive.

149
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,985
And it's natural to crave newness.

150
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,745
So what are you blaming me for?

151
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,457
For going out of your way not to admit it.

152
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,086
Thought I just did.

153
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,301
Don't do that face, Jo...

154
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,684
You know what I meant.

155
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,814
You corner me, and you order me
to admit something -

156
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,985
and then you're pouncing me the second I came,
and now you're going to sleep on the couch?

157
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,945
Fucking fantastic!

158
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,241
I did not do anything wrong, Jo.

159
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,105
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,526
What for?

161
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm not sure but,
I love you.

162
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,008
Come to bed.

163
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,494
I don't want to.

164
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,708
Come to the kitchen.

165
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,752
Food isn't going to fix this.

166
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,012
Soon you'll have a full stomach.
Come on.

167
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,468
We got any tomatoes?
No.

168
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,616
How was your day?

169
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,995
Oh, but...

170
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,124
What?
Nothing,  I just remembered I'm mad at you.

171
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,834
I hate it when that happens.

172
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,000
Danny proposed!

173
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,339
Yeah!

174
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,884
What Pia said?
What did you think she said? Yes!

175
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,251
Was she surprised at all?

176
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,762
Yes, she thought that he was going to tell her
he was moving out.

177
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,985
My mum called.
Yeah, I know. I spoked to her.

178
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,657
Second week of December.
I' ve already said yes.

179
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,327
Can we go via London?
Yeah, sure.

180
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,082
What time is your train?
At 8:00.

181
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,293
You shouldn't be up this late.

182
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,836
I'll sleep on the train.

183
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,811
It's an hours ride.
I'll sleep in the meeting.

184
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,718
What are you doing tomorrow or today?

185
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,171
I got to finish up the accessories piece.

186
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:32,864
Yeah, with pearls?

187
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,642
Yeah, I'll dig up another hundred words.

188
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,479
It's good. And then you can work on the book,
without me here to distract you.

189
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,403
Joanna, I'm sorry.

190
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,366
I would have said something about her,
if I thought there was something to say.

191
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,612
Michael, did something happen in LA?

192
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,964
No.

193
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,086
I swear.
No.

194
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,591
Eggs are good.

195
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,387
Yeah.

196
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,108
What about the orange juice?

197
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,151
Come on.
What kind of cafe is this?

198
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,580
Do you think we got married too soon?

199
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,745
What?

200
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,672
Why can't you make yourself consider that?

201
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,342
Because I don't have to.

202
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,013
I don't think we got married too soon -

203
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,181
- because we married after four years.

204
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,726
Yeah, with a break up in the middle.

205
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,479
And anyway, it's not about the amount of time
but the when of time -

206
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,482
- and our when included college.

207
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,583
You know, that was before we were even us, you know.

208
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,576
Do you think it's even the same
between us?

209
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,621
It got better...

210
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,335
Can you hear yourself right now?

211
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,506
What?

212
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:35,970
Just because I disagree with you,
means I'm not aware of what I'm saying?

213
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,930
You can't really think that.

214
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,975
I do think that.
How?

215
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,645
Sunday night.
The last two weekends.

216
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,565
Breakfast yesterday.
Dinner last night.

217
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,776
There's no bullshit between us.

218
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,363
With the possible exception of this evening.

219
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,288
Come here, Jo.
I'm cold.

220
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,775
Got your orange juice?
No. Thank you!

221
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,968
You're gonna try to get some writing done?
"Try" is a big word.

222
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,444
No, it's not.

223
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,186
Alright, I got to go.
See you later.

224
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,313
Bye.

225
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,589
Hello.
A cup of coffee, please.

226
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,248
Joanna!

227
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,364
Alex! What are you doing here?

228
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,865
I have some work here.

229
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,578
I can't believe this!

230
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,540
Yeah, it's been a while.
How are you?

231
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:37,628
I'm fine, I just can't believe you're here.
How did you know I'd be here?

232
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,447
I keep tabs on you.

233
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,340
I'm serious.
So am I.

234
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,886
Your Christmas cards.
They gave the return address on them.

235
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,806
What if I' d moved?
You haven' t.

236
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,976
How long are you in New York for?

237
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,479
I leave tomorrow. Actually, I'm late for a meeting.

238
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,899
Do you have time for me now?

239
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,862
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Good.

240
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,614
Then I call you later with the time.

241
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,242
Wait, wait, do you need my number?
Has it changed?

242
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,828
No...

243
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,080
Then I call you later?

244
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,418
Wait!

245
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,378
Cause I've never been able to sleep -

246
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,180
- think that by the time I sleep I won't wake up
for about four years.

247
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:57,083
Be like, ...

248
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,330
I need to use the men's room.
Okay.

249
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,797
Michael, we have to wait for Andy.

250
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:07,028
It's funny, because I could actually.. I could sleep anywhere.

251
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,449
Is that right?
Yes, I could probably fall sleep right here.

252
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,838
Right here?

253
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,226
Six, four, seven, two, two.

254
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,441
Operator! Operator!

255
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,238
Operator!

256
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,037
Good morning!
How can I help you?

257
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,488
I need to check in.

258
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,207
Name please?
Michael Reed.

259
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,604
Hello.

260
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,955
Yeah?

261
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,025
About noon, I thought I hallucinated
the whole thing.

262
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,445
Yeah, Yeah, No, No.
That sounds good.

263
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,033
Okay, No...
I'll meet you there.

264
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,329
Alright, see you there.
Bye.

265
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,157
Wow, you look beautiful!
Thank you.

266
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,244
You caught me off guard this morning.
You looked just as beautiful then.

267
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,206
Shall we sit?
Okay.

268
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,177
So do I look different?
No.

269
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,097
I feel older.
You look the same.

270
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,476
You smell the same.

271
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,728
You do too.

272
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,349
Okay...
Let's get you a drink.

273
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,234
Yeah!

274
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:38,864
Can I have two vodka-martinis on ice,
with olives? Thank you.

275
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,452
Can't be that kind of a night.
I know.

276
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,581
The last time we saw each other.
Claridge's.

277
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,882
For drinks.

278
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,883
That was almost...

279
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,184
Two years ago.

280
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,259
That's right. So how's work?
How's the book?

281
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,013
I don't know. But it's finished.
It is?

282
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,265
That's great!
Can I read it?

283
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,893
Of course!
Do you speak french?

284
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,938
No, good.
Okay...

285
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,773
We 're starting early.
Excellent!

286
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,235
The translation is almost finished.
You'll read it.

287
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,488
How's Paris?
How are you?

288
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,409
I'm good.
How's your work?

289
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,373
I'm doing freelance.
Fashion stuff mainly. It's good. It's ok.

290
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,510
Where are you staying?

291
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,462
Here.
Oh, right.

292
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,802
You're still afraid of this object being you
for too long, right?

293
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,351
Come on this is strange.
Us having a drink?

294
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,311
You in New York.

295
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,605
Why?

296
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,482
Because you don't belong here.

297
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,684
Thank you.

298
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,697
So...

299
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,032
Tell me something that counts.

300
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,955
It's been too long since I've seen you.

301
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,790
I meant something personal.

302
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,791
That is something very personal.

303
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,467
Are you seeing someone at the moment?

304
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,846
Tell me about her.

305
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,987
We are... -

306
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,943
- happily under-committed.

307
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,021
How long?

308
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,024
Few months.
That's long.

309
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,277
"For you" .
I wasn't gonna say that!

310
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,578
It was good seeing you...

311
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,453
Bless the Martini!

312
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,793
Obviously you guys won't keep
the hotel open -

313
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,045
 -as long as possible while we're doing work.

314
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,465
It's definitely something you need to think about
as far as how we run phases -

315
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,176
Because now it's becoming very important - 

316
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,512
- thinking about maybe solar panels -

317
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,264
- double paint glass in all the rooms.

318
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,783
It's actually something that Michael has invested

319
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,187
a lot of his time and making sure.
It's actually something - 

320
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,788
- for people who stay at your hotel, because you have these options -

321
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,583
- and we think this is really something.

322
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,386
It's a lot of money upfront, you then you get a payoff.

323
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:23,754
Absolutely!

324
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,074
So Stuart tells me that you guys could probably
bring in about three months.

325
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,159
Do you agree with that?
There's no problem.

326
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,628
Is it alright?
Yeah.

327
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,246
It's all about the timing.

328
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,082
Start paying next week and we could be done
by the end of this year.

329
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,533
Alright.

330
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,548
You know yout timing is nuts.
Why? Are you getting a divorce?

331
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,842
No!
And then?

332
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,388
I think it's possible that I will you into being
in my life.

333
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,683
It's like if I think about you too long
you pick up on it.

334
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,977
Were you thinking about me?

335
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:58,647
I always think about you when thinks
aren't going well.

336
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,441
What wasn't going well?

337
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:08,724
We should get going.

338
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:11,034
Where?
My room...

339
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,581
I'm kidding!

340
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,001
I'm having dinner with - 

341
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,337
- you know the man who bought the permission house
and who is in France?

342
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,840
You're coming with me?
No, I am not.

343
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,050
Why not?
It's your work dinner!

344
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,568
No no - not at all!

345
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:30,349
I've known him for a long time.
He's a friend.

346
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,830
You'll like him, and his wife.

347
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,224
I wouldn't fell comfortable.

348
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,644
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I can't cancel.

349
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,038
Come on! It's been two years.

350
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,981
Michael won't let you out one night?

351
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,902
Michael is out of town.

352
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,923
I'll get the check.

353
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,041
Still a little early for
grabbing a drink?

354
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:03,170
Not so much.
We have an early day tomorrow.

355
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,881
All the more reason to relax
a little tonight.

356
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,716
I don't think that'd be relaxing.

357
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,426
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

358
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,023
So if there's anything you'd like to
add to the presentation -

359
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,692
- we should probably meet a little earlier.
Absolutely.

360
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,120
How long? 30 minutes?
Yes, 30 minutes.

361
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,972
How's the view?

362
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,774
It's good.

363
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,487
Thanks for dinner.
See you tomorrow.

364
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,740
Thanks, goodnight.
Goodnight.

365
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,617
I'm exhausted.

366
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,386
I swear meeting conversations are
right there with working out.

367
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:19,976
Not that I work out, though...

368
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,548
God, I feel like a drink!

369
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:22,849
No, no. Not me.

370
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,793
Plus I thought that it didn't sound relaxing?

371
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,879
Well it didn't. Not with Zach.
You up for it?

372
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,340
Sure, I'll have one.

373
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,427
Really? Because I think you didn't
get much sleep last night.

374
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,388
I'm ok. Call you in the morning,
go for the run.

375
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,027
How is your mum?

376
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,462
She's better, thanks.

377
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,407
Hello.
How are you?

378
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,994
Your friends are there.
Hey, Alex!

379
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,372
Hey!
Hey! How are you?

380
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,332
Great!
Good to see you!

381
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,792
Alex!

382
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,978
So, Joanna, this is Sandra.

383
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,321
Hello.
Hi.

384
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,424
Joanna, Truman. Truman, Joanna.

385
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,843
How are you?
Excellent! Good to see you!

386
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,433
God, you're good looking!
Thank you!

387
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,734
She is!
Look at her!

388
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,064
I had no idea you were seeing
someone in New York.

389
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,817
No, no. We're just good friends.
Who sleep together!?

390
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,172
Oh come on! I was joking.
I was wondering but you know -

391
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,783
- it's way too early in the evening -

392
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,911
- to answer a question like that.

393
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,038
Well, she's not answering and neither am I.

394
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,500
- And no.

395
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,635
Thank you!

396
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,546
So, where do you two know each other from?

397
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,106
Go ahead.

398
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,177
Paris!
I was writing a story and -

399
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,679
- a mutual friend had a dinner.

400
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,473
When was that?

401
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,518
That was about 4 years ago?

402
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,271
What kind of wine guys?
We'll have the Brunello we had last week.

403
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,482
So, Joanna.
What do you write?

404
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,777
Articles.
Freelance mainly.

405
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:18,281
She writes books.
She's written one very good one already.

406
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,492
What's your last name?
Read.

407
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,036
Was the first book not received well?

408
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,831
Wasn't really received at all.
She went with the wrong publisher.

409
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,051
I think, if it had been received,
it wouldn't have been received well.

410
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,657
You're being modest.
No!

411
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:32,838
Yes!
I wish!

412
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,756
Alright, I got ten more questions.

413
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,800
Do you want me to bring the specials?
Yeah.

414
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,553
Would you like another?

415
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:46,768
That guy with the green sweater, if he leaves,
I'll have another.

416
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,690
Why?

417
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,195
I spent 12 and 13 doing things
on the basis -

418
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,115
- of other things happening
or not happening.

419
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,632
Like...

420
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:06,897
If my mother wore her navy skirt to work -

421
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,406
- instead of her navy pants -

422
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,750
- then I wouldn't talk to anybody on the bus -

423
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,337
- but if she wore pants, then I'd have to.

424
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,268
Afraid to be responsible for what you did.

425
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,921
Exactly...

426
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,524
And now?

427
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,103
I'm obviously experiencing a relapse.

428
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,684
I'd love another drink.
Okay.

429
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,078
Just not here...

430
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,171
Okay...

431
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,113
This thing in my life with the most random unrandom things -

432
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:05,155
- happen to me all the time,
does that make sense?

433
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,539
Yes!
No!

434
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,867
I mean it makes sense to me,
because I know you.

435
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:11,895
Joanna?

436
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,504
Maggie!

437
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,149
I thought that was you.
What are you doing here?

438
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,069
We're just having dinner.
Where's Michael?

439
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:22,548
He's out of town at the moment.

440
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,055
Okay...

441
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,370
Well, call me.

442
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,373
Yeah, okay.

443
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,251
Enjoy your dinner.
Thank you, bye bye.

444
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,337
Your best friend?

445
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,716
I'm so sorry I didn't introduce you.
Don't be.

446
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,720
Unless you couldn't remember our names.
Because I do that.

447
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,156
Me too, actually.

448
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:49,566
No worries.

449
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,294
Who's Michael?

450
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:53,613
He's my husband.

451
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,446
God, it tastes good.
I didn't know you ordered this.

452
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,365
Of course you can have mine?

453
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,450
So tell me about your wife.

454
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,329
Where's that come from?

455
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,040
I don't know.
It just came.

456
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,806
She's great.

457
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,880
What does she do,
when you're out of town?

458
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,176
Same things she does
when I'm in town.

459
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,095
What she's doing tonight?

460
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,181
I don't know.

461
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,434
I thought you called her.

462
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,927
Yeah I did.

463
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:35,895
I just couldn't get through.

464
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,857
How long have you been married?

465
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,485
Three years.
Yeah?

466
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,655
And you guys dated a while before?

467
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,409
Yeah, we met in college.

468
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,820
You met young.

469
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,956
Yeah, we did.

470
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,883
I got to find the men's room.
I'll meet you at the bar.

471
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,910
If it's a mingy cat -

472
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,578
- that really means that it's a bad sign.

473
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,331
In dream world, a mingy cat...
Who's phone is that?

474
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,794
Sorry it's me..,
Michael is out of town, excuse me.

475
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,104
Hello, hello!

476
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:53,264
Hey!
Where are you?

477
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,811
Well, I'm grabbing a bite, I just stepped out.
How's your day?

478
00:39:59,312 --> 00:40:01,212
Is it my phone or is it yours?

479
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:03,900
It's got to be yours, I hear you fine.
What?

480
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,152
I said I hear you fine.

481
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,405
How was your day?

482
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:12,406
It's good. I got some work down.
This isn't a very good connection.

483
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,285
No, it's not that good.

484
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,663
Are you out?

485
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,915
I'm in a men's room -

486
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,042
- we're still with the clients.

487
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,795
Okay.
Why don't you give me a call tomorrow morning?

488
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,549
Okay.
Love you.

489
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,135
I love you.
Bye.

490
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,654
I love it, when you come back at the table,
and your food is there!

491
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,991
How long have you been married?
Three years.

492
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,660
Have any kids?
No, no. You?

493
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,328
No.
None.

494
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,830
I never wanted any.

495
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,917
In fact, that's why my first wife and I
broke up.

496
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,919
That didn't came up
before you got married?

497
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,630
Yes, of course it did, but
I think she thought that -

498
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,675
- I would change after we got married.

499
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,051
But people don't change.

500
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,431
I mean, at most your weight fluctuates and
you start dressing differently.

501
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,069
I realize for a host of reasons I -

502
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:35,241
- I probably shouldn't be going here,
but I'm going to.

503
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,788
That night in LA, when we all
went to that bar -

504
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,124
- we sat on those low couches -

505
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,879
- and Jeff wanted to sit next to us,
so you had to move over.

506
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:55,011
Your hand sort of rested against my leg.

507
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,556
Was that on purpose?

508
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,689
I had to be careful not to really
let it rest there.

509
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,945
Cause you moved.

510
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,282
I didn't move.
I wouldn't have.

511
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,014
I'm married.

512
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,507
I know.

513
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:45,631
Still it felt nice.

514
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,098
That is so embarrassing!
Thank you.

515
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:57,378
Usually she's doing it better.

516
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:59,701
No, the point was that I love Italy.

517
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,413
I love it there.
We have a place, we go there -

518
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,457
- one month a year.
It's so wonderful.

519
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,958
Wait! This is who you went to Italy with?
When?

520
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,121
When I got to Paris early, and -

521
00:43:11,147 --> 00:43:13,840
- your little cousin was staying in the apartment,
till you got back -

522
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,801
- and you were away with Patrick and his friends.

523
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,386
Yeah, exactly!
This is them.

524
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,890
That's really so weird!
And you seemed familiar!

525
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,726
How funny.

526
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,357
What if you were married?

527
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,487
Hypotheticals don't do much for me, but...

528
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,533
Probably nothing different.

529
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,499
Are you happy?
With what?

530
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,129
With your marriage.
Yeah.

531
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,558
Very.

532
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,846
You can be happy and still be tempted.

533
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,689
I know.

534
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,393
Just surprised you do.

535
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,858
Have you ever been with someone else
since you've been married?

536
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,611
No.

537
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,739
Have you wanted to be?

538
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:24,452
What happened?

539
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,748
Think of Joanna.

540
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,337
You regret not doing it?

541
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,093
I'd regret more if I did.

542
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,690
You ever cheated on anybody?

543
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,484
Cheated?

544
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,027
Have you?

545
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,229
No.

546
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,826
Not necessarily on principle,
I just -

547
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,577
- I never wanted to.

548
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,002
Alex, I know you want them.
I need one yeah.

549
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,464
And I know you want one.

550
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,384
No, no, no.
She wants to keep me company.

551
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,953
I do. I do.
You do? I do.

552
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,681
Okay.
So have a good night.

553
00:45:28,182 --> 00:45:30,186
It's a trap.
I know.

554
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,116
You'll never change.

555
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:40,027
When was the last time you saw Alex?
Two years ago.

556
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,904
So you know Helen?

557
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:44,632
Helen?

558
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,784
Alex's girlfriend from Paris.

559
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,708
Well, we are not very good at keeping touch with -

560
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:58,254
- the dailies.
We talk when we talk.

561
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:03,468
She's nice. I don't think he's going
to settle down with her anytime soon.

562
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,847
But I don't know that Alex would ever settle down,
with anyone.

563
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,725
He seems more whole,
on his own.

564
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,353
So where is your husband?

565
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,954
He's in Philidelphia on a business trip.

566
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,777
What's he do?

567
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,820
Commercial real estate development -

568
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,491
- but, I don't think this was the question
you wanted to ask.

569
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,203
No, it wasn't.
Go ahead.

570
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,205
I usually tend to go too far.

571
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,124
Okay, warning heard.

572
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,168
Does your husband know Alex?

573
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,256
No.

574
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,009
Does he know of him?
No.

575
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,430
Have I gone too far?
Yeah, maybe, but it's fun!

576
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,934
Why haven't you told him?

577
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:59,982
I think when you know something like that,
you can't unlearn it.

578
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,277
So there is a something like that.

579
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,782
Are you faithful?
Yes.

580
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,578
Will he forgive you,
if you were not?

581
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,456
He's always said
that he wouldn't.

582
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,292
Does that stop you?

583
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,255
Yeah, probably.

584
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,925
How long were you with Alex together?

585
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,927
We were never really together.

586
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,180
We were more kind of on and off.

587
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,601
You think you'll tell your husband
about tonight?

588
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,814
I don't know.
Tonight is not finished yet.

589
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,254
Remember the last time we were here,
and we got in the wrong car?

590
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,247
When was that?
Remember how far we went before you remembered?

591
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,215
Ten blocks. Hey guys, come on.

592
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,734
Why don't you just drive with us?

593
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,261
Oh shit, Lucy!
Who?

594
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,431
A friend's dog.
I said I'd walk her.

595
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,974
Where is she?

596
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,684
She's on our friend's apartment.

597
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,437
Are you just saying that to get out of
going to the party?

598
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,772
No, No! I know! I swear!

599
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,277
When were you last in New York?

600
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,072
Nine months ago.

601
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,700
Why didn't you get in touch?

602
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,706
I wasn't alone...

603
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,415
Can't get the key out!

604
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,160
Andy cooks?

605
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:02,373
No, I bought that for him last year
I doubt he's ever used it.

606
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,001
I do that when we're over.

607
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,169
So why aren't you writing?

608
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,463
I am writing!

609
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,903
No, why aren't you writing?

610
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:13,217
You mean...
Your book, Joanna.

611
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:20,349
My editor says that I just need to get over
my doubt.

612
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,062
What do you doubt?
Everything, Alex.

613
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,066
I go to write -

614
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:33,362
- and every word, every thought, every choice
that I make leads to another and -

615
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,614
- I doubt every single one I make.

616
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,658
It wasn't like this last time.

617
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,078
You live with your first book
all your life -

618
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:43,380
- it comes out on its own.

619
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,002
After that though, it's just different.
You can suddenly write -

620
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,714
- anything and you second-guess everything.

621
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:57,762
Doubts will kill your work.
Who me? I don't know.

622
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,598
What's the matter with doubt?

623
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,568
I think the world could use
a little more doubt.

624
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:04,977
So I doubt...

625
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:06,771
For the good of the world?

626
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,439
Exactly.

627
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,024
No, thank you.

628
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,861
Your first book was good, Joanna.

629
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,744
You know I think you might just have ruined
this kitchen for me.

630
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,468
How?

631
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:26,457
By being in it.

632
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,587
I come here all the time,
and now you've been here.

633
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,602
Remind me why it didn't work?

634
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,821
Geography.

635
00:51:48,822 --> 00:51:50,564
People live between two cities.

636
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,691
I don't, and neither do you.

637
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,277
And timing.

638
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,946
You were broken up!

639
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,325
Temporarily. Technically, whateverly...

640
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,785
We got back together -

641
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,913
- after we'd already been together
for a really long time.

642
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,998
You came after.

643
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,128
So you're with him, 
because he came first?

644
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,089
He did, and I love him -

645
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,426
- and I love you too, and I love
being able to tell you the truth.

646
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,667
And I love...

647
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:26,016
Faith, loyalty and all that shit, even now.

648
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,352
And this?

649
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,413
This?

650
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,819
I don't know that this would be 
what it is on its own.

651
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,999
This is only what it is, because it's something that's between -

652
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:47,079
- me, my marriage to Michael,
you and your set of things.

653
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,834
Does Andy have anything to drink?

654
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,052
What are my things?
Nothing, I'm criticizing.

655
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,643
I'm just...

656
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:07,183
I know that if we went for it,
we'd lose it.

657
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,853
That's hard to lose,
because we never wear out.

658
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,190
We were just getting to know,
that we weren't right for each other.

659
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,709
You didn't want to!

660
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,902
No.
No?

661
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,779
I came to Paris for two months!

662
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,381
You do hold that against me.

663
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:26,535
I don't hold anything against you!
I was finishing a book.

664
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,592
I was too tired to figure out -

665
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:30,497
- what you being there even meant.

666
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,376
It should have meant that you wanted
to spend some time with me.

667
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:38,964
It doesn't matter.
No, it matter to me.

668
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,926
Because I'm the one who has to see you here.

669
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,261
I'm the one who has to look around Andy's

670
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,722
- to see these pictures of you in this life.

671
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,742
What?

672
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,853
I was what you needed to be sure of Michael?

673
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,733
No. No.
It doesn't work like that.

674
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,365
I think...

675
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:09,954
Maybe I've wanted this to change.

676
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,122
Everything...

677
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:17,461
Everything changes, but this,
this still hasn't.

678
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,590
Not for me.
That's a lesson.

679
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,512
I saw you this morning...

680
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,561
And... in the middle of most nights, when I can't sleep -

681
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,731
- I still replay you.

682
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,719
I'm going to take her out for a walk.

683
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,355
Keys, Alex!

684
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,317
I thought you took them with you.
No.

685
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,569
Oh merde!

686
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,446
Did you leave them upstairs?

687
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,157
Yeah, can we call someone?

688
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:13,952
We can call Caroline, but...

689
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:22,836
Shit!

690
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,902
Give me that, I'll give it back to you tomorrow.
Let's go.

691
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,645
You weren't lying about the dog!
No!

692
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,823
Come with me.
Let us find Fred.

693
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:08,141
Okay.

694
00:58:12,234 --> 00:58:15,861
Her husband's best friend's dog.

695
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,585
She's the one Chris told me about?
I don't know.

696
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,964
At Phillips wedding, after you just broken off
with Lauren.

697
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,135
I asked him, what the hell was
wrong with you.

698
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,056
I liked Lauren.

699
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,768
But I like this one much more.

700
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,670
She's smart.
Yeah.

701
00:58:47,705 --> 00:58:49,399
She's funny.
Yeah.

702
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,900
She's gorgeous!
I know.

703
00:58:53,451 --> 00:58:54,801
And she's honest.

704
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,076
Well I mean, besides the fact she's out with you,
and her husband is out of town.

705
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,870
But she's married.

706
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:07,167
I know.
No, you don't. No, you've never been married.

707
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,349
I mean fuck the vows.

708
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,922
 It's the years you can't undo.

709
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:16,635
You will never be able to take her away
the years with her husband.

710
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:21,557
And the moment you try, this,
this will be gone.

711
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:26,103
Trust me.
That would be a shame.

712
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:33,402
I bet you've had less than a hundred days
together, am I right?

713
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:37,503
It's the best.

714
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,329
Be smart.
Keep it as it is.

715
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,314
I'm in!

716
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:41,519
Your turn.

717
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,536
Here.

718
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,191
Oh, come on.

719
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,985
I'm not going to be the only one in here,
in my underwear.

720
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,004
You're uncomfortable.

721
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,507
I am uncomfortable.

722
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,678
You don't hold back much, do you?

723
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,390
We're here in our underwear. I think
it's a late for that, no?

724
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,745
Do you remember that first night?

725
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,080
Do you ever think about it?

726
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,224
Of course I do.

727
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:22,130
I did not want to go home,
and you put me in a taxi.

728
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:25,066
And do you remember that night -

729
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:27,861
- when we met the photographer you were interviewing?

730
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,013
And he was drunk!
He was drunk.

731
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,726
And you danced on that top of yours with no back.

732
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,272
Come.

733
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,297
Let's go.

734
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:46,107
So, have you ever been cheated on?

735
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,003
No.

736
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,076
Well, I have.

737
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,332
The worst part with her I found out.

738
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:08,380
We shared a photo account -

739
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,466
- and I went on the website to order
some pictures -

740
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,303
- and I saw the album she decided to
share with him.

741
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,641
I think they were together for the weekend,
or something.

742
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:23,520
I could have done without the visuals.

743
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,191
There was this one, they were laughing so much...

744
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,779
What happened?

745
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:37,325
We fucked like animals for about a month.

746
01:06:38,535 --> 01:06:40,584
I was angry...

747
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:44,833
Maybe because I thought I had to be.

748
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,877
Or maybe because I was sad.

749
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:52,841
But he still wanted to be with me,
I still wanted to be with him.

750
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,567
So what happened?

751
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,429
We stayed together -

752
01:06:59,617 --> 01:07:01,825
- had the best year of our relationship.

753
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,662
And then?

754
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,334
He died.

755
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,771
I'm sorry.

756
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,510
Do you want anything to drink?
No, I'm fine.

757
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,951
Do you think you still would have been with him?

758
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,167
Yeah, definitely.

759
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:16,132
And I think I'd still be here, attracted to you.

760
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,248
You'd never guess what I was upset about
this morning.

761
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,460
Michael had a work think last night
that we went to -

762
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,881
- and I was accusing him of being
attracted to this woman he's working with.

763
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,843
Was he?
I think so.

764
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,513
You think there's something going on?

765
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,332
It could be.

766
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:08,059
I think he'd want that to be.

767
01:09:10,361 --> 01:09:12,560
He's in Philadelphia with her right now.

768
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,858
Are you worried?

769
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,386
I think I make too big a deal out of it.

770
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,745
Why?

771
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,783
It's 2:00 in the morning and
I'm here with you.

772
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:32,011
So when you think you could get up and have
absolutely no idea what a day will go?

773
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,877
Eighty...

774
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,047
Ninery, a thousand years back
without incident -

775
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,799
- and then all of a sudden...

776
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,677
Hello!
Hello!

777
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,432
What if I hadn't come up for coffee
this morning?

778
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,351
I would have called.

779
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,146
If my number changed?

780
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,649
I would have come upstairs.

781
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:59,235
What about Michael?

782
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,496
Why did you stop e-mailing me?

783
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,338
Because it wasn't enough...

784
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:26,429
Do you know how often I have to make a choice,
not to write.

785
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,349
"Hello, Alex. How are you?".

786
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,559
"Where are you? What are you doing?".

787
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,356
"Do you want to meet me?
Whatever".

788
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,234
"This Friday for dinner?"

789
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,111
"Just to catch up".

790
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,619
You really touch me whenever you feel like,
don't you?

791
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,579
No, I don't.

792
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:57,126
I touch you a fraction of how
often I'd like to.

793
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,063
Why?

794
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,969
Because I like you.

795
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,990
I can't.

796
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,915
I can't do anymore,
and look him in the eye.

797
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,515
You just told me he's away with a woman
you got upset about.

798
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,355
Michael isn't doing anything...

799
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,957
I never told him about us.

800
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,507
Even when -

801
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:24,047
- I found the need to confess something.

802
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,548
Which is when?

803
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,010
When I'm drunk, or happy -

804
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,847
- or after a fight, or in the middle of one -

805
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:35,641
- when things slip out, this never does.

806
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,019
Why?
Would he be angry?

807
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,940
He'd have no right to be.

808
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:45,818
I gave you up.

809
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,875
So what's Helen like?

810
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,394
We have another couple of hours -

811
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,355
- I don't want to spend them talking
about Helen.

812
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,484
Come...

813
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,447
Jo...

814
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,452
Come here...

815
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,748
Jo...

816
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,090
What time is it?
Six thirty.

817
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,994
Laura...

818
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:08,873
Michael, I don't need us to talk about it.

819
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,669
Last night...
Michael, please.

820
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,213
Just don't.

821
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,387
I didn't think that would happen.

822
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,933
Not even a second time?

823
01:18:39,726 --> 01:18:42,438
Well there's so much going on
right now, isn't it?

824
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,184
What I wouldn't give to have tired
of you.

825
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,912
Let me drop you off.
No, I'd rather walk.

826
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,997
Are you sure?
Yes, it would be good for her.

827
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:06,373
It would be good for me.

828
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,746
Let's not do this in a big way, ok?
Please.

829
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,005
See ya!

830
01:20:48,607 --> 01:20:50,400
<i>It's possible I overreacted.</i>

831
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:51,794
<i>I know that. I know you.</i>

832
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:53,181
<i>And I love you.
Jo.</i>

833
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,432
Hey Andy, it's me.

834
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,311
I need you to cover for me.

835
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:21,727
Hey.
Hey.

836
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,146
Are you ready?
Yeah. Where's Michael?

837
01:22:24,911 --> 01:22:26,411
He had to go back to New York.

838
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:29,012
Is everything ok?

839
01:22:29,085 --> 01:22:31,670
Yeah, he left me a voicemail.

840
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:33,822
I guess, Stuart needed him
to go back.

841
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:36,825
Okay...

842
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,452
I'll see you out front.

843
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,164
Joey...

844
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,196
What are you doing back?

845
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,990
What's Lucy doing here?

846
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,285
We got locked out of Andy's.

847
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,913
Who?
Me and Lucy.

848
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:48,457
When?

849
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:55,089
Last night, when I went out to walk her.

850
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,299
You've been crying, Jo?

851
01:24:58,384 --> 01:24:59,760
A bit.

852
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,389
What are you doing back?

853
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,560
We finished up early.

854
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,272
Thought the presentation was today?

855
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,317
No, we finished up early.

856
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,742
I'm sorry about our fight.

857
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:28,664
Yeah, so am I.

858
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,836
Let's not talk about it, okay?

859
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:39,675
Let's have a great lunch, let's walk.

860
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,052
Let's make a day of it.

861
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,514
Okay.

862
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,560
Does she want to go out?

863
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,478
Probably.

864
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,731
I'll take her.
Come on.

865
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,745
Are you okay?
Yeah.

866
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,759
I love you.

867
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
