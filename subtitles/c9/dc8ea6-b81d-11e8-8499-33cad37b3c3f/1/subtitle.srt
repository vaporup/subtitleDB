That's not exactly what
I meant by "starting over. "

What about Emily?

89
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:45,561
This is a traumatic time for her.

90
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,325
I think it's important she stays
here and works through this.

91
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,865
No, here, she's
flooded with memories.

92
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,936
I need to expose her

new things to do...

94
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,370
She'd be losing another person
she depends on.

It's only an hour away.

96

And... you're always welcome
to come and see her.

97
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:08,246
And right now, I need to do
what's right for Emily.

98

a full-time dad.

And whenever I was feeling sad,

103
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:44,376
I would open the lid,

This is Mr. Haskins.

134
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,562
He found us the house.

135
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,226
Well, hello there, Emily.

136
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:48,793
Think your dad did a good job
picking the house?

137
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,008
She's still deciding.

Woodland Estates

142
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,485
a summer community.

00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:05,111
May be a little quiet

Hope that's not a problem.

145
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,688

You ever spent

149
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,457
Not much.

150
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,464
I used to camp
when I was little,

151
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,727
but I was always scared
of the woods.

152

<i>(chuckles)</i>

153
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,530
Nothing to be scared of

00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,703
Biggest house on the lake.

156
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,040
Sheriff, if you'd like
to do the honors;

157

let Dr. Callaway
into his new home.

158
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,439
Figure out which key...

159
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,781
Did you see where
my daughter went?

160
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,320

183
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:38,636
No.

186
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:48,415
Let's see, where
could she be hiding?

187
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:51,112
Could she be
hiding in the... closet!

190
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,528
Okay...

191
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,800
since it's the first night
in a new house,

192
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:15,275
I thought it would be a good
time to start a new diary.

193
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,811
Each day you
can write down

194
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:18,471
your feelings
and thoughts,

195
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,913
and then, one day,
you can look back

196
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:21,347
and see
how much they've changed.

197
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:22,884
Hmm?

198
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,719
I love you more than anything
else in the world, sweetheart.

199
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,556
You know that.

200
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,859
That's what Mommy said.

201
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,661
Hmm?

202
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:41,635

203
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,900
Sweetheart,
she meant what she said.

204
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,140
And so do I.

205
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,377
You want me to put this

206
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,384
over here?

207
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:59,717
Okay.

208
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:02,087

We have some errands to do.

Uh, here.

anyone else lived up here.

235

Well, it does get pretty quiet
in the off season.

236
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:02,232
Oh, this is my
daughter, Emily.

237
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,864
Emily, say hello to Laura.

238
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,032
She's our neighbor.

239
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,609
Isn't she adorable?

240
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,906
You going to say hi?

241
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,710
Well, she gets a little shy

243
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,315

could you tell me then?

00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:04,475
Is he... here right now?

327

It's not unusual

332
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,191
for a traumatized child
to create imaginary friends.

she'd confide in me

608
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,301
He said he had a...
awkward moment

yesterday
with you and Emily.

610
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:33,476
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

611
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:35,607
He's harmless, really.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

612

That's fine.

613

a girl...

Emily reminds us of her.

I see.

617
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,328
He was just... reaching out. Hmm?

618

Honey, would you go upstairs

632
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,106

into something else, please?

You know why.

I think you look
really beautiful.

Yes, he did.

how she died?

Honey, I don't think Elizabeth
really wants to hear

644

how that happened,
okay?

645
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,812
She killed herself

If you're going to behave
this way, go to your room.

Honey, why would Charlie

Is it because of Elizabeth?

Charlie needs to understand
something, honey.

Elizabeth is not trying
to take Mommy's place.

719

Does he understand that?

720
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,322
Honey, I can't help you

Why doesn't he like Elizabeth?

And?

00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:31,514
He doesn't want you to be happy.

Charlie doesn't exist.

732
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,825
You shouldn't say that.

Why not?

734
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:58,234
You're going to make him mad.

00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:02,141
I'll get him mad.

737
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,372
Let him come out
and yell at me. Good.

738
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:06,415
I want to see him.
Where is he?

739
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:09,076
You want to see him?

Who's that supposed to be?

741
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:33,638
Charlie and Mommy.

742
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:35,176
She would have liked him.

743

No, trust me, honey.

Mommy wouldn't like Charlie.

745

That's not what he says.

Talk to me.
What does he say?

751

He says he would
have satisfied her.

Who told you to say that?

753
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,110
Charlie did.

Charlie did!

784
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:21,206

What kind of games?

786
00:54:22,986 --> 00:54:25,216
Hide and seek.

787
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,050
That's our favorite.

788
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:30,786

a lot of fun.

00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:40,562
Bunch of things.

793
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,037
Sometimes he even
talks about you.

794
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,005
Really.

795
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:50,739
And what does he say?

796
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:56,018
You can tell me.

797
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,418
He's afraid you're
going to get in the way.

798
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:02,389

In the way of what?

799

Our game.

800
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:07,259
What game is that?

801
00:55:07,363 --> 00:55:10,264
Upsetting Daddy.

802
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:17,166
Isn't she pretty?

804
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:24,546
At least for a little while,
so she can be evaluated.

805
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:28,777
I'm just worried bringing her back
will make her worse.

806
00:55:28,885 --> 00:55:29,909
She's not well.

807
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:31,281
I know that.

808
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:33,116
And she's not your patient.

809
00:55:33,223 --> 00:55:36,192
I know that, too.

810
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,554
She thinks it's a game.

811
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,685
She's using Charlie
to get to you.

812
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:40,785
I know things

813
00:55:40,897 --> 00:55:42,626
haven't gone
as well as we hoped, but...

814
00:55:42,732 --> 00:55:45,030
do you really think
bringing her back to New York

815
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:47,103
is going to make
that much of a difference?

816
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:48,795
It's worth a try.

817
00:55:52,142 --> 00:55:53,234
All right, look.

818
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,903
I'll give it two more weeks,

819
00:55:56,012 --> 00:55:57,775

I'll bring her back.

she might have crashed

at least stopped by.

964
01:08:56,525 --> 01:08:58,516
Well, maybe she
forgot something,
