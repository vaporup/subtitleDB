1
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,605
Is today the day?

2
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,916
I don't know.

3
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,545
Maybe.

4
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,638
What's your gut tell you?

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,217
That I'm nauseous.

6
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,583
How about less literally?

7
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,179
I'm afraid of deciding.

8
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,952
I'm not afraid
of either scenario,

9
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,257
but I just want this
to be something we're doing,

10
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,228
not something we're not doing.

11
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,527
What does "this" mean?

12
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,728
"This" meaning
whatever we decide.

13
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,239
Well, "this" sounded like
some kind of decision.

14
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,241
No.

15
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,004
It wasn't.

16
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,347
What are we gonna do today?

17
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:05,550
Brooklyn or Manhattan?

18
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,821
That's not
what we were talking about.

19
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,726
I know what we're
talking about.

20
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,195
What do you want to do?

21
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,093
Hey.

22
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,963
What?

23
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,003
Why not?

24
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,037
We can't do that.

25
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,141
Why not?

26
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,590
Hey.
Hey.

27
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,204
Hi.
Hello.

28
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,777
So I thought it would be a
good idea to get my mom flowers,

29
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,513
so we'll stop at a florist
on the way.

30
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,316
She'll like that.
Yes, she will.

31
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,390
Can I take credit?

32
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,617
It was my plan.

33
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,825
Dim sum.
Dim sum.

34
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,595
Is it cool we're not seeing
your family for the barbecue?

35
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,736
Yeah. It's great.
I needed the excuse.

36
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,500
I can't be around them today.

37
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,507
And I'm the perfect excuse.

38
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,076
No, I wasn't trying
to make you--

39
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,304
No, it's all right,

40
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,936
'cause your mom adores me
so much anyway.

41
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,446
Hold on, there's a seat belt
in my ass.

42
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,681
What is this?
Did you get a new phone?

43
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,910
No.

44
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,385
My God, this is, like,
the 2010 version.

45
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,319
Someone is hating life
right now.

46
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,651
Let's just give it
to the cabbie.

47
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,453
No, no, wait,
don't give it to him.

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,458
Don't give it to him.
Come on, let it.

49
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,756
No, no, no.
Why?

50
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,125
He won't give it back;
he'll just sell it.

51
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,131
Don't you remember
I lost my phone just, like,

52
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,791
a month ago in a cab,
and I never got it back.

53
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,698
If you give it to
the cab company then they'll--

54
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:11,895
they'll call the people that--

55
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,268
No, they won't.
They won't.

56
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,365
So what are you, like,
a Canadian Mountie?

57
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,443
Gonna save the phone?

58
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,443
Why you got to make it
about Canada?

59
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,172
I'm gonna get it back
to whosever this is.

60
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,279
Hi, my name
is Bobby Thompson.

61
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,148
I just found this phone
in the back of a cab,

62
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,517
and I'm trying to get it back
to its rightful owner.

63
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,886
My number is 917-817--

64
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,720
Why are you giving them
your number?

65
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,953
What?

66
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,225
Sorry. My number
is 917-817-65--

67
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,726
And, we'll try to figure this out.

68
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,100
Okay, thanks.

69
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,105
What?

70
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,265
Why would you be calling,
leaving your name and number

71
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,672
when the person
who lost this phone

72
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,369
is just gonna call
their phone number

73
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,036
and expect somebody
to answer it?

74
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,614
You don't have to go through
their roster

75
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,512
of friends and family.

76
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,279
Just don't--

77
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,550
Hi, my name
is Bobby Thompson.

78
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,387
Don't leave your name.

79
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,891
Why not?
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

80
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,265
It's yours.
It's not in my purse.

81
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,672
Probably your mom.
Don't answer it.

82
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,374
Yeah, it's your mom.

83
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,717
Hi, Sylvia.
Keep the change.

84
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,754
Hey, thank you.

85
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,152
Thanks for not taking
The Bowery.

86
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,185
Hey, I got a call
on this thing.

87
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,195
Bobby, careful.

88
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,229
Hello?

89
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,026
It's Perez, you assfuck.

90
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,260
We had a deal for that phone,
didn't we, Dmitri?

91
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,730
I think you got the wrong guy.
I've had it with this bullshit.

92
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,738
I just picked up this phone.

93
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,807
Who was it?
Was it the guy?

94
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,875
I don't know.

95
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,634
I'm going inside.

96
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,646
Go ahead, go.

97
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,679
Hello?

98
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,079
I'm so glad
that you picked up.

99
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,616
I think you found my phone.

100
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,151
My name is Dmitri.

101
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,450
Yeah, I found your phone
in the back of a cab.

102
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,021
Hi.
2 please.

103
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,458
Be about 10 minutes.

104
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,494
Man, I'm glad you called.

105
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,497
I've been calling around.

106
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,498
I left a few messages.

107
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,588
What are you talking about?

108
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,099
Who did you call?
Who did you call?

109
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,862
I don't know,
but some guy just called back.

110
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,130
He said his name was Perez.

111
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,170
Perez?

112
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,263
Okay, look, I need to come
get phone right now.

113
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,966
Don't call anyone else.

114
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,202
Where you are?
What is address?

115
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,777
The address?
Address!

116
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,972
It's...
it's 40 East Broadway.

117
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,276
Okay, I'm getting in the taxi
right now.

118
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,214
I'm wearing a red jacket,
okay?

119
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,218
Red jacket.
Red jacket, okay?

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,220
How will I know who you are?

121
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,516
I... I'm wearing
a yellow T-shirt.

122
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,025
Hey... how come your mom
thought we might not be coming?

123
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,530
When did you talk to my mom?

124
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,624
The phone just now.

125
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,032
I told you not to answer
that call.

126
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,467
You didn't know
it was your mother.

127
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,970
If I ask you
not to answer my phone,

128
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,004
you shouldn't answer it.

129
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,472
You can't just not answer
the phone.

130
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,507
That is not my rule.

131
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,042
Wasn't that the turn?
Shit.

132
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,078
You got me flustered!

133
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,942
Sorry.

134
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,891
My God.

135
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,985
Is that a stray?

136
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,461
She's gonna get hit like that.

137
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,063
Do you see anyone
she belongs to?

138
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,638
She came from over there.

139
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,719
Come here.
Come here.

140
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,117
Careful.

141
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,713
Come here, girl.

142
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,520
She's nice.

143
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,696
She's gentle.

144
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,729
Where's she coming from?

145
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,264
I don't know.

146
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,298
Where are you going?

147
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,925
She just licked my hand.

148
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,094
Where are you going, doggie?

149
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,035
Here, she's got a tag.

150
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,436
"Tiger."

151
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,901
Maybe we shouldn't go
to Fitz's party.

152
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,638
No?

153
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,941
I'm gonna want a margarita.

154
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,879
I thought you could have one
now and then.

155
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,315
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe not.

156
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,457
You're kidding.

157
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,026
I'll be right back.

158
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,389
And I'll wait in line.

159
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,231
Hello?
Hello, my name is Dmitri.

160
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,735
I think you found my phone.

161
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,806
I must have left it
in the taxi this morning.

162
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:41,806
Okay.

163
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,839
Where are you?

164
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,842
I'd like to come get it.

165
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,003
You know, someone else
named Dmitri just called

166
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,080
and said it was his phone.

167
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,374
I don't know
who you talked to,

168
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,450
but that's my phone,
and I need to get it back.

169
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,642
Can you bring it to me?
No.

170
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,741
What do you want?
I'll pay you.

171
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,252
You hear me?
Where are you?

172
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,117
No, man, I'm here
at a restaurant in Chinatown

173
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,155
with my girlfriend.

174
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,781
Where are you exactly?

175
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,883
The address here
is 40 East Broadway.

176
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,926
You can come down here

177
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,519
and work it out with
the other guy if you want to.

178
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,291
What? Don't give that phone
to anyone else.

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,696
What's going on?

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,427
It belongs to me;
it's my phone.

181
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,366
I don't know who you talked to,
but it's mine.

182
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,801
Look, I don't know
what the deal is.

183
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:13,872
You can work it out with him.

184
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,565
Actually, he's already here.

185
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,575
What?

186
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,802
That's my phone,
do you hear me?

187
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,871
Was that gunfire?

188
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,414
What just happened?

189
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,416
Can you hear me?

190
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,449
Just get out of there.

191
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,745
You're in danger,
do you hear me?

192
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,251
Take the phone
and get out of there.

193
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,812
You're in danger.

194
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:32,948
Come on!

195
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,704
Do you think he followed us?

196
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,607
No.

197
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,771
It's okay.

198
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,405
He didn't follow us.

199
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,569
It's okay.

200
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,570
You okay?

201
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,161
Bobby, is that man gonna die?

202
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,239
Yeah, he's dead.

203
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,365
It's okay.

204
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,413
It's okay, all right?

205
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,504
Listen.
Listen, look at me.

206
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,846
Look at me, okay?

207
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,749
We're safe here, okay?

208
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,756
We're safe here.

209
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,849
We're safe here.

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,157
We're safe, okay?

211
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,255
Just breathe.

212
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,874
Now, we should go and ask
where there's a police station.

213
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,071
There's one in Union Square.

214
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,148
The nearest is in Union Square.

215
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,910
There's one--
okay, we'll go there.

216
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,212
Okay.
Okay.

217
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,288
Don't worry about anything,
okay?

218
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,349
There is a downtown
local train now at Union Square.

219
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,711
Come on, pooch.

220
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,722
Look at this.

221
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,451
You okay? Okay?

222
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,555
We'll go to the police;
we'll tell them what happened.

223
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,658
All right?

224
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,641
I love you.

225
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,074
If this gets weird,
you just tell me.

226
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,270
It's fine.

227
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,679
Trust you and let's see,
we could do this.

228
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,513
Hello.

229
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,551
What took you so long?

230
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,120
Where have you been?

231
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,482
Look what we found.

232
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,718
Hey, Bobby.

233
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,815
Hi, Felix, how are you?

234
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:22,827
How are you doing?

235
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:23,828
Good to see you.

236
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,987
Happy July 4th, I guess?

237
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,155
Yeah, happy July 4th.

238
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,426
Hi, papa.

239
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,626
You look relaxed.

240
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,793
Hey, why shouldn't I be?

241
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,768
Why shouldn't you be?

242
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,772
I know.

243
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,340
He's sleeping.

244
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,739
Tip-toe.

245
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,936
Hi, mami.

246
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,240
I miss you.

247
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,440
Look at how thin you are.

248
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,641
I know, you always say that.

249
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,842
Hi, Sylvia.

250
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,851
Hi.

251
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,852
Hi, Bobby.

252
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:48,920
Those are for me?
For you.

253
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,921
Thank you.

254
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:50,954
My pleasure.

255
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,990
They're beautiful.

256
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,059
That was your idea?

257
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,183
Yeah.

258
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,229
I knew it.

259
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,262
Very nice, thank you.

260
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
I'll put them in a vase.

261
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,399
Who is she?

262
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,432
This is--

263
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,058
We just... just picked her up.

264
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,761
She was trying to cross
Jamaica Boulevard.

265
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,065
We were afraid
she might get hit,

266
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,332
so we picked her up.

267
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,567
But, you know,
is she vaccinated or something?

268
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,371
I mean, it can be a danger, no,
for the children?

269
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,843
Mom, I wouldn't have brought
her here

270
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,004
if I thought she was a danger.

271
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,672
I don't know.
If you want, you know--

272
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,147
Look at all your meat.

273
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,512
Look at all of it.

274
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,916
Well, I-I have your salmon
and your salmon.

275
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,383
Thank you.

276
00:15:23,889 --> 00:16:01,015
Hello, hello!
Emily!

277
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,456
I thought I heard
a Broadway star in the house.

278
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,926
Hi, Emily.
How are you?

279
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,019
Good. How are you?
Good to see you.

280
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,064
You look great.

281
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,098
Thank you, so do you.

282
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,394
Hello, Mr. Bobby.
How are you?

283
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,469
I'm good. How are you?

284
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,797
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

285
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:39,804
Who do we have here?

286
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,894
This is our new friend.

287
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:41,906
Yeah?
Yeah.

288
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,974
You got a dog.

289
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,406
Yeah, they found it
in the street.

290
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,375
You know, actually,
maybe it would be a good idea

291
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,572
if you run upstairs and use
the computer in Hector's room

292
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,808
and make some "dog found" signs.

293
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,816
Yeah, good idea.

294
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,817
"Dog found" signs.

295
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:55,751
The computer is broken,

296
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,754
but perhaps you might fix it?

297
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,551
Yeah, I'll take a look at it.

298
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,558
Thank you.

299
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,559
Okay, sure, of course.

300
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,553
By the way,
how is your father?

301
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,631
My father?
He's well.

302
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,790
Yeah?
Thank you.

303
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,197
Yeah, he's living
with his brother in Calgary.

304
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,563
Calgary.

305
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,727
I'd like to see a picture.

306
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,270
Perhaps,
next time you're coming,

307
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,272
you can bring one?

308
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,932
Okay, I'll try to--

309
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,509
I'll--I'll find a picture.

310
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,510
Thank you.
Okay.

311
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,579
How nice, Calgary.

312
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,276
Mami, why would you ask him
for a picture of his father?

313
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,751
Well, I'd like to see
a picture of his father.

314
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,946
Do you--do you know him?

315
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,522
Why is Uncle Diego
all alone out there?

316
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,523
Sorry?

317
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,023
I'm going outside, Mom.

318
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,288
Hey, Katalina.

319
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,058
Tio.
Hey.

320
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,359
Tio.

321
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,196
Katalina.

322
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,202
Como estas?

323
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,061
So how are you?

324
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,967
I'm okay.

325
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,004
Yeah?

326
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,835
Yeah.

327
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,873
How are you?

328
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,035
I'm doing okay.

329
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,045
Yeah?
I'm fine.

330
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,047
You're not so bad?

331
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,081
How's your dancing?

332
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,118
It's so good.
Yeah?

333
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,550
Yeah, I'm in a show.

334
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,554
In a show?

335
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,179
Yeah, on Broadway.

336
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,951
On Broadway?
Yeah.

337
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,788
Yeah.

338
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,952
Can I come and see it?

339
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,129
You already came to see me.

340
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,031
You've seen it.

341
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,601
I'm going crazy.

342
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,106
Yeah, I came to see you.

343
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,107
Get her! Get her!

344
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,113
Come back, Tiger! Come on!

345
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,048
It's a dog.

346
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,846
What is that dog doing?

347
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,615
Bobby and I found her
crossing the street.

348
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,816
It's him.

349
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,850
Hello?

350
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,386
Tell me what just happened.
Talk to me.

351
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,853
I just watched a guy get shot
is what happened.

352
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,888
I need to get that phone.

353
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,514
It belongs to me,
and I need to get it back.

354
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,956
I'm taking the phone
to the police.

355
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,118
Don't do that;
listen to me.

356
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,160
Tell me where you are.

357
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,627
I can be there quickly,
but don't...

358
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,129
I said we're taking it
to the police,

359
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,824
and if you want it,
you can get it from them.

360
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,594
I'm done with this.
What is with this phone?

361
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,465
We should have just given it
to the cab driver.

362
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,594
So this is my fault?

363
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,763
We're gonna do that right now?

364
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,238
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

365
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,775
Don't answer it.

366
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,810
Don't answer it.

367
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,107
I didn't.

368
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,348
That's your phone.

369
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,517
Fuck.
He has my number?

370
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,322
Bobby, please don't answer it.

371
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,896
Don't answer it.

372
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,989
I'm not asking you
for the phone, Bobby.

373
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,897
I'm telling you.

374
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,334
How'd you get this number?

375
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,927
You're not listening to me,
Bobby.

376
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,370
That phone belongs to me,

377
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,101
and I'm getting sick
and fucking tired

378
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,141
of asking you for it.

379
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,643
Get off.

380
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
We're gonna run, okay?

381
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,384
Go! Come on!

382
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,790
Come on!

383
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,091
Come on!

384
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,960
Shit.

385
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,061
Come on, you okay?

386
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,071
Wait.

387
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,077
Damn it!

388
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,146
Slide it again.

389
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,477
Come on!

390
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,359
It's him.

391
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,417
Watch out.

392
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,894
Excuse me!

393
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,557
Come on!

394
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,499
Fuck!

395
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,627
Okay, there.

396
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,295
Train on the other side.

397
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,380
Come on! Come on!

398
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,323
What the fuck just happened?
You okay?

399
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,731
How did he find us
in Union Square?

400
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,133
We were only there
for 2 minutes.

401
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,169
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

402
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,569
How did that happen?
I don't know.

403
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,640
He has my cell phone number.

404
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,106
That means he could
have my address.

405
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,141
He has your cell phone

406
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,211
because you left your name
and number on those phones

407
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,109
or the 2 answering machines
or whatever.

408
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,146
You're right.

409
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,977
And we should have just
given it to the cabbie.

410
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,107
Okay, yeah, we should have.

411
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,049
That could have happened,
but it didn't happen.

412
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,053
This happened, okay?

413
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,645
Let's deal in reality.

414
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,782
What's on this fuckin' thing?

415
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,322
What is all that?

416
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,334
Cyrillic.

417
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,335
What's that?

418
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,030
It's the Russian alphabet.

419
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,943
Man, look at all this.

420
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,106
This series of numbers,

421
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,978
this is how computers
talk to each other.

422
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,450
This is--this might be
why they want this.

423
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,789
Bobby, that's you.

424
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,662
My God.

425
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,201
$500,000?

426
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,637
What's on this phone, Bobby?

427
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,444
We need to go to the police.

428
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:34,984
City Hall?

429
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,213
There's a police station there?

430
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,253
Yeah.

431
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,052
Okay, we're gonna turn
all our phones off, okay?

432
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,284
They must be tracking the thing.

433
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,658
Listen to me, okay?

434
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,668
All right?

435
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,674
That's more like it.

436
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,812
Hi.

437
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,910
Hi, baby girl.

438
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,560
So what are you gonna
tell the police?

439
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,726
I'm just gonna tell them
what happened.

440
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,428
We'll give them the phone.

441
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,199
Hopefully that'll be that.

442
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,434
How can a phone
be worth $500,000?

443
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,239
That's a good question.

444
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,710
I don't know.

445
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,583
Hey.

446
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,652
Here you go.

447
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,618
Let's just put this
through first.

448
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,766
Hi.

449
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,931
We just found this in the back
of a cab a couple hours ago.

450
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,941
Since then, 3 different
people have called us.

451
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:38,975
What do you need?

452
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,271
We've been followed,
we've been chased.

453
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,675
We think that
there's something--

454
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,611
We witnessed a murder.
You witnessed a murder?

455
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,647
Yes.

456
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,649
All right, listen, you're
gonna need to speak to--

457
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,582
Hey, you're gonna need to speak
to Sergeant Hill.

458
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,676
Now, he's not here right now,

459
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,779
so what you need to do is sit
down on these benches back here.

460
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,255
When he gets back in,

461
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,087
I'll send him down,
and he'll talk to you, okay?

462
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,387
We just saw someone
get killed.

463
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,395
And we think it has something
to do with this phone.

464
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,431
Yeah, yeah...
lady, I get it.

465
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,464
We saw it.
I get it.

466
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,863
You need to speak
to Sergeant Hill.

467
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,265
Now, when he comes back in,

468
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,961
I'm gonna have him come down
and talk to you.

469
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,629
Go sit down on the benches back
there, okay?

470
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,967
Okay, can we leave this
with you?

471
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,974
No.

472
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,269
But it's not ours.

473
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,037
Well, it's not mine either,
honey.

474
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,634
Take your phone
and sit down on the bench.

475
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,838
Don't call her honey, please.

476
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,073
Easy--

477
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,706
Take your phone, sit down,
relax.

478
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,909
Yeah, how long you think
it'll be?

479
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,111
When the sergeant comes in,
he'll be back and talk to you.

480
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,687
How long do you think
it'll be, please?

481
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,755
I don't know.
Thank you.

482
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,847
Very helpful.
Thanks.

483
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,486
Sorry.

484
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,531
It's okay.

485
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,897
Okay, now we put this here.

486
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,766
Ta-da!

487
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,771
Okay.

488
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,839
Hey, it's going.

489
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,034
I'm gonna do this side here.

490
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,043
Daddy woke up.

491
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,076
How you like that?

492
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,509
What are you doing,
little raccoon?

493
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,380
So, how is Bobby doing?

494
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,043
Bobby's doing good.

495
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,620
How's his job?

496
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,154
His job is fine.

497
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,690
How are you?

498
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,555
How are the both of you?

499
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,255
We're doing good, Mom.

500
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,126
Good.

501
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,123
Kate, how's the show going?

502
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,634
You said it might close?

503
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,226
Yeah, it's gonna close
in 3 months.

504
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,033
No, you're so good
in the show.

505
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,072
Thank you.

506
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,471
Are you bummed
that it's closing?

507
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,476
Are you okay?

508
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,509
What are you gonna do?

509
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,239
You know what you should do
is to call Peter.

510
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,247
Yeah?

511
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,440
Would you like me to call Peter?

512
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,449
I mean, he could help you.

513
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,450
Who's Peter?

514
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,984
Peter is this producer

515
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,576
that she's been trying
to set me up with.

516
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,088
She keeps saying that he's tall,
dark, and handsome, and he's...

517
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,090
Really?

518
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,180
Well, yes, he's handsome,

519
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,782
but I'm not trying
to set you up with.

520
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,089
I mean, I like Bobby.

521
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,164
Really, I do.

522
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,325
Sylvia, you're almost
out of olive oil.

523
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,666
Yeah, well,
I'll get some later.

524
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,829
Let's chop that...

525
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,871
Okay.

526
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:49,874
Quickly.
Yup.

527
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,169
I need it.
Yup, yup, yup.

528
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,948
Do you think we can use
these computers?

529
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,286
I don't know.

530
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,623
I'm gonna go ask.

531
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:15,933
Excuse me.

532
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:16,934
Hi.

533
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,435
Are these computers
for public use?

534
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,561
Yeah, go ahead.

535
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,696
Knock yourself out.

536
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,331
Thank you.

537
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,048
What are you doing?

538
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,245
Looking up this guy Perez.

539
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,388
The baseball player?

540
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,821
"Lottery deputy director George
Perez was charged with 3--"

541
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,399
Lottery deputy director?

542
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,628
"The indictment is certain
to be merely the first move

543
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,067
by a grand jury."

544
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,264
I mean, there could be a lot
of different George Perezes.

545
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,238
Do you think this is him?
I don't know.

546
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,242
It could be him.

547
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,275
It sounds like him.

548
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,674
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

549
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,576
"Whether Perez is under
investigation for arson

550
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,478
in the fire that destroyed
a lottery building."

551
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,846
Right? Doesn't that sound
like the guy?

552
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,920
A guy who'd pay half a million
dollars for a phone,

553
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,989
works for the lottery
commission, stealing money.

554
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,887
So, wait, you think
that's what's on the phone?

555
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,425
Whatever information
is on the phone

556
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,724
that's in my pocket right now
is probably being used to--

557
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,821
And you think it's this?

558
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,268
We have to get rid
of this fuckin' thing.

559
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,636
Bobby?

560
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,539
I mean, I don't know
if this is him.

561
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,576
Bobby?

562
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,646
There could be a lot
of different George Perezes.

563
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,907
What?

564
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,149
What?

565
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,152
Come on.

566
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,584
What?

567
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,952
What?

568
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,631
What?

569
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,528
What if--

570
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,074
What?

571
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,472
What if we sell the Treo?

572
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,581
$500,000 is a lot of money.

573
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,986
You're not kidding?

574
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,785
No.

575
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,883
What the fuck's Dmitri
gonna do to us

576
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,189
if we give it to Perez?

577
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,888
Dmitri is the guy
who has my number,

578
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,966
that probably has my address
and knows where I live,

579
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,332
that found us in Union Square,
sent somebody after us.

580
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,770
You--

581
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,863
No.

582
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,358
You could only sell it
to Dmitri.

583
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,503
But he hasn't asked to buy it.

584
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,905
He would.

585
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,068
He definitely would.

586
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,009
But how would we contact him?

587
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,412
You'd have to turn on the phone,
and then they could track us.

588
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,586
Yeah, so you'd have to
talk to him.

589
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,780
You could talk to him
through e-mail.

590
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,981
You set up an e-mail account.

591
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,489
You get him the new address.

592
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,583
But then you'd have to call
him to give him the e-mail,

593
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,718
and he could still
track us.

594
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,524
That's true, we would have to
turn on the phone

595
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,562
for, like, a second.

596
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,791
Turn it on,
get him the address,

597
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:35,831
and turn it right back off.

598
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,836
So how would they
not track us?

599
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,530
Well, you could do it
while we were moving.

600
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,267
You know, we get on a bus,
send him a text,

601
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,307
turn it on, turn it off.

602
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,209
We take it one step at a time.

603
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,983
We can come back here
whenever we want to.

604
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,354
Okay.

605
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,983
$500,000...

606
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,289
Is a lot of money.
Yeah.

607
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,532
Over here.

608
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,542
One more.

609
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,702
How's it going?

610
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,212
That's so cute.

611
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,976
This one...

612
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,551
or this one?

613
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:28,552
That one.

614
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,553
That one?

615
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,919
Okay, that's it.

616
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,651
Sweet dog.

617
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,159
Yes, you are.

618
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,457
Who do you belong to?

619
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,732
Do I remind you of my mother?

620
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,900
Is that a trick question?

621
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,533
What, you think I-I--
you--I do?

622
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,805
I don't know,
I don't know how to answer that.

623
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,177
I was raised by a single dad.

624
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,310
'Cause, you know, she just...

625
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,352
grilled me down there.

626
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,682
It was so intrusive,

627
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,451
and it made me not want
to be here, so, that's--

628
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,490
What did she ask?

629
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,426
She's asking a lot
about your job, and--

630
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,895
and then she was asking me,
am I happy?

631
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,488
I think she asked me, like,
if I was happy,

632
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,828
if you and I were happy,

633
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,927
and it made me so uncomfortable,
considering what's going on.

634
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,699
Well, she's your mother.

635
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,933
She should want to know
if you're happy, right?

636
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,644
I mean, I don't know.

637
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,182
Look at her.

638
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,046
This goes here.

639
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,647
She's so cute.

640
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,487
It's a good flyer, right?

641
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,035
Hi, I'd like to use
the internet, please.

642
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,613
I need your credit card
for a deposit.

643
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,020
Here you go.

644
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,751
And can I have
some of those crackers?

645
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,064
This'll just take a minute.

646
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,070
Then we'll find a bus.

647
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,934
Don't use your real name.

648
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,132
Yeah.

649
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,080
What's your password?

650
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,152
You gonna tell me what it is?

651
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,721
It's "I love Treos."

652
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,219
Now...

653
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,522
we have an e-mail address.

654
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,091
Get it, come on!

655
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,794
Tiger! Tiger!

656
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,476
You ready?

657
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:07,566
All right.

658
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:12,081
"We have an offer
for the phone.

659
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,548
$500,000."

660
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,448
Wait, 5.

661
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,453
Yeah.

662
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,886
$500,000.
Yeah.

663
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,890
"Will you match? "

664
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:20,923
Yeah.

665
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:26,691
"Contact us via e-mail
at anonymous123@gmail.com."

666
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,992
Okay, is that it?

667
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,031
Yes.

668
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,964
Okay, send.

669
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,333
Okay, turning it off.

670
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,367
Put it away.

671
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,566
It's off.

672
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,884
Bobby, what are we gonna do
if he actually says yes?

673
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,289
Well, I mean, I guess we'll
meet him somewhere, and he'll--

674
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,329
What do you mean you guess
we'll meet him somewhere?

675
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,422
I don't know, I mean,
we didn't talk about it.

676
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,296
Fuck, Bobby.
This isn't all me.

677
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,303
This isn't--

678
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,665
Okay, so, please,
a small bottle, nothing fancy.

679
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,708
Okay.

680
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,277
Just Bertolli
or something like that.

681
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,073
May I buy the olive oil,
please?

682
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,340
No, thanks.

683
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,472
It's--it's on me.

684
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,982
It would really be
my pleasure.

685
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,346
No, no, I insist.

686
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,510
I can't. I can't. I can't.

687
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,383
Mom, let him buy
the olive oil.

688
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,583
No, it's my bottle
of olive oil, okay?

689
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,659
That's okay, thank you.

690
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,817
Thank you. Thank you.

691
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,355
I tried.

692
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,399
Buenos dias.

693
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,435
Hey, Diego.

694
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,469
How are you?

695
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,129
Hi.
Good to see you.

696
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,502
It's Bobby.

697
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,700
Hi, Bobby.

698
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,539
Hi.

699
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,340
Sylvia, can you make me
some breakfast?

700
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,347
That okay?

701
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,380
It's lunchtime.

702
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,416
It's okay,
he doesn't remember you.

703
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,383
It's okay,
he barely remembers me.

704
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,714
Okay.

705
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,413
Katie!

706
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,455
In here.

707
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,683
Where's that mutt you found?

708
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,783
Here she is.

709
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,522
Let's see if this works.

710
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,619
There we go.

711
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,164
Bobby can keep his belt.

712
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,198
Nicely done.

713
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,232
Thank you.
Yeah.

714
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,494
All right, take her outside

715
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,627
before she goes all over
the kitchen floor, all right?

716
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,433
Mom, I'm gonna check on
the kids, okay?

717
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,440
Wash your hands.

718
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,668
We're leaving too.

719
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,708
Don't take too long.

720
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,277
We're just gonna put up
the signs.

721
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,311
See you.
See you.

722
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,881
Don't be too late.

723
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:25,914
See you later.

724
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,952
Have fun.

725
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,782
Hey, tio Dio, you want to play?

726
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,981
No, no, I'm waiting
for something to eat.

727
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,189
Which way should we go?

728
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,028
Let's go this way.

729
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,964
Sit.

730
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,002
Good dog.

731
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,332
My God!
Did you see that?

732
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,340
Bye, papi.

733
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,275
We'll be back soon.
All right, see you later.

734
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,879
I can't believe
what idiots we are.

735
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,977
How could we not
think it through?

736
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,886
Okay, let's just say
that he agrees.

737
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,189
He says, "Okay, I'll pay."

738
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,093
He's gonna want to meet us
face-to-face.

739
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,529
He's not just gonna give us
any money

740
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,396
without getting the phone
right away.

741
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,298
But you can't trust a guy
like that.

742
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,731
If we meet him face-to-face,

743
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,331
you don't know
what he's gonna do.

744
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,535
He could kill us.

745
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,532
It's kind of ironic,
plotting criminal activity

746
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,100
with all these guards
and cameras and security around.

747
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,472
That would do it,
though, right?

748
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,848
Guards and cameras would do it.

749
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,614
If we were somewhere
with a bunch of security,

750
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,779
what could he do?

751
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,187
If we were standing right there,
he couldn't do anything.

752
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,920
What, at the UN?

753
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,290
We can't do it there.

754
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,330
Okay, well, we find somewhere.
Like an airport.

755
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,363
Or even a bank.

756
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,397
Right?

757
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,230
We say, "Meet us at this bank
at this time.

758
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,826
We bring the phone;
you bring us money."

759
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,666
Yeah, we're safe
when we're inside the bank,

760
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,570
but what happens when we leave?

761
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,040
We have the money;
he has the phone.

762
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,075
He could just--

763
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,667
You're right,
he could just follow us.

764
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,337
He could have a gun.

765
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,211
He will definitely have a gun.

766
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,821
It's hot.

767
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,949
She must be hotter
than we are.

768
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,587
Hey, not as hot as you.

769
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,566
I don't feel very hot.

770
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,635
Why not?

771
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,196
That's my ringer.

772
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,604
Yeah, sorry,
I still have it in my pocket.

773
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,301
It's your mom.

774
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,208
Thank you, Bobby.

775
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,302
Hi, mami.

776
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,056
Okay, we'll be back soon.

777
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,215
Bye, mama.
Bye. Bye.

778
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,129
What if the money stays?

779
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,859
We leave it there.
It's a bank.

780
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,733
We can't open a checking
account with $500,000.

781
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,500
But we could open
a safety deposit box.

782
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,869
Leave it
in the safety deposit box?

783
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,101
Yeah, we could leave it there,

784
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,974
and then when we leave the bank,
we don't have anything.

785
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,708
There's nothing
he can take from us.

786
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:46,748
Makes sense, right?

787
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,547
Yeah, makes sense.

788
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,621
I think I know a good bank
to do it in.

789
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,101
You okay?

790
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,738
You didn't say anything
to anybody, did you?

791
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,009
I thought we're not
saying anything.

792
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,989
'Cause Emily, she kept staring
at my boobs and my stomach.

793
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,187
That's 'cause you got
nice boobs and a nice stomach.

794
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,162
That's not what I mean.

795
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,994
You're not showing.

796
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,032
Nobody can tell.

797
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,965
I can't tell.

798
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,273
I-I just feel like I'm lying
to everybody who loves me,

799
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,435
and it feels wrong.

800
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,778
I can see that.

801
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,851
I mean, it is kind of sneaky,
I guess, the way we're--

802
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,147
Are you calling me sneaky?
No, us.

803
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,690
We're--we're--

804
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,759
Even if we knew
what we were doing,

805
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,660
we might not, you know,
talk about it to other people.

806
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,101
I just think we should have come
to some sort of decision by now,

807
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,331
because the longer we wait,

808
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,906
it's just gonna get harder
and harder.

809
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,066
Yeah, I think we should
just talk some more,

810
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,666
and keep talking about it
forever,

811
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,838
and talk and talk,

812
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:28,510
and then we will have talked,
and that'll be really good.

813
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,887
Is that what's known
as a pregnant pause?

814
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,728
You're so funny.

815
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,530
Well, I write music,
not lyrics.

816
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,806
Katie?

817
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,632
How you doing?

818
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,679
Hi, Danny.

819
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,372
I'll get the oil.

820
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,483
How you doing?

821
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,517
Good, where you been?

822
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,587
I moved to Fort Greene.

823
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,678
Fort Greene, very nice.

824
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,397
Excuse me, can I have
an instant lotto millionaire?

825
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,730
I should ask you
about this dog.

826
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,395
We found her
at this intersection today.

827
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,699
She was crossing it by herself.

828
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,535
I mean, she seems to be
pretty well trained,

829
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,269
so she must belong to somebody.

830
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,005
Have you seen her around here?

831
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,004
No.

832
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,310
No, sorry.

833
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,850
Is this okay?
Yeah.

834
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,544
Hey, I'm Bobby.
Hey, Bobby, how you doing?

835
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,643
I'm Danny.
Nice to meet you.

836
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,159
This is it.

837
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,061
This is the one
I was telling you about.

838
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,293
Look, it says "safe deposit box"
right there.

839
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,165
It's good, 'cause it's glass
on all sides.

840
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,430
These doors are glass.

841
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,506
We can see anyone coming
from any direction.

842
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,711
There's a camera right there.

843
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,678
God, there's 3 back there.

844
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,147
There's another one.

845
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,718
I think this is gonna work.

846
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,988
Let's go check e-mail.

847
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,230
Where is everybody?

848
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,677
Well, he's out there.

849
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:44,415
Meet me all by break of day.

850
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,115
If we shadows have offended,

851
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,885
think but this
and all is mended,

852
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:53,657
that you have but slumbered here
while these visions did appear,

853
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:57,894
and this weak and idle theme,
no more yielding but a dream.

854
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,493
Gentles, do not reprehend.

855
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,698
If you pardon, we will mend.

856
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:08,141
And, as I am an honest Puck,
if we have unearned luck,

857
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,304
now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue,

858
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,609
we will make amends ere long.

859
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,082
Else the Puck a liar call...

860
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,518
And so good night unto you all.

861
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,113
Give me your hands,
if we be friends,

862
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,659
and Robin shall restore amends.

863
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,524
My God, hi!

864
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,794
My God!

865
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,962
How long have you been
standing in the corner?

866
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,040
See you downstairs, guys.

867
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,540
So guess what?

868
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,509
My drama teacher knows this
agent who was in the audience,

869
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,739
and he was there watching,

870
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,680
and he's, like, referring me
to his associate in L.A.,

871
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:50,242
so, like, so I'm gonna have
an agent when I go to L.A.

872
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,422
Anyway, this is my friend Beth.

873
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,456
Beth! Hi.

874
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,116
It's great to finally
meet you.

875
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,716
I've heard so much about you.

876
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,319
This is Bobby.
Bobby, Beth.

877
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,331
Great to meet you.

878
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,229
Are you excited for fireworks?

879
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,630
Yeah.
Very.

880
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,669
How was your trip out?

881
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,072
Hi.

882
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,643
Number 13.

883
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:14,768
Thanks.

884
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,740
Let's do this quickly, Bobby.

885
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,620
Do you remember the password?

886
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,815
Yeah.

887
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:59,950
Fuck.

888
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,422
Hey, we got an e-mail.

889
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,720
My God, Bobby.

890
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:04,759
What?

891
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:05,794
We have to get out of here.

892
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,921
The men in the SUV
are downstairs.

893
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,497
Is there another way
out of here?

894
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,934
Washroom, something?

895
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,265
Come on.

896
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:22,939
Can you break it?

897
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,911
We shouldn't.

898
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:29,452
They'll know where we are.

899
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,623
Okay, come on.

900
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,263
Hold this.

901
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,842
All right?

902
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,780
Okay, let's go.

903
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,480
How the fuck did they find us?

904
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,683
I don't know.

905
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,692
You can't trace
an e-mail account that fast.

906
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,625
It was probably the credit card.

907
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,560
Paid for the internet
with my credit card.

908
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,667
So, Bobby, you like it here
in New York?

909
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,799
Yeah.

910
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,035
Yeah, I like New York.

911
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,076
It's a nice town.

912
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,805
You think you'll stay here?

913
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,041
That's a good question.

914
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,812
What, do you have to get,
like, papers and things?

915
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:36,819
You do.

916
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,253
They call it a green card.

917
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,720
Hey, viejo,
here's some more.

918
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,051
Bozo, that's great.

919
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,090
All right, is this ready?

920
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,124
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,194
I was just gonna start that.

922
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,194
Bobby, how do you like
your salmon?

923
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,992
On the rare side, I guess.

924
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,532
You got it.
Thank you.

925
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,261
I'm gonna cut this up,
all right?

926
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,301
That's good.

927
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,099
You don't eat meat?

928
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,639
Nah, I've been...

929
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,140
cutting out the meat of late.

930
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,175
You're a fish guy.

931
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,608
A fish guy?

932
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:06,513
Yeah, one of those fishitarian
alien men.

933
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,709
Vegaquarian?

934
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,410
Did you have
a bad meat experience or...

935
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,510
It's funny you should
ask in this house.

936
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,850
It kind of started here.

937
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,585
Kate's got a-a thing with food
and--and her mom.

938
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:21,130
Which makes Bobby
give up the gift of meat.

939
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,789
Yeah.
Yeah.

940
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,367
Pretty much.
Just checking.

941
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,336
I mean, whatever makes it work.

942
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,564
Hey.
Hey.

943
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,605
How you doing?

944
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,674
I'm nauseous.

945
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,367
Can you go get the ginger pills
out of the car?

946
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,569
I thought so.

947
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,770
How'd I know?

948
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,280
Will you go first?

949
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,817
I'm scared.

950
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,944
I knew that you were gonna
disagree with me,

951
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,749
so I made the decision
on my own.

952
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,619
Really?
Yeah.

953
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,658
Come on, you are so smart,

954
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,491
and, you know, sometimes
you're so confused, you know?

955
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,171
So if you don't get
the scholarship next year--

956
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,540
I'll get
the scholarship again.

957
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,204
That's not gonna be a problem.

958
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,510
And if you don't,
then what?

959
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,154
I think...

960
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,655
I'm gonna get it again.

961
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,749
It almost went over me.

962
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,387
It flew past, a bee.

963
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,089
Well, we don't want to kill
the bee, do we?

964
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,131
Let's try it again.

965
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,666
You're gonna go back
to your studies?

966
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,827
Yes.
I don't think so.

967
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,302
Well, why don't you
just let me

968
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,669
make that decision for myself,
okay?

969
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:38,706
I'm 18.

970
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,969
I've done really well in school.

971
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,203
I think I've earned the right--

972
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,437
What do you want?

973
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,707
You want to struggle
like your sister?

974
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,113
What struggle
are you talking about?

975
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,948
I'm sorry.
No, what?

976
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:51,986
No, nothing.

977
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,021
You all have jobs.

978
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,648
You have--
they're all happy.

979
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,888
Here's the ginger.

980
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,364
I'll be outside.

981
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,700
I'll get that.

982
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,030
The Shermans?

983
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,563
Yeah, yeah.

984
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,335
Is this enough filling
for one?

985
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,171
Yes, that's perfect.

986
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,505
Can you tell your father,
please,

987
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,240
that the Shermans are here?

988
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,612
Papi?

989
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:21,649
Papi.

990
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,982
How you doing?

991
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:24,987
Look at you.

992
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:25,987
Darling.

993
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,249
She looks great.

994
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,450
Hello!
Hey!

995
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,548
How you doing?

996
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,592
Hey, Sylvia!

997
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,787
So nice to see you.

998
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:33,828
You too.

999
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,023
This is my casserole for you.
Okay, thank you very much.

1000
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,033
That's for Felix.

1001
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,829
What's that?

1002
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:39,924
Go get your son, please.

1003
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,061
That's a very nice one.

1004
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,195
Jack!

1005
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,508
We got 3 now.

1006
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,579
We pissed him off.

1007
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:40,689
God.

1008
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,389
Okay, so it's his guys
at the internet place.

1009
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:43,761
He's scared.

1010
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,095
Doesn't seem scared to me.

1011
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,693
He's making threats.

1012
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:02,907
Fuck.

1013
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,618
Okay, well,
that's what we wanted.

1014
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,604
That's what we talked about.

1015
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:29,569
That's what we talked about.

1016
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,271
We're gonna do it?

1017
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,678
Okay?

1018
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,750
You sure?

1019
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:35,783
Okay, I'm gonna send it.

1020
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,252
No, I want to send it.

1021
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,481
Okay.

1022
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,763
Maybe we should
turn the Treo on.

1023
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:48,888
What, just to fuck with him?

1024
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,023
Yeah.

1025
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,397
That's a good idea.

1026
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,503
I got another message
from Perez.

1027
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,604
What does it say?

1028
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,701
Nothing.

1029
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,873
He just wants to know
why we didn't get back to him.

1030
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,974
He doesn't know anything
about us, though, does he?

1031
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,484
No, I don't think so.

1032
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,214
Okay, I'm turning off the phone.

1033
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,119
So now what?

1034
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,851
What do we do?

1035
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,427
We wait until the morning.

1036
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,586
You hungry?

1037
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,685
I'm always hungry.

1038
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,930
You did good.

1039
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:23,965
Look how much you ate.

1040
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,663
I appreciate you
taking care of these.

1041
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,370
All right, make a little
space here, please.

1042
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,406
Good.

1043
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,533
Really good, yeah.

1044
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,474
All right, round 2.

1045
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,103
Nice.

1046
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,943
Mami, there's more down here
if you want any--

1047
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,981
you just let me know, okay?

1048
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,948
Hey, guys?

1049
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,386
This is the time for a toast.

1050
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,850
Para arriba.

1051
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,158
Para arriba.

1052
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,159
Para abajo...

1053
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,092
Para abajo...
Al centro.

1054
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,095
Pa 'dentro.

1055
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,255
Salud.

1056
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,629
Salud.

1057
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,931
I want everyone
to taste my empanadas.

1058
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,700
That's what you want.
I'll go for you.

1059
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,901
Earl, we will get you
some gardening going here.

1060
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,341
I actually own, finally.

1061
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,673
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1062
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:10,871
Little piece of New York.
That's right.

1063
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,007
It's like me in a cubicle
with a phone and a computer,

1064
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,141
and that's really it.

1065
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,276
Yeah.
You know?

1066
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,853
All day long, right?
All day long.

1067
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,252
I don't have anybody bringing me
fresh tomatoes like you did,

1068
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,917
or my--or my coffee
or something like that.

1069
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,152
There was interference there.

1070
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,523
Their player
went out of the line,

1071
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,789
and he hit the guy in the--

1072
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:27,828
They lost.

1073
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,523
Here--here they come!

1074
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,965
Can I have one?

1075
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,040
Yeah, pass the plate.

1076
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,506
These are just vegetarian,
right?

1077
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,339
They're beef.

1078
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,605
No?

1079
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,271
I can't have?

1080
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:46,314
No?

1081
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,680
What do you think, everybody?

1082
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:50,719
They're great.

1083
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,754
You're my little girl.

1084
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,347
I'd love to go to Harvard.
She should.

1085
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,189
She just--she just deferred
her scholarship.

1086
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:04,729
They are driving me
absolutely insane, tio.

1087
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,028
Do you know what happened?

1088
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,330
So it's yours.

1089
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,369
It's gonna be ours.

1090
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,302
This isn't renting.
There's no more renting.

1091
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,931
It's gonna be so much larger.

1092
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,441
We've had, like, no time.

1093
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,602
I'm working extra shifts,
and we got 2 kids,

1094
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:16,838
she's taking off.

1095
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,675
She gives me shit
for not cleaning up the home,

1096
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,443
because she wants everything
to be perfect.

1097
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,711
My father was there when--
he was stationed in--in New York

1098
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,013
when the Giants were here,

1099
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,180
and that--that's part of why
I wanted to come here, actually.

1100
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,279
Don't you worry about it.

1101
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,359
They give me all the credit
for getting the grades.

1102
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,392
Relax.

1103
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,189
But they don't let me
make my own decisions.

1104
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,456
The same happened to Katalina.

1105
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,496
Don't worry about it.

1106
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,589
Your father used to give
a hard time to Katalina,

1107
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,725
and look at her.

1108
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,927
She's doing good now.

1109
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,230
You should do the same thing.

1110
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,535
The same happened with
the music, okay, for Hector.

1111
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,168
Hector had the pa--
the passion.

1112
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,641
Tio?

1113
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,682
Where is he?
Tio?

1114
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,114
Why isn't he here?

1115
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,583
Tio, don't you remember?

1116
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,653
Hey, Felix.
Felix.

1117
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,483
Tio.

1118
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,080
Why isn't he here?

1119
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,557
Why isn't Hector here?

1120
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,720
Where is he?

1121
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,263
Diego. Diego.

1122
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,394
Hector is not coming.

1123
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,097
Remember, I told you that?

1124
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,400
He's not coming.

1125
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,277
Right?

1126
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,744
Yeah, right.

1127
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:27,305
Relax.

1128
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,942
Excuse--excuse me.

1129
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,611
You don't have to leave
the table, tio.

1130
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,120
Do you want me to come inside
with you?

1131
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,588
No, sweetheart, that's okay.

1132
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,623
Just stay.

1133
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,090
Stay.

1134
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:38,421
I had no idea it was this bad.

1135
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,460
I'm so sorry.

1136
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,655
Yeah, he's--

1137
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,130
Mami.

1138
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,200
I don't know what to say,

1139
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,326
but I guess he's also drinking
a little bit.

1140
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,870
He'd always sit up here,
right?

1141
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:52,964
Yeah.

1142
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,043
I'm sorry.

1143
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,113
I'm sorry.

1144
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,680
It's a shame, you know,
so young and--

1145
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,615
Hey.

1146
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,515
You want to come outside
and smoke a cigarette with me?

1147
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,645
Mami, you okay?

1148
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,052
Okay.

1149
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,761
You okay?

1150
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:12,828
Yeah, I'm fine.

1151
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,056
Okay.

1152
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,498
You want more sausage, mom?

1153
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,162
You want more sausage?

1154
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,455
No.

1155
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:44,391
What, did you quit again?

1156
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,395
No, I'm just not smoking
right now.

1157
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,362
Why?

1158
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,437
Because I don't think
I should.

1159
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,511
Oh, my God.

1160
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,580
Katie.

1161
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,672
I know.

1162
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,648
My God.

1163
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,683
Katie.

1164
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,017
I know.

1165
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,613
Katie.

1166
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,283
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

1167
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,758
No, that's okay.

1168
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,126
That's okay.

1169
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:29,268
Does Bobby know yet?

1170
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,772
Yeah, it's been 11 weeks.

1171
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,076
I know.

1172
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,715
I know.

1173
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:50,885
But it's just that every time
I try to make a decision...

1174
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,121
I don't...

1175
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,823
make a decision.

1176
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:02,169
I don't know why.

1177
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,854
You're really mad about this,
aren't you?

1178
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,398
Can't believe
you're eating roast beef.

1179
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,693
One sandwich.

1180
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,031
It--it will lead to others.

1181
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,534
One sandwich does not mean
that I've failed

1182
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,303
in my commitment
to fishitarianism.

1183
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,639
You know,
I'm not gonna kiss you

1184
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,303
till that shit's
out of your system.

1185
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,540
How do I know
when it's out of my system?

1186
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,090
Hey.
Salud, Bobby.

1187
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,128
Salud.

1188
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,219
For many more.

1189
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,264
Maria, I love you.

1190
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,298
My son.

1191
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,697
Mami.

1192
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,667
Cheers, Bobby.

1193
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,702
I love you.

1194
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:09,863
Don't shoot it;
just sip it.

1195
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,509
That's good.

1196
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,205
We'll take some of this with us.

1197
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,042
This Earl knows what he's doing,
let me tell you.

1198
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,173
Look who we found eating
ice cream in the kitchen.

1199
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,342
Aparecido, muchacho.

1200
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,785
Me estaba comiendo
un helado deliciosa.

1201
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:26,820
Mira, mira.

1202
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,187
Numero cinco.

1203
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,693
The fireworks.
My God.

1204
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,563
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we should go to the--hey.

1205
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,336
I liked it.
I did.

1206
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:43,427
That's good.

1207
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,471
You okay?

1208
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,439
Yeah.

1209
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,975
Where are we gonna go?

1210
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,009
I don't know.

1211
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,044
My back hurts.

1212
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,135
Those seats were tiny.

1213
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,179
Your back hurts?

1214
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,213
Yeah.

1215
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,283
That's so funny.

1216
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:57,080
Hector would always talk about
seats being too small for him,

1217
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,551
so he'd have to sit
in the aisle.

1218
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,680
Hector did?
Yeah.

1219
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,022
You don't talk about your
brother as much as you used to.

1220
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,596
I know.

1221
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,826
Bobby, where are we gonna go?

1222
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,925
I don't know.

1223
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:16,301
We can't go home, though.

1224
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,567
I don't like being
on the streets.

1225
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,576
Well, we could go
to Fitz's party.

1226
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,010
I told him we were gonna come.

1227
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,240
All right, let's go.

1228
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,888
Why not?
Come on.

1229
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:35,923
Go like this.

1230
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,118
Hey, Bobby, can you do this?

1231
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,216
You want a beat?

1232
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,454
Do something.

1233
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,962
<i>* Te deja un paseo</i>

1234
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,590
<i>* Como es estudiante
ya se va Escalona</i>

1235
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,760
<i>* Pero de recuerdo
te deja un paseo</i>

1236
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,961
<i>* Que te habla</i>

1237
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,335
<i>* de aquel inmenso amor
que llevo</i>

1238
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,372
<i>* dentro del corazón</i>

1239
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,406
<i>* que dice</i>

1240
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,806
Sorry, excuse us.

1241
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,972
Sorry.

1242
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,279
It's so fucking hot.

1243
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,352
We got to say hi to Fitz.

1244
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,442
Bobby!
Hey.

1245
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,851
What's up, man?
How are you?

1246
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:06,887
Thanks for having us.

1247
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,149
Absolutely.
I brought Kate.

1248
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,157
Kate!
Hi.

1249
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,209
I think there's a roof.

1250
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,648
Okay.
Yeah.

1251
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,121
My God.

1252
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,702
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1253
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:55,771
Come on, girls.

1254
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:56,804
Don't get hit by a car!

1255
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,703
Tiger on there.

1256
01:02:58,808 --> 01:02:59,775
Did you hear that?

1257
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,106
Yeah.

1258
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:05,203
Hey, will you slowpokes
hurry up, please?

1259
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,357
You know,
I don't talk about my brother

1260
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:28,369
as much as I used to because...

1261
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,804
I just don't think about him
as much.

1262
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:41,145
You know, he's been dead
a long time.

1263
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,276
It's been 5 years.

1264
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:51,085
My mom thinks about him
every day...

1265
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:58,091
Every minute.

1266
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,964
Makes me think like
something's wrong with me.

1267
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,867
There's not.

1268
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,636
Promise.

1269
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,793
Would we be people
with a kid...

1270
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,055
or parents?

1271
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,629
What's the difference?

1272
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,482
Jack?

1273
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,821
Come on, girl.

1274
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,765
Come on, girl.

1275
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,302
Ay, come on, girl.

1276
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,598
Bye, Bobby.
Nice meeting you.

1277
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,638
Nice to meet you.

1278
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,071
It was really nice
to see you guys.

1279
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,075
I'm gonna go say good-bye
to mami.

1280
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,077
Felix, thanks again.

1281
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,770
Hey, my pleasure.

1282
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,574
Hey, had a good time?

1283
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,613
Si.

1284
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:27,842
Tranquilo?
Yeah.

1285
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,440
I'll--I'll pick you up next week?

1286
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,144
Thank you.
And we watch some football.

1287
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,973
I asked Bobby if he could
drop off Uncle Diego.

1288
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,308
Yeah, he said it's fine.

1289
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:01,679
So here is the pasta,
las empanadas.

1290
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,957
Mama.

1291
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,527
I want to ask you something.

1292
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,424
Could you talk to your sister?

1293
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,366
Please, talk to her.

1294
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,562
You know, I...

1295
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,536
I want to talk to her,
but it's impossible.

1296
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,766
I mean, she's not listening.

1297
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,968
I mean, I do everything wrong.

1298
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,205
She's gonna trust you, you know?

1299
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,146
You're assuming
that I agree with you.

1300
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,144
You do agree, don't you?

1301
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,562
Please, I can't sleep, you know?

1302
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,598
It's a big mistake.

1303
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,360
I mean, I cannot rely
on your father.

1304
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,902
I'll talk to her.

1305
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,270
Want to put this in a bag?

1306
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:12,719
Yeah?

1307
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,722
We're leaving.

1308
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:14,949
Hey, what?

1309
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,150
I thought--I thought that you
were staying over tonight.

1310
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,194
No chance in hell.

1311
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:26,529
Okay, well, listen, you have to
call me this week, okay?

1312
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,567
I will.

1313
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,659
You have to keep me posted.

1314
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,239
I will.
Call me tomorrow?

1315
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,708
Sophie, I think--

1316
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:48,023
What?

1317
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,719
You were so wonderful
this afternoon.

1318
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,692
Thank you.

1319
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:54,854
I'm so glad you got to see some.

1320
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,056
Me too.

1321
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,632
Okay, bye.
Bye.

1322
01:08:57,731 --> 01:08:59,590
Love you.
Call me tomorrow.

1323
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:00,634
I will.
Okay?

1324
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:01,725
I will.
Okay, love you, bye.

1325
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,361
I love you, papi.

1326
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,996
I love you.

1327
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,234
Bye, mama.
Bye.

1328
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,751
Happy Independence Day.

1329
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,990
I'm not feeling
very independent.

1330
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,605
So how long has he been living
in this place?

1331
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,232
Couple years.

1332
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,275
How long did he box for?

1333
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,176
God, since way before
I was born.

1334
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,306
Did you ever see him?
I did.

1335
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,755
Hey, tio Dio?

1336
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,228
Yes?

1337
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,898
I'm pregnant.

1338
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:10,870
That's beautiful.

1339
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,942
You're gonna have a baby,
Katalina?

1340
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,772
Do you hear that, Tiger?

1341
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,974
Katalina's gonna have a baby.

1342
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,176
That is nice.

1343
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,217
Who is the father?

1344
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:32,817
Tio, Bobby.

1345
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,889
That's nice.

1346
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,360
Can you kick it up a notch?

1347
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,599
Like, kick it up?

1348
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,073
<i>O Canada</i>

1349
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,404
Yeah, that's it.

1350
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:26,003
<i>Our home and na--</i>

1351
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,559
You know, we haven't
known each other for that long.

1352
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,525
10 months?

1353
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,496
10 months.

1354
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,532
It's not that long.

1355
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,499
No, it's not a long time.

1356
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,332
It's not.

1357
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,134
Doesn't it feel like
a long time, though?

1358
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,035
Okay, good point.

1359
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,308
What if you couldn't
write music anymore?

1360
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,545
What if--what if you couldn't
play music anymore?

1361
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,280
I'd kill myself.

1362
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,548
Very funny.

1363
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,748
I'm gonna play music.

1364
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,256
I'm gonna play music.

1365
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,951
Look, I know what you're saying,
all right?

1366
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,494
Because based on our decision,

1367
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,028
there's consequences for that,
for me.

1368
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,062
I know, things change.

1369
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,598
Things change
based on our decision,

1370
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,531
but I'm gonna play music,

1371
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,068
and you're gonna dance.

1372
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,730
Dancing in a kitchen?

1373
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,239
It wouldn't happen like that.

1374
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,442
Do you see what's behind you?

1375
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,606
It's beautiful.

1376
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,887
Why don't we
stay up here tonight?

1377
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,497
Okay.

1378
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,270
We're here, tio.

1379
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:06,872
Welcome back, Diego.

1380
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:07,914
Hi.

1381
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,244
Did you have a good day?
Yes.

1382
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,414
I love you.

1383
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,683
I love you too, Katalina.

1384
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,487
Wanna say bye to Bobby?

1385
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,587
Okay.
Bye.

1386
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,720
Bye-bye.

1387
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,675
You want to come over?

1388
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,769
Okay.

1389
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,658
Okay, girl.

1390
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,290
Come on.

1391
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,459
Come into the kitchen.

1392
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,469
Come into the kitchen.

1393
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:42,043
Do you have a bowl or something
so we can give her some water?

1394
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,372
Yeah.

1395
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:47,472
A bowl that doesn't have,
like, light soy sauce.

1396
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,551
Yeah.

1397
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,675
Mint Moroccan tea?

1398
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:51,810
That's new.

1399
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,424
I'm so hungry.

1400
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:03,623
Yeah, we haven't eaten today.

1401
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:04,994
Almost.

1402
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,209
What?

1403
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,414
What are you thinking?

1404
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,252
How many months
have you been here?

1405
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,485
Not that many.

1406
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:09,758
I can't tell if you're
still unpacking or packing.

1407
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,567
Unpacking.

1408
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,401
What are you really
thinking about?

1409
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,445
I think my mother
is all right.

1410
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,143
What do you mean?

1411
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,845
I just saw
so clearly today how...

1412
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,182
she thinks life has...

1413
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,279
disappointed her.

1414
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,886
Really?

1415
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,829
You know what I saw today
in your mom

1416
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:47,129
that I never saw before?

1417
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:50,329
Just how strong she is.

1418
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,340
She reminded me of you today.

1419
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,412
What?

1420
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:04,179
You scared?

1421
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,881
I know.

1422
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,757
I don't want to
disappoint you.

1423
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,912
Will you kiss me now?

1424
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:08,829
Let's get down to the bank.

1425
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:19,468
Dog in the house.

1426
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,345
Tiger.

1427
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:32,886
Come here, come here.

1428
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:41,888
We're out of coffee.

1429
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,402
I'm supposed to be
at work later today.

1430
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,897
What was that?

1431
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,990
It's a text from Fitz.

1432
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,796
Asked why we didn't come
last night.

1433
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:24,098
I thought it'd be
something about Tiger.

1434
01:22:24,405 --> 01:22:26,264
No, it's not.

1435
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:30,003
What are we gonna do
with the dog?

1436
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,153
Hi, we'd like to open
a safety deposit box, please.

1437
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,587
Yeah, upstairs.

1438
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:43,953
Upstairs?
Yeah.

1439
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,562
I just need some signatures
on the back where the Xs are.

1440
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:49,721
There.

1441
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,355
Now, the both of you
are gonna be on there?

1442
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,592
Yes.
Okey-doke.

1443
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,067
We need to decide
what size box you want.

1444
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,297
We have the 2-inch
and the 5-inch.

1445
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,305
They're both 18 inches long.

1446
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,874
5x18.

1447
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,944
5x18?
All right.

1448
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,686
Do you ever feel like
you're pretending?

1449
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,955
I hope you're not talking
about last night.

1450
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,626
And I think we're all set.

1451
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,065
If you'll just follow me,

1452
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,898
I'll show you
where they're kept.

1453
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,029
Is that gonna be big enough?

1454
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,107
How big is $500,000?

1455
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,436
That's what I'm saying.

1456
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,136
So, just have to show you
how it all works.

1457
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,340
So I had this cup
of espresso.

1458
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,440
I'm talking just a tiny shot,
you know?

1459
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,848
The tiniest shot.

1460
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,887
Not even, like--
it's a single,

1461
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,353
not a double.

1462
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,550
And I felt it instantly
in my body.

1463
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:52,785
Like, I was jittery.

1464
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:56,022
I had a hard time concentrating,

1465
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,689
and I felt it in my stomach.

1466
01:23:57,799 --> 01:23:59,266
Like, I felt it here.

1467
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,267
Of course, I had to go
to the bathroom immediately.

1468
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,495
Then I was thinking,

1469
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,094
"Oh, it's not gonna be that way
with tea,

1470
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,333
or diet sodas probably
don't have the same effect."

1471
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,909
But I think tea is different,
right?

1472
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,637
You think?

1473
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,043
Are you sure that's decaf?
Yes.

1474
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:23,789
All right.

1475
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,793
I'm turning it on.

1476
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,056
Look, are you sure
you want to do this?

1477
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,465
We can't stop after this.

1478
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,531
Call him.

1479
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:44,078
Okay.

1480
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:56,819
Hello.
Is this Dmitri?

1481
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:57,825
Yes.

1482
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:58,826
Yeah, this is Bobby.

1483
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,053
I know.

1484
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:03,096
We're at a Chase bank
at the corner of Canal and Mott.

1485
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:04,256
You meet us here, right now,

1486
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:05,297
you bring the money,

1487
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,027
and you put it in
as small a case as possible.

1488
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,659
We put the money
in a safety deposit box,

1489
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,702
then you get the phone.

1490
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,795
I'm on my way.

1491
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,110
He said he's on his way.

1492
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:24,013
Let's get back inside.

1493
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,143
You know, when I was little,

1494
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,278
my dad told me
that babies grew on trees.

1495
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,784
My dad told me
I came from his balls.

1496
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:39,032
Well, that was the truth.

1497
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,102
Yeah.
How old were you?

1498
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:52,805
Should have been here by now.

1499
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:55,348
What did he say?

1500
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,850
I told you what he said.

1501
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,920
I mean, did he give you
a time when he'd be here?

1502
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,648
He said, "I'm on my way."

1503
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,884
That's all he said.

1504
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:18,063
What if it's a boy?

1505
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,971
I don't know anything
about boys.

1506
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:25,011
I'm a boy.

1507
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,017
Where the fuck is he?

1508
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,118
Shit.

1509
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,157
The guy's here.

1510
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:12,351
The guy's here from yesterday.

1511
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,449
Come on. Come on.
What guy?

1512
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:14,687
The guy with the gun.
Dmitri?

1513
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,195
No, not Dmitri,
the Chinese guy.

1514
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:18,424
My God.

1515
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:19,625
Shit.

1516
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:51,496
Do you see anything?

1517
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,165
He's down there.

1518
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,963
I can see him in the mirror.

1519
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:56,229
How did he find us?

1520
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:57,599
I don't know.

1521
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,172
But the Treo's on.

1522
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,206
What is he doing?

1523
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,502
He's got his phone open.

1524
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,541
We're safe here.

1525
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:04,043
Doesn't feel safe.

1526
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,203
This was our plan.

1527
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,213
I know,
but it's a stupid plan.

1528
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,748
Fuck, he's coming up
the stairs.

1529
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,511
Get in the elevator.

1530
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:11,915
Go, go.

1531
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,662
Fuck.

1532
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,523
Bobby, turn it off!

1533
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,329
I am, I am, I am.

1534
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,562
Turn it off!
I am.

1535
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:30,571
Shit.

1536
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:45,051
Give me your purse.
Take it!

1537
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,347
Just go!

1538
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,997
Sorry!
Sorry.

1539
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,091
Excuse us!

1540
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,530
In here!

1541
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,395
In here, in here.

1542
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:07,866
Go, go!

1543
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:10,699
Get back there!

1544
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:12,430
Okay.

1545
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,666
Bobby, is he there?

1546
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:14,707
Bobby.
Look at me.

1547
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,003
I don't think
I can run anymore.

1548
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,839
Yes, you can.
No, I don't think I can.

1549
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:24,416
The door's locked.

1550
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,508
The door's locked, okay?

1551
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:32,218
Come on.
Come on!

1552
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:36,022
Okay.
You're okay.

1553
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,080
Bobby, I can't.

1554
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,239
You're okay.

1555
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,106
Come on, okay?

1556
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,679
We have to find a way down.

1557
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,256
Okay, okay.

1558
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:04,346
Fuck!

1559
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,619
Come on.

1560
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,520
Okay.

1561
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:11,791
I got you.

1562
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:18,933
Come on.

1563
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:29,778
Shit! Go!

1564
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:35,980
Go, go, go!

1565
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,957
Crap!

1566
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,590
Come on!

1567
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:51,464
Bobby, I can't.

1568
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:56,800
Got you.

1569
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,325
In there! In there!

1570
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,233
Bobby, the lock!

1571
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,638
Is it locked?

1572
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:29,767
Let's go.
Okay.

1573
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,337
God.

1574
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,136
Which way, Bobby?

1575
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:04,939
The... south.

1576
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,283
Do you see him?

1577
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:13,114
No.

1578
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,244
The bridge.

1579
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,149
Fuck!

1580
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:01,159
Wait.

1581
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,253
Wait.

1582
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,224
This is fucking crazy.

1583
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,322
I know.

1584
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:27,684
I almost told my mother
last night.

1585
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:36,255
And then you came
to your senses, right?

1586
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:37,853
Well, I mean,
I told my sister.

1587
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:39,956
Yeah, I know you did.

1588
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:46,364
But I-I know that my mother

1589
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:50,001
wouldn't understand
that it's a decision, you know?

1590
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:52,079
I mean...

1591
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:56,977
The fact that
not wanting to have a baby

1592
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,517
was my first instinct,

1593
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:02,248
one I thought that I'd--

1594
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:06,224
we'd absolutely act upon,

1595
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:08,887
and I thought that's
definitely what we'd do.

1596
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:11,362
That's what we both thought.

1597
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:30,209
Okay.

1598
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,308
I think we're all right.

1599
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:46,590
That didn't go so well.

1600
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:50,500
What happened?

1601
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:54,438
What do you think we did wrong?

1602
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,134
Ethically or logistically?

1603
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:59,041
Yeah, you choose that one.

1604
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:24,065
It's time we decide.

1605
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:27,231
I know.

1606
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,375
You don't know.

1607
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:33,275
I do know.

1608
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,314
We'll decide.

1609
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,816
And it'll be a good decision.

1610
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,623
Will it be the right decision?

1611
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:54,432
Yeah.

1612
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:00,367
Are we through?

1613
01:38:01,374 --> 01:38:03,443
God, yes.

1614
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,171
Here, hold this.

1615
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,750
What are you doing?

1616
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:13,046
Bobby?

1617
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,790
Hello?
It's Bobby.

1618
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,091
Things didn't work out.

1619
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:25,893
We're taking ourselves
out of the equation.

1620
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,332
Just give me the Treo, Bobby.

1621
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:31,427
All I want is the phone.
The Treo's on.

1622
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,032
Nice shot.

1623
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:23,988
What time do you have to
go to work today?

1624
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:25,718
