Portrait of Madame de Nemours
by Cézanne.

6
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,520
Now, because of the interest
in this painting...

7
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:28,189
we are keeping telephone lines open
to our buyers in London and New York.

8
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:33,060
This great painting is from
the world-famous Bonnet collection...

00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,726
sold by order
of the present head of the family...

<i>Monsieur Charles Bonnet.</i>

11
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,168
Now ladies and gentlemen...

12
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:49,943
who will start this superb
Postimpressionist masterpiece...

13
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,416

$230,000. Thank you.

16
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:04,853
Now who says $240,000?

17
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,623
Thank you very much.

18
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,666
Who says $240,000?

19
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:13,732
Thank you.

00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,105
$260,000.

21
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,646
$270,000.

22
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,721
<i>...equal this record
in the coming three months.</i>

23
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:38,226
<i>And now, in the world of art...</i>

24
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,695
<i>in an auction
of notable lmpressionist masterpieces...</i>

25
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,827
<i>the highest price paid
was for a Cézanne portrait...</i>

26
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,999
<i>from the great private collection
of Charles Bonnet...</i>

27
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:53,543
<i>sold after spirited bidding for $515,000.</i>

28
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,015
<i>The buyer,
himself a notable art collector....</i>

29
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,475
<i>- Good evening, Marcel.
- Evening, mademoiselle.</i>

30
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,911
- ls my father home?
- He is upstairs.

31
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,677
- Shall l tell him?
- No, thank you. l'll go up.

32
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,942
Hello, my darling!

33
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,083
Hello, Papa.

34
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,413
- Careful. l'm covered with paint.
- And with money.

35
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,415
l heard all about the auction on the radio.

36
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:16,017
We've got to have a long, serious talk.

37
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,893
My dear angel, it was a triumph.

38
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,330
l could have sold
a dozen Cézannes on the spot.

39
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,528
When is enough more than enough?
This has got to stop.

40
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,164
One moment.

41
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,644
How kind of van Gogh
to use only his first name.

42
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,708
l can sign him in half the time.

43
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,552
There. Perfect!

44
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:43,120
Not again, Papa? So soon?

45
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,951
This long-lost masterpiece
will not be for sale for a long time.

46
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,121
We'll hang it. lt'll be admired. Who knows?
ln time, some legendary tycoon...

47
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,791
may be able to persuade me
to part with it.

48
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,993
- You're such a scoundrel.
- Thank you, my child.

49
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,932
Nicole! My dirt.

50
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,837
This is not ordinary dirt.
lt is van Gogh dirt.

51
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,309
l mean dirt from his own neighborhood.

52
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,707
l scraped it myself
off these old 19th-century canvases.

53
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,909
Like this.

54
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,548
lt took me weeks.

55
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,316
A nice touch of authenticity,
don't you think?

56
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:22,017
l doubt if van Gogh himself would've gone
to such pains with his works.

57
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,495
He didn't have to. He was van Gogh.

58
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:29,661
But you know that in his whole lifetime,
he only sold one painting.

59
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:33,433
Whereas l, in loving memory
of his great tragic genius...

60
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,534
have already sold two.

61
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,439
Papa, l keep telling you...

62
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:41,736
when you sell a fake masterpiece,
that is a crime.

63
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,282
l don't sell to the poor.

64
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:47,479
l only sell them to millionaires
and they get great paintings like this one.

65
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:11,974
Papa! Police!

66
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,022
What a shock you gave me.

67
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,566
lt's the director
of the Kléber-Lafayette Museum.

68
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,602
Come about our Cellini Venus.

69
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,068
What about the Venus?

70
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,006
Our Cellini Venus
is to be the outstanding feature...

71
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,737
of a great loan exhibition,
Masterpieces of French Collections.

72
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,346
Not in public, Papa!

73
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,144
- Yes. Come along.
- No!

74
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,690
Wait a minute.
You can't let it out of the house.

75
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,752
Don't fuss.

76
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:05,662
But, Papa, this is insane.

77
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,793
<i>l'm coming, Monsieur Grammont.</i>

78
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,232
Take your time.

79
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,673
- l beg you. Listen to me.
- Do you see any paint anywhere?

80
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,302
Do l smell of paint?

81
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:23,539
l beg of you, will you listen to me?
The Cellini Venus is a fake.

82
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:28,383
- That's a word we don't use in this house.
- lt's too dangerous. l can't let you do this.

83
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,748
Papa, will you listen to me?

84
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,120
Stop spraying and.... All right.

85
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,720
<i>Come along, you'll like
Monsieur Grammont.</i>

86
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,356
He's impeccably honest
and extremely dull.

87
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:48,741
My dear Grammont.
How kind of you to come in person.

88
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,970
- Good evening, Bonnet.
- My pleasure, l can assure you.

89
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:58,206
Marcel, the doors.
Allow me to present my daughter, Nicole.

90
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,356
<i>- Delighted, mademoiselle.
- Good evening.</i>

91
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:11,593
There she is.

92
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:21,935
Allow me.

93
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,482
l remember it as a work of art,
but it is more.

94
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,786
My friend, l express my own
and the museum's gratitude...

95
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:43,522
for your generous loan,
and l thank you on behalf of France itself...

96
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,190
for never letting this treasure
leave the country.

97
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,531
l know of the offers you must have had
and how tempting they must have been.

98
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,733
One is, after all, always a Frenchman.

99
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,138
- l'll get it for you.
- No.

100
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:04,574
Please.

101
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,184
Look, Papa, let me help you.

102
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,214
lnto your hands...

103
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,051
- my dear Grammont...
- Me?

104
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,356
...l give this, our ultimate treasure.

105
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,977
Papa, what have you done?

106
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,673
The room doesn't look
the same without her.

107
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,560
What have l done?

108
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:28,931
l'm giving the world an opportunity
of studying and viewing the Cellini Venus.

109
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,935
Which is not by Cellini.

110
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:34,063
Labels! lt's working with the Americans...

111
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,234
that's given you this obsession
with labels and brand names.

112
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,437
l wish you'd give up that ridiculous job.

113
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:43,744
Don't you know you can't fake
sculpture anymore? lt's not like painting.

114
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:47,149
l know about their so-called tests.

115
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,422
Papa, they are not so-called. They are!

116
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,552
One quick whiff of something
called potassium argon...

117
00:11:55,862 --> 00:12:00,697
and they can tell the age of the stone,
where it was quarried, when it was cut...

118
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,632
and the name and address
of the man who did it.

119
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,671
Why do you suppose l haven't sold it?

120
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:09,139
l was offered recently....
lt gives me a twinge when l think of it.

121
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,371
l was offered $1,000,000.
But l won't sell it.

122
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,572
l don't even charge rent.
So, why should they test it?

123
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:20,246
Did you hear Grammont say
100,000 souvenir postcards!

124
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,117
They'll be mailed all over the world.
Our Venus!

125
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,850
Don't you feel
a kind of thrilling glow in that?

126
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,251
Chills run up and down my spine.

127
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,588
The basic trouble with you
is that you're honest.

128
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:35,132
l don't say that to hurt your feelings.

129
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,667
l get dizzy spells
when we have these conversations, Papa.

130
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,502
What you need is a brandy.

131
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:47,169
My darling, what you must understand
is that l am pleased and proud...

132
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:51,477
that our Cellini Venus is a forgery.
lf it were genuine, what would it be?

133
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:56,180
A piece of sculpture made
centuries ago by some over-sexed ltalian.

134
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,486
But our Cellini Venus is really our own.
So, be proud of it.

135
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,154
Your own grandfather made it,
and your own grandmother posed for it.

136
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,561
For months she stood
without moving a muscle...

137
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,156
while your grandfather
perpetuated her in marble.

138
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:12,068
That was, naturally, before she
started eating those enormous lunches.

139
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,946
- Back to the hotel, please.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

140
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,122
Miss Treadwell, type this up immediately.

141
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,892
Do it yourself
and send it to all parties concerned.

142
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:50,493
Cancel all travel arrangements
and business meetings Near and Far East.

143
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,902
Remaining in Paris on urgent business
regarding my art foundation.

144
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,669
Further instructions
will be issued as needed.

145
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:59,710
Paris office:
Do a run-down on Charles Bonnet...

146
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,781
this city, all members of his family,
his art collection...

147
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:06,285
and particularly the Cellini Venus,
which is now on exhibition.

148
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,980
Have all this information
at my hotel in the morning.

149
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,319
This is urgent, repeat, urgent.

150
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,716
And confidential.

151
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,703
Don't move.

152
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,314
Put down that painting.

153
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,647
Put it down!

154
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,864
- Miss Bonnet, please....
- Stay where you are!

155
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,451
Why did you choose
that particular painting?

156
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,914
lt was the handiest.

157
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,121
Look, don't call the police.
Give me another chance.

158
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,162
You see, l was only taking one painting
and you've got so many.

159
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,932
The chances were
you wouldn't have missed it.

160
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,802
l'll put it back.

161
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,159
lt's beautiful. A pity.

162
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,824
You knew my father
and the servants were out. How?

163
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,828
lt's my business to know things like that.

164
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,230
Look, if l frightened you,
l'm really terribly sorry.

165
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,602
l thought you'd be at the opening
with your father.

166
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,370
Big event like that....

167
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,783
Anyway, you frightened me,
so we're even.

168
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,156
Don't be impudent.

169
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,322
That thing isn't loaded, is it?

170
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,794
Of course it is.

171
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,874
- Are you armed?
- Wait.

172
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:58,733
Do you have a gun?

173
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,573
Good God, no!

174
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:13,152
l'm going to let you go.

175
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,387
l don't know why, but....

176
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,249
l'm the one that's bleeding.

177
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,716
- What's that?
- lodine.

178
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,321
Will it hurt?

179
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,723
For a burglar, you're not very brave,
are you?

180
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,791
l'm a society burglar. l don't expect people
to rush about shooting me.

181
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,168
Take your hand away
so l can put this stuff on.

182
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,069
That hurt.

183
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:42,480
Don't be such a baby.
lt's only a flesh wound.

184
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:44,139
lt happens to be my flesh.

185
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:46,951
You have to expect
some occupational hazards.

186
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,283
You broke in here to steal!

187
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:52,017
Could we keep personalities
out of this conversation?

188
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,386
Fine. A thing like this
could keep me out of action for a week.

189
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:58,656
Temporarily, you'll have to go straight.

190
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:02,565
Look, it's late and l'm tired,
and l have to work in the morning.

191
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,999
You work?

192
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,665
Some people do, you know.

193
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:08,464
All right. l'm going.

194
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,275
How do l get home? l can't drive.

195
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:22,949
l feel weak from shock and loss of blood.

196
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,252
Dear heaven!

197
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:31,856
l'll call you a taxi. And pay for it.
ls that all right?

198
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,427
As far as l'm concerned, fine...

199
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:39,463
but if the police found my car
outside your house...

200
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:43,439
it would mean questions,
and l'm wanted, you know.

201
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:45,667
l'm really thinking of you.

202
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,241
Thank you very much.

203
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,949
- l'll drive you home. ls that okay with you?
- Fine, thank you.

204
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,030
You don't happen
to have a cigarette, do you?

205
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,268
Here.

206
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,076
Pretty, isn't she?
She'll do more than 150 miles an hour.

207
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,979
Useful for getaways, you see.

208
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,576
The robbery business must be pretty good.

209
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:04,986
lt's stolen.

210
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,582
l can't drive a stolen car!

211
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,287
Same principle.
Four gears forward, one reverse.

212
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:13,957
This is crazy. You should be in jail,
and l should be in bed.

213
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,365
All right. Where to?

214
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,865
The Ritz.

215
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,041
The what?

216
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,805
The Hotel Ritz in the Place Vendôme.

217
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:31,576
l know where it is.
You're a very chic burglar, aren't you?

218
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:04,112
Your arm is much better.

219
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:06,475
No. lt hurts.

220
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,780
lt's the other arm.

221
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:11,455
The infection is spreading.

222
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,598
We got here alive. Thank you.

223
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,663
- And if ever l can return the favor--
- Hardly likely to happen, is it?

224
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,868
Now how do l get home?

225
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:36,544
You see, you never can tell
when you might need a friend.

226
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:43,578
Good evening, Mr. Dermott.

227
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,379
Armand, l want a taxi.

228
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,491
Yes, Mr. Dermott. Right away.

229
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:50,789
Transportation laid on.

230
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,153
Taxi.

231
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:58,496
Gave myself away there, didn't l?
Now you know my name. Can't be helped.

232
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,199
Besides, l have a funny feeling,
believe me, it's rare in my profession...

233
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,537
that you're completely trustworthy.

234
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,808
Just one more tiny favor:

235
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,252
Like an idiot, l forgot to wear gloves.
l may have left fingerprints.

236
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,913
Be an angel. Before you go to bed...

237
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:22,323
give the frame of the painting
a little wipe with a clean cloth, okay?

238
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,727
Certainly. Anything else?

239
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:29,363
You wouldn't like a forged passport
or some counterfeit money or....

240
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:34,971
You're mad, utterly mad.
l suppose you want to kiss me good night.

241
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,541
l don't usually,
not on the first acquaintance...

242
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,907
but you've been such a good sport.

243
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,197
38, rue Parmentier. Drive carefully.

244
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,100
Get a good night's sleep.

245
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:07,561
Nicole, my darling,
what a pity you missed the opening.

246
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,830
Our Cellini Venus
was a tremendous success.

247
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:12,801
You should have seen the crowds.

248
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,462
- Thousands of them.
- l want to....

249
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,598
Photographers from all nationalities...

250
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:20,008
with our Cellini Venus
the center of the whole attraction.

251
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,138
Papa, l caught a burglar.

252
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,476
Of course you did.

253
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,848
But you must promise me
to go there and see for yourself.

254
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,514
A burglar?

255
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,487
What? Here in this house?

256
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:36,458
Good Lord.

257
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:41,795
Here, take a sip of this
and just tell me all about it.

258
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:46,369
lt was pitch dark and there he was.

259
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:51,869
Tall, blue eyes, slim, quite good-looking...

260
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,741
in a brutal, mean way.
Papa, a terrible man.

261
00:28:56,915 --> 00:29:01,181
Arrogant, ruthless,
no sense of guilt or shame...

262
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,585
or anything.

263
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:07,589
So you discussed all that, did you?

264
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,887
That was later,
when l was driving him home.

265
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:18,224
l had to, Papa, l shot him in the arm
with your old pistol...

266
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,964
but it was an accident, l think....

267
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,540
My darling...

268
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,747
supposing you start all over again
and tell me what happened in detail.

269
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,579
l caught him in the act of stealing.

270
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:34,979
l kept him back with the pistol...

271
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,284
and l was telephoning the police
when l saw what he was stealing.

272
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,325
- The van Gogh, your van Gogh.
- What?

273
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:43,519
And l didn't know what to do.

274
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:46,529
l was afraid if he was arrested
it might mean publicity.

275
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:50,123
Of course. A police investigation,
that might have been very awkward.

276
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,602
- That's what l thought. So l let him go.
- Good!

277
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:56,869
- l did the right thing, didn't l?
- Of course. Maybe he was a first offender.

278
00:29:56,975 --> 00:30:01,036
lf you'd have seen how he was carrying on
when l was dressing his wound.

279
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:06,876
He might have got an infection.
The whole thing was too awful, Papa.

280
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,051
Good night, Papa.

281
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:10,982
Good night, my darling.

282
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,884
Have a good sleep.

283
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:51,386
This tall, good-looking ruffian
with blue eyes...

284
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:55,559
he didn't molest you in any way, did he?

285
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,769
Not much.

286
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:08,866
Sorry.

287
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,039
Good morning.

288
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,940
We meet only under
the most artistic circumstances.

289
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,613
Beautiful!

290
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:20,749
You wouldn't dare.

291
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,679
Fear nothing, l'm off duty.

292
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,022
Miss Bonnet. A pleasure to have you here.

293
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,823
Mr. Grammont,
the Director of the Museum, and....

294
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:35,994
- Delighted.
- How do you do, sir.

295
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:38,661
We are old friends.
We used to shoot together.

296
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,304
Wonderful exhibition.
So many beautiful things.

297
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,268
- And so valuable!
- Yes.

298
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:47,868
And observe, please,
the security precautions...

299
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:50,004
protecting your great sculpture.

300
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:53,480
- Are you interested in art, Mr. Dermott?
- lndeed l am.

301
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:57,677
- And in security.
- Splendid. Let me show you, please.

302
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:03,852
Excuse me.
You see those tiny blue beams.

303
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,189
They are infrared circuits.

304
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:09,096
- l have to go.
- Go on. l find it fascinating.

305
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,293
Be careful.

306
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:14,771
Because those beams create
a circuit around the Venus...

307
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:17,933
and anything that breaks the circuit,
instant alarm!

308
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:19,738
Bravo! Thank you--

309
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:22,336
lt's the Electric Eye Detection
and Alarm System.

310
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,347
We call it the E.D.A.S.

311
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:25,643
- Very clever.
- Nice.

312
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,645
l know the question you're going to ask:

313
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,617
''What if a burglar got to it
and turned off the alarm?''

314
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,658
No. The thought never entered my mind.

315
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,158
Funny, l was going to ask that very thing.

316
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:39,822
Good question. The answer is, he cannot.

317
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,728
You see, it operates like the door
to a vault, and only two trusted guards...

318
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:45,996
and myself of course,
know the combination.

319
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,039
- Let me show you--
- l have an appointment.

320
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:50,505
- Goodbye.
- l can spare a few minutes.

321
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:54,170
- You're coming with me. Aren't you?
- All right. lf you insist. Bye-bye.

322
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,076
Now go away or l'll call a policeman.

323
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:01,714
Yours is a capricious nature.

324
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,517
Do you always blow hot
and cold like this? Say!

325
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:09,026
Listen. l have something
very important to say to you.

326
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,391
Now don't go away.

327
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,141
Well, finally!

328
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:28,701
l waited at the Ritz for you last night.
l thought you'd been caught.

329
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,077
- No.
- What happened?

330
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:32,912
l'm only a part-time burglar,
and it's hard work.

331
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:34,713
Did you find the van Gogh?

332
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,913
- Easily.
- And?

333
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,454
lt disturbs you, doesn't it?

334
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,322
Not a bit.

335
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,260
lt's a great van Gogh.

336
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:50,593
Of course it is, but who painted it?

337
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:54,794
My dear Bernard, Bonnet has
a Cellini sculpture on exhibition...

338
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:58,934
right now which is worth $1,000,000.
He doesn't need to forge paintings.

339
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:02,609
- Unless you think that's a forgery too.
- No, not that!

340
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,810
For one thing, it was first exhibited in 1910
when Bonnet was eight years old.

341
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:11,115
Besides, Bonnet never studied sculpture.
But he did study painting.

342
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,748
lf he has $1,000,000 lying around loose...

343
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,487
why does he forge paintings?
What's his motive?

344
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:20,531
Ego, vanity,
hoodwinking the whole world...

345
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,566
and having a wonderful time doing it.

346
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,534
Simon, imagine Bonnet
as a young painter.

347
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,900
Like many others he copies
the masters to learn their secrets.

348
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,201
lt is his hobby.

349
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,505
But over the years,
it becomes an obsession.

350
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:37,241
He learned every nuance of light,
of color, of shade, of form.

351
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,574
He identifies with them completely.

352
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:42,285
When he paints a van Gogh,
he is van Gogh.

353
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:46,949
He's Lautrec, Cézanne, he's any painter
he chooses to be, and that is his motive...

354
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,223
and also his profit.

355
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:53,753
- What about Bonnet's daughter?
- Nicole? What about her?

356
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:57,066
- Do you think she's in it with him?
- ln what?

357
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:59,433
According to you, there is nothing.

358
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,265
- That's right.
- You're wrong. And you'll see.

359
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:04,973
Come in.

360
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,479
- Hello, Papa.
- Good evening, my dear.

361
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,515
Marcel tells me you're dining out.

362
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:14,274
With an American tycoon l met today.

363
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,950
- He makes computers.
- What?

364
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,987
Well, that might be the basis
of an enduring friendship.

365
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,688
And there he is.
Right on the executive button.

366
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,058
An enormous Cadillac.
Does that sound right?

367
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,995
- What's his name?
- Davis Leland.

368
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,139
- Are you sure?
- Do you know him?

369
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:38,334
No, but l'd very much like to meet him.

370
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:42,412
Yes, he is one of the most open-handed
art collectors in the whole of America.

371
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,175
l'll go and keep him company.

372
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,346
He didn't say a word about a collection.

373
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:49,511
Didn't he tell you that
he's got the great Toulouse-Lautrec...

374
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:51,248
from the Bonnet collection?

375
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:55,249
Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec?

376
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,728
Mine, naturally.

377
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,386
Oh, no.

378
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:03,124
Are you implying that my Lautrec
is in any way inferior?

379
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,767
Listen, Papa.

380
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:07,929
He mentioned your name
as though it were only vaguely familiar.

381
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,769
Not only didn't he mention anything
about a collection...

382
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,139
he said he didn't like art at all.

383
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:15,605
He suspects something.

384
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:18,906
He must have arranged to meet me.

385
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:21,585
l find that rather intriguing.

386
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:24,414
l'll go and meet him.

387
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:44,774
A lovely dinner. Marvelous wine.
How did you know how to choose it?

388
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,538
l own a vineyard.

389
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,843
Well, what fun!

390
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:53,179
- lt's a subsidiary of Eastern Coal and Coke.
- Eastern Coal and Coke?

391
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:56,345
That's a subsidiary
of Western Wool and Flax.

392
00:37:56,421 --> 00:38:00,050
Fascinating. What's your growth factor?

393
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,926
Say! You're marvelous. You're wonderful.

394
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:07,054
You know, usually l have trouble
talking with girls...

395
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:10,965
but with you, it's as though
you were a member of the Board.

396
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,104
That's very nice of you, Mr. Leland.

397
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:20,005
But l wish l didn't have this feeling that
there's a subject you're trying to avoid.

398
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,281
There is something, isn't there?

399
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,747
Yes. l hate to say this.

400
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,749
But you see, it has to do with your father...

401
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,256
and the Bonnet collection.

402
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:40,458
Yes. You see....
Damn it, this is hard for me to say.

403
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,657
- Mr. Davis Leland?
- Yes.

404
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,995
Long-distance call, Mr. Leland.
United States. California.

405
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,398
How the devil did they track me
down here?

406
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,702
Please excuse me. l'll cut it short.

407
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,298
- Oh, no!
- Not a very cordial greeting.

408
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:21,065
l went to considerable trouble to arrange
these few precious moments alone.

409
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:24,631
- Leave the table.
- lt's National Crime Prevention Week.

410
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,609
- Take a Burglar to Dinner.
- My escort has a very ugly temper.

411
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:31,147
Now go and call off
that fake telephone call.

412
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:32,739
There's something l must tell you.

413
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,615
- How l'd like to take another shot at you!
- lt's important!

414
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,814
<i>Quittez pas! What is that?</i>

415
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,955
<i>l'm going to quittez pas right now.</i>

416
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:44,654
Either you leave this table
or l start screaming.

417
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:46,560
- Yes, l'll go.
- Choose!

418
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:48,564
Just tell me where and when we can meet.

419
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,395
Choose! And make it fast!

420
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:58,104
Remember, Simon Dermott.
Room 136, the Ritz. lt's urgent.

421
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:05,407
The Ritz!

422
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:12,552
Now, where were we?

423
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,955
With my father and his collection.

424
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:16,552
Oh, yes.

425
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:20,286
l hate to have
to tell you this, Miss Bonnet.

426
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,892
- l arranged our meeting.
- Why?

427
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:28,598
lt's this ridiculous obsession.
lt devours me.

428
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:32,338
From the minute l first laid eyes on it,
l was lost, helpless...

429
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:35,674
completely caught up
in this awful compulsion.

430
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:39,481
Laid eyes on what?

431
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:43,313
The Cellini Venus, of course.
l saw it last night. lt haunted me.

432
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:46,516
l can't think of anything else.
l haven't slept a wink all night.

433
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,082
Today, when l learned
your father wouldn't sell it...

434
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:50,990
l started pulling strings to meet you...

435
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:54,190
hoping somehow to use you
to get the Venus.

436
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,899
Well, that's it.

437
00:40:57,402 --> 00:41:01,202
- You poor, dear man!
- No!

438
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:02,603
Don't spare my feelings.

439
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:05,835
l'm sorry you fell in love with the Venus.
She's not for sale.

440
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,539
Believe me, if she were mine,
she'd be on your doorstep in the morning.

441
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,108
That's your consolation prize.

442
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,642
- Well, you kissed me!
- Yes.

443
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,219
And that's for emphasis.

444
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:26,057
- Shall we dance?
- Oh, yes!

445
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:32,626
Good morning, my dear.

446
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,467
- l'll call Marcel.
- No, thank you, Papa. l'm late.

447
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:39,871
l just have to tell you about Davis Leland.

448
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,376
Everything's fine.

449
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,374
As far as Davis Leland is concerned,
you can go on faking masterpieces...

450
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,713
as long as you can hold a brush.

451
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,152
He cooked up a big plot to meet me
just to get to you through me...

452
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,349
hoping that way he'd get the Cellini.

453
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:57,119
Really? American millionaires
must be all quite mad.

454
00:41:57,562 --> 00:42:00,998
Perhaps it's something they put
in the ink when they print the money.

455
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,493
A gentleman to see you, sir.

456
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:07,035
On behalf of the director
of the Kléber-Lafayette Museum, sir.

457
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:09,963
So early? Show him in, Marcel.

458
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:13,433
Must be a very enterprising young fellow.

459
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:23,315
Good morning, sir.
l'm sorry to disturb you.

460
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:28,484
Just a technicality on the insurance
of your loan of one statue:

461
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:33,462
''twenty-nine inches,
in marble, entitled Venus, by...

462
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:36,159
''Benvenuto Cellini.''

463
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:39,327
lnsurance, on that?

464
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:44,368
- lt's never been insured. lt's beyond price!
- Yes. We were aware of that, sir.

465
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:48,172
So special cover was taken over
for its transportation and exhibition.

466
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:51,107
But by an unfortunate error, sir...

467
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:54,413
your signature was not obtained
on the document.

468
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:58,385
There is, of course,
no expense to yourself, sir.

469
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:03,490
A mere formality,
for once you've signed this document...

470
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:09,391
the work of art is covered until
it's returned to this house in good order.

471
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:14,365
l just have to sign? And then it's....

472
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:17,099
lnsured for $1,000,000 against all risks...

473
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:21,508
including flood, earthquake, thunderbolt,
falling aircraft, loot, sack, pillage...

474
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,413
military or civil commotion,
fire, structural collapse of buildings...

475
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:28,246
and, of course, larceny or theft.

476
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:35,624
Thank you, sir.

477
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:41,129
By the way, sir,
would you like to be present...

478
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,967
at the technical examination?

479
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,901
Technical examination?

480
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:53,337
Yes, they always require it
and you, of course, have just authorized it.

481
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,240
A mere formality.

482
00:43:55,646 --> 00:44:00,481
l believe they have a Prof. Bauer
flying in from Zurich on Friday.

483
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:04,053
Well, thank you, sir. And good day.

484
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:07,016
Wait.

485
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,210
Papa, this Prof. Bauer....

486
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:32,880
Does he know all the tests?

487
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:34,679
He invented them.

488
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:40,717
- lt's not as if we're trying to sell it.
- My dear, at the first breath of suspicion...

489
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:44,124
the entire myth
of the Bonnet collection explodes.

490
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:48,554
Everything l've done will be examined
and re-examined with X-rays...

491
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,295
fluoroscopes, microscopes,
shadowgraphs...

492
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:54,127
smelly chemicals and all sorts of....

493
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,301
We live in a crass, commercial world,
with no faith or trust.

494
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:18,220
We must keep Prof. Bauer
from examining the Venus.

495
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:20,889
But how? l've just given my permission.

496
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,430
l've not only put my head
into the guillotine...

497
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:27,597
l've unloosened my collar and tie
so that they can chop it off.

498
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,630
At least l can keep you out of this.
Leave Paris.

499
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:34,404
l want you to go to America.
No, go to the Orient or somewhere.

500
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:37,242
Please, it will be easier for me,
l promise you.

501
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:39,646
l'm not going to leave you and that's final.

502
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,081
- Sir?
- Yes?

503
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:44,087
<i>- A señor Paravideo to see you, sir.
- Who?</i>

504
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,487
A South American gentleman,
l believe, sir.

505
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,622
Of an excitable nature.

506
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:51,159
- Who's he?
- l don't know.

507
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:53,594
Oh, my God!

508
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:57,293
<i>Mademoiselle, monsieur. l must....</i>

509
00:45:57,702 --> 00:45:59,067
Here it is!

510
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:03,701
Just as you said...

511
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,306
only greater by far!

512
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:11,141
l must apologize. l had an urgent call.
A revolution in my country.

513
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:14,580
Also, some of my mines are flooded.
l must go back soon.

514
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:20,152
l couldn't bear to leave Paris
without consulting you about this.

515
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,395
<i>- Señor, it is not for sale.
- But you said you might.... You said you....</i>

516
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:29,295
lt is not for sale!

517
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,597
- Goodbye.
- l can see the hand of a master!

518
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:36,265
<i>Goodbye. Adiós.</i>

519
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:41,601
Preposterous little man!

520
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,907
l met him at the auction
when my Cézanne...

521
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,245
fetched such a stunning price.

522
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:51,084
Why not? lt was worth a stunning price.
Even more!

523
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:55,452
This will not be a scandal, but a triumph!
Let the experts come pouring in!

524
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,119
Let them bring their X-rays,
their microscopes...

525
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,289
even their nuclear weapons if they like.

526
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:07,030
Remember what happened
with van Meegeren...

527
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:10,301
and all those forged Vermeers?
He drove the experts crazy.

528
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:13,537
He won every round, fought them,
and then emerged the victor.

529
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:17,842
He finally painted one last Vermeer
and even that was a triumph.

530
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,644
The guards marveled at the brilliance
of his brushwork.

531
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:23,209
Even his fellow inmates
couldn't believe their eyes.

532
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,118
And the governor of the prison, he....

533
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,939
What's the number of the Hotel Ritz?

534
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,578
Opera 2830.

535
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,532
Good evening.

536
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:32,043
l didn't recognize you.
You look, somehow, different.

537
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,689
- Scotch.
- Likewise.

538
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:45,895
l was surprised to hear from you.
Surprised and pleased, Miss--

539
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,959
Please, no names.

540
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,496
lf it's all that private,
l've got a bottle in my room upstairs.

541
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:56,399
This is a business meeting.

542
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:02,077
l find l have need of someone
with your talents and experience--

543
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:04,442
Please, no names!

544
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:09,185
You interested in a big-time caper?

545
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,451
- A what?
- A heist.

546
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,380
You mean a burglary.

547
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:27,928
What's the score, baby?

548
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,630
Won't be easy.

549
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:34,609
That's okay. What's the job? l'm in.

550
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:38,344
- The Kléber-Lafayette Museum.
- l'm out!

551
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,314
Why that particular spot?

552
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:46,719
The Cellini Venus.

553
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:49,821
Your Cellini Venus?

554
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:53,194
Well, it's not mine exactly.
lt's sort of in the family.

555
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:55,731
Anyway, that should be
no concern of yours.

556
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,532
You want to steal it?

557
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,396
Why?

558
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:04,567
ls it a publicity stunt?

559
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:08,608
Lord, no! lt's very valuable.
lt's worth $1,000,000!

560
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:12,113
l know. There are also
1,000,000 policemen prowling around it.

561
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:16,243
That's about a dollar a policeman.
l don't like the rate of exchange.

562
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:19,386
- You mean you won't do it?
- No.

563
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,382
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

564
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:23,824
l'm sorry.

565
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:26,328
Thank you for thinking of me.

566
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,256
Look, finish your drink.

567
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,563
l have to go.

568
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:33,626
Are you really serious?

569
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,834
You've seen the way
your statue is protected.

570
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,771
The Electric Eye, the guards....

571
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:42,141
Well, l was hoping to leave
those details to you.

572
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:46,840
l'll sleep on it and....

573
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,014
lt's too late, the museum's closed.

574
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,110
We'll look over the premises
in the morning.

575
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:54,180
What we call in the trade
''casing the joint.''

576
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:58,894
Thank you very much.

577
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:03,057
Look, it's early.
Why don't l show you the real Paris.

578
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,396
That's very kind of you.

579
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:07,660
l live here. l was born in Paris.

580
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:10,901
l forgot. Why don't you
show me the real Paris?

581
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:15,042
- l only have two inches left of this bench.
- l'm terribly sorry.

582
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,612
Where and what time tomorrow?

583
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,081
l find that the most successful jobs
of this kind are planned...

584
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:27,749
when everyone is relaxed. So let's meet
and have a nice, long, cozy lunch.

585
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:32,894
Corner of avenue Gabriel,
avenue Marigny, 10:00 a.m.

586
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:34,430
- Right?
- Right.

587
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,927
ls it those police that worry you so?

588
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:06,462
Yes. And these.

589
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:11,358
But that's the Ministry of the lnterior.
lt's always guarded.

590
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,630
What about them?

591
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,737
They don't have anything to do with us.
They're guarding government buildings.

592
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:23,836
That's where the President lives.

593
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:25,812
l know.

594
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:31,181
And the museum
you want to stick up is right here.

595
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:32,986
Very handy!

596
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:36,048
l can practically taste
the bread and water!

597
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:31,211
- lt can't be!
- What?

598
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:35,015
Well, for a moment,
l thought l saw a resemblance.

599
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,843
Resemblance to what?

600
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:39,655
You and....

601
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:43,549
That's silly! She's at least 400 years old.

602
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:45,319
l know, but....

603
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,328
Sorry.

604
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:55,729
Where exactly were you
in the early part of the 16th century?

605
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,002
l don't know,
but that's not how l was dressed.

606
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:15,877
Who's in charge here?

607
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:18,470
Sir! At your service!

608
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:22,382
Dubois, Assistant Deputy Chairman,
Commissioner of Tourism.

609
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,447
lsn't this place cleaned regularly?

610
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:28,821
Look at this sleeve,
just from brushing against the woodwork.

611
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:31,827
l'm sorry, but we have
a complete staff of cleaning women.

612
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:33,226
Once a month, l suppose.

613
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:36,060
No, sir, every night,
from midnight until 4:00 a.m.

614
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:41,328
See they do their jobs properly,
or l'll make a report.

615
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:42,770
Yes, sir.

616
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:45,265
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

617
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:47,700
Sir!

618
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,543
- This way.
- Really?

619
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:31,750
Don't you think it's being a bit pushy,
starting with a million-dollar robbery?

620
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:34,484
l mean, we've got to walk
before we can run, you know.

621
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:36,855
l know a little gallery
we could knock over...

622
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,622
just to get our feet wet
so to speak and then...

623
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:43,792
gathering confidence as we go,
we could move into the big time.

624
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:48,137
- No good?
- No good at all.

625
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,064
Next question.

626
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,402
Why must it be this particular work of art?

627
00:58:57,013 --> 00:59:00,915
Well, you don't think l'd steal something
that didn't belong to me, do you?

628
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,947
Excuse me, l spoke without thinking.

629
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,456
Why not wait until you get it back home
and steal it then?

630
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:14,562
No muss, no fuss, a nice, clean inside job.

631
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:18,530
- l'll be delighted to offer my services.
- This is not a prank or a whim.

632
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:20,797
lt's something l must do...

633
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:23,603
- because l must do it.
- l see.

634
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:37,684
We must look at the facts impartially.

635
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:40,689
We can't get past the alarm. That's out.

636
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:43,017
We can't tamper with it. That's out.

637
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,617
- We can't turn it off.
- That's out.

638
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:48,327
You're some burglar, you are.

639
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:04,006
This is how you normally work,
by the mile?

640
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:08,182
l'm thinking.
Look at my forehead, all wrinkled.

641
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:11,713
What we need
is at precisely the right moment...

642
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,914
some trusted member
of the museum staff...

643
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:16,219
has to obligingly switch off
the alarm system.

644
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:18,851
- Couldn't we bribe someone?
- Excellent idea!

645
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:20,487
- No.
- Why not?

646
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:25,192
Because l don't know
which guard knows how to do it.

647
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:28,062
Do you want to see it again?
All right. Here we go.

648
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:31,902
lt always circles around and comes back.
Just like that.

649
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:35,171
Not now, please!

650
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:38,779
There you are, sonny. lt's all ready.
Thank you very much.

651
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:42,613
- You, sir. How many do you want?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. l was here first.

652
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,519
Excuse me, sir. Ever seen the boomerang?
Two? Blue or red?

653
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:51,186
Don't forget what l told the children.
Don't forget to throw it at the right angle.

654
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,922
That's the idea.

655
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:01,863
Great fun! Try it.

656
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,068
lf you'll tell me
what you're doing and why...

657
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:10,807
l'll buy you a cowboy suit
and a set of trains.

658
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:15,612
l want you to take a long last look
at the blue sky, the green grass...

659
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:18,654
the trees and the river,
all of which l loathe personally...

660
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:21,485
which is why a juicy stretch
in a cozy French prison...

661
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,650
doesn't bother me at all.

662
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:27,119
You think you have a scheme
that might work?

663
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:34,126
You really are the smuggest
and most hateful man.

664
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:37,970
lf you frequent criminal circles,
you can't be choosey.

665
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:44,205
How do you like
being a gangster's moll, baby?

666
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:47,840
Now where are we going?

667
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:50,042
My apartment.

668
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,589
l'd like to remind you, Mr. Dermott,
ours is a business relationship.

669
01:01:56,693 --> 01:02:00,595
l am aware of that. l'm also aware
of the social gulf between us.

670
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:04,030
You are an aristocrat,
and l am a humble burglar.

671
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,078
Right. There's the bathroom.
Take off your clothes.

672
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:27,782
Are we planning the same sort of crime?

673
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,018
You are quite safe.
lt's dress-rehearsal time.

674
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:33,323
That's why we bought
all this lovely junk. Come on.

675
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:36,523
lf it's a necessary part of the plan....

676
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:38,025
Are you sure?

677
01:02:38,134 --> 01:02:41,331
Chatter, chatter, chatter.
Do as you're told!

678
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,657
That's nice.

679
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:45,497
Yes, that's really nice.

680
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:49,037
lt just needs one more little touch.

681
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:56,205
Now turn around for me, would you?
Go on.

682
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:59,713
Yes, that's fine. That does it.

683
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:01,613
Does what?

684
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:05,313
For one thing,
it gives Givenchy a night off. Now....

685
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,216
Down!

686
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:19,658
Scrub the floor.

687
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:21,934
Crime doesn't pay, does it.

688
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:25,902
Elbow grease! Scrub! And don't sulk.

689
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:29,339
At 1 1 :57 p.m.,
all hell will break loose in the museum.

690
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:32,108
And at midnight,
the scrubwomen come trooping in.

691
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,877
And whatever happens,
hang onto your bucket.

692
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:38,384
You do have a plan, don't you?

693
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:41,651
Of course l have. Now listen very carefully.

694
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:45,059
My plan is, on the night of the crime...

695
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:48,757
my plan and l will be curled up
in that bed with a good book.

696
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:56,064
- Why?
- You asked me why? l ask you why.

697
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:58,573
Why are we breaking
into a heavily guarded museum...

698
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,439
to steal a precious statue
which belongs to you?

699
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,878
But l told you why l couldn't tell you why.

700
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:08,377
Not good enough.

701
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,985
You're perfectly right.
ln your place, l'd feel the same way.

702
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:16,184
l'm in this awful trouble.

703
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,193
But it's nothing to do with you.

704
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:21,560
l just can't explain so l'm stuck.

705
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:24,198
l'll get out of these clothes.

706
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,565
- Don't you dare cry!
- l have something in my eye.

707
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,696
There's nothing wrong with it.
You're crying to soften me up.

708
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:33,901
- lt's not true.
- lt won't work! l'm too tough.

709
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:36,945
l know. l'm going.

710
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,378
Hurry up!

711
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,444
Go on. Hurry up!

712
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,755
And meet me at the museum
at 5:30 p.m., sharp.

713
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:01,628
And don't ask me why,
or l'll hit you with a bucket!

714
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:05,900
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!

715
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:20,886
l won't be in for dinner, Marcel,
and l may be out quite late, in fact.

716
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:22,821
lf anybody calls, anyone at all...

717
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:25,258
you don't know where l am,
or how to reach me.

718
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:27,090
<i>Yes, mademoiselle.</i>

719
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:36,761
Good afternoon.

720
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,372
Just tell Miss Bonnet
that l'm here, please?

721
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:41,967
l'm sorry, sir. Miss Bonnet has gone out.

722
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:45,137
Out? Are you sure?
Her car is in the courtyard.

723
01:06:45,248 --> 01:06:47,739
Quite sure, sir. She took a taxi.

724
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,250
Well, l'll wait.

725
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,467
Why, hello....

726
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:07,932
What a nice surprise!

727
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:11,430
l did go out. l forgot something,
so l came in again.

728
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:12,974
The servants' entrance.

729
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:16,375
l'm rushing out again.
Thank you. l'll let Mr. Leland out.

730
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:19,546
No. l'm all rehearsed, made up,
and ready to go on.

731
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:21,446
Luckily it's only a short speech.

732
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:24,543
l must fly. l have a business appointment.
l can't be late--

733
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:27,817
Business! That's all you French girls
ever think about.

734
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:30,992
- Well, a minute, a second, really.
- You're in a rush.

735
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,927
You want action?
Fine! That's my mood, too.

736
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:35,930
Here. Catch.

737
01:07:40,003 --> 01:07:42,403
- Oh, Davis!
- Please, no speeches.

738
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:43,997
But why?

739
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:47,167
Why? That's the silliest question
l ever heard of.

740
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,537
lt's wild. We don't even know each other.

741
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:52,775
- Please come back tomorrow?
- No. Made up my mind. Man of action!

742
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,476
Snap judgment.
l bought a fleet of tankers that way.

743
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:59,214
- One of the best deals l ever made.
- But l'm not a fleet of tankers.

744
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:01,620
l'm not getting engaged
to a man l barely know.

745
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:05,490
<i>You'll get to know me. Look me up
in Who's Who, Dun & Bradstreet...</i>

746
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:07,927
There. That's it. lt's a deal?

747
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:10,926
Yes. But, no! l'm a little dizzy.

748
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,403
And this thing is just blinding me!
l really have to run.

749
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:16,802
- No. Relax.
- l do.

750
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:20,273
l've never been engaged
to such a fidgety girl in all my life.

751
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:22,367
The kiss.

752
01:08:44,302 --> 01:08:47,362
- Where have you been?
- l was getting engaged.

753
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:49,804
Come on.

754
01:08:49,975 --> 01:08:52,705
This fellow came when l was leaving.
He wants to marry me.

755
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:55,645
l didn't want to keep you waiting,
so l got engaged to him.

756
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:58,206
- ls it all right? Am l on time?
- Fine.

757
01:08:58,318 --> 01:09:00,184
ln fact, we have 10 more minutes.

758
01:09:00,254 --> 01:09:03,383
- lf you'd like to go back and marry him....
- Come on.

759
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:14,729
Would you check your parcel, please?

760
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:48,507
Thank you.

761
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,271
Just checking on the accommodations.

762
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:36,295
Don't start that. Not again.

763
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,301
l could swear that....

764
01:10:45,778 --> 01:10:48,441
Well, we have a few moments
for cultural improvement.

765
01:10:50,684 --> 01:10:52,413
How do we get past the alarm?

766
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:54,512
Like this gentlemen here...

767
01:10:54,623 --> 01:10:57,957
l'm depending on normal human reactions.

768
01:10:59,194 --> 01:11:00,662
Blue period?

769
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,799
Regard the subtle harmony of color.

770
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:10,204
Now, the nice thing about
complicated mechanical devices is...

771
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:13,241
if they do suddenly go haywire....

772
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,144
Yes. What's after haywire?

773
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:20,080
Well, the people in charge
have a tendency to panic...

774
01:11:20,185 --> 01:11:25,123
and to run around in confused circles,
and at that moment we strike.

775
01:11:26,293 --> 01:11:28,194
A superb Rembrandt.

776
01:11:30,131 --> 01:11:33,225
Now, this is, to coin a phrase,
the point of no return.

777
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:36,893
ln precisely one minute,
the closing bell will ring.

778
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:42,068
We can leave with the others
and have a quiet dinner, or we stay.

779
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:44,707
Then we're committed
to go through with it.

780
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:47,273
Do you really want it...

781
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:49,279
that much?

782
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:51,316
More!

783
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:01,361
Okay. You're the boss.
Just do as l tell you.

784
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,584
Stand by for the countdown.

785
01:12:22,526 --> 01:12:26,087
Six, five, four...

786
01:12:26,832 --> 01:12:30,199
three, two, one....

787
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:33,697
Now!

788
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:21,026
Watch for normal human reactions.

789
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:43,486
Comfy?

790
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:49,193
l hadn't counted on there being
quite so much togetherness.

791
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:53,261
lt's the height of the tourist season.
Everything was booked.

792
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:55,169
This was the best l could do.

793
01:16:00,584 --> 01:16:03,450
He locked the door. He's locked us in.

794
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:07,422
lt's challenging, l admit,
but doesn't that make it more interesting?

795
01:16:10,295 --> 01:16:13,389
- l'm going to faint.
- Don't. There's no room.

796
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:52,907
All right, boys.

797
01:16:57,984 --> 01:17:00,011
Didn't you hear me?

798
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,652
8:01 on the nose.

799
01:18:58,126 --> 01:19:00,459
Now we have a fix
on when they make their rounds.

800
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:02,326
Exactly every hour.

801
01:19:04,768 --> 01:19:08,067
We're still locked in.
How about that, mastermind?

802
01:20:20,558 --> 01:20:21,957
Hold that.

803
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:34,076
Brilliant!

804
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:47,215
- lt doesn't open from the inside.
- Blast!

805
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:51,997
However, by a strange coincidence...

806
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,159
l just happen to have....

807
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:51,000
Now.

808
01:23:55,678 --> 01:23:57,077
Marvelous.

809
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,571
No applause, please.

810
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:02,443
Wait till you see what l do for an encore.

811
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:08,860
What are you doing?

812
01:25:09,668 --> 01:25:12,968
Give it to me. Here.

813
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:23,709
Put those on. Get cracking.

814
01:25:40,338 --> 01:25:41,430
Turn around.

815
01:25:42,608 --> 01:25:43,869
What for?

816
01:25:46,177 --> 01:25:48,669
They go on over the clothes.

817
01:25:56,624 --> 01:25:58,319
There. Thank you.

818
01:26:08,671 --> 01:26:11,072
Congratulations! You look terrible.

819
01:26:11,274 --> 01:26:13,402
Can we steal that statue soon?

820
01:26:13,511 --> 01:26:17,242
- l hate to complain but really--
- Have patience. We will.

821
01:26:18,016 --> 01:26:20,382
When? And how?

822
01:26:21,086 --> 01:26:23,715
Now look, if you were a guard...

823
01:26:24,357 --> 01:26:27,793
and had to sit night after night
guarding junk you couldn't afford...

824
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:30,386
and didn't particularly like,
how would you feel?

825
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:31,863
lrritable.

826
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:40,065
Oh, no!

827
01:26:40,975 --> 01:26:44,241
- lt's psychological warfare.
- With that?

828
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:48,544
Turn on the lights. Follow me!

829
01:27:51,025 --> 01:27:52,891
''Ring out, wild bells! ''

830
01:28:01,538 --> 01:28:05,168
Look around! You spread out!
Come with me.

831
01:29:29,242 --> 01:29:31,141
Everything is in order.

832
01:29:31,477 --> 01:29:34,915
- Nothing is missing.
- l checked. lt isn't a short circuit.

833
01:29:35,249 --> 01:29:36,477
Scientists!

834
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:41,147
A burglar alarm
especially designed to give me heartburn.

835
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,428
- Sorry, sir.
- Thank you.

836
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:08,376
Kléber-Lafayette Museum.
Senior Guard speaking.

837
01:30:11,358 --> 01:30:14,760
l regret very much if the Minister
and the Madam Minister...

838
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:16,727
have been disturbed.

839
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,728
Yes, l know it's a very loud alarm.

840
01:30:21,737 --> 01:30:23,432
We don't know why it went off.

841
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:26,373
We checked everything,
and so did the police. But....

842
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:29,907
No, sir, nothing is missing,
and the alarms are set again.

843
01:30:31,548 --> 01:30:33,346
l'm sorry, sir. Good night, sir.

844
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:36,020
The Prefecture of Police.

845
01:30:36,087 --> 01:30:39,285
The alarm bells woke up
the Minister of the lnterior.

846
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:40,783
Good!

847
01:30:56,412 --> 01:30:57,845
l'm so scared.

848
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,242
My heart's thumping.

849
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:02,144
l just feel terrible.

850
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:06,250
l'd send for a doctor but
l honestly don't think he'd fit in the closet.

851
01:31:06,323 --> 01:31:10,784
l'm so scared for you, too.
l had no right to involve you in this.

852
01:31:11,129 --> 01:31:13,063
And if you want to call it off, l....

853
01:31:13,164 --> 01:31:17,124
Well, that's a kind thought
and l appreciate it, but then....

854
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,135
What about Prof. Bauer?

855
01:31:22,575 --> 01:31:26,637
What happens tomorrow when he turns up
to test your million-dollar baby?

856
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,252
lt's a fake, isn't it?

857
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:37,118
No long, involved stories
at this time of night.

858
01:31:37,193 --> 01:31:39,525
Just nod your head, yes or no.

859
01:31:47,672 --> 01:31:49,195
Who carved it?

860
01:31:52,678 --> 01:31:56,614
- My grandfather.
- Who posed for it?

861
01:31:58,952 --> 01:32:00,510
My grandmother.

862
01:32:02,857 --> 01:32:07,090
- You're the first to notice a resemblance.
- l'm very sensitive and perceptive.

863
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:11,824
How long have you known about her,
and me, and....

864
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,596
Since you first asked me to steal it.

865
01:32:17,173 --> 01:32:20,199
But then if you knew
the Venus was worthless...

866
01:32:20,344 --> 01:32:21,901
why did you....

867
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,724
That's why.

868
01:32:36,128 --> 01:32:38,062
l'm so stupid.

869
01:32:42,002 --> 01:32:43,994
Explain it to me again.

870
01:33:04,296 --> 01:33:07,959
Funny how roomy
it's suddenly become in here.

871
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,892
We're adjusting to our environment.

872
01:33:12,739 --> 01:33:13,797
What is it?

873
01:33:13,873 --> 01:33:17,469
l'm sorry. lt's my engagement ring.
l forgot about it.

874
01:33:17,744 --> 01:33:19,872
So did l. Congratulations.

875
01:33:20,515 --> 01:33:22,540
May l kiss the bride?

876
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:29,250
For one thing, whose bride am l kissing?

877
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,295
l don't know. Some American.
His name's Leland Davis.

878
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:38,194
Or Davis Leland?

879
01:33:38,269 --> 01:33:40,898
They're lucky fellows, both of them.

880
01:33:43,275 --> 01:33:45,402
Second round coming up.

881
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:47,873
Just marking my place.

882
01:33:49,748 --> 01:33:51,512
Don't go away.

883
01:34:35,103 --> 01:34:37,095
Find him! Look around.

884
01:35:21,957 --> 01:35:26,156
Pretty soon, someone's going to get
awfully tired of this racket.

885
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:31,268
Normal human reaction.

886
01:36:10,216 --> 01:36:13,549
Jacquart speaking, Senior Guard
at the Kléber-Lafayette Museum.

887
01:36:16,422 --> 01:36:18,288
At your service, Excellency!

888
01:36:19,893 --> 01:36:23,421
Yes, sir, l know it makes
a terrible noise, Excellency.

889
01:36:23,498 --> 01:36:25,830
lt was installed for just that purpose.

890
01:36:26,401 --> 01:36:29,461
No, Excellency, l didn't install it.

891
01:36:31,306 --> 01:36:34,241
Yes, sir, l know
it is the second time tonight.

892
01:36:34,744 --> 01:36:38,441
lt will be rectified right away.
Good night, Excellency.

893
01:36:42,153 --> 01:36:44,281
Now guess who we woke up?

894
01:36:48,693 --> 01:36:50,321
Switch off the lights.

895
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:53,590
l'm going to turn it off!

896
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:56,129
Permanently!

897
01:37:11,253 --> 01:37:12,687
lt worked.

898
01:37:13,657 --> 01:37:17,093
What do you know.
They've turned off the A-B....

899
01:37:19,497 --> 01:37:22,558
- lt worked!
- Didn't you expect it to?

900
01:37:25,037 --> 01:37:29,668
- Pull yourself together. You're a genius.
- l know. lt's a funny feeling.

901
01:37:31,277 --> 01:37:36,078
Look, wait until
the moment of maximum confusion...

902
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:40,747
and then start scrubbing like mad
in the direction of the guards' room.

903
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:42,953
- Guards' room?
- That's right.

904
01:37:43,059 --> 01:37:44,616
But the guards!

905
01:37:45,061 --> 01:37:48,657
When they see that the Venus is gone
there will be guards everywhere...

906
01:37:48,764 --> 01:37:50,790
except the guards' room.

907
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,904
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

908
01:38:20,502 --> 01:38:21,901
Come here.

909
01:38:31,515 --> 01:38:32,915
Hang on to your bucket.

910
01:38:41,126 --> 01:38:42,560
Stay here.

911
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,277
You there, Nicole?

912
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:31,143
Get back there.

913
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:46,532
You know, Grandpa was pretty good.

914
01:39:47,605 --> 01:39:49,300
To say nothing of Grandma.

915
01:39:55,147 --> 01:39:58,776
Now, in the chimney with you,
till the scrubwomen come.

916
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,891
Good luck.

917
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:54,944
What a night we've had!

918
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:58,990
One alarm after another.
And telephone calls from everybody.

919
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:01,893
Who do you think called
from across the street?

920
01:42:33,801 --> 01:42:36,929
Don't just stand there gaping.
Get to your post, man!

921
01:42:39,241 --> 01:42:41,505
And don't hesitate when l give an order!

922
01:42:55,527 --> 01:42:57,189
Alarm!

923
01:43:04,605 --> 01:43:06,095
Robbers! Crooks!

924
01:45:01,743 --> 01:45:04,110
Get this silly bottle out of here!

925
01:45:51,902 --> 01:45:54,736
Can you give us a brief history
of the Venus, Mr. Bonnet?

926
01:45:54,805 --> 01:45:56,740
Have the police reported any progress yet?

927
01:45:56,808 --> 01:45:58,400
Did you turn down $1,000,000 for it?

928
01:45:58,476 --> 01:46:00,444
How did you learn about the robbery?

929
01:46:00,546 --> 01:46:03,913
l woke up in the night
with a sudden premonition.

930
01:46:03,982 --> 01:46:05,917
l thought it was something l'd eaten.

931
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:08,476
But Mr. Grammont,
the director of the museum...

932
01:46:08,588 --> 01:46:10,954
he called and l believe
he's on his way here.

933
01:46:11,024 --> 01:46:13,619
Are you offering a reward
for the return of the Venus?

934
01:46:13,694 --> 01:46:16,095
No! What l mean to say is...

935
01:46:16,164 --> 01:46:20,430
that it seems so commercial
to think of money at a time like this.

936
01:46:23,005 --> 01:46:26,805
l just heard the news.
l can't believe my ears or my eyes.

937
01:46:26,876 --> 01:46:29,869
Absolutely fantastic!
To pull off a thing like that!

938
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:32,279
l guarantee that the police
are investigating.

939
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:36,343
The police? Man, where's your spirit?
lf we wait for the police...

940
01:46:36,454 --> 01:46:40,016
the Venus will be out of the country!
We'll never set eyes on it again.

941
01:46:40,192 --> 01:46:44,596
De Solnay, l'm still vitally interested
in the Cellini Venus, hot or cold.

942
01:46:44,697 --> 01:46:46,723
Do you know what l mean by that?

943
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:51,237
Leland! Do you know what you're saying?
You're compounding a felony.

944
01:46:51,672 --> 01:46:55,233
Offering to become
a receiver of stolen goods.

945
01:46:55,444 --> 01:46:57,207
l'm an art lover.

946
01:46:57,746 --> 01:47:02,684
As a public service, l want to make
an independent inquiry to help the police.

947
01:47:02,752 --> 01:47:04,117
ls that a crime?

948
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:06,712
And if you find it,
a step ahead of the police?

949
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,519
You let me worry about that.

950
01:47:08,592 --> 01:47:12,586
- No, l'm an art dealer, not a fence.
- A fence?

951
01:47:13,431 --> 01:47:17,596
l'll do it entirely on my own.
All l need is an opening contact.

952
01:47:17,937 --> 01:47:20,997
- De Solnay? All right.
- Wait!

953
01:47:22,843 --> 01:47:25,403
There happens to be a man in Paris
at the moment...

954
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:27,947
who specializes in matters of fine art.

955
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:32,642
His name is.... No, Leland, please!
Think of what you're trying to do.

956
01:47:32,987 --> 01:47:36,151
- What about Nicole Bonnet?
- l want both. Nicole and the Venus.

957
01:47:36,258 --> 01:47:38,886
Leland, remember?
l sold you your first painting.

958
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:41,657
l made you a collector.
l thought it'd help you relax.

959
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:44,791
lt's great!
l've never been so relaxed in all my life!

960
01:47:44,868 --> 01:47:47,497
- Yes, l can see that.
- All right. The name!

961
01:47:47,572 --> 01:47:50,473
The name is Simon Dermott.
He is staying at the Ritz.

962
01:47:50,542 --> 01:47:53,535
Night Fighter calling Dawn Patrol.

963
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:57,680
<i>Our telephone may be tapped, so we will
conduct this conversation in Swahili.</i>

964
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,910
How are you?

965
01:47:59,919 --> 01:48:01,409
Did you sleep well?

966
01:48:01,522 --> 01:48:04,685
Simon, isn't it too awful?
l slept beautifully!

967
01:48:04,892 --> 01:48:08,522
And l've just eaten an enormous breakfast.
lsn't it ghastly?

968
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:11,056
lt's your tainted blood.

969
01:48:11,933 --> 01:48:13,458
Who? What?

970
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:18,532
She's fine. She's wrapped up in one
of my old shirts, just as snug as can be.

971
01:48:18,609 --> 01:48:20,736
l rocked her to sleep in my arms last night.

972
01:48:20,811 --> 01:48:23,576
lt's the first time
l ever did that with a grandmother.

973
01:48:42,603 --> 01:48:45,129
Simon, do you think
we should be seen together?

974
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:52,309
All right. ln an hour at the Ritz bar.

975
01:48:56,819 --> 01:48:59,221
The Cellini Venus was uninsured.

976
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:01,352
- Uninsured?
- Yes.

977
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:05,225
But l vaguely recollect
signing something for insurance.

978
01:49:06,297 --> 01:49:08,960
But the policy was not yet in force.

979
01:49:09,035 --> 01:49:11,869
Not until the technical examination
had been made.

980
01:49:12,806 --> 01:49:15,206
Yes, the technical examination.

981
01:49:15,275 --> 01:49:18,074
Well, $1,000,000 more, $1,000,000 less.

982
01:49:18,245 --> 01:49:21,340
l believe my father did buy it
at a bargain price.

983
01:49:21,416 --> 01:49:24,181
My dear sir, you are a prince.

984
01:49:25,254 --> 01:49:28,747
l wish l could express properly what l feel.

985
01:49:29,426 --> 01:49:33,226
Prof. Bauer, l dare say,
will be greatly disappointed.

986
01:49:33,797 --> 01:49:36,062
Yes, and l must meet him now.

987
01:49:36,133 --> 01:49:41,071
Give him my regards, and say l'm sorry to
have been unable to see him on this trip.

988
01:49:41,138 --> 01:49:45,600
Now cheer up, my dear fellow.
lt's not the end of the world, you know.

989
01:49:52,953 --> 01:49:54,443
Marcel, champagne!

990
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:00,988
- Where are you?
- l'm here. We're saved!

991
01:50:01,097 --> 01:50:03,929
- lsn't it marvelous?
- My darling!

992
01:50:03,999 --> 01:50:06,992
- Thank heaven for the criminal class.
- l'm so happy.

993
01:50:07,103 --> 01:50:10,939
You don't have to go to jail. l don't have
to go to America. lt's beautiful!

994
01:50:11,007 --> 01:50:13,771
We must celebrate!
Marcel, take it into the library.

995
01:50:13,844 --> 01:50:18,681
We'll have a lunch and again tonight,
fireworks, cocktails, a magnificent dinner!

996
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:22,153
But not right away. l have
a very important appointment at the Ritz.

997
01:50:22,221 --> 01:50:25,350
- But l'll be right back, l promise.
- That's good.

998
01:50:25,558 --> 01:50:27,424
l'll start by myself.

999
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:33,731
The Ritz? Again?

1000
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:53,785
You realize what you're asking
is extremely difficult and dangerous?

1001
01:50:53,892 --> 01:50:57,260
- Yes, l know that, Mr. Dermott.
- Please, no names.

1002
01:50:57,329 --> 01:51:00,788
We may be up against
some very desperate characters.

1003
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:03,993
- Them?
- Those.

1004
01:51:04,771 --> 01:51:07,569
Fortunately, l've a few contacts.
ln fact, this morning...

1005
01:51:07,641 --> 01:51:11,601
l made a few inquiries, you know,
put out a few feelers. Just idle curiosity.

1006
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:14,342
- You've got a lead?
- Too early for anything concrete.

1007
01:51:14,449 --> 01:51:17,351
Let's just say l suspect who was involved.

1008
01:51:17,654 --> 01:51:22,148
ls it, you know, what we're talking about,
is it still in France?

1009
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:27,026
l think so. l think
l can definitely state it's still in France.

1010
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:31,864
You realize you might be paying
a great deal of money...

1011
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:35,406
for something you could never exhibit,
acknowledge, or even display...

1012
01:51:35,508 --> 01:51:38,477
- not even in your house?
- Yes, l know. l want it!

1013
01:51:38,678 --> 01:51:43,673
l just want to take it out of the vault,
all alone, just look at it now and then.

1014
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:47,482
Know that it's mine, that l own it,
that l can touch it.

1015
01:51:49,257 --> 01:51:50,691
One more thing.

1016
01:51:50,759 --> 01:51:54,593
Do you happen to know the owners,
any member of the Bonnet family?

1017
01:51:54,697 --> 01:51:57,292
l've met Bonnet. l know his daughter, too.

1018
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,891
As a matter of fact,
l'm going to see her tonight.

1019
01:52:01,471 --> 01:52:04,703
Drop her! Don't see her.
Don't even telephone her. That's vital!

1020
01:52:04,775 --> 01:52:07,904
Any contact with any member
of the Bonnet family would be fatal.

1021
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:11,575
- The criminals would suspect a trap.
- But we're engaged.

1022
01:52:13,285 --> 01:52:18,280
You know, you're a lucky fellow.
From what l hear, she's an enchanting girl.

1023
01:52:18,759 --> 01:52:21,819
What the hell! The world's full of statues.
Forget the Venus.

1024
01:52:21,929 --> 01:52:23,328
No! Listen!

1025
01:52:24,231 --> 01:52:27,463
l'll do anything you say.
l'll give you my word.

1026
01:52:32,174 --> 01:52:37,306
- l'll call you later in the day.
- All right. You'll contact me. Thanks.

1027
01:52:37,381 --> 01:52:40,145
- Sit tight. Wait for the call.
- Right.

1028
01:53:46,428 --> 01:53:48,795
- Do l look all right?
- Fine. Why?

1029
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,103
l just met this fellow, and he treated me
like l was a leper or something.

1030
01:53:54,605 --> 01:53:56,698
l just wanted to give him back this.

1031
01:53:56,774 --> 01:53:59,369
Really? Have a drink. Good for morale.

1032
01:53:59,945 --> 01:54:02,540
Let's have some champagne to celebrate.

1033
01:54:02,849 --> 01:54:05,408
You can't celebrate a crime.
That's immoral.

1034
01:54:05,518 --> 01:54:09,182
- You handle it. lt's too confusing.
- A bottle of Dom Perignon, please.

1035
01:54:09,255 --> 01:54:11,190
lt's all right. You're at the awkward age.

1036
01:54:11,258 --> 01:54:14,854
Too old to be a juvenile delinquent,
too young to be a hardened criminal.

1037
01:54:14,928 --> 01:54:19,765
We did it! Did you see the papers
and the television? Did you hear the radio?

1038
01:54:19,868 --> 01:54:24,101
lt's the crime of the century, practically.
And we did it!

1039
01:54:25,308 --> 01:54:29,609
You were the brain behind it,
but l was of some help, wasn't l?

1040
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:32,979
l mean, we worked well together,
considering it was our first job.

1041
01:54:33,084 --> 01:54:35,348
- Calm down.
- l know l shouldn't carry on so...

1042
01:54:35,453 --> 01:54:38,582
it's all in a day's work for you,
but it's my first burglary.

1043
01:54:38,657 --> 01:54:41,149
- And mine, too.
- Bringing it off the way we....

1044
01:54:46,032 --> 01:54:47,193
What?

1045
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,034
My first burglary.

1046
01:54:58,648 --> 01:55:01,446
Then what were you doing
in our house that night?

1047
01:55:02,018 --> 01:55:04,351
You're sure you want to know?

1048
01:55:11,596 --> 01:55:15,726
l'm a private detective,
specializing in stolen works of art...

1049
01:55:16,268 --> 01:55:20,602
and in tracing, detecting,
and exposing forgeries.

1050
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:24,343
l am also an authority
on museum security...

1051
01:55:24,412 --> 01:55:27,005
being a special consultant
to principal museums...

1052
01:55:27,081 --> 01:55:30,573
in London, New York, Chicago,
Madrid. Even Leningrad.

1053
01:55:30,686 --> 01:55:33,586
l have degrees
in history of art and chemistry...

1054
01:55:33,689 --> 01:55:38,558
and a London University diploma,
with distinction, in advanced criminology.

1055
01:55:45,369 --> 01:55:47,132
You're all of that?

1056
01:55:49,807 --> 01:55:51,639
Then you're not a burglar?

1057
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:56,909
l was chipping a piece of
your father's paint from that van Gogh...

1058
01:55:56,983 --> 01:56:00,511
when you loomed up in your nighty
and shot me in the arm.

1059
01:56:10,332 --> 01:56:12,698
- Bring another glass.
- Yes, sir.

1060
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:17,239
l don't believe we've met.
My name is Charles Bonnet.

1061
01:56:17,841 --> 01:56:20,970
- May l please join you?
- Simon Dermott. By all means.

1062
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:25,471
Papa, this is a friend of mine. He's a....
l mean, he was telling me....

1063
01:56:25,551 --> 01:56:29,647
Yes. Blue eyes, tall, quite good-looking.

1064
01:56:30,722 --> 01:56:32,314
A terrible man!

1065
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:36,852
l believe we have
some interests in common.

1066
01:56:37,063 --> 01:56:40,693
You have two gorgeous girls
in your family, Mr. Bonnet.

1067
01:56:41,869 --> 01:56:45,431
The other is upstairs,
wrapped in a shirt, in my room.

1068
01:56:51,047 --> 01:56:54,483
And which, may l ask,
do you intend to keep?

1069
01:56:55,252 --> 01:56:56,742
The real one.

1070
01:56:57,555 --> 01:57:01,115
- A very sound choice, if l may say so.
- l think so.

1071
01:57:02,093 --> 01:57:03,583
And the other?

1072
01:57:03,661 --> 01:57:06,324
l have plans for her, too.
l think you'll be pleased.

1073
01:57:06,431 --> 01:57:07,626
Really?

1074
01:57:07,733 --> 01:57:11,294
ln fact l have to attend to her right now,
so if you'll both excuse me?

1075
01:57:14,674 --> 01:57:17,439
Extraordinary! ls he always so abrupt?

1076
01:57:18,779 --> 01:57:20,440
Not in a closet.

1077
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,447
Key!

1078
01:57:56,090 --> 01:58:00,151
You've done a wonderful job!
You sure you don't want any money?

1079
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:06,727
You will be contacted.

1080
01:58:07,169 --> 01:58:11,163
Don't worry if it's not in the near future.

1081
01:58:11,275 --> 01:58:12,572
Right!

1082
01:58:13,244 --> 01:58:17,272
The code word will be ''togetherness.''

1083
01:58:18,984 --> 01:58:21,476
''Togetherness.'' l got it.

1084
01:58:21,854 --> 01:58:24,482
- Happy landings!
- The same to you!

1085
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:37,702
My dear boy, what a coup!

1086
01:59:37,811 --> 01:59:41,212
And he's the only collector
who'd never dare have it tested.

1087
01:59:41,714 --> 01:59:46,050
How much did you say
he was paying for the Venus, my son?

1088
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:48,855
l didn't say, Papa.

1089
01:59:48,956 --> 01:59:52,619
But l'm sure you picked
a nice, round figure.

1090
01:59:52,694 --> 01:59:54,025
l have.

1091
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:58,558
$0.00

1092
01:59:59,202 --> 02:00:02,171
Gift from Charles Bonnet to Davis Leland.

1093
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:04,538
- But this--
- Sit down, Mr. Bonnet.

1094
02:00:10,483 --> 02:00:12,576
You happen to be a forger.

1095
02:00:13,586 --> 02:00:15,952
My business happens to be
catching forgers...

1096
02:00:16,055 --> 02:00:17,579
and putting them in prison.

1097
02:00:17,657 --> 02:00:21,150
Yes, that could be very awkward.

1098
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:23,953
One of us has to retire.

1099
02:00:24,999 --> 02:00:28,526
Fair enough! Shall we toss a coin for it?

1100
02:00:30,306 --> 02:00:33,173
l've already tossed one on the way here.

1101
02:00:33,677 --> 02:00:36,771
- And?
- You lost.

1102
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,714
Come on. You had a great run,
and you were the best.

1103
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:45,346
Hang up your brushes and paints,
and retire while you're on top.

1104
02:00:46,123 --> 02:00:48,115
What do you say, champ?

1105
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:55,162
Here is my answer.

1106
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,036
lndian wrestling at a time like this?

1107
02:01:02,243 --> 02:01:04,712
Nicole, my darling child.

1108
02:01:05,714 --> 02:01:07,774
You tell her. l'm too moved.

1109
02:01:07,883 --> 02:01:10,945
Papa has seen the light.
He's going straight.

1110
02:01:11,255 --> 02:01:14,918
- Papa, will you be all right?
- He'll survive.

1111
02:01:15,025 --> 02:01:18,017
lf we miss our plane,
we may be getting married in prison.

1112
02:01:18,095 --> 02:01:20,064
This is a most remarkable young man.

1113
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:23,430
The way he explained things,
the path of righteousness...

1114
02:01:24,369 --> 02:01:26,098
became clearly defined.

1115
02:01:26,205 --> 02:01:29,971
Now hurry, my children,
before l break down completely.

1116
02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:54,362
The van Gogh?

1117
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:03,279
<i>Señor. Welcome! Come in....</i>

1118
02:02:09,456 --> 02:02:10,889
Who's that?

1119
02:02:15,396 --> 02:02:16,761
Papa's cousin.

1120
02:02:18,933 --> 02:02:21,232
From South America.

1121
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,163
Go!

1122
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,779
For someone
who started lying just recently...

1123
02:02:33,751 --> 02:02:35,982
you're showing a real flair.

1124
02:02:37,956 --> 02:02:39,321
Thank you.
