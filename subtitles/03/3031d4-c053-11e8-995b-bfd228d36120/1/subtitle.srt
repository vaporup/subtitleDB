1
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,202
Declare all valuables to Customs.

2
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,033
Items undeclared will be...

3
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,698
...confisticated plus a 1000% fine.

4
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,071
Fei-hung, declare the ginseng to Customs.

5
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,268
Dad, we've to pay at least...

6
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,140
...a duty of 50 yuan.

7
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,202
Right.

8
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,870
Let's pass by hiding it...

9
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,346
...inside our pants.

10
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,146
They won't search him,

11
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,677
taking it for hernia only.

12
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:56,820
The idea...

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,414
Outrageous, outrageous!

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,458
It won't work.

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,517
You've got nothing but lousy ideas.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,119
The Northern Army has imposed...

17
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,061
...heavy duties.

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,653
Right.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,629
That's most unfair.

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,360
Nothing in this world is fair.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,425
One traveling must avoid as much as possible.

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,128
Declare it.

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,938
Who's he? Why's he so snobbish?

24
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:22,912
Who's he?

25
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,418
Don't you know British Consul is privileged?

26
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,354
You don't pay duties...

27
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,686
...if you become a Consul.

28
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,712
Exempt from duties?

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,315
Right.

30
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,827
Watch out!

31
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,904
What's wrong with you?

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,399
Get up, get up!

33
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,736
What the hell are you up to?

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,470
He was knocked down.

35
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,679
Sorry.

36
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,879
Why have you given away...

37
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,510
...such a big ginseng?

38
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,179
To avoid tax!

39
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,484
I'll get it back in a minutes.

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,784
Let me have another fall then.

41
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,085
What?

42
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,116
By putting everything in,

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,092
I don't have to pay tax.

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,561
Coming.

45
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,862
What's wrong with him.

46
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,023
An epilepsy.

47
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,535
Tso, get up!

48
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,829
Set him free!

49
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,139
Dad, I'll pay tax in front.

50
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:26,940
Take care.

51
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,476
Don't jostle.

52
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,984
Follow the queue!

53
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,058
Catch it, master.

54
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,288
Come quick!

55
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,434
These kids really are OK.

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,105
Put it aside.

57
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,669
A pickpocket!

58
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,142
Stolen my dad's purse.

59
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,605
Fei-hung.

60
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,449
Stay where you are!

61
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,510
Fei-hung, don't chase him!

62
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,750
Come up.

63
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,857
Fei-hung, remember what I've taught you.

64
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,364
You can't win over a local boy.

65
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,390
Don't chase a desperate thief, understand?

66
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,764
But he's stole your money.

67
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,460
Forget it, as there's no loss.

68
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,404
Remember, the important thing in life is...

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,931
Forgive while you can.

70
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,737
Remember it.

71
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,105
I forgot.

72
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,827
Checkmate!

73
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,866
Again.

74
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,065
A man shouldn't renege.

75
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,840
How should I move now?

76
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,468
Think, think it over.

77
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,912
Dad, look, many trees.

78
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,383
That tree's big!

79
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,181
Already gone.

80
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,421
Come on.

81
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,081
Can I concede the loss?

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,119
Use your brains.

83
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,059
What? Can't move now.

84
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,332
Are you okay?

85
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,574
How did you catch?

86
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,236
Sorry, old gentleman.

87
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,038
Young man, be careful in playing ball.

88
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,847
Thank you.

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,454
Have you thought it over?

90
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,516
Come on.

91
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,891
How come it's "go" chess?

92
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,652
I can't beat you.

93
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,414
Don't go away, vendor.

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,700
Dad, you don't like this.

95
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,566
Let me go down to buy toast chicken for you.

96
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,271
Just wait. A vendor will come in a minute.

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,241
No, we must go down to get a nice roast chicken.

98
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,243
Right, right.

99
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,271
You yearn for a chance to move around.

100
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,371
Why make an excuse? Go then.

101
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,176
Go, go.

102
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,242
Don't arouse trouble.

103
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,583
Yes.

104
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,279
Be sure to come back early!

105
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,496
Master, what class is the compartment?

106
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,006
Why are the cattle here too?

107
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,770
It stinks like hell!

108
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,319
It's just another world.

109
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,884
The weather in the northeast is OK.

110
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,114
I like it.

111
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,889
This is first class.

112
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,518
The number of foreigners speaks for it.

113
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,887
What are you doing?

114
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,125
Looking for a friend.

115
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,291
Could you possible have friends here?

116
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,197
Right, right.

117
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:42,767
Yes.

118
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,631
You mustn't go in anyway.

119
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,533
Can't we just have a look?

120
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,628
No. Get away!

121
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,599
Get away, or I'll get hold of you!

122
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,040
Master, what now?

123
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:50,973
Let's try something.

124
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,507
Really?

125
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,273
Of course.

126
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,150
Master, the next step?

127
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,451
See how I do it.

128
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,186
What are you doing?

129
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,725
What's wrong?

130
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,596
The ducks have fled!

131
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,862
Chase them!

132
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,335
Throw away the poultry quick!

133
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,008
Get back the poultry quick!

134
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,388
Sorry.

135
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,425
Hitting me?

136
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,296
A thief.

137
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,738
Sorry, I'll clear it up right away!

138
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,176
Stop!

139
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,184
What are you doing?

140
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,125
Halt!

141
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,129
A thief beating people!

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,970
Henchman!

143
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,100
What?

144
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,344
Have a bowl of tea.

145
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,039
Keep closer, and I'll shoot you dead!

146
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,235
Henchman!

147
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,847
Don't run

148
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,781
First, I'm not a henchman.

149
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,378
Second...

150
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,923
I've already conceded to you.

151
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,290
Who cares? I won't lose.

152
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,853
You mule, what do you want?

153
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,688
Simple, just apologise to me.

154
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,028
Apologise to you?

155
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,029
Of course, you've misunderstand me.

156
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,927
OK, sorry.

157
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,125
And let me box you on the ear.

158
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,967
Ducking? Again.

159
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,567
Hit me if you can!

160
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,378
Don't say I'm bullying you!

161
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,478
Ok, I'll play along.

162
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:28,410
Come on.

163
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,044
Come on.

164
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,272
Drunken boxing.

165
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,003
Sure, you think I'm getting dizzy?

166
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,608
OK, come on.

167
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,480
Come over.

168
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,643
Come over.

169
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,653
Come over.

170
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:06,249
Well, wait till you get sober first.

171
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,727
Uncle Tsao, God Serving Wine.

172
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,591
Cripple Li, Elbows Whirl and Knees Hit.

173
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,107
Any such blow is drunken boxing?

174
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,211
It's Holding a Jar. New to you?

175
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,140
Fairies Littering Petals.

176
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,584
Grasping Wrist and Hitting Chest.

177
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,317
Han Blowing a Flute.

178
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,163
What's this?

179
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,464
It's Drunken in Battlefield.

180
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,042
Don't worry, stand up.

181
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,573
This hero's kung fu is OK.

182
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,677
Young man, your skills are not bad either.

183
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,518
But your drunken boxing...

184
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,619
faultless?

185
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,649
No, not powerful enough

186
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,126
and can't kill.

187
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,752
What?

188
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,787
My drunken boxing can't kill?

189
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,527
Let's go on.

190
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,828
You're running out of time.

191
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:24,767
What?

192
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,702
I'm young and strong. I've lots of time.

193
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,797
The train's leaving.

194
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,672
Who cares?

195
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,909
Stay!

196
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,407
The train!

197
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,049
Wait for me. I can't keep up.

198
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,491
Your hand, come on, quick!

199
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,099
Thank you.

200
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,693
Have you got back your stuff?

201
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,114
Ginseng?

202
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,188
Get up, all of you!

203
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,523
Get down the luggage for inspection!

204
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,155
Hurry up!

205
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,626
Morning.

206
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,198
What's up, please?

207
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,096
The British Council has lost something,

208
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,697
so everyone has to be searched.

209
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,599
Have a check.

210
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,505
Yes.

211
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,577
Closely!

212
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,974
Open your luggage, be quick!

213
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,450
What's this!

214
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,611
Lingtzu.

215
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,814
And that?

216
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,289
Bear gall.

217
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,891
What's that? Show me.

218
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,160
Ginseng.

219
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,891
And that?

220
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,625
Deer foot ribs.

221
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,031
And that?

222
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,971
Deer tail.

223
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,669
Checked. And that box?

224
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,105
That box...

225
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:13,670
Lingtzu.

226
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,111
That box, not this.

227
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:15,738
That box?

228
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,212
That box behind you.

229
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,477
Ginseng, and you've already seen it!

230
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,609
Open it.

231
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,980
Show him.

232
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:21,781
All medicine.

233
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,048
Open it.

234
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,385
Open it!

235
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,859
Sir, he's my friend...

236
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:30,987
...in bona fide business.

237
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,624
He's never been away. No need to search.

238
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,461
Who are you?

239
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,827
What have you got to say that?

240
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,742
Sorry.

241
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,314
His dad is a General in Northeast.

242
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,447
His dad's a general,

243
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,045
and this is his territory.

244
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,415
Check the next compartment.

245
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,956
Go forward.

246
00:15:59,024 --> 00:15:59,922
Let's go.

247
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,724
This young man's quite capable.

248
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,095
Fei-hung, follow his example.

249
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,226
Fei-hung, put aside the ginseng.

250
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,510
You said the jade seal's missing?

251
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,906
The Emperor's jade seal...

252
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,413
...is like the crown of England.

253
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,107
Understand?

254
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,947
Everything combined here...

255
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,715
...is not as valuable.

256
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,484
The British Empire's premier is my friend.

257
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,888
I promised to put...

258
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,450
the jade seal symbolising...

259
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,621
the power of Chinese Emperor...

260
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,689
into the London Museum of Art.

261
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,163
I don't care how you're going to do it.

262
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,727
I want it back.

263
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,702
Yes, sir.

264
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,740
Sir, I know who's taken it.

265
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,705
go and find it!

266
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,571
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,471
Right.

268
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,744
The workers at the steel factory...

269
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,248
...refuse to work at night.

270
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,079
Anything you can do about it?

271
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,050
Don't worry.

272
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,985
I'll get someone to convince them.

273
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,012
They'll nicely return to work at night for sure

274
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,851
Go then.

275
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,753
Yes.

276
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,999
The ancestor be blessed.

277
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,011
All of a kind!

278
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,882
Thank you, Patriarch.

279
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,180
Come on, pay up.

280
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,209
Cut off the nonsense and pay.

281
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,778
For treatment tell him to see Luk-Ah-choi.

282
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,346
Pay.

283
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,086
My luck's beat you all.

284
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,753
Pay, pay.

285
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,596
One make leads to a series of others.

286
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,633
Madam, Master's back.

287
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,192
Good, why fuss?

288
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,065
Master's back!

289
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,103
Master.

290
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,068
What's taken you so long?

291
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,206
I didn't hear it inside.

292
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,716
Let me.

293
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,983
Master, you're back.

294
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,518
Any hardship on the journey?

295
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,053
No, no.

296
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,732
Mother.

297
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,798
No mahjong game?

298
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,533
Nonsense!

299
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,205
I told you repeatedly...

300
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,370
...not to treat when I am out.

301
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,880
Master, you preached a doctor's...

302
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,609
...parental love too.

303
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,583
I couldn't stand...

304
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,245
...by doing nothing about a dying person.

305
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,948
If I did, you'd blame me.

306
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,552
Have they lost much?

307
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,718
Yes, yes.

308
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,890
Need my help?

309
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,024
Gynaecology only.

310
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,430
I alone can cope.

311
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,933
Fei-hung, you've been away long.

312
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,230
Now serve incense to mom's shrine.

313
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,170
Wash your hands before you do it.

314
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,831
Don't laugh.

315
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,738
Get a ladder for him to do it.

316
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,367
Yes.

317
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,342
Did you water the plants regularly?

318
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,675
Yes, master.

319
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,819
Mother.

320
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,989
The chips.

321
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,861
Fei-hung.

322
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,027
What are you doing?

323
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,228
Nothing.

324
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,359
Go and serve incense.

325
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,808
Get up. Go now, go.

326
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,173
This is mine.

327
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,508
It's mine, it's on my chair!

328
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,518
What are you doing?

329
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,281
Behave yourself.

330
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,893
Remember to come again for treatment.

331
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,428
Yes.

332
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,463
Don't forget.

333
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,432
Madam Wong.

334
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,091
Mr. Chan.

335
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,328
Is Master Wong back?

336
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,266
Yes, he's inside.

337
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,431
What about the ginseng I told him to buy for me

338
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,099
He must've got it. This way, please.

339
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,302
Master, Mr. Chan's here to get the ginseng.

340
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,174
Mr. Chan, you've come...

341
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,270
To get the ginseng?

342
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,438
What are you doing?

343
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,344
I'm going in to get the ginseng.

344
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:16,938
Yes.

345
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,947
Go quick.

346
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,680
Mr. Chan, I've bought you a big ginseng.

347
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,244
Sit a while. Let's chat after I've serve incense

348
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,319
Sorry for the trouble.

349
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,117
Mr. Chan, let me...

350
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,283
...bring you a cup of tea.

351
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,223
Good, thank you.

352
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,260
What's the matter with you? Where're you going?

353
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,762
If master knows the ginseng's lost,

354
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,593
I'll be finished.

355
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,188
You won't.

356
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,392
Fei-hung.

357
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,764
What are you two doing?

358
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,201
Mom, come here, come here.

359
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,136
Mom, we're finished.

360
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,697
The ginseng was replaced on the train.

361
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,602
Tso, you're finished.

362
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,303
Look.

363
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,743
Mom, what shall we do now? Do something.

364
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,644
OK?

365
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,477
Coming.

366
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,016
Go and get a cup of tea for Mr. Chan.

367
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,516
What? Get tea?

368
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,107
Get tea

369
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:53,776
I get tea and you try something.

370
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,444
Do, as I told you.

371
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,349
Go, go.

372
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,718
He gets the tea. What about me?

373
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,656
Come. What is it behind you?

374
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:00,616
A staircase.

375
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,624
And above the stairs?

376
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,284
The medicine storehouse.

377
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:02,986
And inside the storehouse?

378
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,618
A box.

379
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,627
And inside it?

380
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,788
Ginseng. Thank you, madam.

381
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,389
It's poison.

382
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,091
What do you mean?

383
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,396
Stop making fun of me, madam.

384
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,761
Better let me handle it.

385
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,844
Mr. Chan, have tea, please.

386
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,570
Thank you.

387
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,719
Dad, have tea.

388
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,451
Mr. Chan.

389
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,358
Why serve tea now?

390
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,363
To show mom my filial piety to you.

391
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,159
You...

392
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,425
A big ginseng, isn't it?

393
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,059
A rare genus of super quality...

394
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,966
...appears only once in a blue moon.

395
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,597
Just put it in boiling water.

396
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,539
After taking it, you assured...

397
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,634
...of potency and youth.

398
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,444
Why have you brought a carrot?

399
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,547
What?

400
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,673
Carrot?

401
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,250
Doesn't it look like ginseng?

402
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,083
No.

403
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,846
I was going to tell you it's carrot,

404
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,381
and a big carrot.

405
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,654
It neutralises...

406
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,753
...and other tonics.

407
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,286
Don't take it within 3 months...

408
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,992
...after taking ginseng.

409
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,226
Understand?

410
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,564
All right now.

411
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,134
Mr. Chan, my wife really is considerate.

412
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,800
She showed you the carrot,

413
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,207
just to warn you against...

414
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,268
taking carrot within 3 months...

415
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,973
after taking ginseng.

416
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,012
Why doesn't it look like it?

417
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,109
I didn't see it.

418
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,016
Nor did I.

419
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,645
I didn't see it either.

420
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,087
Fei-hung, what are you doing?

421
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,214
I really didn't see anything.

422
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,554
Mom, does it look like it?

423
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,722
Yes, very much.

424
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,228
Brat, where did you steal it?

425
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,226
Dad's plant.

426
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,789
You're finished, but never mind.

427
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,596
Blame it on Tso.

428
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,225
Good.

429
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,498
Blame me again? My goodness!

430
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,729
Tso.

431
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,370
Come in quick. Let me help you.

432
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,777
Are you all right? Did you trip?

433
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:00,909
It looks like it.

434
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:01,742
Of course.

435
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,677
Fei-hung's dad, come over.

436
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,085
Sorry.

437
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:07,808
Please.

438
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,683
Sorry, Mr. Chan.

439
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,345
Good.

440
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:10,613
What happened?

441
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,216
Come on, come over.

442
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,521
Why are you acting so furtively?

443
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,222
I want to consult you on something.

444
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,288
Fei-hung's grown now,

445
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,095
he must be lonesome.

446
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,294
What then?

447
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,131
Do you feel that...

448
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,296
Mr. Chan, your ginseng.

449
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,595
Still wet?

450
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,037
Just unearthed.

451
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,234
Mr. Chan, my dad...

452
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,833
...got it hard.

453
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,107
He said it's wild ginseng.

454
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,011
It's to be taken only after being put...

455
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,411
...in a rice container for 3 days.

456
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,915
To bring him a...

457
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:38,540
...small brother or sister?

458
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,210
No hurry, let's talk about it later.

459
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,684
Why not?

460
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,347
Your master Lu Ah-choi's birthday is coming.

461
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,946
It's just passed.

462
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,617
He'll have his birthday again next year.

463
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,521
That's for next year only.

464
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,251
Mr. Chan.

465
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,224
No, no.

466
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,592
Ginseng has to be put on the chest...

467
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,462
...to get some human breath.

468
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,399
Rember, take it only in 3 days.

469
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,867
And don't forget...

470
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:58,767
tomorrows fund-raising assembly.

471
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,793
Master Wong.

472
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:00,964
I must take my leave.

473
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,566
Have you seen the ginseng?

474
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,402
Yes.

475
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:03,907
Satisfied?

476
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,208
Yes, yes.

477
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:05,709
Very satisfied!

478
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,709
Let me see you out.

479
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,677
No, let Fei-hung do it. Where's he?

480
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,510
Let me. Please, please.

481
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,641
Goodbye.

482
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:12,649
Take care.

483
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,241
The Militia want you...

484
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,253
...to be their coach.

485
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,754
They ask if you're interested.

486
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,583
I've already given them my word. J647

487
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,520
I know you did. J647

488
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,352
Mom.

489
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,686
Mr. Chan has left.

490
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,586
What do you want to tell me?

491
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,753
I need your advice.

492
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,092
Are we to ask for...

493
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,461
...a 30-years deposit in advance?

494
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,988
Forget it. You're tired. Talk about it tomorrow

495
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,522
Go in and retire.

496
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,931
Dad, go in and retire.

497
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,525
How long am I going to live?

498
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,867
Frankly,

499
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,532
if they do pay you a 30-year deposit,

500
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,041
that's a good thing.

501
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,940
Why pull a long face?

502
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,705
If dad should see that plant...

503
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,304
Just throw the pot away.

504
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,810
One more thing.

505
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,907
What's it?

506
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,144
If Mr. Chan takes the fake...

507
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,653
...ginseng after return.

508
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,379
Let's wait till he is sick.

509
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,217
Wish he could really wait for 3 days.

510
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,060
Just for some water. Be back soon.

511
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:01,826
Hurry up

512
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,559
Hurry up

513
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,799
Time for dismissal. No bells

514
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,063
Deliver the coffee before ringing the bell

515
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,902
Fo Sang, my stove's going out. Stoke it

516
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,535
In a moment

517
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,946
Uncle Hing, take care

518
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,143
So I noticed

519
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,554
Time for dismissal

520
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,555
Ring the bell

521
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,087
So much hurry!

522
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,190
Coffer’s here

523
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,099
Off now.

524
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,442
Bells to start work!

525
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,671
You're...

526
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,714
Nonsense.

527
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,242
I'm the new foreman.

528
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,749
Do as I told you!

529
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,424
What happened?

530
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,187
What's wrong?

531
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,125
Isn't it time to be off?

532
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,026
Today, that's no way to curry favor.

533
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,825
Right.

534
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,455
Right, we're already off.

535
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,522
Why did you clock-in?

536
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,133
He is...

537
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,501
The new foreman told me to do it.

538
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,672
The new foreman?

539
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,608
What a waste letting...

540
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,543
...the factory go idle?

541
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,876
So we're working overtime.

542
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,505
4 hours' overtime each night...

543
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,480
...for a month.

544
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,175
Hear me?

545
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,514
What? One month?

546
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,076
One month?

547
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,552
Quiet, everybody!

548
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,084
Well, Mr. Smith,

549
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,921
We'll work over time,

550
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,052
if you agree to pay us overtime.

551
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,561
Right, we must've overtime pay.

552
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,959
We've already paid you overtime pay.

553
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,091
The free board...

554
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,294
...and lodging we provided you...

555
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,133
already cover the OT pay, don't they?

556
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,366
Understand? Quiet!

557
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,765
Mr. Smith, free board and lodging...

558
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,071
are precondition.

559
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,839
We won't work overtime...

560
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:54,970
...if you don't pay for it.

561
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,637
Right, we won't work.

562
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,977
Let's go.

563
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,379
Halt!

564
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,515
You won't work OT the 1st day of my appointment.

565
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,455
It means not giving me face.

566
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,752
It's not true.

567
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,088
It's a matter of principle.

568
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,753
Who'd work overtime without extra pay?

569
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:10,685
Let's go.

570
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,065
Don't!

571
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,567
Why not?

572
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,299
All back to work, hear me?

573
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,839
Stand back, all of you!

574
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,282
Keung.

575
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,558
Are you going to work or not?

576
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,927
Who dares to disobey?

577
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,064
Henry, you're great!

578
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,425
Are you convinced now?

579
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,595
They've to work.

580
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,850
Well, you go on with practice.

581
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,860
The racket! It disturbs my sleep

582
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,923
Any way to buy up that plot

583
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,060
The land is owned by Po Chi Lam gym

584
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,468
He just won't sell

585
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,029
Dawn! I must get rid of him

586
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,402
Sure

587
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,721
Fun, are you tired working along?

588
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,753
Why not let someone help you?

589
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,458
Don't you agree?

590
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,128
Getting help?

591
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,693
No female dares to kill snakes like I do.

592
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,296
And I can't afford...

593
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,398
...to pay wages to a man.

594
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,908
So I prefer to be alone.

595
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,144
Right you are.

596
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,907
But a female...

597
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,608
...may suffer...

598
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,912
...without the care of a man.

599
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,419
Why not let me teach you kung fu...

600
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,977
...to protect yourself?

601
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,250
I like nothing but drunken boxing.

602
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,086
What good is it? It can't fight.

603
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,355
Come to Sha Min tonight.

604
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,158
and I'll teach you Tsai Li Fu boxing!

605
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,198
I prefer drunken boxing.

606
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,766
What's there to see? Back to work!

607
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,540
So many are waiting to buy fish. Are you blind?

608
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,642
How much?

609
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,505
Drunken boxing beat Tsai Li Fu? I chop!

610
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,606
Master Tsan.

611
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,879
Wong Fei-hung.

612
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,350
Half fish, minced,

613
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,946
and a fish head, please.

614
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,447
Which half?

615
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,859
Snake gall good for the eyes,

616
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,691
suits elderly person best.

617
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,252
Fun.

618
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:58,852
Boil snake soup.

619
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,622
Fun.

620
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,356
Fei-hung.

621
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,626
You snake has fled!

622
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,691
Never mind. What do you want?

623
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,669
Give me 3 snake galls and one pheasant.

624
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,069
I've already reserved them for you.

625
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,337
Thank you.

626
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,173
Which half do you want?

627
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,941
It makes no difference.

628
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:17,843
Fei-hung,

629
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,645
they say your drunken boxing is OK.

630
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,412
Thank you.

631
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,282
Teach me a few moves when you've time.

632
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,115
OK.

633
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,657
I won't mince fish today.

634
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,022
Never mind. I'll do it at home myself.

635
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,528
Just do it as I told you. Stop nagging.

636
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,689
I want it right away.

637
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,690
Fei-hung, when will you teach me drunken boxing?

638
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,234
What good is drunken boxing?

639
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,098
It's so sissy.

640
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,195
Wong Fei-hung, you've spoken the truth.

641
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,275
Why don't you ask Tsan to teach you Tsai Li Fu?

642
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,503
What good is your Tsai Li Fu?

643
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,374
At least it's better than drunken boxing?

644
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,013
Never mind him, Fei-hung.

645
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,608
When will you teach me drunken boxing?

646
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,481
Fun, don't you prefer...

647
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,217
Tsai Li Fu to drunken boxing?

648
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,681
Pupils, don't you agree?

649
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,215
Yes.

650
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,954
Sure.

651
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,186
It depends on who's the master.

652
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,861
My Tsai Li Fu beats your drunken boxing.

653
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,633
If I lose to you.

654
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,071
I'll pay for the fish and fish head...

655
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,200
...you bought today.

656
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,176
Tsan, isn't that a deal?

657
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,043
Yes, it's a deal

658
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,248
Master Tsan, I'm afraid...

659
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,947
...I may hurt the passers-by.

660
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,147
Let them be the witness then.

661
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,318
Neighbors, ladies and gentlemen.

662
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,952
I, fishmonger Tsan, will have...

663
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,259
...a fight with Wong Fei-hung.

664
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,663
Be our witness.

665
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,665
Come on.

666
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,659
Don't worry, just a token fight.

667
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,636
Go ahead.

668
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,455
Why don't you use drunken boxing?

669
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,514
Good!

670
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,701
Great, Fei-hung, you've won.

671
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,569
No, I drew with...

672
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,537
...Master Tsan.

673
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,869
Right. Again.

674
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,602
Master Tsan.

675
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,136
Coming.

676
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,512
Mom wants me.

677
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,009
Excuse me. My mom wants me.

678
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:08,950
Fei-hung.

679
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,321
Your fish.

680
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,015
Well, how much?

681
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,920
It my treat.

682
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,980
Thank you.

683
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,753
All right now. It's a draw.

684
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,956
Buy anything you want.

685
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,124
Go.

686
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,225
Getting your food free?

687
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,291
Didn't you fight?

688
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,063
No?

689
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,501
You may get the hell from dad again if you did.

690
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,197
How can we afford...

691
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,433
...to good the ginseng?

692
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,634
Just sell my diamond necklace...

693
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,664
...from your dad.

694
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,368
No way.

695
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,307
Why not?

696
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,402
You're finished if...

697
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,037
...takes the fake ginseng.

698
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,314
Thank you, mom.

699
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,747
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

700
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,089
He's the man wanted by Consul.

701
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,017
You follow him.

702
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,685
I'll bring men, OK?

703
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:49,891
Yes.

704
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,488
Wong Kei-ying sells his wife's...

705
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,226
...jewelry only in emergency.

706
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,323
Try to cut down the price, understand?

707
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,561
Yes, what a nagger.

708
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,760
Let's go.

709
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,299
Is the drought so serious?

710
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,398
The province...

711
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,501
...is known for infertility.

712
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,206
There's no harvest and no rainfall.

713
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,339
How can it not be serious?

714
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,782
My friend told me one whole family there...

715
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,410
shares one pair of pants only.

716
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,976
Who wears it then?

717
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,682
Any member that goes out.

718
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,418
Mr. Chiu, so you're here.

719
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:21,819
Sorry, I'm late.

720
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,948
Mr. Chiu.

721
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,993
Don't mention it.

722
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,095
Sorry.

723
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:25,821
Don't mention it.

724
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,324
Don't you have an appointment...

725
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,764
...with my wife in ABC Cafe?

726
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,994
Are you one player short again?

727
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,194
No, I'll help you to raise funds.

728
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,671
Aren't you coming with me?

729
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,537
Right, I'll try to get a donation from Tsan.

730
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,109
Go quick, don't keep them waiting.

731
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,303
OK.

732
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,378
Excuse me, Dad.

733
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,504
Stay.

734
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,776
Don't arouse trouble.

735
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,410
I won't.

736
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,814
This way.

737
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,615
Go and bring men.

738
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,049
Since everyone's here,

739
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,993
please explain the procedure.

740
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,325
Good. This...

741
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,226
Since Po Chi Lam's in trouble, we must...

742
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,288
...answer Master Wong's request for donation.

743
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,822
Please don't misunderstand.

744
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,266
The donation is not for Po Chi Lam.

745
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,736
It's for the relief of draught victims.

746
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,204
The donation goes to whoever's in trouble.

747
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,606
We're all Chinese, right?

748
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,870
Don't come over unless I tell you to.

749
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,433
Hurry up!

750
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,340
Has anybody disclosed this?

751
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:14,935
No.

752
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:15,637
And you?

753
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,475
I didn't.

754
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,742
Don't frame me.

755
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,682
Whoever revealed it gets his face boxed in.

756
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,739
You'll get it for sure.

757
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,649
Luckily...

758
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,120
...my face's OK.

759
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,417
We're no busybody.

760
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,354
Right.

761
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,221
Who's busybody then?

762
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,351
They're every inch a busybody.

763
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,486
Cut it out! Show me quick!

764
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,461
Show us quick!

765
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,623
Open it quick to show us.

766
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,528
It's valuable!

767
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,901
It's beautiful!

768
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,704
Show me.

769
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,907
It's understood this is to put in your custody,

770
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,209
and I'll redeem it as soon as I can.

771
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,750
OK. At worst I'll pay a higher price.

772
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,445
don't begrudge it. Produce it.

773
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,346
Did you see what it was?

774
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,080
No, may be...

775
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,919
...an expensive item she tried to sell.

776
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,149
We'll snatch it all the same.

777
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,353
Be careful not to...

778
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,053
...expose your identity.

779
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:04,789
Yes.

780
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,220
You act, you help.

781
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,730
Listen, don't wear it to show off.

782
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,562
You may ruin me.

783
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,329
Don't worry,

784
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,061
I'll enjoy it at home only.

785
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:12,830
When will be our game?

786
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,304
Well...

787
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:16,803
What's wrong?

788
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,205
Thief!

789
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,674
Louder.

790
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,339
Thief! Thief!

791
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,410
Wait for me here.

792
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,890
Fei-hung, over there.

793
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,274
Luckily you ran fast.

794
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,316
Fei-hung, great, you've got it back!

795
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,085
My dear son!

796
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:03,878
Fei-hung.

797
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:04,478
Fat, hello.

798
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,249
Great!

799
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,221
Thank you.

800
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,316
Rickshaw!

801
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,492
What happened?

802
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,723
You've hit me.

803
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,856
Sorry.

804
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,263
You can't get over by saying 'sorry' only.

805
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,530
What do you want then?

806
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,801
Kneel down and kowtow to say 'sorry'.

807
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,597
Not so serious.

808
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,505
Darling.

809
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,102
Never mind them.

810
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,235
They're birds of the same feather.

811
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,973
Nonsense, bitch!

812
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,541
None has called me...

813
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,809
...that for a long time.

814
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,873
You couldn't escape our attention.

815
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,111
You exchanged eyes...

816
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:34,845
...with that man.

817
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,943
You look wretched...

818
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,046
...even in a foreign suit.

819
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,755
You're hitting my mom!

820
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,422
Mom, are you OK?

821
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,392
Hitting my son?

822
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,192
Mom, is it serious?

823
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,926
Don't dream of leaving her if you...

824
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,524
...don't apologize on your knees.

825
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,663
You're really going too far.

826
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:54,801
What did you say?

827
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,806
Act.

828
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,797
Act?

829
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,603
It means fight.

830
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,069
Fight, fight.

831
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,303
What happened to your mouth?

832
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,108
It's all right.

833
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,083
My necklace's in that wallet.

834
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,646
Pass it over quick!

835
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,221
Darling, fling it over to me.

836
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,185
Catch!

837
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,130
OK.

838
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,367
Who's that young man!

839
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,372
Wong Kei-ying's son.

840
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,271
Po Chi Lam.

841
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,173
His drunken boxing is terrific.

842
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,370
It's a superb!

843
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,470
How's drunken boxing? Show me.

844
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,644
He's Wong Fei-hung. I'm on good terms with him.

845
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,081
Fei-hung.

846
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,253
Fei-hung, teach them a lesson...

847
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,349
with drunken boxing.

848
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,391
Dad may give me hell.

849
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,653
Don't worry, I'll outtalk him.

850
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,189
Why don't you promote...

851
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,025
...Po Chi Lam's image?

852
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,199
Look.

853
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,199
Come on.

854
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,963
What the hell do you live on?

855
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,994
A bunch of fools! Four beaten by one!

856
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,840
Come on!

857
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,689
Is this drunken boxing?

858
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,790
I think so.

859
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,698
Not bad.

860
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,267
Excellent!

861
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,094
Not too powerful.

862
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,660
Just so-so.

863
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,962
You don't understand.

864
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,904
Go.

865
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,200
Go, go.

866
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,806
Hold it quick!

867
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,746
Get us much wine as possible.

868
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,046
You didn't pay for the wine.

869
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,974
Charge it to Mrs. Wong's account.

870
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:49,982
They're fighting over there.

871
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,884
Go over quick!

872
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,783
Where's he now?

873
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:53,414
Why's he missing?

874
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,355
Over there.

875
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,322
Hurry up!

876
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,726
Oh, no, I'll go with Yee to call the police.

877
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,532
Don't call the police.

878
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:08,962
Fei-hung, catch!

879
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,167
Dad won't let me drink!

880
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,833
I will.

881
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,106
You're finished if you're beaten...

882
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,204
and your gym ruined.

883
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,146
And white wine, red wine.

884
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,761
Can your son drink it adult rated?

885
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,765
why not? It adds to the strength.

886
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,929
Can you make it?

887
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,495
I think I must drink a bit more.

888
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,070
A little bit. Give it to me.

889
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,106
Catch!

890
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,438
Thank you.

891
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,275
Get up!

892
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,311
Why crouch over there?

893
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,696
It's strong. What wine is this, mom?

894
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,691
I don't read English,

895
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,257

00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,418
Why did you sell the diamond necklace?

950
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:57,960
Who's got any diamond necklace?

951
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,859
Mr. Wong.

952
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,228
Why hide Po Chi Lam's financial trouble?

953
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,392
Why raise funds under the pretext of relief?

954
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,299
Po Chi Lam's all right.

955
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,371
Keep the money in custody.

956
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,300
Don't drink anymore.

957
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,035
Fei-hung.

958
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,543
He's deadly drunk.

959
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,640
Mrs. Wong.

960
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,971
Don't drink no more!

961
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:17,871
Mr. Wong.

962
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,075
Let's help him back.

963
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,646
You get the wine...

964
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,309
Let me help you.

965
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,978
Why are you standing there?

966
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,109
Go home.

967
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,555
Yes, master.

968
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,187
Goodbye.

969
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,350
They're gone.

970
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,051
Go now.

971
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,156
Me, too.

972
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,522
Where's he going?

973
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,960
What's there to see? Follow him!

974
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,528
A bunch of fools!

975
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,097
You're not any good either.

976
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,435
You meant to tell on me?

977
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,569
You meant to tarnish our image.

978
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,072
You brat!

979
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,411
Now everybody thought I raise money...

980
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,417
...under the pretext of relief!

981
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,417
Are you broke?

982
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,215
You're even selling my jewelry.

983
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,221
Who's selling it?

984
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,553
I showed it to Fa as an example only.

985
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,819
because she...

986
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,258
...likes the pattern.

987
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,757
Don't deny.

988
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,194
Mr. Chiu's wife asked him...

989
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,925
...for money to buy it.

990
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,592
Did you lose much on mahjong games?

991
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,561
Fa could've lied to her husband...

992
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,865
...to get the money.

993
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,531
You only believe others, not me.

994
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,971
Is there justice?

995
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,473
Mom, you're OK, you have a way.

996
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,441
Be on your knees properly!

997
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,272
See how drunk you are!

998
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,641
Kneel properly!

999
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,909
I told you not to use...

1000
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:26,813
...drunken boxing or fight.

1001
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,317
But you're disobedient.

1002
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,579
Are your wings getting stiff?

1003
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,147
You're drunk, you hit your own dad!

1004
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,214
I'll kill you.

1005
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,820
Why are you hitting your son?

1006
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,159
He helped me only because I got beaten.

1007
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,596
You prefer to let me killed...

1008
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,793
...than have him use drunken boxing?

1009
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,634
Like mother...

1010
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:46,636
...like son!

1011
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,659
I wouldn't let him use drunken boxing...

1012
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,137
...for his own good only.

1013
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,229
What's wrong with that?

1014
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,674
You expected him to stick to that...

1015
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,472
...old medicine shop all his life?

1016
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,842
You really make my temperature rise!

1017
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,416
You never learn!

1018
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,855
Who made a mess of this...

1019
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,454
...pot of mine?

1020
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,123
Oh, I forgot to...

1021
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,928
...fling away this pot!

1022
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,025
Tso.

1023
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,531
You're responsible.

1024
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,634
Well,

1025
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,074
why fuss over such a trifles?

1026
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:31,072
Master, why get so excited?

1027
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,878
I ruined the plant.

1028
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,579
I sold the necklace because I lost in gambling.

1029
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,144
And I forced him to use...

1030
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,382
drunken boxing.

1031
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,391
And I made him drink as he did.

1032
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,222
Curse me!

1033
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,558
Kill me, I asked for it!

1034
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,128
Don't go too far!

1035
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,130
Don't just take the blame...

1036
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,565
...yourself for anything!

1037
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,691
You resent it?

1038
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,396
Beat me!

1039
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,532
Don't think I daren't lay hands on you!

1040
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,768
OK.

1041
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,007
Why cry? I haven't done anything.

1042
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,446
Come on, beat me!

1043
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:12,751
Kill me, and be a man!

1044
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,754
Hitting my own wife, why not?

1045
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,452
I'll kill...

1046
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,529
Just kill me!

1047
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,532
One body with two lives of the Wongs!

1048
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,657
What?

1049
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,268
Are you pregnant?

1050
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,798
Why on your knees?

1051
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,236
Come. Get up!

1052
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,735
You told me to kneel.

1053
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,005
And I'll do it accordingly.

1054
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,603
I kneel, kneel.

1055
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,672
Well, I'm sorry, all my fault!

1056
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:42,276
Great, I'm going to have a small brother!

1057
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,313
Get up, come on!

1058
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,945
Leave me alone! Keep away!

1059
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:46,990
I crouch!

1060
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:47,783
Watch out!

1061
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:48,989
Don't!

1062
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:49,753
Put me down!

1063
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,451
OK.

1064
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,892
I hate you! I'll back-somersault!

1065
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,089
Don't!

1066
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,060
My fault!

1067
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,326
Put me down!

1068
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,362
All my fault!

1069
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,992
I'll spin one full circle.

1070
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,899
Keep cool, it was all my fault!

1071
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,067
Tso, get a chair for madam

1072
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,076
Quick

1073
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,641
My wife, sit down, please!

1074
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,741
My fault again.

1075
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:16,978
Are you all right?

1076
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,055
You framed me.

1077
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,450
Only an accident. Get up!

1078
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,987
You did it deliberately.

1079
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,523
Nothing wrong with your belly?

1080
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,056
Don't touch me!

1081
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:34,503
It's all right.

1082
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,005
Thank God!

1083
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,073
Master,

1084
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,370
Mrs. Chan wants to see you on urgent business.

1085
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,606
Take a rest.

1086
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,916
Dad's OK, he's as sophisticated as ever.

1087
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,849
Nonsense!

1088
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:50,977
Master Wong.

1089
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,648
Mrs. Chan, what is it?

1090
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,123
Master Wong, look.

1091
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,184
This is not ginseng.

1092
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,590
I showed it to a doctor,

1093
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,358
and he said it's a poison plant.

1094
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,229
I knew you wouldn't cheat me with an imitation.

1095
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,824
I'm afraid you've been fooled.

1096
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,132
Luckily, my husband took only half of it.

1097
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,469
He's now only half alive.

1098
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:11,896
What are you doing?

1099
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:12,772
Time for you...

1100
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,834
...to repay my favor now.

1101
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,140
Beat it for me.

1102
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,775
Sorry.

1103
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,113
Uncle Ho, go get the antidote Lingtzu.

1104
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,119
Boil it and feed it to Mr. Chan.

1105
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,415
He'll be all right in time.

1106
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,814
Master Wong, I've come to...

1107
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,882
...tell you about it only.

1108
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:29,924
I won't disturb you any more.

1109
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,688
Sorry.

1110
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,352
Goodbye.

1111
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,087
Sorry.

1112
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,657
Who did it?

1113
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:48,605
Master, youg master did it.

1114
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,771
Not my fault.

1115
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,050
Don't you know this...

1116
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,717
...could be fatal?

1117
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,826
And you've ruined...

1118
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,658
Po Chi Lam's reputation.

1119
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,729
Mom, the ginseng grown by dad...

1120
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:11,964
I'll kill you!

1121
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,135
Brat, I'll kill you!

1122
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,137
Imitation ginseng kills, don't you know?

1123
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,243
He knew it for sure.

1124
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,144
I sold the diamond necklace...

1125
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,773
to buy a ginseng only.

1126
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,112
A slip of the tongue!

1127
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,353
To evade payment of duty.

1128
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,912
Your son hid the ginseng in someone...

1129
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,116
...else's luggage and it got lost.

1130
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,648
To evade tax for me? Outrageous!

1131
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,129
I may be poor, but I'm honest.

1132
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,326
Dishonesty is worst than starvation.

1133
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,765
Now you've brought...

1134
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,393
...this way!

1135
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,801
You want to drink?

1136
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,636
I'll let you drink it now.

1137
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,048
Drink it, drink it like hell, come on!

1138
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,287
Drink it like hell!

1139
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,004
How dare you fight back?

1140
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,836
I've brought you up for nothing.

1141
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,369
Get out of my sight!

1142
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,280
You're not my son!

1143
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,047
Get out!

1144
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,316
Get out!

1145
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,690
Get out!

1146
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,462
Stop it, master!

1147
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,155
Stop it, master!

1148
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,665
Get out!

1149
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,333
Fei-hung.

1150
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,236
Fei-hung.

1151
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,274
Get out! You're not my son!

1152
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,366
Stop it!

1153
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:00,067
Get up!

1154
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,610
Master.

1155
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,978
Master, stop it, please!

1156
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,778
Master, don't.

1157
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,052
Master.

1158
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,866
Are you out of your mind? He's your dad!

1159
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:29,027
Get out!

1160
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,033
Fei-hung.

1161
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,540
Tso, after him!

1162
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,477
Tso.

1163
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,814
There!

1164
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,055
Catch.

1165
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,863
Thanks for the trouble.

1166
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,092
Don't mention it.

1167
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,457
Boss, here you are.

1168
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,264
Thank you.

1169
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,529
Same as usual

1170
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,266
Please be seated. I'll be with you right away.

1171
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,808
Fei-hung, your dad wouldn't let you loose,

1172
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,109
this is to protect the image of Po Chi Lam.

1173
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,881
I see a generation gap.

1174
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,080
Let me toast dad. Drink!

1175
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,982
No, we won't continue.

1176
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,184
Don't drink after this. It's bad for health.

1177
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,119
Name a song.

1178
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,586
I want to name a song.

1179
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,629
What will you name, sir?

1180
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,466
Dad's nice. I'll sing it myself.

1181
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,265
Dad's nice.

1182
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:37,633
Good.

1183
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:46,572
No one's better than dad.

1184
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:51,349
His child's like a straw.

1185
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:59,727
If I misbehave, he boxes me on the ear.

1186
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:00,557
Egad!

1187
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,496
No one's better than dad.

1188
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:09,130
He takes his son for a sandbag.

1189
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:18,137
Punches, kicks, yes. Embraces, never.

1190
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:22,474
No one's better than dad.

1191
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,319
A pity I never know.

1192
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,085
Look, it's that guy.

1193
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,851
I thought it was a dinosaur.

1194
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,052
His drunken boxing is terrific.

1195
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:36,159
Well, let me take on him.

1196
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,241
It's deep night, don't awake others!

1197
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,342
What are you doing?

1198
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,740
None of your business,

1199
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,009
none of your business either!

1200
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,676
Whoever interferes will be eaten.

1201
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,151
Run quick!

1202
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,848
Stand back, or you'll be eaten too!

1203
00:55:58,888 --> 00:55:59,354
Keep away!

1204
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,150
Keep away!

1205
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,158
Why don't you play?

1206
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,866
I'd like to try your drunken boxing.

1207
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,204
Dad won't let me fight it.

1208
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,570
Watch out, he feigns only.

1209
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,954
What's wrong? They say it's terrific!

1210
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,058
Wong Fei-hung?

1211
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,362
Excuse me.

1212
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,730
Why hit him?

1213
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,336
Nothing for you.

1214
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,901
Stop him from getting closer.

1215
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,940
Henry, you said...

1216
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,072
...it's terrific?

1217
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,638
How come?

1218
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,876
He wasn't like that in the day.

1219
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,282
Ask them and you'll be convinced.

1220
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,148
Right.

1221
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,599
Why hit me?

1222
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,194
Isn't your drunken boxing powerful?

1223
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,498
Show me.

1224
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,903
You call that drunken boxing?

1225
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,841
Take his life right now!

1226
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,509
Mad? With so many around,

1227
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,514
just teach him a lesson.

1228
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,885
King of Drunken Boxing?

1229
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:39,751
Wong Fei-hung.

1230
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:40,652
Something wrong.

1231
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,690
Over there, Master Wong.

1232
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:43,214
Thank you.

1233
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,554
What's wrong?

1234
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:50,923
Fei-hung.

1235
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,559
He even gets dizzy.

1236
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,234
His dad.

1237
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:56,867
What did you say?

1238
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,581
Don't be sorry.

1239
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,593
When young,

1240
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,323
we ran around naked too.

1241
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:22,263
If I had been present,

1242
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,528
this might not have happened!

1243
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,437
Young master, don't be sad.

1244
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,936
Let me tell you some good news.

1245
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:35,945
All girls in the city...

1246
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,447
...yearn to marry you.

1247
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,312
Are you happy now?

1248
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,750
Don't cry. Come on, wipe your face.

1249
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,113
Where's my dad?

1250
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,417
In the garden.

1251
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,758
Fei-hung never forgets he once...

1252
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,024
...won with drunken boxing.

1253
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,191
I've my reason for not letting him use it.

1254
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,565
There's nothing wrong with drunken boxing.

1255
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,069
You've to drink to fight it,

1256
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,162
and you may get drunk.

1257
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,070
Let alone fighting, you can't even stand steady.

1258
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,402
He get into trouble because of this.

1259
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,339
Don't drink so much then.

1260
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,310
No, he must drink a proper portion,

1261
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,744
before it becomes effective.

1262
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,248
He gets powerful but feels no pain when beaten.

1263
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,181
So it gives the wrong...

1264
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,276
...illusion of being powerful.

1265
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,183
A drinker knows...

1266
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,482
...he can't stop drinking.

1267
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,216
Is it worth being...

1268
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,621
...a drunkard to use this move?

1269
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,023
Water floats but also capsize boats.

1270
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,119
A good thing must've something had in it.

1271
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,858
Yet a righteous fighter like Fei-hung.

1272
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,230
should be excusable for drinking a bit more.

1273
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,268
Master, your words are...

1274
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,736
...too profound for me.

1275
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,328
Why?

1276
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,861
What is "excusable"?

1277
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,066
How does "water floats, also capsizes boats"?

1278
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,701
How much drink is a proper portion?

1279
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,556
I won't drink any more.

1280
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,432
You're grown.

1281
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,441
Get up, shame on you.

1282
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,999
go and thank your two friends now.

1283
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,238
Come on, thank them.

1284
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:29,525
Is he naughty?

1285
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,186
Don't touch him. He's asleep.

1286
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,751
Good.

1287
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,274
Come again for treatment tomorrow.

1288
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,008
Does Wong Fei-hung live here?

1289
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:56,984
What if he does?

1290
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,179
I want to get something from him.

1291
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,051
What's it at this late hour?

1292
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,715
I can't tell you.

1293
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,297
Did those men send you here?

1294
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,796
Skirt kick!

1295
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,495
Don't misunderstand.

1296
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,696
You old dog!

1297
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,466
What did you say?

1298
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,041
Have you had enough?

1299
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,458
You're hitting my mom?

1300
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,434
Fei-hung, let me help you.

1301
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,466
He's hitting my belly.

1302
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,278
Dad, help!

1303
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:58,207
Come on!

1304
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,182
Did you get hurt?

1305
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,344
I feigned only to make dad fight.

1306
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:03,885
You brat!

1307
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,079
Fei-hung, he's...

1308
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:12,622
Fei-hung.

1309
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:13,389
Stay where you are!

1310
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,257
Stay where you are!

1311
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,592
We'll join to kill you!

1312
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,132
I told you not to move.

1313
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:18,665
I told you not to move!

1314
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:19,827
OK.

1315
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,826
Are you all right?

1316
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,904
I'm Wong Kei-Ying. And you?

1317
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,373
You're the coach of the Militia.

1318
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,674
I'm Fu Wen-chi.

1319
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,976
The last decorated...

1320
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:34,948
...Manchu officer?

1321
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,142
It's nice seeing you.

1322
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:36,844
Go in.

1323
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:37,385
OK.

1324
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:37,976
Please.

1325
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:38,679
Come.

1326
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:39,510
Please.

1327
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,681
Please.

1328
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,793
Mom, what did dad say?

1329
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,192
Damn the...

1330
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,719
...military honors.

1331
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,890
Don't you understand?

1332
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,790
You won't understand no matter how I explain.

1333
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,191
Everything's in a mess.

1334
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:54,931
Have you found it?

1335
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:55,403
No.

1336
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:56,495
Search closely.

1337
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,571
Fei-hung, have you got it?

1338
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,608
No.

1339
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,868
Where is it put?

1340
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,138
Finished! Finished if it can't be found.

1341
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,441
Tso.

1342
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,349
What are you doing?

1343
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,181
It's hot. I'm keeping cool over here.

1344
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,750
You've a good sense of humor.

1345
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,685
Tso.

1346
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,294
Where's that stone I brought back?

1347
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,321
What stone?

1348
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,000
What's this?

1349
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,126
I don't know.

1350
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,430
Is it the one I brought back?

1351
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:29,300
I don't know.

1352
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,902
I've found it!

1353
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,739
You took it away while I was using it.

1354
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:37,609
Mr. Fu,

1355
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,978
you came from Beijing to Canton,

1356
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,609
and got back the jade seal.

1357
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,050
The jade seal is a Chinese Royal emblem.

1358
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,518
It mustn't be taken away by foreigners.

1359
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,919
Right you are.

1360
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,114
Sir.

1361
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,214
There have so far been over...

1362
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,588
...a dozen Emperors in China.

1363
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,559
Missing one jade seal is not too serious.

1364
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,289
If you tolerate the plunder of a jade seal now,

1365
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,990
tomorrow he may...

1366
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,522
...pull down the Great Wall.

1367
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:01,025
Then our children will have to go aboard...

1368
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,039
...to see Chinese treasure.

1369
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,531
Don't you know why the Allies...

1370
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,272
...invaded Beijing?

1371
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,509
To seize the large territory of China.

1372
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,641
Would they restrain themselves...

1373
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,515
...if you don't collect yourself?

1374
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,316
It's but natural that might wins.

1375
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,880
You won't win respect without spines.

1376
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,290
Anyone gets bulled if he bullies himself,

1377
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,487
understand?

1378
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,693
I do. Thanks for your guidance, sir.

1379
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:28,855
Come on, drink.

1380
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:29,897
Let's drink.

1381
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,604
What happened? Why so quiet?

1382
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,469
Right.

1383
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,235
They left without saying a word.

1384
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,638
Let me go and see if Tsan has come.

1385
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,910
Where's everybody in the street?

1386
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,288
Chop them, kill them!

1387
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,060
What a crowd. Fei-hung, you got first.

1388
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,498
I'll lead.

1389
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:09,726
Fei-hung, grasp it.

1390
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,662
Go, sir.

1391
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,950
How's the situation?

1392
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,049
No problem.

1393
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,790
We Ax Gang...

1394
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,320
...never miss.

1395
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,162
So much the better.

1396
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,627
Fei-hung.

1397
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,935
Come on!

1398
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,831
Sir.

1399
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,280
Undress.

1400
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,839
Undress now!

1401
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,249
OK.

1402
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,354
Catch!

1403
01:08:59,068 --> 01:08:59,625
Follow me!

1404
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,562
After him!

1405
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,111
Run!

1406
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:20,116
What are you doing?

1407
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,850
No boat today. Why stand there?

1408
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,950
Go.

1409
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:24,993
Come quick!

1410
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,220
Sir.

1411
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:45,609
Stop chasing!

1412
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:46,510
Go.

1413
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,381
Sir.

1414
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:50,782
Sir.

1415
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,284
Sir.

1416
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,351
Help him up quick!

1417
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,755
Are you all right?

1418
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,120
Are you all right?

1419
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,293
Sir.

1420
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,459
Sir. Are you all right?

1421
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,431
Sir.

1422
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,230
Sir.

1423
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,895
Sir.

1424
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,396
The jade seal...

1425
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,100
Don't worry, sir, I'll get it back for you.

1426
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,575
We'll get it back for sure.

1427
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,943
Forget it. You can't beat them.

1428
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,005
Sir, hold on.

1429
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,016
I'll help you back to Po Chi Lam.

1430
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,948
My dad will treat you.

1431
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,781
Don't die. He'll help you for sure.

1432
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:25,543
Sir.

1433
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:26,245
Sir.

1434
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,084
Wake up!

1435
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,054
Sir.

1436
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,181
Sir.

1437
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,691
What's on your mind?

1438
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,929
Nothing.

1439
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,343
Tsan.

1440
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:57,379
Fei-hung.

1441
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,216
Why didn't you tell me you would come here?

1442
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,409
Neither did you.

1443
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,356
Have you found the jade seal?

1444
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,018
I'd have left if I had found it. Come.

1445
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,361
It's pitch dark. Have you brought fire?

1446
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,233
Yes.

1447
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,498
Light it quick!

1448
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,205
Welcome.

1449
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,109
You want to get back this.

1450
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,448
You really are too naive.

1451
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,577
I've already taken photos of you.

1452
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:13,554
Intrusion into a consulate means invasion.

1453
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,716
I can punish you any way I like.

1454
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,851
Kill us if you've the guts.

1455
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,402
Good.

1456
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:39,872
Do you understand what I said?

1457
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:40,937
Yes.

1458
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,720
We planned to buy the land...

1459
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:50,918
...of Po Chi Lam, but failed.

1460
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:54,326
Now we've thrown out those boxers

1461
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:57,526
Right, Po Chi Lam has been in power for too long

1462
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,591
Now it's our turn.

1463
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,626
Send someone to Po Chi Lam,

1464
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,537
and tell him his son sneaked...

1465
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:05,904
...into our consulate illegally.

1466
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,032
and see what he says.

1467
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,599
Only if he agrees to sell the land...

1468
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,906
...of Sha Min to us cheap,

1469
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,412
we'll free his son.

1470
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,312
And we can sit back and relax.

1471
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,409
He really is foolhardy.

1472
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,352
A consulate is foreign territory.

1473
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,379
Any intruders are shot on sight.

1474
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,856
I'll go and talk...

1475
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:23,357
...sense with them.

1476
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:24,723
Sit down!

1477
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,851
You think it so easy?

1478
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,758
It's already vexing enough...

1479
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,524
...to have a son captured.

1480
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:29,994
They merely wanted to be heroes.

1481
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,624
They're not criminals.

1482
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,964
It was all your fault.

1483
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,798
You taught him patriotism

1484
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,070
You lack the dignity of a mother.

1485
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,004
Are you blaming it on me?

1486
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,441
Try to do something, I beg you.

1487
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,409
I can't.

1488
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,412
Nor can I.

1489
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,940
The truth is obvious.

1490
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,144
The British are after the land of Sha Min.

1491
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,208
You mean giving it...

1492
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:51,617
...away to them?

1493
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,315
If he wants to be a hero, let him,

1494
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,221
and don't take him for a son.

1495
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,527
If you won't help your son,

1496
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,085
I'll beg his mother to.

1497
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,128
Sister, your son's in trouble

1498
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,661
and now none wants to help him.

1499
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,038
Please show me your divine powers.

1500
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,202
Release them.

1501
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,447
OK, release them.

1502
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,836
Are you all right?

1503
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,667
Your mom's over there.

1504
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,566
Master Wong.

1505
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,010
Mom.

1506
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,171
They've beaten you badly.

1507
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,513
I've beaten them even worse.

1508
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:56,940
Auntie.

1509
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,586
Master, are you all right?

1510
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,451
Yes, only a bruise.

1511
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,150
Master, where are we moving to?

1512
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,350
What do you mean?

1513
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,792
Master Wong has sold the land in Sha Min.

1514
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,158
What?

1515
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,261
What had dad done?

1516
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,060
To help you, Master Wong did it.

1517
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,566
He sold the land...

1518
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,626
...cheap to the consulate.

1519
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:19,034
Fei-hung, I covered up for you each time,

1520
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,304
but not now.

1521
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,674
You like to...

1522
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,076
...butt in?

1523
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,808
I regret not having taken dad's advise.

1524
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,917
It's not too late for you to repent now.

1525
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,887
Learn a lesson...

1526
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:36,220
...and forget the past.

1527
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,156
Take it as a lesson.

1528
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,991
Go back.

1529
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,467
When will there be sailing for HK?

1530
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,466
In 10 days.

1531
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,501
Have you completed production?

1532
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:54,837
No problem.

1533
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,472
Good.

1534
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,169
Close the factory...

1535
01:16:58,213 --> 01:16:59,771
...for the time being lay them off.

1536
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,908
After the shipment leaves,

1537
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,178
find cheaper workers.

1538
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,218
Yes.

1539
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,559
They always force us to work overtime.

1540
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,323
If we refuse, they beat us up.

1541
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,524
Now they dismiss us...

1542
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,829
...without paying.

1543
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,926
and we have...

1544
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:21,993
...to starve.

1545
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,902
There are no good foreigners.

1546
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,233
Tsan, what happened?

1547
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,365
Let's talk about that later.

1548
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,773
The one who hit us is the foreman...

1549
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,470
...of the steel factory.

1550
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:30,603
Right.

1551
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,777
Tsan, forget it.

1552
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,338
The less trouble the better.

1553
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,544
What? That kid's cocky.

1554
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,553
He beat us if we refused to work OT.

1555
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,179
And he stops our work at will too.

1556
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,588
Look, they've promised us nothing.

1557
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,053
How could the factory have suddenly closed?

1558
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,116
I've lately found they've...

1559
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,560
...been acting furtively.

1560
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,827
They must be up to no good.

1561
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,329
Fei-hung, what now?

1562
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,496
Go with Uncle Hing...

1563
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:57,095
...see what's happened.

1564
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,697
Is there really something fishy?

1565
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:00,904
Then we'll try to do something, okay?

1566
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:01,874
Let's go.

1567
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,894
Looks valuable.

1568
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:20,690
Why's the curio hidden...

1569
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,526
...in the steel for shipment.

1570
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:23,621
I'll go and tell them.

1571
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:24,689
Go quick.

1572
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:57,693
Go quick.

1573
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:05,930
Quick.

1574
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:06,564
Go quick.

1575
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,199
Go.

1576
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:10,739
This way.

1577
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,136
Get them!

1578
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,279
Run quick!

1579
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:20,813
Leave me alone!

1580
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:37,933
Shit!

1581
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,636
Young master, we're leaving.

1582
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:44,676
Go into hiding!

1583
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,109
Bye.

1584
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,411
Madam, we're leaving.

1585
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,247
Good, take care on the journey.

1586
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:51,908
Mind your belly.

1587
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,181
I will.

1588
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,287
Fei-hung.

1589
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,547
Dad.

1590
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,218
Keep on writing.

1591
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,853
You know what to do.

1592
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,521
I'll remember what you said.

1593
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:03,758
I'll visit the drought zone for a few days.

1594
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,794
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

1595
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,566
Take care now that...

1596
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:09,695
...you're pregnant.

1597
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:10,737
I will.

1598
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,738
I must leave.

1599
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,403
Master, I want to have a word with you.

1600
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,275
If it's a son,

1601
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,678
call him Wong Tai.

1602
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:20,237
Yes.

1603
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:21,579
If a daughter, call her Wong Fei.

1604
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,683
OK.

1605
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,716
You're only 4 months' pregnant, still early.

1606
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,345
It may be premature.

1607
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,981
It's taboo.

1608
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:29,956
I'll be away for a few days only.

1609
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:30,753
Good.

1610
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,654
Fei-hung, remember.

1611
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:34,956
Yes.

1612
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,088
Master Wong, time to leave.

1613
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:36,858
Coming.

1614
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,332
I'll rein Fei-hung in.

1615
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,232
Take good care on the road. Come back early.

1616
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,236
Take care.

1617
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:44,537
You may come out.

1618
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,203
They really ship away the Chinese treasure.

1619
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:53,077
Wonder how Uncle Hing's.

1620
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,240
I've got him involved.

1621
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:55,112
Don't be silly.

1622
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,412
No Chinese would tolerate...

1623
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,420
...seeing treasures being shipped away.

1624
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:00,818
What now, mom?

1625
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,089
Come with me.

1626
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,289
Mom, where are you going?

1627
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,759
Beat the bastard!

1628
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:08,751
Dad said...

1629
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,525
Madam, you're pregnant.

1630
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:14,129
Only 4 months, nothing serious.

1631
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,530
Auntie, we told Master Wong...

1632
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:19,131
...nothing would happen to you.

1633
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,773
Right, that son of the bitch is lucky.

1634
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,744
Tell Fun to get helpers.

1635
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,439
Fine, I'm on my way.

1636
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,109
See you at the bridgehead.

1637
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,042
Fei-hung, let's go.

1638
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:30,744
Come.

1639
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:33,348
We're leaving.

1640
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:33,911
Take care.

1641
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:34,478
Yes.

1642
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,250
If anything happens to me,

1643
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:36,780
take care of my dad.

1644
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,349
Damn your dirty mouth!

1645
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,223
One without ambitions...

1646
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,626
...is not my worthy son!

1647
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:41,890
I'm leaving.

1648
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,888
Fei-hung.

1649
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,067
Don't ever come back if you get beaten.

1650
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,233
Yes, mom.

1651
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,506
Protest unreasonable closure,

1652
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,204
demand reasonable compensation!

1653
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,008
Protest unreasonable closure,

1654
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,207
demand reasonable compensation!

1655
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,842
Don't get carried away

1656
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,173
What are you doing here? Go away!

1657
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:34,511
Hand over the treasure or we won't let you go

1658
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,446
Bullshit!

1659
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:36,514
You bullshit!

1660
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,178
Hand over Uncle Hing quickly...

1661
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,652
...or we'll be nasty.

1662
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,052
So what?

1663
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,891
Throw them out!

1664
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:56,435
Don't move!

1665
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,029
Don't shoot!

1666
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,591
Fei-hung, come and rescue Uncle Hing!

1667
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,002
Come on!

1668
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,211
Fei-hung.

1669
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,085
Don't.

1670
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,418
Go and rescue Uncle Hing.

1671
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:07,817
I know where he is.

1672
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:09,329
Good. Keep an eye on him.

1673
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,699
Wong Fei-hung's rushing in!

1674
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:22,402
Stop him!

1675
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:23,239
Yes.

1676
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,260
Wait.

1677
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,689
Don't you know what you're doing?

1678
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,462
He's helping foreigners ship away...

1679
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:48,867
...China's treasure. Why help him?

1680
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,597
State treasure? What about our empty stomach?

1681
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,973
Others will do it if they don't.

1682
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,568
I won't let you do it.

1683
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,577
Have you got the guts?

1684
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,911
We saw through...

1685
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,179
...you as you tripped.

1686
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,982
Didn't that consulate beating hurt enough?

1687
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,952
I want to try it again.

1688
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:10,718
Fine, I'll get you carried away horizontally.

1689
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,649
Too much talk.

1690
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,161
Go kill him.

1691
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,161
Act!

1692
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:17,758
Act!

1693
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:18,524
Come on!

1694
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,327
Finish him off!

1695
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,190
Come on!

1696
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:23,723
Drag him over, quick!

1697
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,449
Drunken boxing.

1698
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,020
Just so-so.

1699
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,790
Come on.

1700
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:32,081
I also have a fist.

1701
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,821
Water floats but also capsizes boats

1702
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,168
Now you are beyond help

1703
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:53,350
Fit to it

1704
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:56,222
Dawn you

1705
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,331
Mr. Wong, thank your son for his efforts...

1706
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:29,359
...to protect a national antique.

1707
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,337
You really are a good father.

1708
01:38:31,438 --> 01:38:33,269
General, we might as well tell you.

1709
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,036
Master taught Fei-hung...

1710
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,771
...drunken boxing.

1711
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:38,505
Really?

1712
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:39,876
So your drunken boxing is even more powerful?

1713
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:40,903
Yes, thank you.

1714
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:42,882
Like father like son.

1715
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,779
Where's Fei-hung?

1716
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,045
General,

1717
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,247
to demonstrate his boxing,

1718
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:49,847
Fei-hung wrongly took industrial...

1719
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,051
...alcohol affecting his eyes.

1720
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:54,923
But the doctor said it can be treated.

1721
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:55,826
He's so active,

1722
01:38:55,863 --> 01:38:57,558
he'll be sorry if he can't see anything.

1723
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,361
This is only a temporary symptom.

1724
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:00,490
Over here.

1725
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,727
Take photos.

1726
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:04,496
Let's go in to see him.

1727
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:05,060
Good, good.

1728
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:05,798
Please, please.

1729
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:06,737
Hang it up.

1730
01:39:08,809 --> 01:39:10,003
He's here.

1731
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:20,444
What's he doing?

1732
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:21,715
Practicing blind boxing.

1733
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:26,116
Master, he's a quack.

1734
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,151
He said the alcohol not only ruined his eyes,

1735
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:29,685
but his brain too.
