1
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,445
She must be killed!

2
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,319
She was chosen
to bear his child.

3
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:09,836
<i>If she lives to bring about the End
of Days, there will be no redemption.</i>

4
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,796
All our souls
will perish.

5
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,437
Tomaso.

6
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:03,443
<i>Okay,
now give me a big push.</i>

7
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,655
That's it.
You're doing great.

8
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:08,594
<i>That's it. Okay, stop pushing.
...five, six, seven...</i>

9
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,523
<i>I have the baby's head.</i>

10
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,694
Don't push yet.

11
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:16,246
One little push oughta finish
this off. One little push.

12
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:20,855
You have
a beautiful baby girl.

13
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:29,181
She's so beautiful!

14
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,279
Just gonna take her
and clean her up.

15
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,174
Not yet. Hospital rules.

16
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,183
Please. You'll have her
back before you know it.

17
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,779
Here she is.

18
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,346
All fresh and clean.

19
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,897
You thought of a name
for her yet? Christine.

20
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,423
Her name is Christine.

21
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:39,661
Happy birthday,
Christine.

22
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,822
<i>WBAZ time is 8:06.</i>

23
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,666
<i>Three more nights, New York. Three
more nights left in the century.</i>

24
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:58,580
<i>Three more nights left
in the millennium.</i>

25
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,231
<i>Three more nights
until every computer fails.</i>

26
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:05,491
<i>Three more nights until the biggest
celebration in the history of this city...</i>

27
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,412
<i>starts in Times Square.</i>

28
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:09,365
<i>Where will you be?</i>

29
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:14,541
<i>Hey, Bobby, come over
here. Something weird's goin'on.</i>

30
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:24,816
What do you got there,
Charlie? I don't know.

31
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,637
<i>Pressure's climbin' off
the gauge.</i>

32
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,908
Go the other way!

33
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,373
Excuse me.

34
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,741
What the hell are you...

35
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,793
<i>You're on Gotham Talk.
Say something interesting.</i>

36
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,033
<i>I'm trying to figure out
what everyone's predicting here.</i>

37
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,419
<i>Is the world going to come to an end
at exactly 12:01 on New Year's, or...</i>

38
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,982
<i>I'll tell you
what. You should play it safe,</i>

39
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:13,910
<i>not quit yourjob
just yet.</i>

40
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,982
<i>Tell you something else:
In two more nights,</i>

41
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:18,227
<i>this place is gonna see
the wildest party ever.</i>

42
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,427
<i>We're gonna be there with the first hundred
callers, we're gonna make the most noise,</i>

43
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:24,366
<i>and we're gonna be the craziest,
and if the world comes to an end,</i>

44
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,329
<i>what the hell,
we're all gonna be together!</i>

45
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:28,498
<i>And if it doesn't,
and I don't think it will,</i>

46
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>then we'll all have the best
time anybody has ever had.</i>

47
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,224
<i>Let's go. We're gonna be late.</i>

48
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,763
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

49
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:10,389
I was just
pulling myself together.

50
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:13,081
It's gonna
take a lot more pulling.

51
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,151
<i>You are looking
very sharp this morning.</i>

52
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,638
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,712
You got about five minutes
to get ready. Here.

54
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,759
There's enough caffeine in this
to kill an elephant.

55
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,095
Oughta get you
started.

56
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,119
- So what's today?
- Transport.

57
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,285
Anyone special?

58
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,615
No, just some
Wall Street scumbag.

59
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:46,913
Why the hell does he need
all this protection?

60
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:48,922
Well, I guess he fucked
with some people...

61
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,713
<i>that didn't like
being fucked with.</i>

62
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,353
Personally, I like scumbags.
They pay better.

63
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,484
They say breakfast is the
most important meal of the day.

64
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,336
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

65
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,449
<i>Striker One, F.D.R. Drive...</i>

66
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:31,489
<i>Follow Three, F.D.R. Southbound.</i>

67
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:34,180
<i>Striker One, stay close.</i>

68
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,138
<i>Striker Four... Okay, you zeroes.</i>

69
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,341
These people are
paying us good money.

70
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,575
Get your heads out of your asses
and start earning those paychecks.

71
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,619
<i>Follow Three,
give me a visual sweep.</i>

72
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:46,539
<i>Striker One,
rooftops 125 to 136 clear.</i>

73
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:51,754
<i>- Keep them clear.
- Striker Four, advise and contact the...</i>

74
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,530
<i>Follow Three is on
approach. E. T.A., two minutes.</i>

75
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:59,394
<i>Striker One, Follow Two and Three to
report tight formation. Do you copy?</i>

76
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,988
<i>- Air One, make a final sweep.
- Roger that.</i>

77
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:10,317
<i>Follow Three.
We have nest in sight.</i>

78
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,587
<i>Air One,
westbound over zone two.</i>

79
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,463
<i>Ten seconds out.</i>

80
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:30,188
<i>Roger. Ten seconds.</i>

81
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,495
<i>Follow Three, we have arrived.</i>

82
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:34,734
Keep everyone close.

83
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:42,290
<i>- We're exposed.
- Roger.</i>

84
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:53,647
<i>Sky Two,
fire escape, southwest corner.</i>

85
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:57,331
Fire escape's negative.

86
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:14,994
You're wrong! Shooter!
Evac! Evac!

87
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:17,169
Get in the car!

88
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:43,706
Call N.Y.P.D.!
Get me an ambulance!

89
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,838
<i>- What the hell's goin' on?
- I see him! I see him!</i>

90
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:49,145
Shit!

91
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:54,230
Oh, shit! Tell me
you remembered! Come on!

92
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,812
Get up,
you pussy.

93
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,198
Where's the shooter?

94
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,213
- Headed for the roof.
- So are we.

95
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,903
Sky Two, get the fuck
down here, now!

96
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,715
Come on! Hurry!

97
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,295
Take us up there!

98
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,613
Move in! Move in!

99
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,591
- Set us down! Hurry!
- There's too much crap on that roof!

100
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,514
<i>- We'll tear off the main rotor.
- Then get us down as low as you can!</i>

101
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,361
<i>Hurry now! Go!</i>

102
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,118
Strap me in!

103
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:44,225
You're good!

104
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,634
He's gonna jump off the roof! Shit!

105
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:28,809
He's got him!

106
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,080
Gun! Gun!

107
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:09,943
<i>Oculus Dei!
The thousand years has ended!</i>

108
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,382
The Dark Angel is loosed
from his prison!

109
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:15,383
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your head.

110
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,816
You don't know
what you've done!

111
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,077
- Get down, or I'll put you down!
- The thousand years has ended!

112
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,381
You don't know
what you've done!

113
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,677
Priest that drinks.
Can't be all bad.

114
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:10,304
I think the police
may want that at some point.

115
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,743
- They call it evidence.
- I like to get a head start.

116
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,272
- No reason to make it easy for them.
- Yeah.

117
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,407
All right.

118
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,173
<i>Watch the lines.
Go through here.</i>

119
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:29,222
She doesn't look happy
with the statements.

120
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,738
Should've just killed that son
of a bitch. Less paperwork. Yeah.

121
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,461
Hey, Detective. Bobby.
Hey, Jer, it's been a while.

122
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:39,241
Hey. How are you, Marge?
Can't complain. You?

123
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,577
It's a nice day to jump
out of a helicopter.

124
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,783
Well, just doing
my job.

125
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,761
Now, listen. Something I gotta ask you.

126
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,706
<i>Yeah, what is
it? You still drinking?</i>

127
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,885
<i>Oh, yeah, we got
all liquored up this morning.</i>

128
00:22:50,956 --> 00:22:53,706
- We start every day that way.
- I'm just reading his statement.

129
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:57,189
You said here the guy
spoke to you. Yeah. So what?

130
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:59,913
The guy doesn't
have a tongue.

131
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:02,983
- What?
- He has no tongue?

132
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:06,600
Why don't I just leave
that little detail out for now.

133
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,638
<i>No big deal, right? Are you
saying that I imagined all this?</i>

134
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:12,166
No, I'm just saying.
I saved a life today.

135
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,127
What the hell did you
do? All right, let it go.

136
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,397
- No, no. I know what I heard.
- All right.

137
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:19,149
<i>Those people who don't
belong here, get them out of here.</i>

138
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:21,126
Make sure this place
is secure.

139
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:41,160
A drunk hangs out in a neighborhood
bar, passes out enough times,

140
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:44,050
people would know where he
lived from carrying him home.

141
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:45,970
I mean,
it's one thing I know.

142
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:48,305
Yeah, well, it's important
to be an expert at something.

143
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:51,537
Oh, it took years of
research. This must be it.

144
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:04,433
What do you want
to bet it's rent-controlled?

145
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,003
Well, I don't think
this is paint.

146
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:39,000
A real art buff.

147
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:42,264
I don't go for this
look. It's just too damn busy.

148
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:56,119
Listen to this.

149
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,492
"I have seen the Earth
laid to waste.

150
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,610
<i>"I have seen the horror to come. Is
it a sin to wish you were never born?</i>

151
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,362
<i>"The thousand years
have ended.</i>

152
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,660
Twenty... seven."

153
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:12,728
<i>It ends in a football
score. That's nice.</i>

154
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,071
<i>Hey, I found something.</i>

155
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:22,618
Can you see
what it is?

156
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,043
His tongue.

157
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,365
<i>He must have
cut it out himself.</i>

158
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:39,454
Okay. And why is it someone
would cut out their own tongue?

159
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:42,623
To keep from talking. Right.

160
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,996
Well, I could eat.

161
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:51,298
Ah!

162
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,951
- Shit!
- What?

163
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,669
All right, I knew
that was gonna happen.

164
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,123
No, it's all right.

165
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:02,107
There's something
in here.

166
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,786
Have you ever seen her before? Nah.

167
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:43,750
<i>This guy is no ordinary hit man.</i>

168
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,795
No, this one's
extraordinary.

169
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:48,619
Let's get the hell outta here.
This place is making me itch.

170
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:52,679
- Drop it! Don't move! Don't move! Freeze!
- Don't move! Freeze!

171
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:56,134
Oh. It's us.

172
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,389
<i>Jesus! How the hell
did you two find this place?</i>

173
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:03,431
Lucky guess. So what did you find out?

174
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,992
His name's Thomas
Aquinas. He's a priest.

175
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:08,039
Why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

176
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:11,461
- A homicidal priest. That's good.
- Yeah? Well, it gets better.

177
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,603
He studied at the Vatican. He was
one of their alleged visionaries.

178
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:17,390
Came here in '81 to St.
John's Church downtown.

179
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,109
<i>Six months ago,
he disappeared.</i>

180
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,545
Priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.

181
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,912
Oh, yeah.
That's what this is about.

182
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:28,044
Spiritual crisis.
Doesn't make any sense.

183
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,766
<i>What's a priest doing shooting
at a Wall Street banker?</i>

184
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:34,632
<i>A Wall Street banker, by the
way, who suddenly disappeared.</i>

185
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,530
Maybe we should ask the girl.

186
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:38,800
What girl?

187
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,185
<i>Uh, the guy. The guy. Priest
guy.</i>

188
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,565
There's five million
women living in New York City.

189
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,525
How we gonna find her
without a name?

190
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,098
Here.

191
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:43,292
Look, I already gave you some
money. Can you just move on, please?

192
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:46,837
He's comin' for you.
He's comin' for you, Christine.

193
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:48,916
How do you know
my name?

194
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:52,634
He's gonna fuck you. He's gonna
fuck you, Christine. Can you see him?

195
00:28:52,702 --> 00:28:54,843
- Can you see him?
- Who are you?

196
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,049
<i>How do you know
my name?</i>

197
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,116
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.

198
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:22,141
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

199
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,939
The thousand years
have ended.

200
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:27,043
Thousand years have ended.

201
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,725
"When the thousand years
are ended,

202
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,927
Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison."

203
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:35,316
<i>"Twenty... seven."</i>

204
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,725
<i>Christine?</i>

205
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:53,355
<i>Christine? I'll be there in a sec!</i>

206
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,135
Doctor's office.

207
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,088
Hello.
Is Dr. Abel in, please?

208
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,008
Who's calling, please?
It's Christine York.

209
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:17,369
<i>Christine, listen to me.
We've been over this before.</i>

210
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:21,907
It's a terrible thing to lose your
parents. I know it was a long time ago.

211
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:25,394
The holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.

212
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:30,617
Understand, these dreams are your
creation. There's nothing real about them.

213
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,476
You control them.
They don't control you.

214
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,547
Take another Xanax
to relieve your anxiety.

215
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:43,484
You are fine. Trust me.

216
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:49,204
Another vision?
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,272
<i>I didn't want you to worry. I'm your
stepmother. It's my job to worry.</i>

218
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:55,197
No big deal, really.

219
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:58,907
<i>Just someone on the subway car
turned into porcelain and shattered.</i>

220
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:02,358
<i>What's wrong with me? Why do I
see things? Why am I so different?</i>

221
00:33:02,432 --> 00:33:06,524
Oh, you don't know
how special you are.

222
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:09,756
You're better than everybody
else. Just remember that.

223
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:12,640
I don't want to be better or
worse. I want to be normal.

224
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:16,284
I want a normal life.
You have to have patience.

225
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:18,689
All good things will come
to you. You'll see.

226
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:29,880
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry, we're closed.

227
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:33,088
I would like to talk to
you about Thomas Aquinas.

228
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:35,229
Father, please, I need you
downstairs. Just take these.

229
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,156
Father, please.
Go.

230
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:43,613
I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

231
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:46,500
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

232
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,453
There was no one else
on that fire escape.

233
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,316
You don't understand. I understand
getting shot at, and I don't like it.

234
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:55,140
He shot at you? No,
he shot at my client.

235
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:58,273
- I happened to get in the way.
- Who's your client?

236
00:33:58,343 --> 00:34:02,337
That's irrelevant right now. What I want to
know is why would a priest try to kill someone?

237
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,565
You've been drinking. I've got 14
years sober, and I can spot that.

238
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:10,430
Well, good for you. Your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone?

239
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,447
Yes, he was working for God.

240
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:15,140
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker?

241
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:17,959
There's a lot that you don't know.
You think you've seen everything?

242
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:20,132
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

243
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:24,000
There's another world out there.
Thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.

244
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:28,037
I've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.

245
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,686
Yeah, well, wait a few days.
What happens in a few days?

246
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:34,090
<i>Did Thomas tell you
about a girl?</i>

247
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,267
- No.
- I see. Do you believe in God?

248
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,096
Maybe once,
but not anymore.

249
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,207
What happened?

250
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:49,667
We had a difference of opinion.

251
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:54,020
I thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and He felt otherwise.

252
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:58,318
I'm sorry to hear about the loss. Maybe
it's time for you to renew your faith.

253
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:02,057
This girl.

254
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:04,333
Is she in trouble?
Does she need help?

255
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,248
I have a lot of things to do
here. Excuse me. Excuse me.

256
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:10,095
I have more questions, if you don't
mind. I've got a question for you.

257
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,911
If you don't believe in God, how
can you understand his adversary?

258
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:17,201
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime?

259
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:20,300
I'm sure that you
can find your way out.

260
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,218
- How many have received the stigmata?
- She's the third this week.

261
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:08,213
<i>- What is she saying?
- For your own good, get out and forget what you've seen!</i>

262
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:12,373
Was Thomas part of this? There are forces
at work you couldn't possibly comprehend!

263
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:15,028
<i>Now, please,
leave!</i>

264
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,127
<i>No, it's just I hate the fact that
they put finals after the holiday.</i>

265
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:22,138
It ruins the whole meaning of vacation.

266
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:24,798
I wouldn't worry.
You always do fine.

267
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,878
Besides, a bad grade
isn't the end of the world.

268
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:43,229
It's you.

269
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,440
I didn't...
Where is she?

270
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,478
The girl is safe.
And what of the world?

271
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:51,170
Everything is
as planned.

272
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,628
Our acts go unnoticed,
unquestioned.

273
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,071
<i>- We're everywhere.
- Daddy, who is it?</i>

274
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:07,585
<i>- Is this your daughter?
- Yes.</i>

275
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:14,279
<i>- And this is your wife?
- Yes.</i>

276
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:25,647
What's wrong, baby? What's
wrong? It was a dream.

277
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:28,619
He came for me again.
It's only a dream, angel.

278
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:31,660
It felt closer.

279
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,349
<i>Throughout
the country, the National Guard...</i>

280
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,364
<i>has been put on alert
as a precaution...</i>

281
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:42,893
<i>Mayor Giuliani
urged all citizens and police...</i>

282
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,876
<i>to stay calm
during this holiday season.</i>

283
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:47,820
<i>No explanations for
how blood on the hands of the Christ child,</i>

284
00:39:47,895 --> 00:39:50,284
<i>depicted in Michelangelo's
famous sculpture of the Pieta...</i>

285
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:52,694
<i>...atmosphere of fear
and panic, random acts of violence...</i>

286
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,411
<i>are being attributed to satanic
cults who seem determined...</i>

287
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,335
<i>to disrupt New Year's
celebrations throughout the world.</i>

288
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:58,775
<i>Here in New York...</i>

289
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,459
Sorry, pal,
you can't come in here.

290
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:22,167
Ahh. The young boys that you seduced
have left their scent upon you.

291
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:27,732
Remember who it is
that you serve. Hmm?

292
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,154
<i>Open your eyes, Thomas.</i>

293
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,587
Look. Look at the face that has haunted
your dreams for a thousand years.

294
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,694
They say you can
see the future, Thomas.

295
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:28,024
Then you must know exactly
what I'm going to do to you.

296
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,347
<i>I don't know what
we hope to get from this guy.</i>

297
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:34,306
He's got no fuckin'
tongue. He can write.

298
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,419
Fuck me.

299
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,260
<i>There is still no explanation...</i>

300
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:12,103
<i>for the devastating explosions
that rocked midtown two nights ago.</i>

301
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:14,209
In the wake
of Tuesday night's explosion,

302
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,886
investigators from the New York City Fire
Department are still at a loss to explain...

303
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:23,298
<i>why the restaurant suddenly burst into
flames, killing at least 35 people.</i>

304
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,948
- Hey, asshole, watch where you're going.
- Hey, I like the shirt.

305
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:28,426
Screw you, man!

306
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:35,203
Hey, kid.

307
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:41,378
<i>Nice shirt.</i>

308
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,491
<i>I'm tellin'you, no one entered
the room. Maybe he did it himself.</i>

309
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:35,444
Then how did he get
the last scalpel in!

310
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:37,297
Oh, my God.

311
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,293
- It just keeps getting better.
- I've never seen anything like this.

312
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:48,274
<i>I think this
is written in Latin.</i>

313
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:52,085
"When the thousand years
has ended,

314
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:57,552
Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison."

315
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:01,518
Uh, this next part is not clear.
L- I-I think it's in English.

316
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:03,730
<i>It says, "Christ...</i>

317
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,063
Christ in New York."

318
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,999
<i>Christ!</i>

319
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:23,542
Well, it's official. I'm never
sleeping again, ever. You okay?

320
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:29,651
A guy cuts words into his chest.
Someone else nails him to the ceiling.

321
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:32,091
What's not okay?

322
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:34,229
So where we going?

323
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,617
The girl. I gotta talk to
her, find out what she knows.

324
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:39,580
Wait. We don't have
a name. That would help.

325
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:43,988
Maybe we do. Maybe it's
not "Christ in New York."

326
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:47,640
Maybe it's, "Chris in New
York," "Christine in New York."

327
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,981
"Christine York." Let's run a D.M.V. Check
and find out if any of those names come up.

328
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,968
<i>Hello, Christine York.</i>

329
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:01,887
Sometimes you border
on competent.

330
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:05,503
<i>I know. It's scary, isn't it?</i>

331
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:14,744
<i>Christine?</i>

332
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:17,468
Mabel called. She'd like you to
get dressed and join her for lunch.

333
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:19,392
<i>Grazie, Carson.</i>

334
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,653
Ahhh! Goddamn it,
get off me!

335
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,701
<i>Go downstairs and watch
the front door! Please!</i>

336
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:00,525
Help! There is no sanctuary but heaven.

337
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:02,795
You must go there now.

338
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:05,733
- What are you doing?
- I commend you to Almighty God and entrust you...

339
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:07,979
<i>At what point
is this considered...</i>

340
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:10,698
interfering with
a police investigation?

341
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:14,631
Hey, we are private citizens having
a conversation with another citizen.

342
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:18,503
I mean, I don't think they've found a
way to outlaw that. At least not yet.

343
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:22,187
<i>Please! No!</i>

344
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:27,757
May you return
to Him who formed...

345
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,181
Go down there. Do whatever you can. I
need more time to finish the last rites.

346
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:41,075
May Christ, the true shepherd...

347
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:43,028
<i>Help! Stairs.</i>

348
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:44,947
Covered.

349
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:49,075
<i>Help!</i>

350
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:55,888
May you see
your redeemer...

351
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,141
...forever, amen.

352
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:44,787
Son of a bitch!

353
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:08,890
You all right?

354
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,514
Yeah. Check the body
down the stairs.

355
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,210
What body?

356
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:18,328
Call the police,
and get an ambulance.

357
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,962
Take it easy.
We're the good guys.

358
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:26,424
<i>All right?
What happened?</i>

359
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:31,933
Carson. Those men... Th-Those men...

360
00:49:32,004 --> 00:49:34,208
They tried to kill me.

361
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:36,611
Why?

362
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:40,354
<i>Eight jets, variable speed.
That's what I call dying in style.</i>

363
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,461
What kind of girl lives in
a house like this, anyway?

364
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:44,475
Oh, she's an orphan.
Both parents deceased.

365
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:47,418
After the mother died, the
home nurse married the father.

366
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,468
Now the nurse is
the sole guardian.

367
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:52,128
I think it's adorable the
way you talk like a real cop.

368
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,784
Yeah? So you think after they
clean up this mess, we could...

369
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:57,027
<i>Don't tempt me. Soak a little?</i>

370
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:28,548
They relax me. You want
one? Oh, no, thanks. I drink.

371
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:32,904
My little girl had one
just like it. Really?

372
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:36,933
Mm-hmm. Yeah? You snoop through
her stuff without asking too?

373
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:39,142
When I was looking
for something.

374
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:41,635
What are you
looking for?

375
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,564
A connection.

376
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:46,629
Most days, I don't feel
connected to anyone.

377
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:49,867
I noticed a lot
of religious books outside.

378
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:51,975
Mm. They're
my stepmother's.

379
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:54,731
- Is she a big believer?
- No, not really.

380
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:57,220
It's mostly just kind of
like a hobby with her.

381
00:50:57,295 --> 00:51:00,427
Do you know a priest by
the name of Thomas Aquinas?

382
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:03,213
No. Is that
your connection, religion?

383
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:05,189
I've seen a lot
of attempted murders,

384
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:07,785
but I've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.

385
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,712
<i>Christine? In here!</i>

386
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:14,536
Are you all right? Oh, my God,
I just heard what happened!

387
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,464
Did they
hurt you?

388
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:18,537
I'm okay, but Carson...

389
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,163
I know. Oh.

390
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,264
I'm just so glad you
came along when you did.

391
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:27,317
Thanks.

392
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:55,383
I didn't realize you knew where the
library was, let alone had a card.

393
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,964
Well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

394
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,598
<i>They're right outside.</i>

395
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:07,152
<i>You must
bring her. He is waiting for her.</i>

396
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,193
No, that's impossible! They'll
follow me and find the temple!

397
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,905
I couldn't convince her to come here.

398
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:24,084
Yuck! Then I shall
have to go to her.

399
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:26,163
<i>Did I mention
I had a date tonight?</i>

400
00:52:26,236 --> 00:52:28,341
Not just the inflatable
kind. A real live girl.

401
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,517
Did you break up
with the inflatable one?

402
00:52:30,588 --> 00:52:34,418
Yeah. She was
just too needy.

403
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,981
Everything
was about her.

404
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,639
It's just that this is starting
to feel a lot like work.

405
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,322
<i>Normally, I wouldn't mind
work because, well, you know,</i>

406
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,365
<i>we'd be
getting paid.</i>

407
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,341
Watching rich people for free.
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

408
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,885
Okay, I'll wait here.

409
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:04,508
- Change your mind about the pill?
- I found something.

410
00:53:07,073 --> 00:53:10,172
Christine, what are you
doing? Why is that man here?

411
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:12,097
I'll be
five minutes.

412
00:53:12,163 --> 00:53:15,480
<i>She loves me to death, but she's
a little overprotective.</i>

413
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:41,051
I took this from one
of your attackers.

414
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,548
Did you show that to the police? No.

415
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:47,453
If I did, it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one of their large shelves.

416
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:51,303
That's pretty cynical. Well, I've
put a few of those envelopes...

417
00:53:51,368 --> 00:53:53,734
up on that
large shelf myself.

418
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,451
I used to be a cop.

419
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,757
Now, this amulet
is from a Masonic order...

420
00:53:58,824 --> 00:54:01,923
in a former sub-herald
of the Vatican knights.

421
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:04,034
<i>The Knights of the Holy See.</i>

422
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:07,140
<i>They await the return
of the Dark Angel to Earth.</i>

423
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,592
So, the men that attacked
me are devil worshippers?

424
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:13,765
No. This says
they're the good guys.

425
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,802
They're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshippers.

426
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,008
Those were the good guys? What
does that have to do with me?

427
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:33,538
I'm sorry. I have
a medical condition.

428
00:54:33,613 --> 00:54:37,924
- Sometimes I see things that aren't there.
- No. I saw it too.

429
00:55:04,913 --> 00:55:06,823
I've been having visions
ever since I can remember,

430
00:55:06,897 --> 00:55:09,287
but I've never
shared one before.

431
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:11,217
There must be
an explanation.

432
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:13,584
I hope so. I've been waiting
all my life to hear it.

433
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:14,074
Let's get out of here! Come on!

434
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,700
You're not going anywhere.

435
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,975
- What are you doing?
- There's no time to discuss this.

436
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:23,415
<i>After all these years of waiting, it's
finally happening. What's happening?</i>

437
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:25,274
<i>You can't run away now!</i>

438
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:30,296
<i>- Stop
it! - Let her go! - No!</i>

439
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,613
Don't you love me?

440
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:44,597
Didn't I give you
everything?

441
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:48,185
Haven't I been a mother to you?

442
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,460
- Christine. You know who I am.
- Oh, no.

443
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:29,183
- I've come for you.
- Let's go. Come on.

444
00:57:45,511 --> 00:57:49,472
You only had one simple job,
and you couldn't even do that.

445
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,881
Hey, Marge? Marge, over
here! We need your help!

446
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:09,834
Easy with the hardware.

447
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:15,525
Jesus, Marge!
What the fuck?

448
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:17,983
<i>It's okay, Jer.
Wejust want the girl.</i>

449
00:58:18,058 --> 00:58:21,375
Okay, tell me. What the hell
is going on here? I don't know.

450
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:23,688
I don't believe you.

451
00:58:23,756 --> 00:58:26,506
- All right. I'm coming out.
- Throw out the gun.

452
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:30,151
Please don't don't
leave me here. Please!

453
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,195
<i>Hands on your head.</i>

454
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:40,425
<i>- What?
- Hands on your head. Now!</i>

455
00:58:48,783 --> 00:58:50,791
What do you want
with her, Marge? Huh?

456
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:55,206
<i>- Why is she so important?
- Just the girl. You can kill him.</i>

457
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:11,019
Come on!
Quickly!

458
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:31,027
<i>You, I don't need.</i>

459
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:33,941
But you...

460
00:59:34,006 --> 00:59:36,723
Call your people.
Find them.

461
00:59:51,576 --> 00:59:54,195
Over here.

462
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,112
Goddamn it!

463
01:00:01,178 --> 01:00:04,593
Get up!
Come on. Get up!

464
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:08,496
My best friend is dead. Everyone is
trying to kill us. I just shot two cops.

465
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,189
Why is everyone after you? I don't know.

466
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:13,266
I swear. I don't know.
Why is this happening?

467
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:16,568
<i>I know it's my fault.
I just don't know why.</i>

468
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,624
<i>That man on the stairs,
what do you know about him?</i>

469
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:24,081
Nothing. Come on. I saw your face.

470
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:26,578
You recognized him.
I don't talk about it.

471
01:00:26,653 --> 01:00:29,304
Tell me. I need to know.

472
01:00:33,502 --> 01:00:37,780
I've seen him before...
in my dreams.

473
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:42,262
- In your dreams?
- They're... They're nightmares really.

474
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:46,110
He takes me, and...
and he makes love to me.

475
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,663
I've been making love
to him my whole life.

476
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:52,446
I thought I was crazy, but he
was never real before tonight.

477
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:54,968
Oh, he's real.
I've seen him before.

478
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:59,481
- I'm afraid.
- Don't be afraid. I won't let him do any harm to you.

479
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:04,289
I'm afraid of me. I'm afraid that
if I see him, if he tries to take me,

480
01:01:04,354 --> 01:01:07,005
I'm gonna
want him to.

481
01:01:07,074 --> 01:01:10,424
<i>Let's go!</i>

482
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:13,060
Where we going? To get some answers.

483
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:25,890
You don't need that. You have no enemies here.

484
01:01:25,957 --> 01:01:29,438
I'm not so sure about that. This
girl was just attacked by your people.

485
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,252
- Your Vatican knights almost killed her!
- Vatican knights?

486
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:35,173
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

487
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:38,173
Well, they're not my people. They
think they're doing God's work.

488
01:01:38,246 --> 01:01:40,319
- But they're not.
- I want to know what's going on,

489
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:42,693
and I want to know right
now! Put the gun away.

490
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,411
Did anybody
see you come?

491
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,025
No. Good. We should be safe here.

492
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:54,366
According to the Scriptures, he
can't see inside of the house of God.

493
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:57,060
Who can't? Maybe now
you're ready to believe.

494
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:17,546
Her hands are healed.
That's the power of faith.

495
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,816
- Who is she?
- She's a Polish peasant.

496
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:21,892
<i>She fell into a trance
about two weeks ago,</i>

497
01:02:21,965 --> 01:02:24,899
and then she began to speak in a
language she couldn't possibly have known.

498
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:29,446
<i>- She made a prophecy about End of Days.
- "End of Days"?</i>

499
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:32,419
Of man's destruction and the
unholy's reign upon the earth.

500
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:35,691
Why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on.

501
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:40,494
- Who's after her?
- Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll try to explain.

502
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,145
<i>You know anything
about the number of the beast?</i>

503
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:45,899
Revelation of St. John?
From his dream?

504
01:02:45,968 --> 01:02:49,798
- Six-six-six? - The number of
the beast is not six-six-six.

505
01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:53,997
Often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.

506
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:58,157
So, six-six-six
becomes nine-nine-nine.

507
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:01,007
Like in 1999,
the year of his return.

508
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:03,212
What does that
have to do with me?

509
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:07,696
<i>Regressus diaboli:
The return of Satan.</i>

510
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:10,764
Does any of this
look familiar to you?

511
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:25,585
She's been chosen.
He's in her blood.

512
01:03:25,654 --> 01:03:29,615
<i>The Holy Church has been searching
for you since the day you were born.</i>

513
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:32,589
<i>Chosen for what? Every thousand
years, on the eve of the millennium,</i>

514
01:03:32,663 --> 01:03:34,702
the Dark Angel comes
and takes a body,

515
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:38,997
and then he walks the Earth, looking
for a woman who will bear his child.

516
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:42,773
<i>It all has to happen in that unholy
hour before midnight on New Year's Eve.</i>

517
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,386
<i>If he consummates your
flesh with this human body,</i>

518
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:49,140
then he unlocks
the gate of hell...

519
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,983
<i>and everything as we
know it ceases to exist.</i>

520
01:03:53,048 --> 01:03:55,951
<i>So, the Prince of Darkness
wants to conquer the Earth,</i>

521
01:03:56,025 --> 01:03:59,026
<i>but has to wait until an hour
before midnight of New Year's Eve?</i>

522
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:02,394
- Is this Eastern time?
- It's got nothing to do with New Year's Eve.

523
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:05,328
It has to do with a
temporary celestial alignment.

524
01:04:05,403 --> 01:04:08,153
<i>The Gregorian monks
studied the heavens.</i>

525
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,869
They were able to calculate the
precise moment of this event.

526
01:04:10,938 --> 01:04:13,590
<i>They created our calendar
by mapping this event...</i>

527
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,181
<i>and counting backwards
from that moment.</i>

528
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:19,897
- It was a mistake to come here.
- It doesn't matter whether you believe or not.

529
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:22,965
He's real, and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.

530
01:04:23,037 --> 01:04:26,650
- Why did he pick me?
- Because the stars were right when you were born.

531
01:04:26,718 --> 01:04:29,979
<i>A man's body was also
chosen, just like yours.</i>

532
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:33,341
<i>If the devil does exist, why
doesn't your god do anything?</i>

533
01:04:33,406 --> 01:04:38,492
<i>It's not my God. It's our God, and
He doesn't say that He will save us.</i>

534
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,593
He says that
we will save ourselves.

535
01:04:41,663 --> 01:04:44,794
<i>Save myself? What am I supposed
to do? Get a restraining order?</i>

536
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:48,028
- We have to have faith.
- Faith.

537
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:50,485
<i>Yes, faith.
It's an interesting concept.</i>

538
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,627
If you read the Bible,
you can't miss it. Faith!

539
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:59,361
Between your faith and my Glock nine
millimeter, I take my Glock. Come on. Let's go.

540
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:02,972
I'm afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil.

541
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:05,759
You did your job. You brought her here
to people of faith. We'll protect her.

542
01:05:05,826 --> 01:05:09,886
- We'll hide her.
- You know, you live in a different world.

543
01:05:09,956 --> 01:05:13,437
We have some real serious problems
here, and this is not solving them.

544
01:05:13,508 --> 01:05:16,574
Satan's greatest trick was
convincing man he didn't exist.

545
01:05:20,228 --> 01:05:25,051
I don't, uh... This
all feels true to me.

546
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:30,341
You'll be safer with me. At least I
can fight this guy with something real.

547
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:32,796
<i>You know what to do.
You feel it.</i>

548
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,708
I'm sorry.

549
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,615
Let him go.

550
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,405
It gets easier when you
accept what you are.

551
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:22,407
A fallen soul.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

552
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:27,851
<i>Door's locked,
no windows broken.</i>

553
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,236
- How did I get in here?
- Who the fuck are you?

554
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:33,646
Oh, I think
you know who I am.

555
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:36,133
You just don't
want to believe it.

556
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:40,048
I took a bullet for you.

557
01:06:40,112 --> 01:06:42,349
I protected you. Oh, no-no-no.
You didn't protect me.

558
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:46,542
You protected this body. Am
I... Am I getting a pattern here?

559
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:51,847
So much pain. "Not to
be taken with alcohol."

560
01:06:51,922 --> 01:06:54,476
Remember that.

561
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:59,052
<i>To lose a wife and child.</i>

562
01:07:00,468 --> 01:07:03,632
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

563
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:08,240
- What do you want?
- To make you happy again.

564
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:30,319
<i>A gift from your daughter? Hmm?</i>

565
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:42,549
<i>Amy? Don't stay in there too
long. You'll turn into a prune.</i>

566
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:45,138
- Emily!
- Come on, darling. It's time to get out.

567
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,978
<i>Gotta get you dressed.
Your daddy's gonna be home soon.</i>

568
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,189
I have the best
daddy in the whole world.

569
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:53,114
Yes,
you certainly do.

570
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:55,700
But I don't
think he'll be home.

571
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,520
<i>Now, what makes you
say a silly thing like that?</i>

572
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:01,271
<i>- He never comes home.
- Well, honey, you know your daddy works hard.</i>

573
01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:04,471
It's not about how much time you're
there. It's about "quality time."

574
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,086
Now, he'll be home just
like he promised. You'll see.

575
01:08:08,157 --> 01:08:10,012
<i>He keeps his promises.</i>

576
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:13,852
<i>I can give it all back to you.
Everything that He took away.</i>

577
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:15,544
Everything.

578
01:08:15,614 --> 01:08:18,429
<i>You can hold
your wife again.</i>

579
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:22,073
You can watch your daughter walk
through the door in her prom dress.

580
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:24,990
All you have to do is
tell me where the girl is.

581
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:28,634
Come on. She's a nobody to
you. You don't even know her.

582
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,093
You're in the middle of something
you don't really understand.

583
01:08:31,168 --> 01:08:34,267
You think you're saving her
from me? She wants to be with me.

584
01:08:34,336 --> 01:08:37,118
<i>- You know that.
- What did you do in school today?</i>

585
01:08:37,185 --> 01:08:40,731
<i>You think I'd harm her?
I'd treat her like a queen.</i>

586
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:44,249
<i>Turn around, sweetheart. You told me
you'd do anything to get your family back.</i>

587
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:47,639
You want them?
This is your chance.

588
01:08:47,714 --> 01:08:50,846
<i>They're not real.
Does that matter?</i>

589
01:08:50,915 --> 01:08:53,500
<i>- Oh, yes.
- I think you need to be reminded...</i>

590
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:56,026
of how painful
reality is.

591
01:08:57,604 --> 01:08:59,873
<i>No!</i>

592
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,560
Oh, shit!

593
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:20,710
Don't hurt my baby!

594
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:23,077
<i>- Daddy!
- Let my daughter go!</i>

595
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:27,586
Daddy!

596
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:31,933
<i>Let go of my baby!</i>

597
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:36,197
No!

598
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:42,022
Oh, it's true.

599
01:09:58,092 --> 01:10:00,875
It wasn't your fault.

600
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,329
- I wasn't there.
- No, you were just...

601
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:05,292
You were out doing your job.

602
01:10:05,356 --> 01:10:09,929
- I wasn't fucking there!
- Oh, look at you. Torn apart by guilt.

603
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:13,893
You didn't do anything wrong. You were
an honest cop. You didn't take money.

604
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:17,196
You had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.

605
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:19,205
Most people would never
testify against those guys.

606
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,383
They're not like you. You
had to do the right thing.

607
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:23,724
And where was God, hmm?

608
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:26,661
He could've stopped it, but he didn't. He
fucked you. Then He made you feel guilty.

609
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:29,638
Me, I don't do guilt.
I didn't do what happened here.

610
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:32,844
He did. Now you just think about that.

611
01:10:32,913 --> 01:10:34,768
Then you tell me
who's really your friend.

612
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:37,254
I can make it like
it never happened.

613
01:10:37,328 --> 01:10:40,046
<i>All for the price
of a stranger's address.</i>

614
01:10:41,393 --> 01:10:43,434
No!

615
01:10:44,978 --> 01:10:46,888
You will never see the girl!

616
01:10:46,963 --> 01:10:50,225
Now, you see...
Now you're upsetting me.

617
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,910
You don't want to see
me upset, believe me.

618
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,111
Oh, you want to fuck with me?
You think you know bad, huh?

619
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:59,725
You're a fucking choirboy
compared to me! A choirboy!

620
01:10:59,796 --> 01:11:02,612
You're in touch with your anger.
I really like that.

621
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:05,525
I don't know about you, but
I'm going to have a drink.

622
01:11:05,589 --> 01:11:08,459
You and I are
so much alike.

623
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:11,218
We're nothing alike!
Nothing!

624
01:11:11,286 --> 01:11:14,733
Look at yourself. Look at this.
Look at what you are now.

625
01:11:14,806 --> 01:11:17,971
You walked away from the light,
just like me. You want one?

626
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:22,262
- You need to get out, now.
- Come on. You know what's in your heart.

627
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:25,644
<i>We're on the same side. I'm not
on your side, and I never will be.</i>

628
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,616
You're on His side? He's
the one who took away your family.

629
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:31,663
Let me tell you
something about Him.

630
01:11:31,736 --> 01:11:34,868
He is the biggest underachiever
of all time.

631
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:39,476
He just had a good publicist, that's all.
Something good happens: "It's His will."

632
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,645
Something bad happens:
"He moves in mysterious ways."

633
01:11:42,714 --> 01:11:45,562
You take that... that overblown
press kit they call the Bible.

634
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:47,536
<i>You look for the answer in
there, what do they tell you?</i>

635
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:51,091
"Shit happens." Please.

636
01:11:51,163 --> 01:11:54,938
He treated you like garbage.
You walked away.

637
01:11:55,003 --> 01:11:58,168
I'm not the bad guy.

638
01:11:58,236 --> 01:12:00,341
What about the End of Days?

639
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:02,649
Think of it
as a new beginning.

640
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:06,131
A change of management. And you'll be
right there with me on the ground floor.

641
01:12:06,204 --> 01:12:09,336
It will be
so cool.

642
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:11,260
Tell me what you want.

643
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,196
Tell me what you really want,
and I'll give it to you.

644
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:20,535
I'll tell you
what I want.

645
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:25,597
I want you
to go to hell.

646
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:29,854
You see,
sometimes the problem is...

647
01:12:31,873 --> 01:12:34,263
Hell...

648
01:12:34,337 --> 01:12:36,727
Comes to you!

649
01:12:49,603 --> 01:12:52,287
Don't fuck up the coat.

650
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,668
I've wasted
too much time on this.

651
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,122
You see those insignificant little
dots down there? Huh? Do you see them?

652
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:03,546
That's what you mean to me.
Now, give me the girl!

653
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:05,628
Not today.

654
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,232
Look down.

655
01:13:32,297 --> 01:13:36,902
Now, look in your heart and
tell me you don't want to die.

656
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:38,791
All you got to do
is take my hand.

657
01:13:38,858 --> 01:13:41,825
And I'll give you
back everything that He took away.

658
01:13:45,579 --> 01:13:48,100
- Come on.
- Okay.

659
01:13:48,172 --> 01:13:52,874
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

660
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:02,116
Fuck... you!

661
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:49,897
Hey.
Hey!

662
01:14:51,507 --> 01:14:53,809
- I thought you were dead.
- Couple of seconds, I would've been.

663
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:57,138
All I remember is steppin' out of the
van, then I woke up in the fucking gutter.

664
01:14:57,205 --> 01:14:59,923
What the hell are you doing
here? What are you talking about?

665
01:14:59,989 --> 01:15:03,185
<i>I've been lookin' for you all
night. What the hell happened to you?</i>

666
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,845
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- I can't trust you.

667
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:12,563
I don't know how much you had to drink,
okay, but let's not point the gun at me?

668
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:14,573
I just need to know.
You need to know what?

669
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:18,259
That you are you. Of course I'm me!
What the hell are you talking about?

670
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:23,603
You took his body.
All right. You're ill.

671
01:15:23,672 --> 01:15:26,389
Okay? You need some help. All right?

672
01:15:26,457 --> 01:15:28,879
Oh, fuck!
Jesus!

673
01:15:28,953 --> 01:15:31,124
- Fuck.
- You're bleeding.

674
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,495
Of course I'm bleeding!
You fuckin' shot me!

675
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,725
I just needed to find
out! You found out, okay?

676
01:15:36,793 --> 01:15:40,176
Stop being such a pussy! It's
just a scratch. Pussy? Come on!

677
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,672
Oh, Christ.
Does it hurt?

678
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,016
What do you think?
Jesus.

679
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,636
What the hell's the matter
with you? What's going on here?

680
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:49,595
I can't explain it.

681
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:55,764
I shouldn't have left
her alone like that.

682
01:15:55,836 --> 01:15:59,382
<i>I should be with her.
Tell me what to do.</i>

683
01:15:59,453 --> 01:16:01,526
I gotta get back there.

684
01:16:01,597 --> 01:16:03,899
Got to get her as far
away from him as I can.

685
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:06,715
Okay, we'll leave town. You
get her. I'll get a Striker car.

686
01:16:06,782 --> 01:16:08,692
Just tell me
where to meet you.

687
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,072
St. John's Church...
in one hour.

688
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:26,074
<i>How much longer, Father?</i>

689
01:16:26,145 --> 01:16:30,236
Well, he has to sire his child between
11:00 and midnight tomorrow night.

690
01:16:30,304 --> 01:16:33,786
<i>So, we must keep you hidden
until that hour passes.</i>

691
01:16:38,754 --> 01:16:42,071
We've come to help.
Your Eminence.

692
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:45,443
In this hour of darkness,
we need all the help we can get.

693
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,135
How's the girl? The girl's fine. Thanks.

694
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:57,372
No.

695
01:16:57,445 --> 01:17:00,479
No. Father! Father, they're
the ones who tried to kill me!

696
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:04,925
<i>- No!
- Your Eminence, what are you doing?</i>

697
01:17:04,998 --> 01:17:07,005
<i>We cannot allow this union
to take place. No! No.</i>

698
01:17:07,077 --> 01:17:08,387
<i>Please! You can't! You mustn't!</i>

699
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:11,269
<i>- Let go!
- She is only one life.</i>

700
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:13,604
<i>How many lives are you prepared
to end if we do nothing?</i>

701
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:15,581
- That's not who we are.
- Of course it is.

702
01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:18,820
We are doing God's work. We
are preventing the End of Days.

703
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:22,303
But you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.

704
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:24,286
- There is no time!
- No! -

705
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,302
<i>- It's the only way.
- No-o-o!</i>

706
01:17:26,377 --> 01:17:28,068
<i>May God forgive us!</i>

707
01:17:28,137 --> 01:17:29,992
<i>Amen. -</i>

708
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:37,792
I can do this all day long.

709
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:40,321
Now, let her go.

710
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:42,369
You must let us finish.

711
01:17:42,443 --> 01:17:45,957
<i>If she is slain, his hope of creating
a kingdom on Earth dies with her.</i>

712
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,778
<i>- Her death is God's will.
- It's not God's will.</i>

713
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:50,884
<i>It's your will, and it will
lead to our destruction. Jericho.</i>

714
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:53,412
<i>She must be removed.
It's the only way to defeat him.</i>

715
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:56,649
For a thousand years,
we prepared ourselves for this.

716
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:59,434
We're not afraid to die. Good.

717
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:01,508
Because I'm not afraid to kill you.

718
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:03,786
Let her go.

719
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:23,432
Go. Go.
Get out of here.

720
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:27,112
<i>Go!</i>

721
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:36,265
God help us.
We're too late.

722
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:41,997
- I've come for my wife.
- Let's go.

723
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:44,785
<i>This is the house of the Lord, our
God, and you are not welcome here.</i>

724
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:51,090
I can stand the pain of being in
church. How much pain can you bear?

725
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:53,840
Christine!
Come to me.

726
01:18:53,908 --> 01:18:56,396
<i>I am the one
you've been waiting for.</i>

727
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:58,477
I am the answer
to your prayers.

728
01:18:58,549 --> 01:19:01,397
In the name of God,
I order you to leave here now!

729
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,909
<i>May the wrath of God destroy...</i>

730
01:19:31,545 --> 01:19:36,150
A thousand years you have waited for
my return. And behold, you have failed.

731
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:41,075
And with your last breath you shall
bear witness to the End of Days.

732
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,561
No! Jericho!

733
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,847
Get in the car!
Run!

734
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:19,511
Jesus! Come on!

735
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:32,922
Bobby, what the hell are you
doing?

736
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,034
<i>What are you doing?
Open the door! Open up!</i>

737
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:37,049
- Come on! Open up!
- Open the door!

738
01:20:39,074 --> 01:20:42,905
Jer... Please, stop the car! Please!

739
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,500
Jer!

740
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:35,104
Jer!

741
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:15,310
<i>You should
have taken my offer.</i>

742
01:22:15,376 --> 01:22:18,060
<i>At least you would have
been happy once in your life.</i>

743
01:22:24,337 --> 01:22:27,949
Let her go,
or I'll kill you.

744
01:22:28,017 --> 01:22:30,767
Ooh, so much anger,
so much hatred.

745
01:22:30,835 --> 01:22:33,071
You're almost there.

746
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:42,156
I'm gonna hurt you so bad,
you're gonna beg to die.

747
01:22:42,227 --> 01:22:46,003
But I'm not gonna let you.
It's not gonna be that easy.

748
01:22:46,068 --> 01:22:50,826
You're mine, and I want you
to see what's gonna happen.

749
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:47,126
<i>World religious
leaders have asked their followers...</i>

750
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:50,677
<i>to prepare for the new millennium
not with celebrating and partying...</i>

751
01:23:50,749 --> 01:23:53,117
<i>but rather with acts
of kindness, compassion...</i>

752
01:23:53,181 --> 01:23:57,492
<i>This is it, New York.
The last day of the first 2,000 years.</i>

753
01:25:05,576 --> 01:25:10,213
- How long have I been out?
- You almost slept the whole day.

754
01:25:10,281 --> 01:25:13,248
You're lucky to be alive.

755
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:23,817
The time?

756
01:25:23,882 --> 01:25:26,982
It's almost 7:00.
It's not too late.

757
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:30,085
He has the girl.
But it's not too late.

758
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:36,201
<i>In nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

759
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:01,706
<i>Jesus, what did you
do? Get hit by a truck?</i>

760
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:03,751
No, the truck missed me.

761
01:26:30,515 --> 01:26:33,417
Where the hell are you
goin'? Doing my job.

762
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:35,532
<i>You
know, the cops are after you.</i>

763
01:26:35,604 --> 01:26:37,459
<i>They have to wait.
I've got to do something.</i>

764
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,048
That son of a bitch.

765
01:28:18,946 --> 01:28:23,005
Yes. You wish entrance?

766
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:30,561
You have much hatred
and vengeance in your heart.

767
01:28:30,628 --> 01:28:32,897
You may pass.

768
01:30:05,232 --> 01:30:10,504
<i>Angelus obscurus.</i>

769
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:18,192
<i>Princeps finis dierum.</i>

770
01:30:58,648 --> 01:31:00,917
You know
this is what you want.

771
01:31:09,018 --> 01:31:18,671
Angelus obscurus.

772
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:22,970
You can't resist, can you?
'Cause you don't want to.

773
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:30,422
I didn't come here to hurt you.
I came here to love you.

774
01:31:33,564 --> 01:31:37,460
Relax.
Give yourself to me.

775
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,104
- No one move, or I kill the girl.
- What are you doing?

776
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:09,984
- Trust me.
- You're not gonna kill her.

777
01:32:10,049 --> 01:32:12,189
<i>You said it yourself.
I have a dark heart.</i>

778
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:14,560
- Then stand with me.
- I'll tell you what.

779
01:32:14,626 --> 01:32:19,329
<i>You let us both out of here,
and I'll stand wherever you want.</i>

780
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:22,657
- Step back, or I'll pull the trigger.
- I didn't want to kill you.

781
01:32:22,723 --> 01:32:24,578
<i>But now you
leave me no choice.</i>

782
01:32:31,589 --> 01:32:34,753
Let her go, Jer.

783
01:32:34,821 --> 01:32:36,677
<i>Oh, don't look at me
like that.</i>

784
01:32:36,742 --> 01:32:38,683
You'd be amazed what you
agree to when you're on fire.

785
01:32:38,757 --> 01:32:41,954
Don't do it, Bobby.
You're better than this.

786
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:45,121
- You're better than him.
- You know, considering how you've lived your life,

787
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:49,152
when this is all over, what makes you
think you're going upstairs anyways, huh?

788
01:32:49,223 --> 01:32:52,999
Come on, Jer. This is the
main event. It's gonna happen.

789
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:56,380
- Why shouldn't you have the best seats in the house?
- You will never get a shot off,

790
01:32:56,456 --> 01:32:58,791
and you know it.

791
01:33:02,057 --> 01:33:03,879
Don't do it.

792
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:10,114
<i>Bobby.</i>

793
01:33:10,186 --> 01:33:12,325
I thought we had a deal?

794
01:33:12,394 --> 01:33:14,598
<i>Bobby.</i>

795
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:35,300
Well, I guess
the deal's off.

796
01:33:41,678 --> 01:33:43,883
No!

797
01:33:46,255 --> 01:33:48,394
You son of a bitch!

798
01:34:18,707 --> 01:34:21,163
Here!
This way!

799
01:34:33,845 --> 01:34:35,700
Up here.

800
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:48,405
Shit!

801
01:35:13,883 --> 01:35:16,882
- Oh, thank God. I thought I hit you.
- Just get us out of here!

802
01:35:21,499 --> 01:35:23,158
Let's go.
Give me a minute.

803
01:35:24,828 --> 01:35:28,025
I'd feel better if you'd show me
how to use one of those things.

804
01:35:28,093 --> 01:35:32,316
<i>- I want to do something. Let me help.
- All right. Here.</i>

805
01:35:32,381 --> 01:35:35,480
You take the gun. Line up
the sight with your target.

806
01:35:35,549 --> 01:35:38,004
Uh-huh. Beware of the
recoil. Here's the magazine.

807
01:35:38,077 --> 01:35:40,118
Put it in. Load.

808
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:42,841
Only pull the trigger when you're ready...

809
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,486
Like that?
Yeah, like that.

810
01:36:08,962 --> 01:36:10,904
He's on the tracks!

811
01:36:12,002 --> 01:36:13,693
Shit!

812
01:36:13,762 --> 01:36:16,316
- Don't stop! Don't stop!
- What are you doing?

813
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,310
He's gone.

814
01:37:27,853 --> 01:37:29,609
Oh, God.

815
01:37:32,077 --> 01:37:33,736
Go on.

816
01:37:39,374 --> 01:37:42,058
- We must separate the cars. Separate the cars.
- What?

817
01:38:02,353 --> 01:38:04,459
Jericho!

818
01:38:06,418 --> 01:38:08,207
Jericho!

819
01:38:18,996 --> 01:38:22,412
Jericho!

820
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:32,751
That's it. Come on.

821
01:38:39,959 --> 01:38:42,064
Jericho!

822
01:39:20,605 --> 01:39:22,777
Here. Hold on!

823
01:40:15,332 --> 01:40:18,234
Jericho!

824
01:40:18,308 --> 01:40:22,531
<i>How can you expect to
defeat me when you are but a man...</i>

825
01:40:22,597 --> 01:40:26,372
and I am forever!

826
01:41:02,539 --> 01:41:05,092
We must lock the doors!

827
01:41:14,764 --> 01:41:17,961
<i>- Deliver us, O Lord.
- Everyone, out!</i>

828
01:41:18,028 --> 01:41:20,555
<i>Get them to a safe place!
Get them out of here!</i>

829
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,926
<i>Lady, come on!</i>

830
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,414
What are we gonna do?

831
01:41:55,345 --> 01:41:58,379
Hide. Just hide!
No.

832
01:43:11,292 --> 01:43:14,937
Please, God, help me.

833
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:18,644
Give me strength.

834
01:46:14,356 --> 01:46:16,659
Christine.

835
01:46:16,725 --> 01:46:18,667
Christine?

836
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:21,873
Jericho?

837
01:46:26,231 --> 01:46:28,303
Are you all right?

838
01:46:28,375 --> 01:46:32,052
What happened?
It's over.

839
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:36,112
We won.

840
01:46:40,537 --> 01:46:42,577
Let's go.

841
01:46:45,272 --> 01:46:47,095
Huh?

842
01:46:50,425 --> 01:46:52,425
- What's wrong?

843
01:46:52,425 --> 01:46:55,420
- Nothing is wrong.

844
01:46:56,315 --> 01:46:59,382
Everything is the way it should be.

845
01:46:59,452 --> 01:47:03,029
No! Jericho! No! No!

846
01:47:03,098 --> 01:47:05,521
No, please!
What are you doing?

847
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:08,051
Jericho!
No!

848
01:47:08,124 --> 01:47:10,099
No!

849
01:47:12,604 --> 01:47:15,223
No! Stop it!

850
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:21,533
You died for nothing.
You just bought them time.

851
01:47:21,597 --> 01:47:25,013
<i>Please. You have to fight
him, Jericho. I know you.</i>

852
01:47:25,086 --> 01:47:28,086
You're stronger than he is.

853
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:32,373
That's why you came back for me.
Don't let him win.

854
01:48:06,116 --> 01:48:07,938
Run.

855
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:12,121
Run.

856
01:48:18,021 --> 01:48:20,257
- Yah!
- No!

857
01:48:22,502 --> 01:48:24,706
<i>Six, five, four,</i>

858
01:48:24,774 --> 01:48:28,256

Thank you.
