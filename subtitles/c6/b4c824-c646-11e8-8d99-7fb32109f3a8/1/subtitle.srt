00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,593
Hello.

2
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,638
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,156
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,836
I could eat
about a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,751
My mama always said

6
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,389
Iife was like
a box of chocolates.

7
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,310
You never know
what you're going to get.

8
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,353
Those must be comfortable shoes.

9
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,637
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that

10
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,676
and not feel a thing.

11
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,871
I wish I had shoes like that.

12
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,394
My feet hurt.

13
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,869
Mama always said there's an awful lot

14
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,111
you can tell about a person
by their shoes.

15
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,476
Where they're going,
where they've been.

16
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,794
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,353
I bet if I think
about it real hard,

18
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,557
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,392
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

20
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,313
'She said they was my magic shoes.'

21
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,790
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

22
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,516
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,111
How do those feel?

24
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,397
His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,
as strong as I've ever seen.

25
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,393
But his back's
as crooked as a politician.

26
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,916
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

27
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,149
Forrest!

28
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,470
'Now, when I was a baby,

29
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,472
'Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero

30
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,516
'General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

31
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,558
'She said we was related
to him in some way.

32
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,392
'What he did was,

33
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,631
'he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.

34
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,917
'They'd all dress up
in their robes and their bed sheets

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,357
'and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

36
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,149
'They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

37
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,233
'And anyway that's how
I got my name, Forrest Gump.

38
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,073
'Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me

39
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,799
'that sometimes we all
do things that...

40
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,474
'well, that just don't
make no sense.'

41
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,232
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

42
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,756
All right.
What are y'all staring at?

43
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,118
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

44
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,074
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

45
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,355
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

46
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,238
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

47
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,596
'Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

48
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,715
'We lived about
a quarter mile off Route 17,

49
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,598
'about a half mile
from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

50
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,478
'That's in the county of Greenbow.

51
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,838
'Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

52
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,992
'had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

53
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,517
'Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

54
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,752
'Mama decided to let those rooms out,
mostly to people passing through,

55
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,037
'like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

56
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,873
'That's how me and Mama got money.

57
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,349
'Mama was a real smart lady.'

58
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,795
(Mama) Remember
what I told you, Forrest.

59
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,792
You're no different
than anybody else is.

60
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,275
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else.

61
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,669
You are no different.

62
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,753
Your boy's...different, Mrs Gump.

63
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,035
His IQ is 75.

64
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,874
Well, we're all different,
Mr Hancock.

65
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,349
'She wanted me to have
the finest education

66
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,591
'so she took me to the Greenbow
County central school.

67
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,513
'l met the principal and all.'

68
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,797
I want to show you something,
Mrs Gump.

69
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,633
Now, this is normal.

70
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,035
Forrest is right here.

71
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,557
The state requires a minimum IQ
of 80 to attend public school.

72
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,713
Mrs Gump, he's going to have
to go to a special school.

73
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Now, he'll be just fine.

74
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,396
What does normal mean, anyway?

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,914
He might be...

76
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,956
a bit on the slow side,

77
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,669
but my boy Forrest will get the same
opportunities as everyone else.

78
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,878
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to retread tyres.

79
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,270
We're talking about
five little points here.

80
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,358
There must be something can be done.

81
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,793
We're a progressive school system.

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,872
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

83
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,793
Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?

84
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,076
He's on vacation.

85
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,436
(Principal panting and gasping)

86
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,991
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

87
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,033
Well, your mama sure does care about
your schooling, son.

88
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,872
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

89
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,708
You don't say much, do you?

90
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,109
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

91
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,919
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,596
"Finally, he had to try.
It looked easy, but...

93
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,069
"Oh, what happened? First they..."

94
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,311
Mama, what's vacation mean?

95
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,515
Vacation?

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,273
Where Daddy went?

97
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,078
Vacation's when you go somewhere...

98
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,470
and you don't ever come back.

99
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,676
'Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

100
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,912
'But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,798
'There was always
folks coming and going.'

102
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
Supper! It's supper, everyone!

103
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,351
(Man) That sure looks special.

104
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,000
'Sometimes, we had so many people
staying with us

105
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,117
'that every room was filled,
with travellers, you know,

106
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,877
'folks living out of their suitcases
and hat cases and sample cases.'

107
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,873
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest?

108
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,394
'One time, a young man
was staying with us,

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,278
'and he had him a guitar case.'

110
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,672
(Strumming)

111
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,309
# Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit

112
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,597
# And you ain't no friend of mine #

113
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,548
Forrest, I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

114
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,437
No, that's all right, ma'am.

115
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,478
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

116
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,358
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

117
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,238
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

118
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,471
Say, man, show me
that crazy little walk you did there.

119
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,551
Slow it down some.

120
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,392
# You ain't nothing but... #

121
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,074
'l liked that guitar.

122
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,515
'lt sounded good.

123
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,192
'l started moving around
to the music, swinging my hips.'

'This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping.

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,189
'We walked by Vincy's furniture
and appliance store, and guess what?'

young man who they called the king,

It must be hard being a king.

It's funny how you remember some
things, but some things you can't.

- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

the first day of school very well.'

Are you coming along?

from strangers.

any more.

Well, are you going
to sit down or aren't you?

What's wrong with your legs?

159
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,350
Um, nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

to me or asked me questions.'

164

Are you stupid or something?

165
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,150
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

166
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,109
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.

we was always together.

'l showed her how to dangle.'

172
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,913
"A good little..."

173
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,154
'She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

174
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,031
'Sometimes, we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.'

175
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
- Mama's going to worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

176
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,233
'For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.'

177
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,914
OK, Jenny, I'll stay.

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,310
'She was my most special friend.'

179
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
My only friend.

180
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,309
Now, my mama always told me
that miracles happen every day.

181
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,995
Some people don't think so,
but they do.

182
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,070
Hey, dummy!

183
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,435
Are you retarded,
or just plain stupid?

184
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,671
(Kid) Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.
(Jenny) Just run away, Forrest.

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,833
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

186
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,629
- Get the bikes!
- Let's get him! Come on!

187
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,918
Look out, dummy! Here we come!
We're going to get you!

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,073
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

189
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,396
Come back here, you!

190
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,034
(Kid laughs)

191
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,275
Run, Forrest! Run!

192
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,195
Now, you wouldn't
believe it if I told you...

193
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,475
but I can run like the wind blows.

194
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,397
From that day on, if I was
going somewhere, I was running.

195
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,957
That boy sure is a runnin' fool.

196
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,474
'Remember how I told you that Jenny
never seemed to want to go home?

197
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,950
'She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

198
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,474
'Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was five,

199
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,916
'and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.'

200
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,797
Jenny?

201
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,836
'He was a very loving man.

202
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,038
'He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

203
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,557
'And then this one time,

204
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,438
'Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.'

205
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,909
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?

206
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,230
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

207
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,992
(Man) Jenny!

208
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,672
Come on!

209
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,118
Jenny, where'd you run to?
You better get back here, girl!

210
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,196
Where you at?

211
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,550
Jenny! Jenny, where you at?

212
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,035
Jenny!

213
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,317
Pray with me, Forrest.
Pray with me.

214
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,674
Jenny!

215
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,877
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

216
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,791
far, far away from here.

217
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,156
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

218
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,593
far, far away...

219
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,433
'Mama always said God is mysterious.'

220
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,999
Jenny!

221
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,514
'He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.

222
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,477
'lnstead,

'he had the police say

'Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,878
'She went to live with her grandma,
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

'which made me happy,
cos she was so close.

227
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,439
'Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out
and come on over to my house,

228
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,114
'just cos she said she was scared.

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,953
'Scared of what, I don't know.

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,353
'But I think it was her grandma's
dog. He was a mean dog.

'Anyway, Jenny and me

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,318
'all the way up through high school.'

233
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,919
- (Boy) Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

234
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,513
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Didn't you hear me, stupid?

235
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,318
Run, Forrest!

236
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,791
Get in the truck!
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,314
Run, Forrest! Run!

238
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,238
(Shouting and hollering)

239
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,155
Run, Forrest!

240
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,472
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going.

241
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,950
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

242
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,271
Who in the hell is that?

243
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,999
That there is Forrest Gump, coach.

244
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,036
Just a local idiot.

245
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,998
'And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.'

246
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,195
(Whistle)

247
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,479
Forrest, go on! Run!

248
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,993
- OK!
- Run!

249
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,878
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,873
You son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

251
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,560
Run! Run! Go!

252
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,997
(Whistle)

253
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,717
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

254
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,756
but he sure is fast!

255
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,396
'Now, maybe it's just me,

256
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,358
'but college
was very confusing times.'

257
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,915
'Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,150
'integrated
the University of Alabama today.'

259
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,835
Two Negroes were admitted, but
only after Governor George Wallace

260
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,833
had carried out his symbolic threat
to stand in the schoolhouse door.

261
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,480
I take it from that statement...

262
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,516
Earl, what's going on?

263
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,909
Coons are trying to get into school.

264
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,149
Coons?

265
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,119
When racoons got on our back porch,
Mama chased them off with a broom.

266
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,555
Not racoons, you idiot. Niggers.

267
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,870
They want to go to school with us.

268
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,837
With us? They do?

269
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,674
(Reporter) Shortly after Governor
Wallace had blocked the doorway,

270
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,718
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

271
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,756
to use military force.

272
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,435
Here is the encounter by General
Graham of the National Guard,

273
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,317
and Governor Wallace.

274
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,073
..because these National Guardsmen

275
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,879
are here today as federal soldiers
for Alabama,

276
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,748
and they live within our borders
and they are our brothers.

277
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,479
We are winning in this fight,

278
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,313
because we are awakening
the American people

279
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,188
to the dangers that we have
spoken about so many times

280
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,191
that is so evident today -

281
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,909
a trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.

282
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,996
And so, at day's end, the University
of Alabama in Tuscaloosa

283
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,991
had been desegregated,

284
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,469
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

285
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,348
had been signed up
for summer classes.

286
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,276
Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.

287
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,749
'Governor Wallace
did what he promised.

288
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,196
'By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...'

289
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,716
- Say, wasn't that Gump?
- Nah, that couldn't be.

290
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,598
It sure as hell was.

291
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,072
'A few years later, that angry little
man at the schoolhouse door

292
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,118
'thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for President.

293
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,957
'But somebody thought
that it wasn't.'

294
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,192
But he didn't die.

295
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,194
- My bus is here.
- Is it the number nine?

296
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,432
- No, it's a number four.
- It was nice talking to you.

297
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,599
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,716
I was in college.

299
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,917
Did you go to a girls college
or girls and boys together?

300
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,353
It was co-ed.

301
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,715
Cos Jenny
went to a college I couldn't go to.

302
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,916
It was a college just for girls.

303
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,310
'But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.'

304

I love you but I do

# I don't know why I love you
but I do... #

Forrest! Forrest!

311
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,950
Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
What are you doing?

312
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,750
- He was hurting you.
- No, he wasn't! Get over there!

313
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,638
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- Just keep away from me.

314
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,474
Don't be such a... Don't go!
Billy, wait a second.

315
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,915
He doesn't know any better.

316
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,318
Forrest, why did you do that?

317
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,794
I brought you some chocolate.

318
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,791
I'm sorry.

319
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,229
I'll go back to my college now.

320
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,072
Forrest...

321
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,551
Look at you.

322
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,434
Come on. Come on.

323
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,397
(Thunder)

324
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,629
- Is this your own room?
- Shh!

325
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,316
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

326
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,155
about who you're going to be?

327
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,235
- Who I'm going to be?
- Yeah.

328
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,072
Aren't I going to be me?

329
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,357
You'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

330
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,351
You know?

331
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,192
I want to be famous.

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,994
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

333
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,996
I just want to be on an empty stage
with my guitar, my voice.

334
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,078
Just me.

335
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,430
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

336
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,354
I want to be able to say things,
just one to one.

337
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,509
Have you ever been with a girl,
Forrest?

338
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,193
I sit next to them in my
home economics class all the time.

339
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,872
Oh... Oh... Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,235
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

341
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,512
Oh... Oh...

- It's OK.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

No.

your roommate's bathrobe.

I don't like her anyway.

No. But I been on a real big boat.

401
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,993
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

402
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,833
I been working on shrimp boats
all my life.

403
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,072
I started out on my uncle's boat
when I was about maybe nine.

404
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,915
I was just looking into buying
my own boat and got drafted.

405

My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

406
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,756
People call me Bubba, just like
one of them old redneck boys.

Can you believe that?

408
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,352
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,555
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

416
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,952
I'm going into the shrimping business
myself, after I get out the army.

417
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,715
OK.

418
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,475
GUMP! What's your sole purpose
in this army?

419
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,949
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

420
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,998
Damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

421
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,878
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

422
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,954
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160.
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

423
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,355
Listen up, people!

424
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,672
'Now, for some reason, I fit in
the army like one of them round pegs.

425
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,478
'lt's not really hard.

426

(Sergeant) ls that clear?

429
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,995
(All) Yes, Drill Sergeant!

430
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,390
What you do is you just
drag your nets along the bottom.

431
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,598
On a good day, you can catch
over a hundred pounds of shrimp.

432
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,672
Everything goes all right,
two men shrimping ten hours,

433
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,320
Iess what you spends on gas...

434
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,278
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

435
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,479
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

436
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,551
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

437
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,996
Jesus H Christ.
This is a new company record.

438
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,878
If it wasn't a waste
of a fine enlisted man,

439
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,190
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

440
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,475
You're going to be a general someday!

441
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,313
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

442
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,359
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

443
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,150
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

444
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,118
There's, um, shrimp kebabs,
shrimp creole,

445
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,194
shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

446
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,477
There's pineapple shrimp
and lemon shrimp,

447
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,949

448
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,474
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

449

shrimp salad, shrimp in potatoes,

450
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,072
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.

451
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,077
That's about it.

452

'Night-time in the army

What are you doing?

What are you doing, Forrest?
Let me down!

You can't keep trying to rescue me.

- A lot of people try to grab me.

doing this all the time.

You don't know what love is.

You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

493
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,834
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far away?

494
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,116
Yes, I do.

495
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,794
You think I could fly
off this bridge?

496

What do you mean, Jenny?

497
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,952
Nothing.

I gotta get out of here.

499
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,351
- Wait, Jenny.
- Forrest, you stay away from me, OK?

500
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,590
You stay away from me, please.

501

- Can I have a ride?
- (Man) Where are you going?

502

- I don't care.
- Get in the truck.

If you're ever in trouble,
don't be brave. Just run.

OK? Just run away.

00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,193
OK.

511
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,071
Jenny.

512
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,918
I'll write you all the time.

513
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,876
'And just like that,

514
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,712
'she was gone.'

515
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,996
You come back safe to me.
Do you hear?

516
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,233
# Some folks are born

517
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,515
# Made to wave the flag

518
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,795
# Ooh, they're red, white, and blue

519
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,236
# And when the band plays
"Hail to the chief"

520
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,676
# Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you, Lord

521
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,309
# It ain't me, it ain't me

522
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,960
# I ain't no senator's son, son

523
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,109
# It ain't me... #

524
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,398
'Now, they told us that Vietnam
was going to be very different

525
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,550
'from the United States of America.

526
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,351
'Except for all the beer cans
and barbecues, it was.'

527
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,592
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

528
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,478
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.

529
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,075
After we win this war
and we take over everything,

530
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,596
we can get American shrimpers out
here and shrimp these waters.

531
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,830
Just shrimp all the time, man.

532
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,470
- You must be my FNGs.
- (Both) Morning, sir!

533
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,313
Oh, get your hands down.
Do not salute me.

534
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,834
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

535
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,911
who'd love to grease an officer.

536
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,037
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

537
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,834
What's wrong with your lip?

538
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,115
I was born with big gums, sir.

539
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,432
Well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

540
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,397
Where are you boys from in the world?

541
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,198
(Both) Alabama, sir!

542
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,236
You twins?

543
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,880
No. We are not relations, sir.

544
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,434
Look, it's pretty basic here.

545
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,429
You stick with me and learn from the
guys who've been in country a while,

546
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,272
you'll be all right.

547
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,351
There is one item of GI gear

548
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,193
that can be the difference
between life and death...

549
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,679
socks.

550
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,389
Cushioned sole, OD Green.
Try and keep your feet dry.

551
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,109
When we're out humpin',
change your socks whenever we stop.

552
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,510
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet right off his legs.

553
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,559
Sergeant Sims. God damn it, where's
that sling rope I told you to order?

554
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,073
I put in the requisitions.

555
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,355
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...

556
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,317
'Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.

557
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,198
'l felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.

558

'He was from a long,
great military tradition.

God damn it, kick some ass.
Get on it!

564
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,589
'l guess you could say
he had a lot to live up to.'

565
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,390
So, you boys from Arkansas, huh?
Well...l been through there.

566
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
Little Rock's a fine town.

567
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,157
Now, shake down your gear.
See the platoon sergeant.

568
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,800
Draw what you need for the field.

569
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,032
If you boys are hungry, we got
steaks burning right over here.

570
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,714
Two standing orders in this platoon.

571
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,439
One, take good care of your feet.

572
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,830
Two, try not to do anything stupid,

# ..this is the worse trip
I've ever been on #

575
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,716
I sure hope I don't let him down.

576

'l got to see
a lot of the countryside.

577

for this guy named Charlie.'

I can't get no relief... #

582

- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

583

'lt wasn't always fun.'

584
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,272
'Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings, about a rock

much about anything,

to go to that river. Move out.

is there was always someplace to go.'

Fire in the hole!

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,069
Gump, check out that hole.

'And there was always
something to do.'

606

- Mount 'em up!
- Spread out! Cover his back!

607

'One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

kind of rain there is.

- Hey, Bubba.

I'm going to lean up against you.
You lean back against me.

with our heads in the mud.

we're a good partnership, Forrest?

Cos we be watching out for one
another, like brothers and stuff.

619

Hey, Forrest,
something I been thinking about.

620
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,993
I got a very important question
to ask you.

621
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,355
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

622
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,952
- OK.
- Man, I tell you what.

623
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,235
I got it all figured out, too.

624
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,118
So many pounds of shrimp
will pay off the boat.

625
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,351
So many pounds for gas.
We'll live right on the boat.

626
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,670
We ain't got to pay no rent.

627
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,469
We can just work it together, split
everything right down the middle.

628
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,554
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50. And hey,
Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

629
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,509
That's a fine idea.

630
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,398
'Bubba did have a fine idea.

Not every day, but almost.

00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,152
'somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest, help me!"'

680
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,510
OK. Here. Here.

681
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,593
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be OK.

682
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,031
'l started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.'

683
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:26,752
I know my position is danger close!
We got Charlie all over this area.

684
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,638
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

685
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,950
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

686
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,352
I know he's dead! My whole
goddamn platoon is wiped out!

687
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,150
God damn it! What are you doing?
You leave me here!

688
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,630
Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

689
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,235
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!

690
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,709
'Leg Lima six, this is Strongarm.

691
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,792
'Be advised
your fast movers are inbound. Over.'

692
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,838
'Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.'

693
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,798
Aah! Something bit me!

694
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,314
(Dan screams)

695
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,631
You son of a bitch! Aah!

696
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:15,272
I can't leave the platoon.
I told you to leave me there, Gump!

697
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,478
Forget about me. Get yourself out!
Did you hear what I said?

698
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,872
Gump, damn it, put me down!
Get your ass out of here!

699
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,477
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

700
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,757
- Where do you think you're going?
- To get Bubba.

701
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,594
I got an air strike inbound now.
They're going to nape the whole area.

702
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,240
Stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

703
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,709
I gotta find Bubba!

704
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,311
(Bubba) Forrest.

705
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,519
Bubba.

706
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,831
I'm OK, Forrest. I'm OK.

707
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,509
- Oh, Bubba, no.
- I'm gonna be all right.

708
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,390
(Vietnamese soldiers approaching)

709
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,349
Come on. Come on. Come on.

710
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,680
Ugh. I'm OK, Forrest.

711
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,399
(Aeroplanes overhead)

712
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,357
I'm OK. I'm fine.

713
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,517
(Dan) Top smoke. Get it out there.

714
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,592
'lf I'd have known this
was going to be the last time

715
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,636
'me and Bubba was gonna talk,

716
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,029
'l'd of thought
of something better to say.'

717
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,999
- Hey, Bubba.
- Hey, Forrest.

718
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,233
Forrest...

719
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,595
why did this happen?

720
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,592
You got shot.

721
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,355
'Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.'

722
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,829
I want to go home.

723
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,269
'Bubba was my best good friend.

724
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,876
'And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

725
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,077
'Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,

726
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,188
'but instead, he died right
there by that river in Vietnam.'

727
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,316
That's all I have to say about that.

728
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,230
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

729
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,112
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

730
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,196
Oh. Yes, sir.

731
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,510
Bit me directly in the but-tocks.

732
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,752
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

733
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,796
the army must keep that money,

734
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,509
cos I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

735
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,309
The only good thing
about being wounded in the but-tocks

736
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,277
is the ice cream.

737
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,920
'They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

738
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,513
'And guess what?

739
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,513
'A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.'

740
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,557
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

741
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,756
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

742
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,033
It's time for your bath,
Lieutenant.

743
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,878
Harper!

744
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,075
(Man) Cooper. Larson.

747
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,760
- Gump!
- I'm Forrest Gump.

Kyle. Nichols.

749
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,759
McMill. Johnson.

750
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,993
(TV) 'Surprise, surprise, surprise!'

751
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,113
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit? Turn it off.

752
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,033
'You are tuned to the American Forces
Vietnam Network.

'This is Channel 6, Saigon.'

754
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,837
Good catch, Gump.

755
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,511
You know how to play this?

756
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,314
Come on. Let me show you. Here.

757
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,032
Now, the secret to this game is
no matter what happens,

758
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,749
never, ever take your eye
off the ball.

759
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,952
All right.

760
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,274
'For some reason, ping pong
came very natural to me.'

761
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,557
See? Any idiot can play.

762
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,915
'So I started playing it
all the time.

763
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,874
'l played ping pong even when
I didn't have anyone to play with.

00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,750
'The hospital's people said it
made me look like a duck in water.

'Whatever that means.

'Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

'l played ping pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.'

768
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,111
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

769
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,397
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

770
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,358
I should have died
out there with my men,

771
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,389
but now, I'm nothing but
a goddamn cripple, a legless freak!

772
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,675
Look. Look! Look at me!

773
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,398
You see that?

774
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,234
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

775
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,956
Y-y-yes, sir, I do.

776
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,674
Did you hear what I said?

777
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,399
You cheated me! I had a destiny.

778
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,553
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honour!

779
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,191
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

780
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,595
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

781
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,795
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

782
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,230
I had a destiny.

783
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,991
I was...Lieutenant...Dan Taylor.

784
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,875
Y-you're still...Lieutenant Dan.

785
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,591
Look at me.
What am I going to do now?

786
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,678
What am I going to do now?

787
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,993
PFC Gump?

788
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,071
Yes, sir!

789
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,276
As you were.

790
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,955
Son, you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

791
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,075
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

792
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,151
They want to give me a m...

793
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,917
Ma'am, what did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

794
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,956
They sent him home.

795
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,191
'Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.'

796
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,750
'The ceremony was kicked off

a debt of gratitude, son.

Where were you hit?

In the but-tocks, sir.

Well, that must be a sight.

803
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,474

01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,509
And that's all I have to say
about that.

851
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,712
(Silence)

852
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,595
That's so right on, man.
You said it all.

853
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,236
What's your name, man?

854
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,118
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

855
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,031
Forrest Gump.

856
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,872
(Crowd) Gump!

857
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,238
(Woman) Forrest! Forrest!

858
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,714
Jenny!

859
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,552
Forrest!

860
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,756
Hey!

861
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,589
'lt was the happiest moment
of my life.

862
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,509
'Jenny and me were just
like peas and carrots again.

863
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,354
'She showed me around

864
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,238
'and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.'

865
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,596
Shut that blind! And get your
white ass away from that window.

866
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,955
Don't you know we in a war here?

867
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,396
- He's cool. He's one of us.
- Let me tell you about us.

868
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,189
Our purpose is to protect our black
leaders from the racial onslaught

869
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,512
of the pig who wishes to brutalise
our black leaders, rape our women,

870
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,830
and destroy our black communities.

871
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,556
Who's the baby killer?

872
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,438
This is my good friend I told you
about, Forrest Gump.

873
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,433
Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley
and I lived together in Berkeley,

874
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,318
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

875
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,198
We are here to offer
protection and help

876
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,511
for all those who need our help,
because we, the Black Panthers,

877
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,955
are against the war in Vietnam.

878
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,032
We are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to die

879
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,872
for a country that hates them.

880
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,635
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

881
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,349
and come to be brutalised
and killed in their own communities.

882
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,149
We are against all these racist
and imperial acts...

883
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,516
# You know I caught my old lady
messin' around town

884
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,795
# And I gave her the gun

885
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,472
# I shot her... #

886
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,189
Forrest! Stop it! Stop it!

887
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,068
I shouldn't have brought you here.

888
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,516
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

889
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,160
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

890
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,956
Come on, Forrest.

891
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,190
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

892
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,633
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

893
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,234
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

894
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,911
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

895
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,440
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

896
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,999
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

897
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,078
You look handsome in it. You do.

898
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,519
- You know what?
- What?

899
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,559
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

900
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,873
Me, too, Forrest.

901
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,273
'We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talkin'.

902
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,911
'She told me about
all the travelling she'd done

903
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,629
'and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind

904
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,190
'and learn how to live in harmony,

905
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,430
'which must be out west somewhere,

906
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,909
'cos she made it
all the way to California.'

907
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,195
# Love one another right now #

908
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,872
(Man) Hey.

909
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,110
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

910
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,919
- I'll go.
- Far out!

911
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,516
'lt was a very special night
for the two of us.

912
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,636
'l didn't want it to end.'

913
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,313
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

914
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,356
I have to, Forrest.

915
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,192
Jenny?

916
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,994
Things got a little out of hand.

917
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,959
It's just this war and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

918
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,238
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

919
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,350
You know what I think?

920
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,437
I think...

921
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,069
you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

922
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,594
Forrest, we have very different
lives, you know.

923
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,396
I want you to have this.

924
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,631
Forrest, I can't keep this.

925
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,311
I got it...

926
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,198
just by doing what you told me to do.

927
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,236
Why are you so good to me?

928
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,751
You're my girl.

929
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,910
I'll always be your girl.

930
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,115
# To everything, turn, turn, turn

931
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,034
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn

932
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,238
# And a time to every purpose
under heaven #

933
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,753
'And just like that,
she was gone out of my life again.'

934
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,670
(Neil Armstrong)
'lt's one small step for man,

935
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,433
'one giant leap for mankind.'

936
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,995
'l thought I was going back
to Vietnam,

937
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,629
'but instead they decided the best
way for me to fight the communists

938
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,358
'was to play ping pong.'

939
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,035
So I was in the Special Services,
travelling around the country,

940
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,033
cheering up wounded veterans and
showing 'em how to play ping pong.

941
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,633
I was so good,

942
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,996
the Army decided I should be
on the All-American ping pong team.

943
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,236
'We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,038
'Somebody said world peace

'but all I did was play ping pong.'

01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,233
When I got home,

948
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,151
I was a national celebrity,

Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

952
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,357
Welcome home.

953
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,479
Can you tell us, um,
what was China like?

954
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,390
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothin' at all.

955
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,950
- No possessions?
- (Laughter)

956
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,511
And in China,
they never go to church.

957
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,594
- No religion, too?
- Oh. Hard to imagine.

958
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,752
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

959
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,037
'Some years later,
that nice young man from England

960
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,475
'was on his way home
to see his little boy

Lieutenant Dan!

01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,677
Yes, sir. They surely did.

968

Well, that...that's just perfect!

974
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,909
Well, I just got one thing
to say to that.

Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

997

I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for him, sir.

That's all these cripples
down at the VA.

Jesus this and Jesus that. Ha.

1001
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,430
Have I found Jesus?

1002
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,436
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

1003
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,913
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

1004
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,753
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

1005
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,992
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1006

Did you hear what I said?

1007

Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

Well, kiss my crippled ass.

1009

God is listening?
What a crock of shit.

1010
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,389
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

Oh?

01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,239
Well...

1013
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,554
Before you go, why don't you
get your ass down to the corner

1014
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,313
- and get another bottle of Ripple?
- Yes, sir.

about shrimping boats?

we'd be partners.

01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,950
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

1023
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,793
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

1024
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,711
A shrimp boat captain.

1025
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,837
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,
Lieutenant Dan.

1026
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,837
Now hear this!

1027
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,629
Private Gump here is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

1028
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,996
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1029
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,389
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1030
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,836
I will come and be
your first mate. Ha ha ha!

1031
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,675
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut!

1032
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,911
Danny, what are you complaining
about? How you doing, huh?

1033
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,798
Mr Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?

1034
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,314
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

1035
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,552
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-limbs Lenore.

1036
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,349
So where you been, babycakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1037
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,829
You should have been here
for Christmas,

1038
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,674
cos Tommy bought a free round
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1039
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,591
Well, I had, uh...company.

1040
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,434
Hey! Hey, we was just there!
That's, like, Times Square.

1041
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,230
Don't you just love New Year's?
You can start all over.

1042
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,357
Everybody gets a second chance.

1043
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,352
'lt's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1044
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,237
'l began to think about Jenny,

1045
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,517
'wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night

1046
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,114
'out in California.'

1047
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,430
# Don't you love her ways?

1048
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,478
# Tell me what you say

1049
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,552
# Don't you love her madly?

1050
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,438
# Want to meet her daddy?

1051
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,432
# Don't you love her face?

1052
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,071
# Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? #

1053
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,639
(Crowd) Nine...eight...

01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,551

three...two...

1057
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,078
One! Happy New Year!

1058
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,795
(Toot)

1059
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,114
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1060
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,998
# And never brought to mind... #

1061
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,878
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1062
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,590
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot

# Divided we fall

1066
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,232
# Come on now, people,
let's get on the ball

1067
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,436
# And work together

1068
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,751
# Come on, come on
let's work together... #

1069
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,874
Oh! What are you, stupid
or something? What's your problem?

1070
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,112
What's his problem?
Did you lose your packet in the war?

1071
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,556
- Is your friend stupid or something?
- What did you say?

1072
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,870
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

1073
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,713
- Don't call him stupid!
- Hey, don't push her!

1074
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,633
You shut up!
Don't you ever call him stupid!

1075
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,517
Get the hell outta here.

1076
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,592
Get your goddamn clothes
and get the hell out of here!

1077
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,559
You should be in a sideshow.
You're so pathetic!

1078
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,039
Get out of here!

1079
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,510
- You retard!
- Loser. You freak!

1080
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,592
Oh, no. No.

1081
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,876
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's
Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1082
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,110
She tasted like cigarettes.

1083
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,996
'l guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things you can't change.

1084
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,913
'He didn't want to be called crippled

1085
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,310
'just like I didn't want
to be called stupid.'

1086
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,310
Happy New Year, Gump.

1087
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,397
The US ping pong team met
with President Nixon today...

1088
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,119
Wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1089
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,352
they invited me and the ping pong
team to visit the White House.

1090
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,318
So I went, again.

1091
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,836
And I met the President
of the United States again.

1092
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,913
'Only this time, they didn't get us
rooms in a real fancy hotel.'

1093
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,356
Are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1094
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,477
- Where are you staying?
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

1095
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,994
Oh, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

1096
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,232
It's brand-new. Very modern.
I'll have my people take care of it.

1097
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,834
- 'Security.'
- Yeah. Sir...

1098
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,718
You might want to send
a maintenance man

1099
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,030
over to that office across the way.

1100
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,078
The lights are off and they must be
looking for a fuse box,

1101
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,958
cos them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1102
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,670
- 'OK, sir. I'll check it out.'
- Thank you. Good night.

1103
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,876
'Therefore,
I shall resign the presidency

1104
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,190
'effective at noon tomorrow.

1105
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,111
'Vice President Ford

1106
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,830
'will be sworn in as President
at that hour in this office.

1107
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,919
'As I recall the high hopes
for America

1108
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,912
'with which we began
this second term,...'

1109
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,353
- Forrest Gump.
- Yes, sir!

1110
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,796
As you were.
I have your discharge papers.

1111
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,030
Service is up, son.

1112
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,917
Does this mean
I can't play ping pong no more?

1113
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,911
For the Army, it does.

1114
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,113
'And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1115
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,311
'So I went home.'

1116
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,079
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know. I know.

1117
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,833
Louise, he's here.

1118
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,833
'Now, when I got home, I had no idea,
but Mama had all sorts of visitors.'

1119
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,480
We've had all sorts of visitors.

1120
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,199
Everybody wants you
to use their ping pong stuff.

1121
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,829
One man even left a check for $25,000

1122
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,549
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

1123
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,949
I only like using my own paddle.

1124
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,076
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1125
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,993
I know that, I know that.

1126
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,150
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1127
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,552
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1128
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:15,031
'That Mama, she sure was right.
It's fun to have things work out.

1129
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,031
'l didn't stay home for long

1130
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,875
'because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
and I always try to keep my promise,

1131
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,669
'so I went on down to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family.'

1132
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,955
Are you crazy...

1133
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,031
or just plain stupid?

1134
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,113
- Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs Blue.
- I guess.

1135
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:38,637
'And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.'

1136
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,395
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

1137
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,235
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1138
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:59,310
I'm taking the $24,562.47 that I got,

1139
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,676
that's left after a new haircut
and a new suit

1140
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,593
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1141
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,433
and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr Peppers.

1142
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,315
Tell me something.

1143
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,356
Are you stupid or something?

1144
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,396
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1145
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,233
That's what's left after me saying,

1146
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,153
"When I was in China
on the All-America ping pong team,

1147
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,199
"I just loved playing ping pong with
my Flex-o-lite ping pong paddle",

1148
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,670
which isn't true, but Mama said
it was just a white lie,

1149
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,716
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1150
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,716
So anyway, I'm putting all that
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1151
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,756
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1152
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,037
'Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1153
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,918
'but you know what I found out?

1154
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,599
'Shrimping is tough.'

1155
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,920
I only caught five.

1156
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,356
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

1157
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,833
You ever think about
naming this old boat?

1158
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,673
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1159
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,990
'l'd never named a boat before,

1160
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,915
'but there was only one
I could think of.

1161
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,788
'The most beautiful name
in the wide world.'

# Get down tonight... #

1170

'Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1171
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,628
'but I thought about her a lot.

Hey!

1179
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,955
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1180
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,032
Well, thought I'd try out
my sea legs.

1181
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,032
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1182
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,276
Yes, I know that.

1183
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,510
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1184
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:57,754
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1185
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,268
And...

1186
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,751
I told you if you were
ever a shrimp boat captain,

1187
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,149
that I'd be your first mate.

1188
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,153
- Here I am. I am a man of my word.
- OK.

1189
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:15,074
But don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1190
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,230
No, sir.

1191
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,635
That's my boat.

1192
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,359
(Dan) I have a feeling
if we head due east,

1193
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,910
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.

1194
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,515
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1195
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,034
Over there! They're over there!

1196
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,750
- Get on the wheel and take a left.
- OK.

1197
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,312
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1198
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:59,790
That's where we're going to find
those shrimp, my boy! Ha ha!

1199
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,791
That's where we'll find them.

1200
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,634
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- OK, so I was wrong.

1201
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,518
Well, how are we going to find them?

1202
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,229
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1203
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,834
# Still praying as

1204
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,276
# I onward bound... #

1205
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,828
'So I went to church every Sunday.

1206
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,395
'Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1207
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,836
'though I think he left
the praying up to me.'

1208
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,831
No shrimp.

1209
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,958
Where the hell's this God of yours?

1210
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,474
'lt's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,

1211
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,869
'cos right then God showed up.'

1212
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,516
(Dan) You'll never sink this boat!

1213
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,068
'Now, me, I was scared,

1214
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,470
'but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.'

1215
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,278
Come on!

1216
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,636
You call this a storm?

1217
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:38,473
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1218
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,918
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1219
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,754
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1220
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,432
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1221
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,354
You'll never sink...this...boat!

1222
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,237
Ha ha ha ha!

1223
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,276
Hurricane Carmen
came through yesterday,

1224
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,669
destroying nearly everything
in its path.

1225
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,320
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1226
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,834
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1227
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,914
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1228
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,956
'This reporter has learned,

1229
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:15,271
'in fact, only one shrimping boat
survived the storm.'

1230
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,715
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1231
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,758
'After that, shrimping was easy.'

1232
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,479
(Gospel choir)
# There will be great bounty

1233
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,233
# Oh, my God... #

1234
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,359
Since people still needed shrimps
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues,

1235
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,432
and we were the only
boat left standing,

1236
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,875
Bubba-Gump shrimp's what they got.

1237
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,793
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1238
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,394
Twelve Jennys, big old warehouse.

1239
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,950
We even have hats
that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1240
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,838
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1241
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,319
Hold on there, boy.

1242
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,916
Are you telling me you're the owner
of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1243
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,798
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1244
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,915
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time, but that tops them all.

1245
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,309
(Laughs)

1246
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,756
We were sitting next
to a millionaire!

1247
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:15,515
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

1248
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,515
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1249
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:24,434
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1250
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,750
Yes, I would.

1251
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,632
That's him right there.

1252
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,438
Let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan.

1253
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,158
Forrest...

1254
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,075
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

1255
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,795
'He never actually said so,

1256
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,634
'but I think
he made his peace with God.'

1257
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,076
(Gunshots)

1258
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,912
'For the second time in 17 days,

1259
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,436
'President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.'

1260
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,512
(Radio) 'Base to Jenny 1 .
Base to Jenny 1 .'

1261
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,953
Jenny 1 . Go, Margo.

1262
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,871
'Forrest has a phone call.'

1263
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,349
Well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1264
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,271
He is indisposed at the moment.

1265
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,510
'His mama's sick.'

1266
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,797
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1267
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,830
Hi, Forrest.

1268
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,911
(Doctor) I'll see you tomorrow.

1269
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,752
All right.

1270
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,075
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1271
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,192
What's the matter, Mama?

1272
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,271
I'm dying, Forrest.

1273
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,158
Come on in, sit down over here.

1274
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,270
Why are you dying, Mama?

1275
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,276
It's my time.

1276
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,351
It's just my time.

1277
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,749
Oh, now...

1278
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,991
Don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1279
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,230
Death is just a part of life.

1280
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,039
Something we're all destined to do.

1281
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,831
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1282
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,388
I did the best I could.

1283
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,436
You did good, Mama.

1284
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,594
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1285
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,469
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1286
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,274
What's my destiny, Mama?

1287
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,837
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1288
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,753
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1289
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,593
You never know
what you're going to get.

1290
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:57,753
'Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.'

1291
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,796
I will miss you, Forrest.

1292
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,675
'She had got the cancer

1293
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,876
'and died on a Tuesday.

1294
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,111
'l bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.'

1295
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,072
And that's all I have
to say about that.

1296
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,238
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1297
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,392
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1298
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,438
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1299
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,353
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1300
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:42,149
and a college graduate, the city
fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1301
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,879
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1302
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,476
'So I never went back
to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1303
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,233
'though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1304
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,153
'He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1305
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,629
So then I got a call from him

1306
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,154
saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,

1307
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:04,438
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1308
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,238
# I've got a new hope... #

1309
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:10,279
'Now Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1310
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,591
'and the rest
is just for showing off.

1311
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:18,993
'So I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare Gospel Church.

1312
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:24,555
'And I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1313
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,597
'And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1314
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,956
'l gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.'

1315
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,192
You know what?

1316
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,551
'She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.'

1317
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,596
That smells wonderful.

1318
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,800
'And cos I was a gozillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1319
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,836

1323
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,869
'And then...she was there.'

1324
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,755
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1325
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,038
'Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1326
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,750
'Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1327
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,628
'or maybe it was because she was
so tired cos she went to bed

01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:10,157
'and slept and slept
like she hadn't slept in years.

jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

ping ponging and shrimping

'Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.'

Will you marry me?

I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1353
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,757
You would, Forrest.

1354
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,790
But you won't marry me.

1355
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,393
You don't want to marry me.

1356
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,675
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1357
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,995

1358

01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,919

1360
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,233
Forrest, I do love you.

1361
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,399
Where are you running off to?

1362
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,436
I'm not running.

No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1374
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,231

if I could help them out.

I'm in the bumper sticker business.

you've been so inspirational,

be able to help me...

Whoa, man! You just ran
through a big pile of dog shit!

- It happens.
- What? Shit?

I'm supposed to go on the number nine
bus to Richmond Street

and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, apartment 4.

Why, you don't need to take a bus.

Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

- Down that way?
- Down that way.

Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

This is my very good friend Mr Gump.
Can you say hi?

1495
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,395
- Hello, Mr Gump.
- Hello.

1496
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,359
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes. Just keep it low.

- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1498
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:01,513
His name's Forrest.

1499
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,352
Like me!

1500
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,995
I named him after his daddy.

1501
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,753
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1502
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,916
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1503
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,308
Hey...

1504
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,836
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1505
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:38,632
There's nothing you need to do.
You didn't do anything wrong.

1506
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,073
OK?

1507
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,752
Isn't he beautiful?

1508
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:51,238
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1509
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,272
But...

1510
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:00,597
Is...is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1511
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:05,071
He's very smart. He's one
of the smartest in his class.

1512
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,873
Yeah, that's OK. Go talk to him.

1513
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,553
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1514
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,831

1515
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,672
I'm sick.

1516
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,754

a cough due to a cold?

they don't know what it is,

01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,120
and there isn't
anything they can do about it.

1519
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:15,433
You could come home with me.

1520
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:22,436
Jenny, you and...Little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1521
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:28,757
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1522
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,911
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1523
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,235
OK.

1524
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,836
(Man) Please take your seats.

1525
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:48,592
Forrest? It's time to start.

1526
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:07,953
Hi.

1527
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,792
Your tie.

1528
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,435
Lieutenant Dan.

1529
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,192
Lieutenant Dan.

1530
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,758
Hello, Forrest.

1531
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,512
You got new legs.

1532
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:47,158
New legs!

1533
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,392
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1534
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:55,632
Titanium alloy. It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1535
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,832
Magic legs.

1536
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:06,957
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1537
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:13,831
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1538
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,391
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1539
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,278
Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.

1540
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,873
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1541
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:40,513
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1542
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,356
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1543
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,996
- Hey.
- Hi.

1544
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:31,232
Hey, Forrest...

1545
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,476
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1546
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:44,237
Yes. Well, l... I don't know.

1547
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:50,519
'Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out...

1548
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,117
'and then it was nice.'

1549
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:02,672
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1550
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,470
'There was always a million sparkles
on the water...

1551
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,076
'like that mountain lake.

1552
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:13,116
'lt was so clear, Jenny,

1553
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:17,876
'it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.'

1554
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,671
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...

1555
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:31,713
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped
and the earth began.

1556
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,396
'lt's so beautiful.'

1557
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:42,198
I wish I could've been there
with you.

1558
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:47,231
You were.

1559
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,718
I love you.

1560
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,597
'You died on a Saturday morning.'

1561
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:11,353
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1562
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:21,072
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1563
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:31,677
Mama...always said
that dyin' was a part of life.

1564
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,756
I sure wish it wasn't.

1565
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,799
Little Forrest is...doing just fine.

1566
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,597
"But..."

1567
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:49,148
About to start school again soon,

1568
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:54,272
and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner every day.

1569
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:01,990
I make sure he...combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1570
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:10,390
Teaching him how to play ping pong.
He's really good.

1571
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,677
Uh, Forrest, you go. Uhh!

1572
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,116
'We fish a lot.'

1573
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:25,995
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1574
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:30,350
You'd be so proud of him.

1575
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:33,359
I am.

1576
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:37,238
He, uh, wrote you a...a letter.

1577
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,880
And he says I can't read it.

1578
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,475
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1579
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:01,872
Jenny...

1580
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:12,516
I don't know if Mama was right
or if it...it's Lieutenant Dan.

1581
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:19,995
I don't know...if
we each have a...destiny,

1582
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:26,758
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze...

1583
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,630
But l...l think...maybe it's both.

1584
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:43,391
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1585
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,796
But I miss you, Jenny.

1586
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,396
If there's anything you need...
I won't be far away.

1587
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,397
(Birds chirping)

1588
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,555
Here's your bus. OK.

1589
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:42,473
Hey, I know this.

1590
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,233
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell

1591
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:47,959
because Grandma
used to read it to you.

1592
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,596
My favourite book.

1593
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,719
Here we are.

1594
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,070
Hey. Here you go.

1595
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:05,719
Hey, Forrest.

1596
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,233
Don't...

1597
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,320
I wanted to tell you I love you.

1598
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,277
I love you, too, Daddy.

1599
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:18,114
I'll be right here when you get back.

1600
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:19,474
(Pop)

1601
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,997
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1602
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,710
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
