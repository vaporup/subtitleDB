Princess!

18
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,078
How dare Fung San
rape and murder Princess Nan Cheong!

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,432
Nan Cheong was of noble blood
and she was my cousin.

20
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,597
How could she be raped
by a degenerate?

21
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,229
How am l to face my ancestors?

22
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,871
Please look after yourself, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,798
Your Majesty,
as the Chief Royal Guard

24
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,559
it is Fong Sau Ching's duty
to patrol the Royal City,

25
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,194
but he colluded
in his brother Fung San's crime.

26
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,949
l beg Your Majesty to punish
Fong Sau Ching according to our law.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,230
l didn't collude
in Fung San's crime.

28
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,909
However, Fung San is cunning
and highly skilled in martial arts.

29
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,156
No more nonsense from you!

30
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,838
l must have your family killed

31
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,679
and have you beheaded
at the market entrance!

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,156
Your Majesty, please spare me!

33
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,636
- Wait...
- Wait.

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,591
Wait.

35
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,671
Since you have been
loyal to me for years...

36
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,193
l will give you a chance
to redeem your guilt.

37
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,436
You have 20 days to capture Fung San.

38
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,996
Thank you, Your Majesty.
l will capture Fung San in 20 days

39
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,396
to thank Your Majesty
for sparing my life. l am leaving.

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,276
l salute you, our master's brother.

41
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,909
Master's brother!
Are you all right?

42
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,919
lt was the traitor Fung San
who did this to me.

43
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,998
Why did he hit you so hard?

44
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,796
Fung San sneaked in the night before last
to try to steal the black jade Buddha.

45
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,879
l found out and we started to fight.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,710
l was hit
and he stole the black jade Buddha.

47
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,638
Why did he steal
the black jade Buddha?

48
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,788
According to the Buddhist scriptures,
after Buddha achieved enlightenment,

49
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,632
the devil went to Buddha and said,
''l want to follow Buddha's path.''

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,753
''However, l am full of sin.
Can l still achieve enlightenment?''

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,678
Buddha worked a miracle
and devised the Wheel of Life and Death.

52
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,519
The devil sat on it
and held the black jade Buddha tightly,

53
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,313
while saying the Buddhist prayer.

54
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,672
The devil went through the process of
rebirth and death 100 times in an instant.

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,360
To go through rebirth and death
100 times in an instant?

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,029
Fung San has reached the end of the road.
Does he believe in this myth

57
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
and wish to use the black jade Buddha
to transport him to another time?

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,792
But transition is impossible without
the Wheel of Life and Death, isn't it?

59
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,232
The Tibetan ambassador has just entered
the city to present the gifts of tribute,

60
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,069
and one of the gifts
is the Wheel of Life and Death.

61
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,272
ln seven days at midnight it will be the
time to achieve Buddhist enlightenment.

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,879
l must stop him!

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,436
Fung San, you can't escape.
Surrender now.

64
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,358
Stupid dog, you've come too late!

65
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,399
Fung San.

66
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,790
Stupid dog,
are you blind and without a brain?

67
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,115
Don't you know l'm the older brother?

68
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,755
The first of the ten rules
in our monastery is not to rape.

69
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,235
You raped and murdered
1 3 young women.

70
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,191
Why have you become like this?

71
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,199
Stupid dog, we started practising
martial arts when we were five years old,

72
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,791
from dawn before the rooster crowed
until midnight every day.

73
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,150
lt was an intolerable life.

74
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,477
l've practised martial arts for 25 years.
A whole 25 years!

75
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,394
l've finally mastered
the undefeatable martial art.

76
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,594
Now that l've reached perfection,
it's time to indulge myself to the full.

77
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,111
Raping and murdering women
excites and delights me!

78
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,074
You've lost your soul.
You've gone mad!

79
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,520
l tear my robe and our relationship
is at an end from today.

80
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,235
Our brotherhood has now ceased.

81
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,751
Your Majesty, although l can't bring
Fung San back to the city for punishment,

82
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,351
killing him at least
means l have fulfilled my duty.

83
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,074
But your servant will also perish today.

84
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,351
l will no longer
be able to serve Your Majesty.

85
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,597
Your Majesty,
please look after your precious self.

86
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,710
University of Qing Hua,
Research Team for the Northern Region.

87
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,148
There's been an accident over there!

88
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,869
- Over there, over there!
- Go and save him!

89
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,878
- Quick, over there.
- Quick, quick!

90
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,110
- Hurry.
- He's there, he's there...

91
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,199
- Get the medicine, get the medicine!
- Drag him out of there!

92
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,709
- Be careful.
- Be gentle with him.

93
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,398
- ls there any medicine?
- He's fine.

94
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,272
Pass it over.

95
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,237
lt's all right. lt's all right now.

96
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,551
lt's showing now.

97
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,598
Visual Analysis System

98
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,834
This is such a great discovery.

99
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,992
This proves homosexuality existed
even in ancient times.

100
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,554
And that AlDS existed
a very long time ago?

101
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,194
- Goddamn it, stop talking nonsense.
- Yes, yes.

102
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,597
ln 1887, the lnstitute
of Bioresearch Centre in Sweden

103
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,917
resuscitated a frog
which had been frozen for a century.

104
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,474
ln 1 985, a university successfully
germinated a lotus seed

105
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,275
which had been frozen
for 20 million years.

106
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,834
Therefore, in theory,
the two ancient corpses

107
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,713
may be restored to life
by using electrodes to revive them.

108
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,432
Stop talking nonsense.

109
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,348
The bodies are being kept
at minus 10 degrees.

110
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,508
Attempting to revive them
means defrosting them.

111
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,349
lf the attempt fails,
the bodies will start to decompose.

112
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,391
We can't risk that.

113
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,273
l suggest we send the bodies to the US.
They have advanced equipment there.

114
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,039
- What do you think?
- Yes, yes.

115
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,438
And, of course, we should all go there
to conduct the experiment.

116
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,472
lt's a golden opportunity to apply
for research funding to go abroad.

117
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,433
- True.
- l've got to go.

118
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
Are you Li Pang, trying to escape
because you've killed so many people?

119
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,597
Chai Ling is your student.
You're the one who wants to flee.

120
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,790
Stop talking nonsense.

121
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,596
There's no hope for our country.
We should all go together.

122
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,271
Watch out - if 27th Army hear us,
they'll send tanks here to suppress us.

123
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,231
You can all relax.

124
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,591
l expressed my support
for the Central Government from the start.

125
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,075
We're experts at telling lies,
isn't that right?

126
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,395
No one will ever suspect me.

127
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,795
We can say the transport
of the corpses to the US

128
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,354
is an excuse
to capture the student leader Wuer Kaixi.

129
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,472
Carry on teaching that the government
loves its people very much.

130
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,752
That son of a bitch Li Pang
will certainly allow us to go abroad.

131
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,075
What a great speech!

132
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,070
lf we can find
an excuse to go via Hong Kong,

133
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,877
we could visit Club Boss or
The Volvo Club. That would be ideal.

134
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,276
- What do you think?
- l couldn't agree more.

135
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,951
What he said wasn't nonsense, not at all.

136
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,318
Here's your car.

137
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,150
Fat Bull,
don't you have any brains?

138
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,033
How can we fit all the stuff
in such a small car?

139
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,836
The boss is having a party tonight.
We've got to take everything in there!

140
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,795
l didn't know that. l can fetch a bigger car
or l can make another trip.

141
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,353
Start working!

142
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,879
Which is more expensive,
frozen prawns or abalones?

143
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,878
Are you stupid? Take whatever you see.

144
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,916
- What the hell is it?
- lt says ''National treasure''.

145
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,194
- How mysterious.
- Let's check it out.

146
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,869
We'll be executed if we steal
something of national importance.

147
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,879
l didn't say l wanted to steal it.
l'm just nosy and want a peep.

148
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,479
Get some tools to open it.

149
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,435
What a huge refrigerator.

150
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,718
Why is this in here?

151
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,112
What is this?

152
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,755
Don't you know anything?
This is called a Terracotta Warrior.

153
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,872
lt can't be.
Terracotta is made of ceramic clay.

154
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,991
lt doesn't have to be in a fridge.

155
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,878
Then may l have your opinion
on what it might be?

156
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,591
A corpse!

157
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,949
Oh, no!
Sounds like the boss's son is back!

158
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,830
He should be at the party.

159
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,514
That short-arse is so sly.
He even comes back to check on us.

160
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,676
Thank God we're smart,
or we'd be caught.

161
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,797
You scared me to death!

162
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,475
- What happened?
- Yes...

163
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,636
There are two possibilities.

164
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,117
The corpse was stolen by someone,
or the corpse has come back to life!

165
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,071
Shit, now that the corpses have vanished,
we'll be executed!

166
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,189
What shall we do?

167
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,278
Don't you have a brain?
Think of a way.

168
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,918
l have a way.

169
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,635
lt's horrific here.

170
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,399
Could this be hell?

171
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,277
Why are there so many monsters?

172
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,751
Why are my skills impaired?

173
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,796
- lt's cold...
- Who's that?

174
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,472
Who's this?

175
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,194
My friend, are you a newcomer?
Here for a handout?

176
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,357
- lf so, get to the back of the queue.
- Yes, get to the back.

177
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,198
The church workers are coming.

178
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,358
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

179
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,077
We haven't eaten for days
and we're dying of hunger.

180
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,033
Merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

181
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,718
- Good health...
- Thank you.

182
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,991
Good luck with your school results.
Merry Christmas.

183
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,159
- A Christmas present. Good health to you.
- Thank you.

184
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,956
That's for you.

185
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,274
My dear brothers, where am l?

186
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,195
- Kowloon City.
- Kowloon City?

187
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,550
Where is Kowloon City?

188
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,353
- lt's in Kowloon.
- And where is Kowloon?

189
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,118
lt's in Hong Kong.

190
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,356
So where is Hong Kong?

191
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,359
lt's in Asia.

192
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,836
Asia? l don't know any of these places.

193
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,233
- But do you know Peking?
- Peking? Of course we know Peking.

194
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,396
How long will it take to walk there?

195
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,909
l think probably a year.

196
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,076
Was l taken to the land of the barbarians
while l was unconscious?

197
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,590
This guy is a nutter.
We have to watch what we say.

198
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,638
My dear brother,
what did you do for a living?

199
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,753
l was the Chief Royal Guard
of the palace.

200
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,635
And may l ask who you are?

201
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,153
He is the East Factory Chief.
He's a eunuch.

202
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,112
Nice to meet you.

203
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,798
He's a eunuch?

204
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,550
He wasn't castrated!

205
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,673
- And who are you?
- l am the great emperor.

206
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,549
How dare you!

207
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,355
lt is sacrilegious to pretend
to be the emperor. l'll behead you!

208
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,799
Wait, wait.

209
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,559
Chief Royal Guard, l am innocent.
Please read my paper.

210
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,955
Please submit it to the emperor.

211
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,435
HlSTORY OF CHlNA

212
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,719
What are you doing?

213
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,712
Sister, it is very brave of you
to take on other people's debt.

214
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,115
But a debt is a debt after all,

215
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,118
and you must pay off some today
no matter what,

216
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,277
or l'll have no explanation
to give Big Brother.

217
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,710
Don't say another word, you moron.

218
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,673
l don't have any money now.
Kill me if you want.

219
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,633
lf not, let's talk after the New Year.

220
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,356
Don't say l'm not giving you a chance.

221
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,869
l have a customer
who wants some excitement

222
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,156
and wants you to pretend
to be raped in a car.

223
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,434
Are you crazy?
l'm a model, not a hooker.

224
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,155
Model, my arse. The customer
is paying $5,000. A fat $5,000!

225
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,989
No way. l won't work for a psychopath,
no matter how much he pays me.

226
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,156
You dare touch me?

227
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,916
Show her the present.

228
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,595
So you have some circus tricks?

229
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,513
- No, l won't do it.
- What do you mean? What's this?

230
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,029
Ask him to take his mask off.

231
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,439
Boss, would you take off the mask?

232
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,792
Be happy.

233
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,676
Go to hell!

234
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,519
Hey!

235
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,192
Damn it.

236
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,508
Tie.

237
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,470
Hurry up.

238
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,351
A deviant?

239
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,031
You masked pervert!

240
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,672
Traitor! You dare speak
in a foreign tongue? Go to hell!

241
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,553
Help!

242
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,958
Miss, are you all right?

243
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,469
Who are you?
They didn't say anything about you.

244
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,751
Boss! Boss! What happened?

245
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,677
Hey!

246
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,513
My dear brothers, can l help?

247
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,998
Can you help?

248
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,949
Big brother, that was really cool!

249
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,275
Get him! Get him!

250
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,480
Miss, it's all quiet again now.

251
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,478
Who the hell are you?
Why did you interfere?

252
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,036
Miss, l preserved your honour.
Why are you reproaching me?

253
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,355
A sister owed them money
and vanished.

254
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,031
l'm her guarantor, so l have to satisfy him.
Do you understand?

255
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,276
So it's forced prostitution.

256
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,392
Miss, you are an extraordinary person.
You sacrificed yourself.

257
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,229
You are brave and courageous.
l salute you.

258
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,078
l don't care. You've ruined this. You must
explain to Big Brother tomorrow.

259
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,317
No problem. l am a man of dignity
and will take the responsibility.

260
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,591
- l shall leave now.
- Wait. Give me your pager number.

261
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,075
- What?
- How do l find you tomorrow?

262
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,911
l've only just come to this place.
l don't have a place to sleep.

263
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,471
Hey, give me your lD card.

264
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,514
- lD card?
- You're an illegal immigrant, huh?

265
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,950
Don't think this is over, bitch.
l'll spray you with acid one of these days.

266
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,072
You dare threaten me with acid?
You son of a bitch!

267
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,195
Follow me home.

268
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,833
Brothers, you'll be fine in an hour.
See you another time.

269
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,677
Come in and stop acting like a thief.

270
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,033
Leave your stinking clothes over there
in case they stink out the whole flat.

271
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,189
Crazy.

272
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,350
How magical.

273
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,477
Hey, Mr lllegal, what are you doing?

274
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,434
- Can you tell me about this light?
- Electric lights.

275
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,111
- Which village are you from?
- l'm from Ji village of Shanxi Province.

276
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,800
- Never heard of it.
- May l ask where you come from?

277
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,798
- Tsim Sha Tsui.
- Tsim Sha Tsui...

278
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,552
Miss, we use oil for lights in my village.

279
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,391
My dear warrior,
we use electricity for lights.

280
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,832
Electricity for lights?
Does it come from thunder and lightning?

281
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,234
That's correct.

282
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,239
A giant power plant
collects the electricity,

283
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,230
l push a switch, through the electric wires
and here we have light.

284
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,670
- Do you understand?
- Yes, l entirely understand.

285
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,952
Do you really? Don't pretend.

286
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,195
Men and women shouldn't touch.

287
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,314
Damn you!

288
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,432
Did your enemies ransack your home?

289
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,235
l've been busy working
and haven't had a chance to tidy up.

290
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,069
l've never seen a woman's room
look as chaotic as this.

291
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,555
How dare you insult me!
l'll hit you!

292
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,112
Yes?
You've got the wrong number, bitch.

293
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,392
You're the bitch!

294
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,791
What is this thing?

295
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,912
Are you winding me up?
Haven't you seen a telephone before?

296
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,716
You can play with it.

297
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,518
Sister, the Japanese customer has arrived.
Come if you need money.

298
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,119
You've got the wrong number, bitch.
You're the bitch!

299
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,759
You're a fast learner.

300
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,552
You flatter me.

301
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,596
Miss, now what's this?

302
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,518
This is an electric kettle.
lt's for boiling water.

303
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,800
l see, it's an electric kettle.

304
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,718
And what about the small house
that took us up here?

305
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,159
lt was the lift.

306
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:13,868
Lift, electric light, electric wires,
electric kettle, telephone...

307
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,991
Electric chair?

308
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,677
Damn you.

309
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,717
Stop laughing. Are you an idiot?

310
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,956
You'll get the electric chair, not me!

311
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,873
Miss, may l ask...

312
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,233
How are you, handsome?

313
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,672
How are you, miss?

314
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,558
Come close to me, handsome.

315
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,238
What for?

316
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,796
l'm lonely. Come and hold me.

317
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,193
Watch yourself!
Men and women shouldn't touch.

318
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,073
l, Fong Sau Ching, am a man of dignity.

319
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,035
l will not submit to seduction.
Get away from me, evil woman!

320
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,799
- Let's see how far you'll go.
- l was only joking!

321
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,559
Stop it, you bad boy...

322
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,514
You degenerate!
Stop this immediately or l'll kill you!

323
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,789
- Don't kill it!
- Get away!

324
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,116
Where's he gone?

325
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,476
- Where are those two people?
- Who do you mean?

326
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,149
- This is just a picture screen.
- Picture?

327
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,836
A picture that can move?
How can it look so real?

328
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,151
- Magical pictures?
- Magical pictures? Don't be silly.

329
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,910
lt's acting. You must have it
in your village. lt's like Chinese opera.

330
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,996
People filmed it with a machine

331
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,557
and use the wires
to send the picture into this box,

332
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,070
then show it to us.
This thing is called television.

333
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,950
- Do you understand now?
- Yes, l understand entirely.

334
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,434
Mister, how long's it been
since you had a wash?

335
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,994
You really stink. Have a bath now.

336
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,509
Miss, please respect yourself.

337
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,640
Respect, my arse. Go and have a bath.

338
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,196
Wash your buttocks, toes and armpits.
Get in there.

339
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,196
Miss, please withdraw.

340
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,508
Do you know
how to use the handles and taps?

341
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,677
l'll know after some investigation.

342
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,753
l see. lt's an electric well.

343
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,836
l'm thirsty.

344
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,717
The water is of poor quality.
Let me try again.

345
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,833
lt's far too salty.

346
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Let me wash my face.

347
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,674
Miss, men and women shouldn't touch.

348
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,516
Miss, why are you so frightened?

349
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,237
Cockroach!

350
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,397
- Do you mean this?
- What are you doing? Throw it away.

351
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,516
That's quite tasty.

352
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,592
Tastes much better
than ones from home.

353
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,916
Miss, the electric kettle.

354
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,110
He has superhuman powers.

355
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,879
l'm going to sleep now.
You take your time.

356
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,316
Don't touch my things.

357
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,031
lt's showing
an opera of the Ming Dynasty.

358
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,915
His Majesty summons
Princess Cheung Ping to court.

359
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,274
Summon Chow Sai Hin to court.

360
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,277
He's playing the emperor.

361
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,633
Our soldiers have been defeated
by the rebels outside the city gate.

362
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,516
The rebels got into the palace?
lt can't be true.

363
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,677
God decided
to destroy the Ming Dynasty.

364
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,439
Has the Ming Dynasty been destroyed?

365
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,593
lt can't be true. lt must be just a play.

366
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,510
''ln 1644, 340 years ago,
Lin Chong forced his way into Peking.''

367
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,076
''Emperor Chong Zhen fled and hanged
himself. The Ming Dynasty collapsed.''

368
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,155
Has the Wheel really made me travel
300 years into the future?

369
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,397
lt's impossible. lt's impossible!

370
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,509
My country was wiped out ,
my home destroyed. ls it really true?

371
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,114
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

372
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,550
Your servant deserves
to die a million deaths for his guilt.

373
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,075
Your servant didn't manage
to protect you from danger.

374
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,270
l can't atone
even if l die a million times!

375
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,473
Your servant must die
a million deaths for his guilt!

376
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,074
Your servant must die
a million deaths for his guilt!

377
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,479
He's so amazingly into the film.
lt's madness.

378
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,032
l'll be negotiating with Big Brother.

379
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,470
lf l fail, l'll make this sound.
You come and beat him up.

380
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,989
Beat him up?
What does the ''up'' mean?

381
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,509
That's what it means, you dumb-ass.
Understand?

382
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,596
l understand. To fight him with a fist.

383
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,349
And you look like a creampuff.
How can you negotiate looking like that?

384
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,119
lt doesn't look cool. Be like me.

385
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,231
Like how?

386
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,036
Shake your body, like this.
Pretend you're on stage.

387
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,919
Light me a cigarette.

388
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,668
Damn it, creampuff.

389
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,789
Miss Beautiful,
Big Brother wants you to go in.

390
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,553
Be smart.

391
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,757
Your men treated me badly last night.
l put up with it.

392
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,711
But my boyfriend can't.

393
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,630
You know, Chinese gangsters kill without
mercy and they're good at kung fu.

394
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,435
Brother Hung
learnt a lesson from him last night, right?

395
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,869
Normally l don't take him out.

396
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,630
l only brought him today
to at least apologise to you.

397
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,036
We should just forget
about what happened last night.

398
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,950
lt wasn't an electric well,
but an electric crap bowl.

399
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,195
Ching! Ching!

400
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,359
Go!

401
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,631
Superb, superb!

402
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,673
Mr lllegal, look out!

403
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,750
- What was that powerful hidden weapon?
- Don't you know? lt's a gun.

404
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,359
A gun?

405
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,712
l specialise in catching them.

406
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,230
That weapon is definitely very powerful.

407
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,920
- We're no match for him.
- Let's retreat.

408
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,269
Jump down from here.
We'll get away quicker. Let's jump.

409
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,070
- lt's too high. l changed my mind.
- Let's jump quickly.

410
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,189
No!

411
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,839
- No...
- Jump.

412
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,471
Quick, run.

413
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,595
Hey, bitch!

414
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,990
ls that your boyfriend?

415
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,836
What big news! What big news!

416
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,269
Will you just sit down?

417
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,998
What a dumb-ass.

418
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,190
- What would you like, sister?
- A coffee.

419
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,799
And sir?

420
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,593
- A glass of water will do for him.
- OK.

421
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,750
Check that out carefully.
This is what's called an lD card.

422
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,556
Without it, the police will trample on you
and you won't find a job. Understand?

423
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,398
Miss, you know a lot of people.

424
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,512
Please help me to apply for one
and also recommend a job for me.

425
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,596
That's not a problem.

426
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,868
But tell me why you're so dumb.
You don't know a damn thing.

427
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,752
Where the hell are you actually from?

428
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,953
l'm worried that if l tell you the truth
you'll beat me up again.

429
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,992
l won't beat you up. So tell me.

430
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,035
l am actually the
Chief Royal Guard to the Ming Dynasty.

431
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,278
To catch my older brother,
a depraved maniac, l got onto the Wheel.

432
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,436
lt somehow brought me
300 years into the future,

433
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,472
and l've now come to
Asia of Kowloon in Hong Kong.

434
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,032
Forget it.

435
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,151
Fine. So what can you do?

436
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,832
Although l am a warrior,
l've worked hard on music and the arts.

437
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,469
My interests include locks, carpentry,
fishing, hunting and folk dancing.

438
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,875
l learned how to look after myself
as a youth,

439
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,788
so l know a little about
washing clothes, ploughing land,

440
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,151
growing vegetables,
weaving and embroidery.

441
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,751
Also, l've cooked for 500 men at one time
when l was serving in the army.

442
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,118
That's all pretty run-of-the-mill.
All men know how to do those things.

443
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,995
Don't say that l'm not nice to you.
l'll do you a favour.

444
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,192
You can be my bodyguard
and general servant.

445
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,471
l'll pay you $300 a month.
Am l nice to you?

446
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,511
- Are you happy?
- No.

447
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,519
Fong Sau Ching is a man of dignity.
l will not serve a woman.

448
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,679
You're too chauvinistic.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

449
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,351
Women are superior here.
Only dignified men serve women.

450
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,914
Watch this. Watch carefully.

451
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,750
- You bastard!
- You poor thing, are you hurt?

452
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,155
Serves you right!

453
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,950
Don't hit me. l'm sorry.

454
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,794
Times have changed.

455
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,471
What's more, even the coins we use
have a woman's head on them.

456
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,591
As you can see.

457
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,475
Without lD, the police will trample on you.
lt's up to you if you want to leave.

458
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,388
l'd never have guessed that l,
Fong Sau Ching, would sink so low.

459
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,909
My country was wiped out,
my home destroyed.

460
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,559
l've no choice but to follow the example
Emperor Yue set - to bear insults.

461
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,593
l hope the day will come
when my country is rebuilt.

462
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,192
Miss, l accept your offer for now.

463
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,348
Good. Now practise putting two cubes of
sugar in my coffee and stirring it properly.

464
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,470
- lt's been stirred properly...
- How dare you?

465
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,114
How dare you use your fingers?

466
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,756
Think it over.
l'm paying a fat $300 a month to hire you.

467
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,638
- Don't you know how to play mahjong?
- Sister, here's your tea.

468
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,598
l asked you to serve my sisters, not me.
Go over there and do it.

469
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,917
You're such a dumb-ass.
l pay a fat $300 a month to hire you.

470
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,759
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, come on...

471
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,233
- 1 5, 20...
- l lose again!

472
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,592
- Have some tea first.
- l don't want any.

473
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,996
Sister, here's your tea.

474
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,792
What's this?

475
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,595
- Mud lemon tea.
- Go to hell! Go to hell!

476
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,675
My country was wiped out,
my home destroyed.

477
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,636
To bear the insults, accept the bitter life.

478
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,548
My country was wiped out, my home
destroyed. Fong Sau Ching, bear it!

479
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,270
Ching, what are you doing?
Be quick, l'm desperate.

480
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,311
l'm washing clothes.

481
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,635
Why is it taking so long?

482
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,272
What are you doing?

483
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,109
Hey!

484
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,077
How can you screw things up
every single time?

485
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,031
l'll go crazy soon.

486
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,832
Help, my home is ruined.

487
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,959
Fire!
The flat is on fire! Ching, get out now!

488
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,072
Help!

489
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,112
Ching, what are you doing?

490
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,994
l'm making you some nice food to eat.

491
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,076
Are you insane? Why burn logs
when you can use the microwave?

492
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,158
l'll go crazy soon.
Nothing will be left.

493
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,073
Why are there so many plants?

494
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,112
l grow them.
Look how many l've grown.

495
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,438
That's nice.

496
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,714
- What's this?
- An African orchid.

497
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,075
Are you really a man?

498
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,072
Damn it. What's he drawing all this time?

499
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,558
- That looks stupid.
- Give it back.

500
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,148
Give it back.

501
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,436
Robbery! Robbery!

502
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,316
How much did you get?

503
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,674
- Here.
- You should've taken gold Rolexes.

504
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,155
Jewellery's hard to sell.
Why don't you learn?

505
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,350
You're such an idiot.

506
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,716
Take it.

507
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,676
l'll have a bath first.

508
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,794
Hello. Page 996 for me.

509
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,195
lt's Sister calling him. Yes.

510
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,592
''Sister paged you.''

511
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,876
- Have a bath.
- Stop being so fussy.

512
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,718
Open the door! Open the door!

513
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,400
- Someone's outside. Do you hear?
- Don't worry.

514
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,750
- l recognise the voice! lt's my husband!
- Your husband?

515
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,677
Open the door!

516
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,755
Ching...

517
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,110
- You pervert!
- What is it?

518
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,951
Excuse me, sir...

519
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,833
Ching, leave him alone. Stop hitting him!

520
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,111
l'm fine. Since you hit him so hard,
he won't try anything again.

521
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,151
- Are you really OK?
- Yes.

522
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,589
- Be careful.
- Go back down.

523
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,675
l'm so puzzled.
My husband really loves me.

524
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:12,194
When a man loves a woman that much
it becomes puzzling.

525
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,550
What should l do?

526
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:20,198
How about you give me $5,000
and l'll send him away?

527
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,157
There you are!

528
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,670
Only $3,000?
l'm afraid it isn't enough.

529
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,199
lt probably is enough. l'll try.

530
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,913
l'll try now.

531
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,836
What's it like to be a model?

532
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,795
We try to sell
fashionable clothes to the customers.

533
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,512
We have to meet them all the time.

534
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,518
lt's fine when the customers are good.

535
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,269
But some take the chance
to try to rape us.

536
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,992
l was really scared.

537
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,079
Thanks for helping me.
lt's good to teach them a lesson.

538
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,236
lt's hard to earn a living in Hong Kong.

539
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,909
Now you know. lt's a hard life.

540
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,949
Skinny monkey, what are you doing?

541
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,550
l warn you, if you damage the televisions
you'll have to pay for them.

542
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,149
What are you staring at?
Haven't you seen this before?

543
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,236
You piece of shit.

544
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,235
You piece of shit, drink the whole can
and l may let you lick my toes clean.

545
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,359
Go to hell!

546
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,232
Darling!

547
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,795
Darling...

548
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,078
Darling, he tried to rape me!

549
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,838
Bastard!

550
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,599
You piece of shit,
how dare you try it on with my wife?

551
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,392
You son of a bitch!

552
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,639
Hung!

553
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,356
Let her go or l'll kill you!

554
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,389
But for me, you'd be a beggar.
This is how you repay me?

555
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,877
You've made a fortune from me.
l've robbed over ten times for you.

556
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,157
You never gave me a share.

557
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,635
Shut up! l'm the boss.
You do as l say!

558
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,593
Kneel down and apologise to my wife.

559
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,270
You don't think l'll shoot you?

560
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,552
l've got the bullets.

561
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,878
Miss has gone too far.
She treats me like a slave.

562
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,311
l agreed to serve her,
but not her friends as well.

563
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,994
To be frank, he isn't bad.
lt's crucial that he can stand your temper.

564
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,429
Your boyfriend is so strong.

565
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,996
He must make you very happy
when you're making love?

566
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,829
You're talking nonsense.
He's not my boyfriend.

567
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,350
- l treat him like a maid.
- You just treat him like a maid?

568
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,234
How about this: l pay you $5,000
and you sell him to me.

569
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,511
- l'll pay $10,000.
- l'll pay $1 5,000.

570
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,632
l'm not selling him,
however much you offer.

571
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,273
- Fine.
- lt's your turn.

572
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,678
By the way, does he know you use him
to cheat your customers?

573
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,315
Of course not.
You can't tell, but he's a moron.

574
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,112
He's there to be used.

575
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,193
Does he know what we do for a living?

576
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,711
How would he know? l look so elegant.
l'm not sure about you, though.

577
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,559
- Do l look like one?
- Not your look, but your voice.

578
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,911
Once people hear your voice
they know you're a hooker.

579
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,793
- Hooker?
- Stop it! We're all hookers.

580
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,235
''Hooker: another name for a prostitute.''

581
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,039
So l've been helping her
cheat her customers.

582
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,910
God, l, Fong Sau Ching,
am a respectable Chief Royal Guard.

583
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,635
How did l sink
to helping a hooker commit crimes?

584
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,750
Hey! Go and cook now. l'm starving!

585
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,236
No. l won't work for this hooker any more!

586
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,518
Am l doing this for the lD card?

587
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,434
My country was destroyed.
Where can l go now?

588
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,235
There's nothing left for me.
l feel so alone.

589
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:30,589
Even though my country was destroyed,
l still don't have to bear her temper, do l?

590
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,914
Have l fallen in love with her?

591
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,953
lt's impossible.

592
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,709
lt's impossible.

593
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,034
Can l have some newspapers?

594
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,755
''Cold-blooded pervert
raped and decapitated young woman.''

595
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,756
''Body found, limbs broken.
Rape and murder in cold blood.''

596
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,555
Limbs were broken?
The killer acted exactly like Fung San.

597
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,511
Could he be alive...

598
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,237
and be here too?

599
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,035
lt must be him.

600
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,637
''Arrest Notice''

601
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,788
''This man is Fung San. He acts
like a mad wolf and has no morals.''

602
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,711
''He rapes women and robs people.
All good citizens, beware of him.''

603
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,632
Please come up.

604
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,394
Follow me.

605
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,799
She's a model. She just needs some
fast cash. She'll only do it once or twice.

606
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,069
Hey, miss.

607
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,753
Hello? Hello? lt that Ching?

608
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,668
Ching. What's wrong with you?
l've been paging you all day.

609
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,349
l'll be going with a customer
to Pei Pa Garden later.

610
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,278
l'm afraid he may assault me.
Get ready to help me.

611
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,034
This woman wants to use me again
to help her commit crimes.

612
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,674
l'm a respectable commander.
l won't help you again.

613
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,511
996.

614
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,679
Yes, tell him that Sister called him.
Tell him to come to me now.

615
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,756
My rule is l get the money first.

616
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,828
- How about having a cigarette first?
- No. l don't take drugs.

617
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,516
l'll have one by myself then.

618
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,669
How about you go for a bath first?

619
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,918
You have a bath first.
l want to watch you having a bath.

620
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,633
Sure, but it'll cost you extra.

621
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,874
ls that enough? Take it.

622
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,034
Are these real?

623
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,349
l don't know. l took the money
from someone who cheated me,

624
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,199
and l've already killed him.

625
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,794
l'm only kidding.
We can always talk about money later.

626
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,197
Your muscles are so toned.
Where do you work out?

627
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,949
You get me so excited.
You look so fine.

628
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,196
- Really?
- l'll just have a bath first.

629
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,756
l'm a bit shy.

630
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,438
Damn you, Ching!
Come and rescue me quickly!

631
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,360
Your muscles are so toned.

632
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,672
l need to think through what l'm doing.

633
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,673
Now that l know Fung San is still alive,
l should complete my mission.

634
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,435
Have l really forgotten my duty to the
emperor because of an ignorant woman?

635
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,196
Fong Sau Ching,
you are infatuated by a ''black widow''.

636
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,594
No.

637
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,236
l must complete my mission.

638
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,789
You son of a bitch! Are you insane?

639
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,709
When my boyfriend comes,
he'll beat you up!

640
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,718
You're insane, you maniac!

641
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,879
ls that nice?

642
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,434
- l don't want to play this game.
- Come on.

643
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,279
- Please don't. l'm a model...
- You hands are so smooth.

644
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,436
l don't want to play this game any more.

645
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,029
lt really hurts!
Let me go! lt really hurts!

646
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,389
Hello, Sister? ls that Sister?

647
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,635
Why don't you speak?

648
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,599
l am not Sister.
Why do you want her?

649
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,712
Why is that voice so familiar?

650
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,952
That voice is familiar.

651
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,072
Ching, where are you?

652
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,834
l'm at a phone box.
Don't raise your voice to me.

653
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:55,318
l have no faith in you any more.
l won't let you use me again. Bye.

654
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,876
Ching, please don't do this now!

655
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,879
Someone wants to kill me!
He broke my hand! l'm in agony!

656
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,675
- You had your hand broken?
- Yes!

657
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,030
Who? Who broke your hand?

658
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,712
He looks like George Lam.

659
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,028
George Lam?
Who's George Lam?

660
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,195
Ching!

661
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,598
Hello? Hello?

662
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,990
George Lam?
Who's George Lam?

663
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,630
George Lam? Who is Lam?

664
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,351
- Who's George Lam?
- George Lam?

665
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,790
This is George Lam. Don't you know him?
Which village are you from?

666
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,638
Peasant!

667
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,998
lt's Fung San!
So George Lam is Fung San!

668
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,917
Fung San!

669
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,552
Sister!

670
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,793
- Hello...
- Stupid dog!

671
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,150
- Fung San!
- Go to the cemetery at Happy Valley now.

672
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,430
Don't do anything rash!

673
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,477
- Where are you?
- At the second gate, with the sculpture.

674
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,591
- Where are you?
- Jump over, like the dog you are!

675
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,393
- Fung San, tell me where you are.
- Go into the crypt.

676
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,598
Stupid dog!

677
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,190
l haven't seen you for over 300 years.
How have you been?

678
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,195
Fung San.

679
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,231
- Ching!
- Sister!

680
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,798
Stop now, or l'll squeeze her head open!

681
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,150
You're using a defenceless woman
to threaten me?

682
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,952
The Jiang Hu people will laugh at you.

683
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,356
Don't you know that term
isn't used any more?

684
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,429
Let me bring you up to date.

685
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,030
Chong Zhen is long dead. The Ming
Dynasty collapsed centuries ago.

686
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,673
What are you still chasing me for?

687
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,069
You put my picture up everywhere,
you son of a bitch!

688
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,990
lt's my duty as the Chief Royal Guard.
l promised the emperor l'd capture you.

689
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,998
l won't give up
if it takes me a million years!

690
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,998
You make me sick, Chief Royal Guard.

691
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,910
Let me teach you a lesson

692
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,953
by raping and killing
your girlfriend in front of you!

693
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,193
Stop there,
or l'll bite into her throat!

694
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,150
Please don't, warrior!
l'm not his girlfriend, just his friend.

695
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,794
- His friend?
- Yes.

696
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,912
So you can relax
and enjoy our performance.

697
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,313
Wait!

698
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,034
This is between me and you.
lt has nothing to do with her.

699
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,434
Let her go first.

700
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,680
Beg me - and beg me sincerely.
Tell me you're scared of me.

701
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,874
Fine.

702
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,750
l beg you.
l beg you sincerely, and l'm scared of you.

703
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,833
Why are you begging me like a coward?

704
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,872
Give me a reason for this.
l may consider it and let her go.

705
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,991
l've lost patience. l'll count to three.

706
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,749
l love her.
l'm in love with her!

707
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,471
My god, that really is sickening to hear.

708
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:57,509
lt's hard to believe you're in love
with a woman of no dignity.

709
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,234
Prove it to me.

710
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,832
Fine. How can l prove it to you?

711
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,637
Drink this.

712
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,591
''The seven poisons''?

713
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,429
Think this through carefully.
You'll lose all your skills if you drink it.

714
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,430
Don't ask me why. l just dislike you
following me everywhere like a ghost.

715
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,395
Ching, don't drink it!
He'll go back on his word anyway!

716
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,149
Ching...

717
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,748
''The wife shouldn't be of concern,

718
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,997
but the hero is too romantic.''

719
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,271
Pity you're not a hero
but a stupid dog!

720
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,030
You give up all the kung fu
you've learnt in your life for a woman,

721
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,072
and break your promise to the emperor.

722
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,710
l despise you even more.

723
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,435
Don't let me see you again
or l'll kill you!

724
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,310
Go.

725
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,273
Big brother! Big brother!

726
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,992
Don't call me big brother.

727
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,113
- l know you'll go back on your word.
- Have l ever not?

728
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,878
So why did you drink it?

729
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,117
l had no chance if l didn't drink it,

730
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,869
and l may have a small one if l did.

731
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,710
l drank it because of the small chance...

732
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,557
Fung San...

733
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,432
we've been brothers for many years.

734
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,199
You know my personality well.

735
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,108
l'd rather die than accept an insult.

736
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,909
So far in my life,
apart from my parents...

737
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,390
the emperor and our master...

738
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,752
l've never bowed down to anyone else.

739
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,076
l bow down to you now.
l beg you, let her go!

740
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:39,356
You act like a piece of shit.
You've spoilt my interest in your girl.

741
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,758
You lowlife, don't let me
ever set eyes on you again...

742
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,711
or l'll kill you!

743
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,758
Ching, are you all right?

744
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,309
Ching...

745
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,477
Sister, use this to bind your hand first.

746
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,997
Sister, lead a better life from now on.

747
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,714
There's something l have to do.
l must go now.

748
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,354
Ching, don't go. Ching!

749
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,789
Ching, what are you doing?

750
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,479
Ching, where are you going?

751
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,228
Ching, come back here!

752
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,156
Hey, my horse!
Someone's stealing my horse!

753
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:56,193
Medicine is very advanced now! There's
still hope if you go to the hospital at once!

754
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,275
Ching!

755
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,518
Ching!

756
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,758
You stupid dog, using gold needles
to block the pulses!

757
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,472
lf you force yourself to fight me,

758
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,989
the poison will spread
to your heart in four hours

759
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,917
and you'll bleed
from seven holes until you die!

760
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,712
Why are you doing this?

761
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,792
Blocking the pulses with gold needles,
l can keep my powers for an hour -

762
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,593
long enough for me to kill you!

763
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,154
Come and die then!

764
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,318
Damn it.

765
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,717
Come on, come on! Run faster
and pass them! Pass them all!

766
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,032
Come on, stupid dog!

767
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,836
Come on, come on...

768
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,559
Fung San, l thought you knew me better.

769
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,195
To keep my promise to the emperor
and protect my beloved,

770
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,709
l wouldn't hesitate
to sacrifice my own life.

771
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,673
Of course -
you're so noble, you stupid dog!

772
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,949
Damn! Why is a car up there?

773
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,157
lt's stuck... l don't want to know!

774
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,471
l want you to die with me!

775
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,919
You die first!

776
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,430
Stupid dog,
you want to take me to the emperor?

777
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,592
Shit...

778
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,830
Where's the stupid dog?

779
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,356
Where is he?

780
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,831
Come and catch me, stupid dog!

781
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,071
Faster! Faster!

782
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,674
Hurry!

783
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,195
Ching!

784
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,072
Stop holding me! Ching!

785
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,270
Rescue him! Quickly!

786
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,709
The poison is working and l'm dying.
Goodbye, Sister.

787
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,918
Ching, the doctors in Hong Kong
are excellent! They can save you!

788
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,273
Miss, l'll ask you for the eighth time -
and give me a straight answer.

789
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,753
Who is he to you?

790
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,235
l'll tell you the same thing
if you ask a thousand times.

791
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,794
He's my boyfriend,
Chief Royal Guard from the Ming Dynasty.

792
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,196
- How dare you try to wind me up?
- You dare to hit me? l'll report you!

793
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,710
l'll lick your toes clean if you can prove
he's from the Ming Dynasty!

794
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,437
Doctor, is he saved from the poison?

795
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:43,189
lt was carboxyl acid, but the sea water
diluted it and we managed to save him.

796
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,880
l always say
Hong Kong doctors are the best.

797
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,629
But something was very strange.
l conducted a cell analysis on him

798
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,958
and it suggested he's over 300 years old -
which means he's from the Ming Dynasty.

799
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,674
That machine really is no good.

800
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,715
Aren't you going to lick my toes clean?

801
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,319
Hey, why are you hitting her?

802
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,035
Miss, do you want to report him?
l can be your witness.

803
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,876
l just want to see Fong Sau Ching.

804
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,833
He's still in a coma. The earliest
you can see him is tomorrow afternoon.

805
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,077
You also have to get clearance
from the police.

806
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,909
ln theory, you're not authorised.
But the police are compassionate.

807
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,759
You're authorised this time.

808
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,432
Sir, what did he say?

809
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,710
Your boyfriend doesn't want to see you.
Leave now.

810
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,559
- You're lying!
- Why should l?

811
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,429
Hey!

812
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,476
That really hurts! Let me go!

813
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,996
OK, l'll authorise you one more time.

814
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,156
But only for a moment.

815
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,309
Ching! Ching!

816
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,313
Ching?

817
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,153
Ching, did you ask the police
to say you won't see me?

818
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,955
Stop pretending you're asleep.
l know you're just pretending.

819
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,310
l don't want to see you. Leave now.

820
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,110
Have you gone mad
from taking ''The seven poisons''?

821
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,673
l am Sister!

822
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,237
You used me.
You've been lying to me all this time.

823
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,037
You pretend to be a model,
but you're really a hooker.

824
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,916
ln other words, a prostitute.

825
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,839
A woman like you would have been
beheaded in the Ming Dynasty.

826
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,671
Beheaded, my arse!

827
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,238
l admit l was wrong.
l apologise. l know it was my fault.

828
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,429
Won't you accept my apology?

829
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,879
How about if l admit
that you're my boyfriend from now on?

830
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,274
l'll be nicer to you.

831
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,354
But l won't admit that you're my girlfriend.

832
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,075
So why did you say you love me?

833
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,752
lf l didn't love you,
would l be willing to die for you?

834
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,713
But to die for love is a different matter.

835
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,276
l could never be with
a woman as bad as you are.

836
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,515
l'm a man of principle.

837
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,113
Can you stop this?
Stop being so mean to me.

838
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,915
l'm already begging you.
What more do you want?

839
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,871
l can change!

840
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:31,518
One's personality is determined at birth.
People don't change.

841
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,109
l'm still acting as Chief Royal Guard
300 years later.

842
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,511
Fung San is still the same psychopath
who rapes and murders women.

843
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,076
l can't suppress my feelings
for an evil woman.

844
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,231
But l can force myself
not to see her again.

845
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,078
Go now.

846
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,953
l'm very tired and l need some rest.

847
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,997
Fine! Just pretend l never met you!
l can't believe you're so heartless!

848
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,312
Get lost!

849
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,558
- lt's you, miss.
- Sorry, sorry...

850
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,357
- Does he know l made this for him?
- No. l told him what you asked me to say.

851
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:34,429
l told him that he looked like my dead son,
so l make soup for him every day.

852
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,393
- Please take it.
- l shouldn't, really.

853
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,158
- Take it.
- Thank you.

854
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,794
See you tomorrow. Thank you. Bye.

855
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,917
You've dropped everything!
Let me help you.

856
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,151
You broke her things!

857
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,113
- Forget it.
- Are you blind?

858
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,910
Sorry.

859
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,030
- What is it?
- l just wanted to give you back the flask.

860
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,835
- l'm not sure if it's broken or not.
- lt doesn't matter.

861
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,552
Please take it. Take it.

862
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,955
- Why are you giving me so much money?
- Take it.

863
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,150
- Do one thing for me, please.
- What is it?

864
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,758
Thank you, sir.

865
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,316
He'll be back immediately
after the urine test.

866
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,357
Don't say a thing. Fung San is here.

867
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,633
Why are you covering your head?

868
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,831
Damn it! Reverse that bad luck.

869
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,720
is being exhibited for the first time
around the world.

870
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,992
lt will be exhibited in Hong Kong
in three months.

871
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:46,636
The Wheel of Life and Death
is more than 500 years old.

872
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,236
Brother San, there are six boxes
and you've counted them.

873
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,716
That's $488,000 altogether.
Let's see the money.

874
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,878
You're buying a lot of guns.
Are you starting a war?

875
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,754
lf you're planning a robbery, count us in.

876
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,916
Damn you.

877
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,630
l've thought it through.
l'll always be discriminated against here.

878
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,188
lt's not my territory. l can't compete
with Hong Kong people.

879
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,990
My expertise in martial arts
doesn't help me here.

880
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,715
l'll take the guns
back to the Ming Dynasty,

881
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,831
destroy the palace,

882
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:51,589
kill the useless emperor
and crown myself in his place!

883
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,871
Little brothers,
history must be rewritten.

884
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,915
Brother San, that's too cryptic.
l don't understand.

885
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,554
lt's better that you don't.

886
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,795
lt won't do you any good.

887
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,629
Any more national treasures arrived?
Anything interesting?

888
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,594
Yes. There are 1 50 items.
Let me show you.

889
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,157
A sword, hundreds of years old,
with no rust at all.

890
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,998
The Dragon Spring Sword?

891
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,509
Someone's willing to pay $180,000 for it.

892
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,316
Damn. lt really is
Fong Sau Ching's Dragon Spring Sword.

893
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,477
My sword was broken by this.

894
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,070
This sword is worth 10 million dollars.
l'll have it!

895
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,718
OK. Give me one million tomorrow
and l'll sell it to you.

896
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,312
You don't deserve the sword.
You don't even know how to use it.

897
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,795
Let me show you
how much it's worth.

898
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,558
This precious sword really doesn't stain.

899
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,675
What a sword!

900
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,958
l'll rule the Ming Dynasty! l'll rule it!

901
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,909
''The Wheel of Life and Death will be
exhibited in Hong Kong in two months.''

902
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,069
Life is full of coincidences.

903
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,670
The Wheel will be exhibited in Hong Kong.

904
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,234
ls this really ordained in heaven?

905
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,879
ln two months and 1 7 days at midnight...

906
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,033
it will be the date
to achieve Buddhist enlightenment

907
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,197
and the Wheel will hold supreme power.

908
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,232
Fung San will surely act on that day,
and l shall complete my mission then.

909
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,150
Are you confident you'll beat him?

910
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,395
No.

911
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,479
Then why do you want to provoke him?
Can you stop being so stubborn?

912
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,309
l can't. l promised the emperor
l'd bring Fung San back for punishment.

913
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:13,035
l'll be guilty of disrespect to the emperor
if l don't keep my promise.

914
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,357
lf l can't beat him, l'll die with him.

915
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,675
lf l'm fortunate enough to beat him,

916
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,553
l'll take him back to the Ming Dynasty
through the Wheel.

917
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,196
So you're leaving...
and you won't come back again?

918
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,669
l don't belong here anyway.

919
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,431
And what about me?

920
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,874
- You'd better leave now.
- Have you gone insane?

921
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,156
Didn't you say you love me?

922
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,078
Love is a different matter.
l must train hard for the next two months.

923
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,237
And l must also make a sword
to fight Fung San with.

924
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,352
How can l concentrate
if you're staying here?

925
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,869
lt's better to cut things short.

926
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,991
As the singer Mui said,

927
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,272
''Love is not meant to be forever.
Cherish it when you find it.''

928
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:07,634
l don't care. l won't leave.

929
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,279
Fine. Then prove that you can change.

930
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,038
- How can l prove it?
- That's up to you.

931
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,111
We'll see.

932
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,595
Eat more - you never know
if you'll get struck by lightning.

933
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,517
And l still outrank you.

934
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,674
Hey.

935
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,756
Delicious?

936
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,393
Your Majesty,
your servant has made a strong sword.

937
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,114
l promise you l'll defeat Fung San.

938
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,994
Please give me strength from heaven
so that l can complete my mission.

939
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,670
Ching, this bulletproof jacket
is for you.

940
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,716
This sword belongs to you.

941
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,148
''Sister's Sword''?
So it is mine?

942
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,316
How cool is that?!

943
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,470
There's something else.
Just wait a minute.

944
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,712
Ching?

945
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,551
Ching!

946
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,118
What are you doing?
The exhibition hall is closed.

947
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,478
''Fung San, you degenerate,

948
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,717
fight me on the roof
if you want the black jade Buddha.''

949
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,676
Stupid dog.

950
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,318
Fung San!

951
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,272
You're riddled with sin
and you've committed many crimes.

952
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,554
Come back to the Ming Dynasty with me.
l'll beg the emperor to spare you.

953
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,111
l'll blow you to bits!

954
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,752
Ching!

955
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,349
Ching!

956
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,193
Now pay the money back, bitch.

957
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,908
Don't call yourself a sister
if you can't pay it back.

958
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:15,919
l haven't been a sister for a long time.
l work in a shop now.

959
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,710
l don't have the money to pay you back.

960
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:22,674
All l've got is $200. Do you want it?
l'll give it to you.

961
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,075
Aren't you afraid of the acid?

962
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,551
lt's just water.

963
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:48,835
Ching!

964
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,793
You're still alive? ls this real?

965
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,309
This is great!

966
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:59,715
This is sexual harassment!

967
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,319
The End
