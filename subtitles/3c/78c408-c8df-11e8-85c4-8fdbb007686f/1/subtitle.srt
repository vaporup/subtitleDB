1
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,154
Let's talk business.

2
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,800
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

3
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,066
You know Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,440
He just wants
a little conversation.

5
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,275
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

6
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,247
Maybe he'll listen to you.

7
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,308
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

8
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,346
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

9
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,174
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Jones.

10
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,281
Remember, neatness counts.

11
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,792
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,693
One hour.

13
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,115
What?

14
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:42,348
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,723
What's he look like?

16
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,355
Serious.

17
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,456
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

18
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,637
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

19
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,375
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

20
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,713
We got company.

21
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,596
Come on.

22
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,773
Stop, man!

23
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,287
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

24
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,496
- Sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

25
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,665
It's cool. Take a nap.

26
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,326
Oh, my God.

27
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,556
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

28
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,201
Check the terrace!

29
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,439
<i>- 911 emergency.
- I need help.</i>

30
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,912
<i>- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Just stay on the line.</i>

31
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,609
<i>I'll just be off a moment.</i>

32
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,118
<i>I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.</i>

33
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,604
<i>Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?</i>

34
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,643
I'll call you back.

35
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,978
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

36
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,818
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

37
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,627
Dial this number.

38
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,468
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

39
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,544
Bye.

40
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,354
<i>- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?</i>

41
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:47,017
<i>- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean, no.</i>

42
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,027
Just for today.

43
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,859
<i>So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...</i>

44
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,695
<i>and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.</i>

45
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,361
Yeah. Right.

46
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,200
<i>Let me speak
to our mutual friend.</i>

47
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,269
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,711
<i>Make sure he understands,
and let him go.</i>

49
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,064
Do you understand?

50
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,760
- So say it.
- I understand.

51
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,236
Good.

52
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,764
Jesus.

53
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,268
Two milk as usual?

54
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,909
Why did you hide the cigarette?

55
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,779
This building's full of rats.

56
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,153
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

57
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,567
What happened?

58
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,196
I fell off my bike.

59
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,686
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

60
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,633
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know...

61
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,968
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

62
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,406
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

63
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,501
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

64
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,411
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

65
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,574
- I don't know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me.

66
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,243
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

67
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,914
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

68
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,516
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

69
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,858
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

70
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,421
- That's all I know.
- I'm trying to help you out here...

71
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,162
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

72
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,602
I gotta disturb him.

73
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:57,938
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

74
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,274
I'm telling you the truth.

75
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,612
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

76
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,514
It's scary.

77
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,679
It's almost like a sixth sense.

78
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,623
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

79
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,294
I'm telling you the truth.

80
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,304
All right.

81
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,636
Stan.

82
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,676
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

83
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,052
Of course he didn't.

84
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,200
Just do me a favor.

85
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,968
Find out who did by tomorrow.

86
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,872
Noon.

87
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,049
Malky, wait.

88
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,150
I didn't cut your shit.

89
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,661
Find out yourself!

90
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,068
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

91
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,798
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

92
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,396
clean up the goddamn house!

93
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,567
And stop smoking cigarettes!

94
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,480
<i>One!</i>

95
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,980
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

96
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,116
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

97
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,288
<i>- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.</i>

98
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,093
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

99
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,566
<i>Ready for the legs.
And down.</i>

100
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,306
Sorry, sweetheart.

101
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,213
<i>Squeeze. Release.</i>

102
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,548
Good morning.

103
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,679
Hi, honey.

104
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,190
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

105
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,492
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

106
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,498
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

107
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,557
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

108
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,899
<i>Two and up.</i>

109
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,404
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

110
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,067
move a little ass
and go get some food?

111
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,636
<i>- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.</i>

112
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,082
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

113
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,591
You always come up
with somethin', right?

114
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,923
I think I went too far this time.

115
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,430
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

116
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,932
How about workin'
at home today?

117
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,762
<i>Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.</i>

118
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,435
<i>- One...
- Now it's my turn!</i>

119
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,070
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

120
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,580
- Daddy, she's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

121
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,914
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

122
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,254
Fuckin' bitch.

123
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:49,124
<i>- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

124
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,255
<i>When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles...</i>

125
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,324
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

126
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,309
<i>- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...</i>

127
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,871
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.</i>

128
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,644
<i>Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

129
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,613
This is she.

130
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,988
<i>Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...</i>

131
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,323
<i>he told us she had "problems."</i>

132
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,989
<i>As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...</i>

133
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,157
<i>into healthy,
productive young women.</i>

134
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,168
<i>But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.</i>

135
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,501
<i>Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

136
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,508
<i>I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...</i>

137
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,672
<i>but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...</i>

138
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,683
<i>you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...</i>

139
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,686
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

140
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,279
She's dead.

141
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,212
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

142
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,546
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

143
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,051
Hurry up!

144
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,661
<i>Why am I feeling</i>

145
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,669
<i>When things could look black</i>

146
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,037
<i>That nothing
could possibly go wrong</i>

147
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:49,069
<i>This has been
a most unusual day</i>

148
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,343
<i>Love has made me see things</i>

149
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:59,254
<i>In a different way</i>

150
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,084
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

151
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,460
Always like this.

152
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,634
Keep it.

153
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,545
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

154
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,550
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

155
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,021
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

156
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,624
It reminds me of Beethoven.

157
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,197
Can you hear it?

158
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,139
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

159
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,403
you can hear it growin'.

160
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,241
You can hear the insects.

161
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,877
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

162
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,923
I'm gonna play you some.

163
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,327
Daddy!

164
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,741
You better stay here.

165
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,452
We said noon.

166
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,924
I've got one minute past.

167
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,989
You don't like Beethoven.

168
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,431
You don't know
what you're missing.

169
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,995
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

170
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,666
So powerful.

171
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,906
But after his openings,
to be honest...

172
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,075
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

173
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,379
That's why I stopped!

174
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,024
Toss the apartment.

175
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,481
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

176
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,544
I love Mozart!

177
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,128
He was Austrian, you know.

178
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,962
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

179
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,059
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

180
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,731
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

181
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,571
<i>Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.</i>

182
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,511
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

183
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,140
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

184
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,831
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

185
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,242
Wow.

186
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,760
Oh! Fuck!

187
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,165
He's dead.

188
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:28,501
Jesus. Look what you did.

189
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,507
Stan, you all right?

190
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,863
What are you doin'?

191
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:57,027
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

192
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

193
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,038
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

194
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,632
I'm calm.

195
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,939
Stay there, all right?

196
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,749
Benny!

197
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,581
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

198
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,254
Take it easy, all right?

199
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,126
Come on.

200
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,902
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

201
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,461
Benny, we're comin' out!

202
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,337
Benny, don't fire!

203
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,206
Get in there!

204
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,678
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!

205
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,376
You wear somethin' new and...
Got a light?

206
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,419
Take it easy.

207
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,588
What's happening out there?

208
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,521
It's all right, ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

209
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,788
Leave that poor family alone.

210
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,490
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

211
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,795
Why don't you
leave them alone?

212
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,296
He said go back inside.

213
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,840
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

214
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,833
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

215
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:41,565
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

216
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,573
Did you really
have to do that?

217
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,086
Please open the door.

218
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,709
Benny,
there are three kids here.

219
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,118
I think Stan killed this girl.

220
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,748
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

221
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,349
The third one's missing.
Find her.

222
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,265
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

223
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,934
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

224
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:55,768
<i>- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!</i>

225
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,316
Shit.

226
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,646
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

227
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,818
- They found it.
- I know.

228
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,827
There it is.

229
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,830
There's cops outside.
We better go.

230
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,334
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

231
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,871
What do I say?

232
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,847
Tell them...

233
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,185
we were doing our job.

234
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,826
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

235
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,968
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

236
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,072
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

237
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,550
Your mother, she...

238
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,382
She's not my mother.

239
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:21,983
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

240
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,961
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

241
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,395
Not a good half at that.

242
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,709
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

243
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,746
They killed my brother.

244
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,046
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

245
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,052
He never used to cry.

246
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,147
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

247
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:58,127
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

248
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:02,599
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

249
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,897
But they smell like shit.

250
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,271
Not true.

251
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,935
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

252
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,910
that's very clean...

253
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:19,109
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

254
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,618
Yes, I do.

255
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,850
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

256
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,359
Don't move.
I'll get him.

257
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,263
Piggy, where are you?

258
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,800
There you are.

259
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,810
Hi, Mathilda.

260
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,540
Hi, piggy.

261
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,252
How are you today?

262
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,884
I've seen better days.

263
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,836
- What's your name?
- Leon.

264
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,301
Cute name.

265
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,380
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

266
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,966
I'm gonna get some more milk.

267
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,087
Holy shit.

268
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:14,063
Don't touch that, please.

269
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,531
What do you do for a living?

270
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,069
Cleaner.

271
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,405
You're a hit man?

272
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,544
Cool.

273
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:44,584
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

274
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,722
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

275
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,596
who killed my brother?

276
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,434
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

277
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,601
How about I work for you...

278
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,168
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

279
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,340
What do you think?

280
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,441
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

281
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,748
I'll even wash your clothes.

282
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,356
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

283
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:27,702
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

284
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,606
You've had a rough day today.

285
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,036
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

286
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,623
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

287
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,725
and it's not always like that.

288
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,667
You know?

289
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,811
Good night.

290
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,453
You sleep well?

291
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,857
Good.

292
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,361
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

293
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,092
Not my problem.

294
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,914
Read it.

295
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,813
You don't know how to read.

296
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,882
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

297
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,020
so I'm a little behind.

298
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,563
What's it say?

299
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,692
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

300
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,229
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

301
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:21,074
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

302
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,740
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

303
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,807
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

304
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,083
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

305
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,820
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

306
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,761
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

307
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,095
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

308
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,603
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

309
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,434
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

310
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,340
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

311
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,813
But you did open it. So...

312
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,454
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

313
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,787
I don't wanna die tonight.

314
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,795
You're just a little girl.

315
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,798
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

316
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,299
I'm sorry.

317
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,987
How's that?

318
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,016
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

319
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,525
You got that?

320
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,197
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

321
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,199
There is rules.

322
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,032
And stop saying "okay"
all the time!

323
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,699
Good.

324
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,187
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

325
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,221
Mister, I have to use it...

326
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:58,394
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

327
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,699
and I have to practice.

328
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,639
Okay, but not after 10:00.

329
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,767
- I promise.
- All right.

330
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,748
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

331
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,911
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

332
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,476
Fill those out, please.

333
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,653
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

334
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,395
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

335
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,733
Fourth floor!

336
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,397
Thanks, mister!

337
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,567
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

338
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,403
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

339
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,081
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

340
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,955
Of course.

341
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,145
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

342
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,213
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

343
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,835
There. Finished.

344
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,368
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

345
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,206
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

346
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,517
No. You just look a little young.

347
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,950
Thanks.

348
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,726
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

349
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,066
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

350
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,672
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

351
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:22,803
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

352
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,010
What do you think?
Just the theory.

353
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,348
I need this, Leon.

354
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,181
I need time
to get my head together.

355
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,021
Yeah, and I need...

356
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,289
a drink.

357
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,359
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

358
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,897
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

359
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,229
I thought my hearin' was goin'.

360
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:22,204
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

361
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,035
I like to stay in shape.

362
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:28,567
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

363
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,342
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

364
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,976
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

365
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,380
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

366
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,769
Check it.

367
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,001
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

368
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,101
One thing's got nothin' to do
with the other. Remember that.

369
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,446
I will.

370
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,465
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

371
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:26,366
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

372
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,666
The closer you get
to being a pro...

373
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,936
the closer you can get
to the client.

374
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,536
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

375
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,651
Position.

376
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,644
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

377
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,512
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

378
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:17,314
And always dress down.

379
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,515
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

380
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:28,023
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

381
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,191
Who should I hit?

382
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,859
Whoever.

383
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,039
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

384
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,875
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

385
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,405
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

386
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,396
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

387
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,071
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

388
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
Keep calm.

389
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,878
Don't take your eyes off him.

390
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,751
Breathe easy.

391
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,118
Watch his movement.

392
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,095
Pretend you're running with him.

393
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,262
Try to feel his next movement.

394
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,171
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

395
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,217
Now.

396
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,116
Oh, my God!

397
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,884
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

398
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,723
One shot. Not bad, huh?

399
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,229
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

400
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,960
Can we try
with real bullets now?

401
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,002
Not today.
Let's pack up.

402
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,812
Like that.

403
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,522
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

404
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,236
"It seemed...

405
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,572
to Socrates..."

406
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,315
I'll do it.

407
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,821
Leon, all we do is work.

408
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,027
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

409
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,765
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

410
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,639
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

411
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,615
<i>Like a virgin</i>

412
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,792
<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

413
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,328
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

414
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:17,282
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

415
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:21,654
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

416
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,159
I don't know.

417
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,800
Moustache.

418
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,335
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

419
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,006
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

420
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,641
<i>- What a beaut...
- Gene Kelly?</i>

421
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,685
Good.

422
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,587
Your turn now.

423
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,858
Okay, pilgrim.

424
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,734
Clint Eastwood?

425
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:17,706
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

426
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,774
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

427
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,217
Leon, really brilliant.

428
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,557
Amazing.

429
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:47,739
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

430
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,406
Always happy.
No questions.

431
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,076
It's like me, you see.

432
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,313
No roots.

433
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:02,154
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

434
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,891
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

435
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,567
You're right.

436
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,446
Wait!

437
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,859
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

438
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,308
It's been a long time, Leon.

439
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,185
I missed you.

440
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:08,088
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

441
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:12,151
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

442
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,628
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

443
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,164
Tony...

444
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,698
all the money I make,
that you keep for me...

445
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,764
You need some money?

446
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,400
Just curious.

447
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,411
I've been working
a long time...

448
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:33,176
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

449
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:41,087
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

450
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,523
You met a woman.

451
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,195
You gotta be careful
with women.

452
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,240
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

453
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,711
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fuckin' ears...

454
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,714
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

455
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:10,685
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

456
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,587
You know, about my money...

457
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,061
Maybe I could give...

458
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,222
a little...

459
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,064
to someone.

460
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,229
You know, to help out.

461
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,801
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

462
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:40,248
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

463
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,648
No one knocks off old Tony.

464
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,244
Besides, with a bank...

465
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,586
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

466
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:53,755
But old Tony, nothin' to read,
nothin' to write. It's all in his head.

467
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,397
I know how to read now.

468
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,596
That's good, Leon.

469
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,099
Your money's here.

470
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,871
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

471
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:13,006
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

472
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,542
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

473
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,522
All right.
Now let's talk business.

474
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,118
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

475
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:29,290
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

476
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,989
Listen, Mathilda,
you better be careful.

477
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,652
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

478
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,659
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

479
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,495
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

480
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,499
I want you to stop cursing.

481
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,835
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

482
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,001
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

483
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,979
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

484
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,355
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

485
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:40,198
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

486
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,814
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

487
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,689
It's the first time for me,
you know.

488
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,127
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

489
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:10,063
'Cause I feel it.

490
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,725
Where?

491
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,272
In my stomach.

492
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,634
It's all warm.

493
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:28,946
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

494
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:37,121
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

495
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,661
I don't think
it means anything.

496
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:43,597
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

497
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,002
How's the practicing going?

498
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:05,073
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

499
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,082
I understand.

500
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,084
But you're doing all right.

501
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,143
I haven't received
any complaints.

502
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,486
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

503
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,150
That's very smart.

504
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,857
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

505
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,059
What does your father do?

506
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,929
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

507
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,567
Except he's not really my father.

508
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,877
He's my lover.

509
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:48,287
Think I'll go for a walk.

510
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,600
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

511
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,770
- Where you goin'?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

512
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,711
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

513
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,740
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

514
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:19,914
You got plans?

515
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,193
Meet you here?

516
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,764
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

517
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,776
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

518
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,678
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

519
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,943
Bang, we shot him.

520
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,189
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

521
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,748
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

522
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,760
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

523
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,853
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

524
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,989
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

525
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,662
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

526
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,172
Cooperation.

527
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,512
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

528
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:30,211
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

529
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,390
Kids should be at school.

530
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,227
Come on, that's my ball!

531
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:51,797
Give that back.
Where you goin'?

532
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:55,310
Damn! Where you goin', man?
That's my ball!

533
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,985
Follow the blue car.

534
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,216
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

535
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,847
No, drive slowly.

536
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,722
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

537
01:07:44,753 --> 01:07:48,189
<i>I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.</i>

538
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:54,626
<i>Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!</i>

539
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,728
<i>- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...</i>

540
01:08:01,803 --> 01:08:04,931
<i>our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.</i>

541
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:06,940
<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

542
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:14,581
It's for you.
A present.

543
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:20,310
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

544
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,023
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

545
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:31,031
Mr. McGuffin?

546
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:36,028
Can I have a word with you?

547
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,548
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

548
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:02,613
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

549
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:05,683
in the D.E.A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.

550
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:09,120
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

551
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,023
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

552
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,931
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

553
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,630
I never lend out my gear.

554
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:18,570
But...

555
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,608
you still have your gun.
Use it.

556
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:24,111
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

557
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,670
Why are you so mean to me?

558
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:30,741
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

559
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:34,516
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

560
01:10:35,156 --> 01:10:38,023
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

561
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,354
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

562
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:44,421
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

563
01:10:44,499 --> 01:10:46,490
you expect me to forget?

564
01:10:46,568 --> 01:10:48,695
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

565
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,601
Blow their fucking heads off.

566
01:10:50,672 --> 01:10:53,641
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

567
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,736
Your life is changed forever.

568
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:04,217
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

569
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:06,982
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

570
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:09,981
I want love...

571
01:11:10,325 --> 01:11:12,225
or death.

572
01:11:13,161 --> 01:11:14,822
That's it.

573
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,726
I want death.

574
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:22,600
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

575
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:28,569
There's this really great game, Leon.

576
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:32,135
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

577
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,852
The kind of game you love.

578
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,030
If I win...

579
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:56,970
you keep me with you...
for life.

580
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,768
And if you lose?

581
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:04,278
Go shopping alone, like before.

582
01:12:06,348 --> 01:12:08,839
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

583
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:13,285
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

584
01:12:13,355 --> 01:12:14,720
So what?

585
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,849
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

586
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:22,153
Nothing.

587
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,230
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

588
01:12:29,537 --> 01:12:32,870
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

589
01:12:35,944 --> 01:12:37,935
Because if there is...

590
01:12:38,012 --> 01:12:41,277
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

591
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:46,745
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

592
01:12:56,631 --> 01:12:58,622
I love you, Leon.

593
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,116
I win.

594
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:37,003
I took a hit.

595
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:40,173
I need a hand now.

596
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:44,337
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

597
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:46,573
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

598
01:13:46,648 --> 01:13:49,913
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

599
01:13:49,984 --> 01:13:51,918
She's 18.

600
01:13:51,986 --> 01:13:53,920
Really?

601
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,490
How about something to drink, Tony?

602
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:03,053
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

603
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,534
Nice tattoo.

604
01:14:12,173 --> 01:14:15,609
Manolo, make that two.

605
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:37,927
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

606
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,958
First you find out
where the chain is.

607
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:44,402
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

608
01:14:44,472 --> 01:14:47,202
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

609
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:50,007
Whatever you want.

610
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:53,980
- Yes?
- Hi.

611
01:14:54,048 --> 01:14:55,982
It's Susan.

612
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,281
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

613
01:14:59,354 --> 01:15:01,754
I don't know any Susan.

614
01:15:01,823 --> 01:15:05,884
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

615
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,554
The light's out.

616
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,564
It's all dark out here.

617
01:15:13,835 --> 01:15:18,329
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

618
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:25,741
What the fuck are you doing?

619
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,316
Open up.

620
01:15:34,088 --> 01:15:37,148
<i>If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?</i>

621
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,960
Here's okay.
Let it go.

622
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,397
I said, "Let it go."

623
01:16:19,467 --> 01:16:21,867
Move. Move over.

624
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:24,894
Easy. Easy.

625
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:27,908
Easy. Careful.
You want me...

626
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:32,207
Go ahead. Your turn.

627
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,588
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

628
01:16:41,656 --> 01:16:44,216
Sir?

629
01:16:47,295 --> 01:16:49,354
Sir, it's not my dope.

630
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,398
Sir, look I...

631
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:53,400
A little left, please.

632
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,428
Before... Ple...

633
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:04,010
Now, the security shot.

634
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:12,013
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

635
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,452
Aim for the heart and lungs.

636
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:16,547
There. Right there.
You see?

637
01:17:16,624 --> 01:17:18,558
The first shot takes him
out of order.

638
01:17:18,626 --> 01:17:21,527
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

639
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:23,086
Never in the face.

640
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:26,395
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

641
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:30,130
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

642
01:17:30,204 --> 01:17:32,900
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

643
01:17:32,974 --> 01:17:36,432
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

644
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:38,809
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

645
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,405
What are you fuckin...

646
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:47,114
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

647
01:17:47,188 --> 01:17:49,452
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

648
01:17:49,524 --> 01:17:52,425
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

649
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:55,223
A damp, black cloth is the best.

650
01:17:58,566 --> 01:18:00,500
What you doing?

651
01:18:00,568 --> 01:18:03,799
We said no women, no kids.

652
01:18:03,871 --> 01:18:07,568
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

653
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,455
Now it's clean.

654
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:29,325
Let's get out of here.

655
01:18:42,777 --> 01:18:44,711
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

656
01:18:44,779 --> 01:18:48,943
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

657
01:18:51,052 --> 01:18:56,388
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

658
01:18:56,457 --> 01:19:00,291
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

659
01:19:03,965 --> 01:19:05,899
Yes.

660
01:19:06,968 --> 01:19:08,697
What you doing?

661
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,238
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

662
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:14,138
Come on. Just a kiss.

663
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,541
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

664
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,415
Go sit down.

665
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,524
Enjoy.

666
01:19:37,098 --> 01:19:39,999
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

667
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:45,095
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

668
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:48,973
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

669
01:19:50,278 --> 01:19:54,305
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

670
01:19:54,382 --> 01:19:56,942
Nineteen.

671
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:58,952
Beat you.

672
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:07,854
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

673
01:21:54,568 --> 01:21:58,402
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

674
01:22:02,076 --> 01:22:05,068
- Yes?
- Hi.

675
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:07,480
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

676
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:11,314
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

677
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,319
Just a second.

678
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,766
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

679
01:22:28,836 --> 01:22:31,600
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

680
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:39,511
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

681
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:43,710
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

682
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:46,548
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

683
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,952
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

684
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:52,557
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

685
01:22:52,626 --> 01:22:55,094
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

686
01:22:55,162 --> 01:22:57,096
Show it to me, motherfucker.

687
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:09,042
That's the ring trick.

688
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:26,986
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

689
01:23:38,105 --> 01:23:41,404
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

690
01:23:44,278 --> 01:23:47,270
Nicer than people, eh?

691
01:23:47,348 --> 01:23:49,282
I told you that.

692
01:23:51,519 --> 01:23:53,453
You got a problem?

693
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,291
Get the chair. Sit down.

694
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:07,456
I was thinking.

695
01:24:10,137 --> 01:24:13,800
If something happens
to me someday...

696
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:17,708
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

697
01:24:17,778 --> 01:24:20,747
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

698
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:24,945
Tony, I thought about my money.

699
01:24:28,155 --> 01:24:33,718
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

700
01:24:38,165 --> 01:24:43,068
Her name is Mathilda.

701
01:24:43,137 --> 01:24:46,436
If anything happens to me...

702
01:24:46,507 --> 01:24:50,705
I'd like you...

703
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,647
to give her...

704
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,978
my money.

705
01:25:01,288 --> 01:25:03,916
You can count on me, Leon.

706
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:06,425
Thank you, Tony.

707
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,661
I won't be long.

708
01:25:13,134 --> 01:25:16,103
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

709
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:20,207
This one is too big.

710
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:24,308
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

711
01:25:26,213 --> 01:25:28,545
Mathilda, since I met you...

712
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:30,743
everything's been different.

713
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:35,355
So I just need some time alone.

714
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,116
You need some time
to grow up a little.

715
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:42,890
I finished growing up, Leon.

716
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:44,794
I just get older.

717
01:25:44,865 --> 01:25:48,323
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

718
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,095
I need time to grow up.

719
01:26:07,188 --> 01:26:09,179
Shit.

720
01:27:24,265 --> 01:27:26,665
Come on! Hustle!

721
01:27:28,736 --> 01:27:30,567
- Good shot.
- Come on.

722
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:36,469
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

723
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,470
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

724
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:42,014
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

725
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:45,051
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

726
01:27:45,185 --> 01:27:47,244
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

727
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:50,881
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

728
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:52,619
a month.

729
01:27:54,928 --> 01:27:56,759
Got change?

730
01:27:58,265 --> 01:28:00,563
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

731
01:28:00,634 --> 01:28:02,864
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

732
01:28:02,936 --> 01:28:04,426
Okay, a year.

733
01:28:05,272 --> 01:28:08,366
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

734
01:28:11,545 --> 01:28:14,036
So go play somewhere else.

735
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:19,783
I need to think.

736
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:19,907
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

737
01:29:29,923 --> 01:29:31,356
Food.

738
01:29:34,862 --> 01:29:39,595
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

739
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,327
Sign here.

740
01:29:41,402 --> 01:29:42,926
Come here.

741
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:49,667
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

742
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:51,677
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

743
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:13,725
Special delivery?

744
01:31:13,794 --> 01:31:15,728
Let me guess.

745
01:31:17,898 --> 01:31:19,365
Chinese?

746
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,533
Thai, maybe?

747
01:31:27,207 --> 01:31:30,040
I've got it.

748
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,340
Italian food.

749
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,896
What's your name, angel?

750
01:32:20,928 --> 01:32:24,091
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

751
01:32:29,536 --> 01:32:30,969
Good.

752
01:32:33,607 --> 01:32:38,670
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

753
01:32:38,745 --> 01:32:41,646
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

754
01:32:41,715 --> 01:32:46,345
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

755
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:50,723
So this is something...

756
01:32:52,626 --> 01:32:55,060
personal, is it?

757
01:32:59,066 --> 01:33:03,162
What filthy piece of shit...

758
01:33:03,236 --> 01:33:05,170
did I do now?

759
01:33:05,238 --> 01:33:08,503
You killed my brother.

760
01:33:12,446 --> 01:33:14,380
I'm sorry.

761
01:33:22,756 --> 01:33:25,384
And you wanna join him?

762
01:33:29,363 --> 01:33:33,026
It's always the same thing.

763
01:33:37,437 --> 01:33:42,340
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

764
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:45,970
that you learn
to appreciate life.

765
01:33:46,046 --> 01:33:50,415
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

766
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:58,723
That's good.

767
01:34:03,664 --> 01:34:07,600
Because I take no pleasure...

768
01:34:08,969 --> 01:34:12,336
in taking a life...

769
01:34:12,406 --> 01:34:17,366
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

770
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:30,348
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

771
01:34:30,424 --> 01:34:33,723
- I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

772
01:34:33,794 --> 01:34:36,627
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

773
01:34:38,832 --> 01:34:42,097
Malky was makin' a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

774
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:45,002
<i>But they got nothin'
to do with it.</i>

775
01:34:45,072 --> 01:34:50,942
<i>They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

776
01:34:51,011 --> 01:34:54,105
<i>He was fast.
He fuckin' came out of nowhere.</i>

777
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:57,116
<i>Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.</i>

778
01:34:57,184 --> 01:35:00,779
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

779
01:35:00,854 --> 01:35:03,755
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

780
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:05,985
No women, no kids.

781
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,833
I think
it was somethin' personal.

782
01:35:18,205 --> 01:35:23,507
Death is whimsical today.

783
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:54,267
Blood, do you hear me?

784
01:35:54,341 --> 01:35:58,778
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

785
01:35:58,845 --> 01:36:01,279
Would you take her
up to my office?

786
01:36:02,949 --> 01:36:04,541
All right.

787
01:36:12,893 --> 01:36:15,020
Jesus fucking Christ.

788
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:28,773
<i>"Leon, my love.</i>

789
01:36:28,842 --> 01:36:31,310
<i>I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.</i>

790
01:36:31,378 --> 01:36:36,077
<i>Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D.E.A. building, room 4602.</i>

791
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:38,117
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

792
01:36:38,185 --> 01:36:41,985
<i>If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

793
01:36:42,055 --> 01:36:46,014
<i>It's for a contract.
Five grand a head, right?</i>

794
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:49,994
<i>I know I'll feel better
after I do this.</i>

795
01:36:50,063 --> 01:36:51,997
<i>I love you."</i>

796
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,901
Wait. I won't be long.

797
01:36:58,972 --> 01:37:02,237
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

798
01:37:06,813 --> 01:37:10,180
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

799
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,844
A nine "millie."

800
01:37:12,919 --> 01:37:15,046
Bullets.

801
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,554
Another nine "millie."

802
01:37:19,993 --> 01:37:22,018
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

803
01:37:22,095 --> 01:37:25,064
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

804
01:37:29,236 --> 01:37:31,067
Holy shit!

805
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,798
What's this? Lunch.

806
01:37:35,408 --> 01:37:37,501
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

807
01:37:37,577 --> 01:37:39,568
There's no anchovies on this.

808
01:37:56,997 --> 01:38:00,763
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?
I been here for ten minutes.

809
01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:03,530
I did my best.

810
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:52,707
Do you like it?

811
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:55,748
Yes.

812
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,380
So say it.

813
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,350
I like it.

814
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,574
Not thirsty?

815
01:39:27,988 --> 01:39:31,048
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

816
01:39:31,124 --> 01:39:34,218
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

817
01:39:34,294 --> 01:39:37,422
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

818
01:39:37,697 --> 01:39:41,133
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

819
01:39:42,369 --> 01:39:45,566
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

820
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,999
They just did it to show off.

821
01:39:49,075 --> 01:39:52,875
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

822
01:39:56,983 --> 01:39:59,577
Will I like it the first time?

823
01:40:03,723 --> 01:40:05,714
Mathilda, no.

824
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,651
Why not?

825
01:40:10,063 --> 01:40:12,258
I just can't.

826
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,790
- You love someone else?
- No.

827
01:40:16,736 --> 01:40:18,567
I mean...

828
01:40:22,075 --> 01:40:24,771
There was someone a long time ago.

829
01:40:26,012 --> 01:40:28,344
Before I came to the States.

830
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:32,113
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

831
01:40:32,919 --> 01:40:36,377
She was from
a very respectable family.

832
01:40:37,624 --> 01:40:39,114
Mine was...

833
01:40:39,926 --> 01:40:41,757
you know...

834
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,157
not so respectable.

835
01:40:45,231 --> 01:40:49,099
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

836
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:51,501
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

837
01:40:53,273 --> 01:40:54,638
Right.

838
01:40:54,707 --> 01:40:57,107
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

839
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:01,570
He killed her.

840
01:41:02,248 --> 01:41:04,375
One shot through the head.

841
01:41:07,887 --> 01:41:12,119
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

842
01:41:14,027 --> 01:41:16,222
They said it was an accident.

843
01:41:18,398 --> 01:41:19,888
So...

844
01:41:21,601 --> 01:41:23,728
one night I...

845
01:41:24,104 --> 01:41:26,095
waited for him.

846
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,840
Five hundred feet with a lens.

847
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:34,510
He also had an accident.

848
01:41:35,782 --> 01:41:39,445
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

849
01:41:39,519 --> 01:41:43,649
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

850
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:46,422
I was 19.

851
01:41:49,863 --> 01:41:53,663
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

852
01:41:57,337 --> 01:41:59,703
I've never had another girlfriend.

853
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:05,370
You see, Mathilda...

854
01:42:05,445 --> 01:42:07,504
I wouldn't be a good lover.

855
01:42:09,883 --> 01:42:11,544
Okay.

856
01:42:14,654 --> 01:42:16,884
Would you do me one favor?

857
01:42:16,956 --> 01:42:18,446
What?

858
01:42:18,525 --> 01:42:20,925
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

859
01:42:20,994 --> 01:42:23,155
We're gonna share the bed.

860
01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:26,429
I don't think it's a good idea.

861
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,700
It's okay.

862
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:32,167
Put your legs up on the bed.

863
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:34,297
Yeah. That's nice.

864
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:41,111
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

865
01:43:02,835 --> 01:43:04,826
Good night, Leon.

866
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,571
Good night.

867
01:43:32,098 --> 01:43:34,293
I want a piece of cake first!

868
01:43:39,305 --> 01:43:43,537
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

869
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:05,698
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

870
01:44:05,765 --> 01:44:08,359
When you've killed for us
in the past...

871
01:44:08,434 --> 01:44:11,926
we've always been satisfied.

872
01:44:12,005 --> 01:44:17,602
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

873
01:44:17,677 --> 01:44:19,611
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

874
01:44:23,816 --> 01:44:27,809
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

875
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:30,981
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

876
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:34,891
was kind of the Italian type.

877
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:38,795
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

878
01:44:38,865 --> 01:44:41,333
Wait. There's more.

879
01:44:41,401 --> 01:44:43,528
You're gonna love this.

880
01:44:45,872 --> 01:44:51,242
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

881
01:44:51,311 --> 01:44:56,078
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

882
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:59,915
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

883
01:45:01,187 --> 01:45:03,382
The very same...

884
01:45:03,456 --> 01:45:05,549
Italian hit man.

885
01:45:10,196 --> 01:45:12,630
I'm dying to meet him.

886
01:45:17,303 --> 01:45:21,672
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

887
01:45:21,741 --> 01:45:25,905
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

888
01:45:25,978 --> 01:45:27,969
Yeah, I forgot.

889
01:45:28,047 --> 01:45:30,982
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

890
01:45:32,518 --> 01:45:35,487
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

891
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:40,116
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

892
01:45:40,193 --> 01:45:42,058
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

893
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,653
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

894
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:46,164
Right.

895
01:46:06,552 --> 01:46:09,487
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

896
01:46:29,809 --> 01:46:31,777
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

897
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:35,780
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

898
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:38,408
Is he alone?

899
01:46:38,484 --> 01:46:40,679
Does he expect you?

900
01:46:40,753 --> 01:46:43,950
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

901
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:47,288
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

902
01:47:35,374 --> 01:47:36,773
Alpha team.

903
01:47:36,843 --> 01:47:40,438
<i>- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.</i>

904
01:48:27,493 --> 01:48:30,656
What up? Move! Fuck.

905
01:48:36,002 --> 01:48:37,833
Shit.

906
01:48:39,272 --> 01:48:41,263
Alpha team. Man down.

907
01:48:42,508 --> 01:48:44,635
I told you.

908
01:48:48,514 --> 01:48:51,278
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "everyone"?

909
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:53,818
Everyone!

910
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,574
Take this.

911
01:49:55,414 --> 01:49:58,508
Go take a look.

912
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:15,898
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

913
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:21,706
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

914
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:26,334
Nobody moves.

915
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:29,279
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

916
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:35,187
Okay, the girl's comin' out.
Let the girl go.

917
01:50:45,264 --> 01:50:48,563
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

918
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,963
You're coming with us.

919
01:51:06,218 --> 01:51:07,981
Christ, he shot him!

920
01:51:09,422 --> 01:51:11,890
Bastard!

921
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:22,399
Move!

922
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:28,566
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

923
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:30,768
Come!

924
01:51:31,911 --> 01:51:35,608
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

925
01:51:45,725 --> 01:51:49,422
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

926
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:55,058
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

927
01:51:56,836 --> 01:51:58,963
Stay away from the window.

928
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:46,784
Come here.

929
01:52:49,255 --> 01:52:50,688
Snipers.

930
01:52:52,758 --> 01:52:56,660
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

931
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:18,214
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

932
01:54:18,744 --> 01:54:22,373
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

933
01:54:22,448 --> 01:54:26,248
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting...

934
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:31,312
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

935
01:54:32,825 --> 01:54:35,123
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

936
01:54:35,194 --> 01:54:37,424
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

937
01:54:37,496 --> 01:54:40,294
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

938
01:54:40,366 --> 01:54:43,028
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

939
01:54:43,102 --> 01:54:44,592
Go.

940
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:47,969
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

941
01:54:51,877 --> 01:54:55,335
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

942
01:54:55,414 --> 01:54:57,348
You've given me
a taste for life.

943
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:00,749
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

944
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:02,946
You'll never be alone again.

945
01:55:06,292 --> 01:55:09,489
Please, go now, baby. Go.

946
01:55:11,563 --> 01:55:14,031
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

947
01:55:16,735 --> 01:55:20,728
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

948
01:55:26,412 --> 01:55:28,642
I love you, Mathilda.

949
01:55:28,714 --> 01:55:30,773
I love you, too, Leon.

950
01:56:05,784 --> 01:56:11,279
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

951
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:33,637
We've got one breathing here!

952
01:56:35,514 --> 01:56:37,778
Get a medic on the horn!

953
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:43,620
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

954
01:56:46,258 --> 01:56:50,058
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

955
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:54,893
Let's go! Move!

956
01:56:54,967 --> 01:56:56,764
Get that guy off the stairs!

957
01:56:56,835 --> 01:57:00,327
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

958
01:57:00,406 --> 01:57:03,466
We've got two men comin'
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

959
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:29,064
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

960
01:57:29,134 --> 01:57:31,159
Move your fuckin' asses.

961
01:57:31,236 --> 01:57:33,727
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

962
01:57:33,806 --> 01:57:36,138
<i>Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.</i>

963
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:37,641
You got it.

964
01:57:37,709 --> 01:57:41,338
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

965
01:57:41,413 --> 01:57:42,971
Did you find the girl?

966
01:57:52,224 --> 01:57:54,818
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

967
01:57:57,729 --> 01:58:01,825
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...

968
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:05,131
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

969
01:58:07,606 --> 01:58:10,837
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

970
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:17,173
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

971
01:58:33,999 --> 01:58:36,058
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

972
01:58:36,135 --> 01:58:39,627
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

973
01:58:39,705 --> 01:58:43,698
You're all right.
Sit tight.

974
01:58:49,448 --> 01:58:54,909
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

975
01:59:19,344 --> 01:59:22,472
Clear the way, men.

976
01:59:31,523 --> 01:59:33,889
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

977
02:01:27,406 --> 02:01:29,533
At your service.

978
02:01:38,116 --> 02:01:42,075
This is from...

979
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:50,424
Mathilda.

980
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:07,375
Shit.

981
02:02:28,834 --> 02:02:30,267
Get out of here!

982
02:02:33,638 --> 02:02:36,505
Leon asked me
to help you out...

983
02:02:36,575 --> 02:02:40,511
if somethin' happened,
and I think somethin' happened.

984
02:02:40,579 --> 02:02:44,345
He put aside
a little cash for you.

985
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:47,579
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

986
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:50,120
seein' as how
you're still so young...

987
02:02:50,188 --> 02:02:53,123
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

988
02:02:53,191 --> 02:02:55,318
Like a bank, you know, except...

989
02:02:55,394 --> 02:02:59,455
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

990
02:02:59,531 --> 02:03:02,227
No one knocks off old Tony.

991
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:04,962
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

992
02:03:05,036 --> 02:03:08,972
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

993
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:12,806
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

994
02:03:13,945 --> 02:03:15,378
Here.

995
02:03:15,447 --> 02:03:20,942
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

996
02:03:21,019 --> 02:03:25,956
A job?
What the hell can you do?

997
02:03:26,024 --> 02:03:27,855
I can clean.

998
02:03:29,227 --> 02:03:31,695
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

999
02:03:31,763 --> 02:03:33,856
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1000
02:03:33,932 --> 02:03:36,662
It's over!
The game's over!

1001
02:03:36,735 --> 02:03:39,465
Leon's dead!

1002
02:03:39,538 --> 02:03:41,506
You hear me?

1003
02:03:48,713 --> 02:03:53,446
Come on. You think
I ain't hurtin' too?

1004
02:03:58,924 --> 02:04:01,324
But he's dead.

1005
02:04:01,393 --> 02:04:05,352
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1006
02:04:06,598 --> 02:04:09,692
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1007
02:04:09,768 --> 02:04:11,861
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

1008
02:04:11,937 --> 02:04:16,203
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1009
02:05:07,459 --> 02:05:10,917
My parents...

1010
02:05:10,996 --> 02:05:13,089
died...

1011
02:05:13,164 --> 02:05:17,760
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1012
02:05:17,836 --> 02:05:19,770
It was terrible.

1013
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:26,106
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1014
02:05:26,177 --> 02:05:30,910
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1015
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:34,315
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1016
02:05:34,386 --> 02:05:39,449
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1017
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:44,021
But on one condition:

1018
02:05:44,095 --> 02:05:47,292
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

1019
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:49,526
I want you to take a chance...

1020
02:05:49,601 --> 02:05:52,536
and trust me.

1021
02:05:52,604 --> 02:05:55,129
Tell me what happened to you.

1022
02:05:58,543 --> 02:06:01,637
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. officers...

1023
02:06:01,713 --> 02:06:05,149
because of a drug problem.

1024
02:06:05,216 --> 02:06:07,810
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1025
02:06:07,886 --> 02:06:12,653
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1026
02:06:12,724 --> 02:06:16,592
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1027
02:06:35,981 --> 02:06:39,644
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1028
02:07:06,211 --> 02:07:08,873
I think we'll be okay here.
