00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,324
You know,
I noticed a shelter outside.

5
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,793
Then you go, idiot!

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,524
Shit, I'd be better off
going back to the army.

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,168
Damn it.

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,185
What a pitiful sight.

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,355
I told you all not to
drink here, didn't I?

10
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,791
Didn't I?

11
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,229
Hey, you.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,632
You're new here, huh?

13
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,467
Yes.

14
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,669
Get up.

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,933
Get up now!

16
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,307
Let me see your ID.

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,247
Right, you wouldn't have one.

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,816
Because you're filth.

19
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,451
Pardon?

20
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,619
Human filth.

21
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,558
All of you are trash
that disgust ordinary citizens.

22
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,761
Damn it,
how old are you?

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,731
I got a presidential plaque
when you were breast-fed.

24
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,234
You disrespectful prick.

25
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,104
You all are in big trouble.

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,141
You two come with me.

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,976
What?

28
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:55,415
Seems like filth
carry around IDs now.

29
00:01:55,415 --> 00:02:00,353
Han Min-wook...

30
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,820
Nice.

31
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,454
What?

32
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,820
Mr. President!

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,685
Salute!

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,691
President?

35
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,693
President, my ass!

36
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,764

I'm Kim Jong-il.

37
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,493

Are you deaf?

53
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,254
Where's an empty seat?

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,669
Here...

55
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,227
Thanks.

56
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm Eun-soo, Choi Eun-soo.

57
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,808
Nice to meet you.

58
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:51,090
Hey, aren't you supposed
to introduce yourselves, too?

59
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,396
Right, I'm Jin-ah.

60
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,131
Cho Jin-ah.

61
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,766
I'm Sun-mi.

62
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,631
Are you a transfer student?

63
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,471
What's our
homeroom teacher like?

64
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,607
Is he cute?

65
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,543
We have a new teacher
coming today.

66
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,567
Hey.

67
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,649
Who's the boss of this class?

68
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,219
Boss?

69
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,255
Her.

70
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,052
Min-sook.

71
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,428
I see.

72
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,996
And the pushover?

73
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,432
The one in front, Bang-shil.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,071
I see.

75
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:44,374
Hey, then who's the rebel?

76
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,479
Han Young-hee.

77
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,936
Students, settle down.

78
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,879
I said be quiet!

79
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:29,655
Had it hard without a homeroom
teacher for two weeks, right?

80
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:34,327
Well let me introduce
your new teacher.

81
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,319
Come in, Miss Choi!

82
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,294
Hey.

83
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,568
What?

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,417
Hello everyone.

85
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm your new homeroom teacher
starting today.

86
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,619
You know my name, right?

87
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,267
Study hard
with your new teacher.

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,869
And make a fresh new start.

89
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,605
Just do it!

90
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,266
Excuse me.

91
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,281
I don't know what
your previous teacher was like,

92
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,052
but I can never forgive anyone

93
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:40,159
who ostracizes or harasses
other students.

94
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,661
Understand?

95
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,298
When class ends, Min-sook and
Bang-shil come to the office.

96
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,788
Okay?

97
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,508
So you're Young-hee, right?

98
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,426
Don't you hear me?

99
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,724
Please don't bother me.

100
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,639
Young-hee,
feeling sick anywhere?

101
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm not sick.

102
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,734
Just don't act like you care.

103
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,780
What?

104
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,084
Don't act like I care?

105
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,850
I'm your teacher,
so how can I not care?

106
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,124
This sucks.

107
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,233
Young-hee,
stop where you are!

108
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,894
Stop right there!

109
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,313
Speak.

110
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,453
We met for
the first time today.

111
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,722
But are you mad at me
for something?

112
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,056
I'm not,
so don't bother me.

113
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,299
I guess it's no use
talking to you.

114
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,901
I'll have to
meet your parents.

115
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,199
My parents?

116
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,640
Then ask to
meet them yourself.

117
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,382
Fine!

118
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,719
What's their number?

119
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,155
It's 016-200-0001.

120
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,901
This is the President's office.

121
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,502
What?

122
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,766
The President's office?

123
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,974
Through reality-based policies,

124
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,211
President Han has improved
the lives of the less fortunate.

125
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,780
He's been single for ten years,

126
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,818
and had a piano concert for
the first time for any president.

127
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,387
With the "Piano President"
as his nickname,

128
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,423
he's very popular
among the youth and women.

129
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,661
But his support from elders
has considerably fallen.

130
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,797
With the local elections
two months away,

131
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,368
this will be a test to the
President's political ability.

132
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,269
Mr. President.

133
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,238
I think Young-hee
is in trouble at school.

134
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,210
Look here, Miss Choi.

135
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,381
How can you put me
in a tight position like this?

136
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,585
What are you trying to
accomplish with the President?

137
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:57,022
As a teacher,
I thought it was necessary.

138
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:04,764
I can forgive you for not knowing
that her father was the President.

139
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,134
But you shouldn't have
called him if you knew later!

140
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:14,403
Did you think the President
would call you to apologize?

141
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,477
Yes, this is the
principal speaking.

142
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,412
This is Han Min-wook,
Young-hee's father.

143
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,015
Mr. President!

144
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,151
I'm sorry I couldn't...

145
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,821
Mr. President, what is the
reason for your gracious call?

146
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,557
My secretary had
received an urgent call.

147
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:36,696
I was wondering if I could
speak to Miss Choi Eun-soo.

148
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,130
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,033
Thank you, Mr. President.

150
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:48,874
I know you're extremely busy,
but please hold for one moment.

151
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,808
Thank you.

152
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,776
Answer it!

153
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,360
Yes, this is Choi Eun-soo.

154
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,299
I'm sorry I had
called you so suddenly.

155
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:18,804
However, 35 students have been
waiting for me for 25 minutes.

156
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,007
If you'd like to talk,
please call me after class.

157
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,998
Have a nice day.

158
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,681
Look here, Miss Choi!

159
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,719
Hello?

160
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,387
Hello?

161
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,922
Mr. President!

162
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,049
Mr. President!

163
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,053
Mr. President!

164
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,390
That doll is cute, huh?

165
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,626
Right?

166
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,761
Yeah, it's cute.

167
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,396
Steal it for me.

168
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,193
Huh?

169
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:26,172
Why? You don't want to?

170
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,370
But...

171
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,140
Welcome.

172
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,182
Hey, kid.

173
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,444
Hey, kid!

174
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,953
Damn it!

175
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,148
Hey you,
stop where you are!

176
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,457
Stop!

177
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,936
"I envy those orioles
who look so much in love."

178
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:37,671
"My lonely heart would
like to return to my beloved."

179
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,705
Now who'd like to read it
in Chinese characters?

180
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:51,455
Pyunpyun... Hwangjo...
Jawoong... Sangee...

181
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,623
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Hello.

182
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,393
Thank you for coming.

183
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,352
Young-hee's classroom
is over there, sir.

184
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,609
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,844
I should've
visited you sooner.

186
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,678
But today's my first day.

187
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,689
So what happened
with Young-hee today?

188
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,390
Right!

189
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,693
In your last press conference,

190
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,595
you highlighted equal education
and teachers' authorities.

191
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,665
But one student used
her father's special status

192
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,201
to directly challenge
a teacher's authority.

193
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,571
In order to stop
this act from repeating,

194
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,542
and as parents are legally
held for a minor's crime,

195
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,639
I'd like for you to accept
Young-hee's punishment.

196
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,356
Wait.

197
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,425
So you're saying that
I be punished instead?

198
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,290
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,607
Miss Choi...

200
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,511
So I want you to write
"The Oriole Song" 100 times.

201
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,313
In Chinese by tomorrow!

202
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,304
I have to go to class now.

203
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,463
I bet the principal didn't sleep,
thinking he might get fired.

204
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,332
I wish I could've seen
the President's face.

205
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:53,794
Giving the President homework
is history in the making.

206
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,110
Think he'll really do it?

207
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,246
Are you on drugs?

208
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,578
Think the President will do it?

209
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,161
Mr. President,
let me do it instead.

210
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,832
How much do I have
before school ends?

211
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,334
If you speed it up,

212
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,565
we can arrive
before after-school class.

213
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,944
Damn, it would be
better drawing it instead.

214
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,749
Teacher!

215
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,950
Can't I get my dad
to do it, too?

216
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,328
Just bring it to the
office when you're done.

217
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,353
Understand?

218
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,538
Why couldn't
my dad be president?

219
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,871
That's why you have
to have the right parents.

220
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,614
97, 98, 99...

221
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,748
100!

222
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,351
You've done it,
Mr. President.

223
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,751
Congratulations!

224
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,856
I won't be tardy, right?

225
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,391
No, sir.

226
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,095
The school is
right over the bridge.

227
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,824
I'm exhausted.

228
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:31,170
But sir,
what does this song mean?

229
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,732
Anyone who went to
high school should know.

230
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:41,538
I was very into sports,
so I missed a lot of classes.

231
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:46,285
The King of Koguryu
wrote it for his beloved.

232
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,856
"I envy those orioles
who look so much in love."

233
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,919
"My lonely heart would
like to return to my beloved."

234
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,347
Mr. President!

235
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,802
I did my homework,
but as I crossed the bridge...

236
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,072
In other words,
the wind blew...

237
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,008
Well, I left the window open.

238
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,043
- And then the wind...
- Mr. President.

239
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,913
Just say that
you were too busy

240
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,949
or that you
didn't want to do it.

241
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,543
You don't need
to lie so blatantly.

242
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,989
Lying?

243
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,491
That's nonsense.

244
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,161
I did my homework,
and then right on the bridge...

245
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,329
That's enough!

246
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,798
I'll take your word for it.

247
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,701
I have class,
so I'm hanging up now.

248
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,840
Mr. President.

249
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,677
I'll order the coast guard
to find your homework, sir.

250
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,942
Don't talk nonsense,
and just get me some paper.

251
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,595
Choi Eun-soo passed
her teaching exam in 1997.

252
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,565
She started teaching Korean
at Jamshil H.S. In 1998,

253
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,667
and transferred to
Songpa H.S. In September,

254
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,368
Junghwa H.S. In June 1999,

255
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,103
Jangchoong H.S.
In September 2000,

256
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,972
Youngbok H.S. In March 2001,

257
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,410
Mijoo H.S. In March 2002,
and then finally to Hanil High.

258
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,179
She only taught for
six months at each school.

259
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,807
Only six months, I see.

260
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:07,089
Everyone, I have a
surprising announcement.

261
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,564
Our new teacher,
Ms. Choi Eun-soo

262
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,001
will represent
our nation's teachers

263
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,734
and have lunch
with the president.

264
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,779
Ms. Choi,
I hope you do well.

265
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,547
Yes.

266
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,378
Applause!

267
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,577
She's the pride of our school.

268
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,279
What am I gonna do?

269
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:05,283
When the President appears,
rise up and greet him politely.

270
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,419
Excuse me.

271
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,856
We're only having lunch, right?

272
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:15,627
I won't be dragged to
anywhere else, right?

273
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,859
Just relax while
you talk over lunch.

274
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,841
Hello?

275
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,376
Did you meet
my sweety Min-wook?

276
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,778
Did you mention me?

277
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,370
Hang up!

278
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,617
Rotten girl.

279
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,109
She thinks
she's a big shot now.

280
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,058
Miss Ha-rin!

281
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:51,396
Does a Mr. Shin Kwang-bae
live with you by any chance?

282
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,990
There's a letter for him.

283
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,527
I don't know who he is!

284
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,775
No.

285
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,643
I'm positive
a man lives there.

286
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,749
I said I'm coming,
so stop calling!

287
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,342
Here it is,
Mr. President.

288
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,585
Mr. President!

289
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,382
Please relax.

290
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,321
"The Oriole Song"
written 100 times.

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,071
I'd like to repeat that I did
do my homework yesterday.

292
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,606
It's not a lie.

293
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:46,211
And I stayed up
all last night doing this.

294
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,271
Please take back
that it was a lie.

295
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,775
You've written
each character very well.

296
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,927
Excellent work.

297
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:24,249
I feel like a elementary school student
all over again.

298
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,585
Shall we have lunch now?

299
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,386
Despite one mistake,

300
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,089
I gave you a perfect grade
for your sincerity.

301
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,857
A mistake?

302
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,759
Where?

303
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,161
Here.

304
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,898
On the third line, it's not
the "Ji" character for "earth."

305
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,733
But it's the particle "Gi".

306
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,102
You're wrong.

307
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,439
That line means
"a lonely me on the earth."

308
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,375
It's not "Gi",
but "Ji" for "earth."

309
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,743
Come on, Mr. President.

310
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:56,281
"Gi" is a particle that
connects the other characters,

311
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,783
so that line
means "a lonely me."

312
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:04,255
I won all the calligraphy
competitions with this song.

313
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,025
It's "Ji" not "Gi."

314
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,462
I am a language teacher.

315
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,399
I've taught this 100 times
a year, so I should know.

316
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,135
It's "Gi" not "Ji".

317
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,603
You're being stubborn!

318
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,705
Stubborn?

319
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,229
Want to bet on it?

320
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,411
I'm the President.

321
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,879
You're also
my student's parent.

322
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,013
Fine!

323
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,420
Minister of Education,
this is the President.

324
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,123
Yes, sir.

325
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,492
I just want to inquire
about something trivial.

326
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,727
It's about "The Oriole Song".

327
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,895
In the third line,

328
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:49,134
it's the particle "Gi"
not "Ji" for "earth", right?

329
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,669
It's "Gi", right?

330
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,570
Of course it's "Gi".

331
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,206
What fool said it was "Ji"?

332
00:27:55,206 --> 00:28:01,012
You finished college long ago,
so you might be confused.

333
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,481
"Ji" should be right.

334
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,850
No, I'm sure that it's "Gi".

335
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,520
My doctorate was
on "The Oriole Song".

336
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,354
Your doctorate?

337
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,358
Should I bring you
my thesis now, sir?

338
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,125
Have a nice day.

339
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,261
He said "Gi", right?

340
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,928
I bet you're hungry.

341
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:35,346
You look so marvelous
playing the piano.

342
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:40,251
And a bit lonely, too.

343
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:44,122
I really wanted
to tell you that.

344
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,790
Thank you.

345
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,459
But I can't play too well.

346
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,293
Oh yeah!

347
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,030
Do you know
the theme song for

348
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,232
Love is a
Many-Splendored Thing?

349
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,735
Of course I do.

350
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,271
The movie with William Holden
and Jennifer Jones, right?

351
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,208
It's Andy Williams' song,
"Love is..."

352
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,710
Can you play that song?

353
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,845
Pardon?

354
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,979
That?

355
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,416
Well, I had a good time
thanks to you.

356
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:17,355
Please teach our students
to their full potential.

357
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,289
I was just thinking, sir.

358
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,698
Try pulling down
your bangs a little.

359
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:30,335
And don't wear ties
with stripes all the time.

360
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,638
Try on ones with pok-a-dots.

361
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:37,597
Then you'll look
ten years younger.

362
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,126
Hi Eun-soo!

363
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,206
Did you meet
my sweety Min-wook?

364
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,175
He's so incredible.

365
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,977
And don't call
the President sweety.

366
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,379
Did you tell him about me?

367
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,815
That there's a girl
who loves him?

368
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,248
Nope.

369
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,586
Hey, is there a law where
I can't become his wife?

370
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,687
Shin Kwang-bae.

371
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,679
Ha-rin, you've got
reserve forces training.

372
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,071
Sir, here's the location
for you to examine tonight.

373
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,480
How about if we
do this instead?

374
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,927
Did you know that I was
also an outcast in high school?

375
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,062
You, too?

376
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,763
This is a secret,

377
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,467
but I'm an outcast
among the teachers, too.

378
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,804
Don't stay home
this weekend.

379
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,275
Go out and meet
your friends, okay?

380
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,777
- Yes, teacher.
- Go Bang-shil!

381
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,880
- Go Miss Choi!
- Bye.

382
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,948
Here's Andy Williams' song,

383
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:29,511
"Love is a
Many-Splendored Thing."

384
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:46,537
"Love is a
Many splendored thing."

385
00:31:46,537 --> 00:32:00,251
"It's the April rose that
only grows in the early spring."

386
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:14,632
"Love is nature's way
of giving a reason to be living,"

387
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:27,478
"The golden crown
that makes a man a king."

388
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:40,358
"Once, on a high and windy hill,"

389
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,494
"In the moonlight mist,"

390
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,731
If I stopped, then hurry
and give me a ticket.

391
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,724
Now they're having
their fun with people.

392
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,534
How are you?

393
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,367
Remember him?

394
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,942
It's good to see you again.

395
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:37,541
It's good to
see you doing well.

396
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,359
I'd like to make a proposal.

397
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,529
For the citizens who
have worked hard today,

398
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:59,170
I will bring all of you home
on the President's limousine.

399
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,606
How about it Mr. President?

400
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,198
Great!

401
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,378
Cheers for
President Han Min-wook!

402
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:17,049
"Yes, true love's a many splendored thing."

403
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:22,427
Frankly, I've given up
a lot on Young-hee.

404
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,931
But after meeting you,
I've mustered some hope.

405
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:32,733
That maybe you could guide
her into the right direction.

406
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,340
But lately I don't know

407
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,912
whether straightening up
a student is really right.

408
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,049
After going through
their own rebellious stage,

409
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:50,146
I think maybe they could
naturally heal themselves.

410
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:56,889
The bigger problem is that
she doesn't have a dream.

411
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:02,530
It's been so long
since I've seen her smile.

412
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:08,172
Perhaps when
she was six years old.

413
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:14,236
When I fell flat down on ice,
she smiled and laughed.

414
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,244
I really miss that smile.

415
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:25,056
Then how about we try
to find Young-hee's smile?

416
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,325
I'm not that confident, but...

417
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,361
Just do it!

418
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,953
Just do it!

419
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,173
Oh yeah!

420
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,799
Thanks for the cake.

421
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,922
I don't like them.

422
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,253
What?

423
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,833
I wanna be rained on.

424
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,198
Rain?

425
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,786
Please don't worry,
everything is fine now.

426
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,469
Young-hee, let's talk.

427
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,770
No.

428
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,305
Young-hee!

429
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,673
Let's talk first.

430
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,198
No, let go!

431
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,019
Why'd you hit me?

432
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,511
My dad doesn't even hit me,
so what gives you the right?

433
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,417
Follow me.

434
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,442
Do you want that?

435
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,842
Want me to steal it?

436
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,282
Why? Think I can't?

437
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,979
If I get caught,
I'll say I was menstruating.

438
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,805
Here!

439
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,522
Mister,
she told me to steal it.

440
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,863
Not again.

441
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,097
Hey!

442
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,265
Hey!

443
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,668
Hey!

444
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,829
Hey you!

445
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,213
Hey you!

446
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,306
Stop!

447
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,920
Smile whenever you
wanna smile, dummy.

448
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,619
It's worse holding
in a smile than pooing.

449
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,927
You're in high school,
but do you still like dolls?

450
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,910
That was the first time
I stole something.

451
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,140
It's easier than I thought.

452
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:36,287
Why did you stare
at the doll before?

453
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,723
I was talking to it.

454
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,393
Talking?

455
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,128
When I was young,

456
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,065
I fell asleep after
waiting for my parents.

457
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,468
When I wake up,
parents have already left.

458
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:55,105
And I'd find a doll in front of me.

459
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,776
And then I'd throw it away.

460
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:05,349
Afterwards,
there'd be another doll.

461
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,876
And I'd throw it away again.

462
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:15,987
Maybe it's some curse,
but the dolls talk to me.

463
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,131
About what?

464
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,000
About anything.

465
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,434
Common day stuff.

466
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,200
You made that up, huh?

467
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,745
How'd you know?

468
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,283
There are ways to find out.

469
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,553
But others believed me.

470
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,581
Teacher, you take it.

471
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,495
Hey!

472
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,559
Young-hee.
