1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,436
I stole it for you.

2
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:09,496
It talks too much,
so I don't want it.

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,774
Hey!

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,451
What should we do?

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,620
It looks good to me.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,714
Leave it there so it
can ramble on by itself.

7
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:30,417
Think we should?

8
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:45,409
Prices are too high I tell you.

9
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,213
So you mean that taxi fares
are too high as well, right?

10
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:54,013
No way,
taxi fares need to go up.

11
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,689
I was valedictorian,
and I didn't get in.

12
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,494
But tall and pretty Ji-hyun
who doesn't study gets in.

13
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:06,696
Mister,
does this make sense?

14
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,632
Does this make sense?

15
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:11,624
I said does this make sense?

16
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:31,788
Sorry to keep you waiting.

17
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,881
No, that's okay.

18
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:36,893
Do I look strange?

19
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:40,420
No, you look good in jeans.

20
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:43,900
Please come this way.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,162
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,215
So where shall we go?

23
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:01,810
I have an idea.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,089
Young-hee really smiled?

25
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,457
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:12,963
It would've been nice if you
had saw it, Mr. President.

27
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:15,866
Please don't call me
Mr. President.

28
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:19,836
Just call me Mr. Han.

29
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:24,574
Or Min-wook perhaps.

30
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,771
Yes, Min-wook.

31
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:30,647
Why are you so late?

32
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,949
Man, it was damn hard.

33
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,153
That's why I told you
to go on time.

34
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,788
How'd you get
so much dirt on you?

35
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:41,348
She and I live together.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,896
She?

37
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:50,934
In high school, we were
in the same movie club.

38
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:55,906
He was so handsome
all the girls liked him.

39
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:59,740
But after serving in the army,
he came back as a girl.

40
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,146
I see.

41
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:14,524
Hey Eun-soo.

42
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,593
Why'd your reserve training
end so late?

43
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:20,689
I had to make up for missing
out on the last session.

44
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:25,402
It's you, right?

45
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,768
Right?

46
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,273
Pleased to meet you.

47
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,242
It's a tremendous honor, sir.

48
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:36,179
You look a lot handsomer
in person than on TV.

49
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,281
Am I dreaming or what?

50
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:40,984
This isn't a dream, right?

51
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:47,390
Ha-rin, aren't you going to
change into something prettier?

52
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,526
Oh my, where's my head?

53
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,261
I'm going to
change very quickly,

54
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,363
so please wait a moment, sir.

55
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,297
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,869
I'll be right back.

57
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,669
- Let's drink.
- Sure.

58
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,722
Mr. President,
I mean Min-wook.

59
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:23,727
Have you ever been
without your bodyguards?

60
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,529
No, I've never had the chance.

61
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,467
Don't you want to try once?

62
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,458
Well...

63
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:38,174
It won't be that easy.

64
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:42,304
The bathroom has a back door.

65
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,944
See you soon.

66
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:42,128
Hurry.

67
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,951
Out of shape?

68
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:46,868
It's locked.

69
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,969
Let's jump over.

70
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,686
Are you okay?

71
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:37,420
Where did he go?

72
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,944
Let's look for him again.

73
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,704
Noodles and a soju bottle
for table three.

74
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,044
What's this?

75
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:20,689
This is a tavern, right?

76
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:34,544
Actually, these huge guys
dressed in black suits outside.

77
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,513
I know, I know.

78
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,281
You're fugitives, right?

79
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,249
Yes.

80
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,784
Trying to hide, right?

81
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,286
Yes.

82
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:44,187
Follow me.

83
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,655
- Thank you.
- Hurry and go upstairs.

84
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:50,326
Don't worry about big men.

85
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:53,563
I used to be a Marine.

86
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:56,396
Oh my, isn't that him?

87
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,025
Just finish your food.

88
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,815
They're coming.

89
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,458
What do you want?

90
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,328
Was the President here
by any chance?

91
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,829
The President?

92
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:28,264
Of course.

93
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,499
Really?

94
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,167
Yeah, 30 years ago.

95
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,871
President Park
came to my Marine unit.

96
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,498
Pardon?

97
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:14,877
Bastard didn't know
what a real Marine can do.

98
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:17,513
I knocked him out,
so you can relax and drink.

99
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:18,502
Follow me.

100
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:22,819
Sit, sit.

101
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,253
Sit over here.

102
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:28,825
It's nice sitting together, huh?

103
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,760
So what drink
can I get for you?

104
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,026
Since we were drinking

105
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,134
Something newer?

106
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,570
I told you there's
no one like that here.

107
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,705
No, a customer that just left

108
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,675
said there's someone who
looks just like the President.

109
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,677
I'm sorry,
but I'll have to look upstairs.

110
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:48,778
You can't.

111
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:49,879
Ma'am, you can't do this.

112
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,337
If you keep this up,
I'll call the police.

113
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,855
Big trouble.

114
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:00,390
They have guns.

115
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,158
Hurry and hide.

116
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:05,228
Hurry and go.

117
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:08,998
Go inside.

118
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,199
Hurry.

119
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,567
Go in.

120
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:17,573
Wait...

121
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,564
Do you want to get shot?

122
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:27,507
I was only a security guard.

123
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,866
Sorry to interrupt.

124
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,316
Salute!

125
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:36,752
Everything's clear,
Mr. President.

126
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:51,033
I think we've put them
through too much,

127
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:54,400
so how about we quit?

128
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:51,548
What a beautiful morning!

129
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:57,622
Oh my,
Young-hee's here early today.

130
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:02,865
What a great day it is.

131
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:06,469
Life is happy and beautiful.

132
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:11,007
We're going to study
hard today, okay?

133
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,668
Just do it!

134
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:28,891
Teacher, please have some.
It'll help start your great day.

135
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,792
Thank you!

136
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:55,151
Well, see you in Korean class!

137
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,085
Just do it!

138
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:02,854
Teacher!

139
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,663
Teacher, are you all right?

140
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm fine.

141
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,235
Vinegar is a good
beauty treatment.

142
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,004
Just do it!

143
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,505
Sorry, teacher.

144
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,809
It's okay.

145
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,211
Hey, it tasted better
than soy sauce.

146
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,442
We mixed it with
soap water, too.

147
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,218
It's okay.

148
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:32,244
We spit in it, too.

149
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,837
The files on the eastern front
you'll be visiting today, sir.

150
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,271
Yes, good work.

151
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:50,863
There are so many.

152
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,009
Here you go.

153
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,408
Mr. Chang.

154
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:59,545
It concerns
Young-hee's teacher.

155
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:05,588
Well, some place
people can't notice...

156
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:08,691
That is, a quiet place...

157
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:10,493
Well, for the two of us...

158
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,395
I understand very well.

159
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:14,030
I'll set the time
and place for you.

160
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,930
Thank you.

161
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:24,302
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

162
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,610
Hello?

163
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,878
Is this Miss Choi Eun-soo?

164
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,279
Yes, it's me.

165
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,149
This is Mr. Chang
from the President's office.

166
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,685
Yes, we've met before.

167
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:41,891
The President wants to meet
you at a quiet place tonight.

168
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:42,892
Yes.

169
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:47,563
The place is suite 2301
at the Hyatt Hotel.

170
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:51,267
The President
will arrive at 10 p.m.

171
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:54,603
It's suite 2301,
and please don't be late.

172
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:57,800
Hotel suite?

173
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:02,945
Our policy shouldn't
be superficial or formal,

174
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:08,584
but being full of hope for
the future is most important.

175
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:11,712
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

176
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:17,460
Oh yeah, what happened
to that favor I asked of you?

177
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,261
Right, sir.

178
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:23,899
The room has been reserved,
and security has been sent.

179
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,368
What? Reserve a room?

180
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:32,341
Yes, if you go to suite 2301
at the Hyatt Hotel at 10 p.m.,

181
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,844
Miss Choi will be
waiting for you.

182
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:39,548
It's the room President Clinton
slept in during his visit.

183
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:43,219
It's the best place for secrecy.

184
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,587
Look here, Mr. Chang.

185
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:47,623
I'm sorry, sir.

186
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:50,092
I should've mentioned it
when no one's around.

187
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:51,927
Look here, Mr. Chang.

188
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,997
Are you out of your mind?

189
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:55,998
Sir?

190
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:58,601
This is not what I wanted.

191
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,236
Cancel it right now.

192
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,703
Now!

193
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,965
What's wrong?

194
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,229
Something happened?

195
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:37,006
I want to get drunk.

196
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,008
Why?

197
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:41,577
What happened?

198
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:46,649
Which bastard did this to you?

199
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,174
The President bastard.

200
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,159
Hello?

201
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:02,264
Oh, right.

202
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,528
Hold on please.

203
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:11,140
Answer it.

204
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,175
Who is it?

205
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,077
The President bastard.

206
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:15,911
I don't want to.

207
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,681
Answer it,
he wants to talk to you.

208
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,946
Just tell him
what's on your mind.

209
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:24,376
Hurry.

210
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,761
Hello?

211
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,264
Eun-soo, it's me.

212
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:39,068
I'm sorry that
I'm not that kind of girl.

213
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,770
I'm not like that
so I'm very sorry.

214
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,328
Good-bye.

215
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,751
Yes, Mr. President.

216
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,446
Get the car ready.

217
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:06,026
I think I've fallen in love.

218
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,598
Okay.

219
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,400
Good luck with him.

220
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,872
Good luck with
that president guy.

221
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:20,576
It's all over now.

222
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:25,240
Don't ever talk about him
in front of me, okay?

223
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:31,253
Hey, Han Min-wook!

224
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,023
It's all over!

225
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,425
The end!

226
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,052
End!

227
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:42,058
But it's not about
my sweety Min-wook.

228
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:51,338
Hello.

229
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:57,008
She just left.

230
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,781
Where did she go?

231
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,114
Eun-soo!

232
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:42,291
Eun-soo,
I know you're very upset.

233
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,793
It's all my fault.

234
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:48,931
But I wish
you'd let me explain.

235
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,299
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,002
This may be rude of me,
but one thing is for sure.

237
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:57,062
I'm not that kind of girl.

238
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:14,383
Hello.

239
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:17,586
Nice to meet you.

240
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:22,489
It's the President!

241
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,505
It's an honor to meet you.

242
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:39,565
What a handsome fellow.

243
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:52,416
Hello.

244
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:58,449
You're so cute.

245
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:25,754
This guy who likes this girl
made a mistake.

246
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:27,856
It wasn't directly his fault,

247
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:31,126
but if he nonetheless
hurt her in the end,

248
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:35,564
I think he should apologize
and make up to her.

249
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:40,592
If you were her,
what would you do?

250
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:58,587
That girl was riding
in the subway.

251
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:02,891
She waited for him to come
closer and missed her stop.

252
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,426
So what would you do?

253
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:07,396
I'd have to take her
all the way home.

254
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:09,261
Let's get off at the next stop.

255
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:20,472
Seoul Night Club,
Waiter Han Min-wook

256
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:31,386
It's here.

257
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:32,955
I see.

258
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:35,253
It's a nice place.

259
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:42,264
I'm sorry and grateful
for today.

260
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:44,566
I had a good time.

261
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:46,864
I had a good time as well.

262
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:07,518
I wonder why people
find courage in the dark.

263
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:21,970
Feeling the hiccups
coming again?

264
00:27:54,136 --> 00:28:03,807
President Han Gets Caught
On A Secret Date

265
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:09,651
In a recent newspaper,

266
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:14,556
President Han was found
embracing a woman.

267
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,491
Her name is Choi Eun-soo.

268
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:19,628
She's the President's
daughter's teacher.

269
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:24,399
But the thornier issue
is Choi Eun-soo's past.

270
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,501
In college,
she was suspected of

271
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:29,604
kidnapping the Unification
Minister's granddaughter,

272
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:32,474
and was being investigated.

273
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:36,611
My granddaughter
was taken hostage.

274
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:40,012
Is that a humane thing to do?

275
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,613
Hello.

276
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:03,472
Hey, did you guys hear?

277
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:07,943
Ms. Choi came to our school
to become the President's wife.

278
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:09,010
That sucks.

279
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,179
For that kidnapping,

280
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,816
she seduced these guys
and then betrayed them...

281
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,753
No wonder she tried
to manipulate Young-hee.

282
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:21,450
I heard she stole something
to get close to Young-hee.

283
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:27,913
Repeat what you all just said.

284
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,115
What?

285
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:30,983
What did you just say?

286
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:33,752
Say it, you bitches!

287
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:37,620
Say it!

288
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,561
To be the President's wife,

289
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:46,132
become a teacher and
transfer to different schools.

290
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,734
Then go to the President's
daughter's school.

291
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,170
Afterwards,
be her homeroom teacher.

292
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,072
Since there needs
to be an opening,

293
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:56,609
use any means
to kick out her old teacher.

294
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,611
I'd like to
point something out.

295
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:02,448
There's something very
important to be his wife.

296
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:04,016
What's that?

297
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:08,885
You must kidnap
a little child ten years ago.

298
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,259
Our country has
gotten a lot better.

299
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,762
In the old days,
he'd go to jail for saying that.

300
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:20,533
Who is he talking about?

301
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,735
Just keep eating!

302
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:27,573
A woman who dates the
President can become his wife.

303
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,575
Who is she?

304
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,844
The mother of our country.

305
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:37,816
But at the same time,
she lives with another man.

306
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:41,487
Does this make sense
in a civilized country?

307
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,422
Look at this.

308
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:48,928
Shin Kwang-bae's ID
is 730728- 1052511.

309
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:54,166
Have you ever heard of a
woman called Kwang-bae?

310
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:58,068
And ever seen a woman's ID
start with a male's number?

311
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:09,705
Ha-Rin.

312
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:25,898
Our party's approval rate
has fallen by 35% this month.

313
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:31,131
This will negatively affect
the local elections next month.

314
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:45,211
Sir, shall I catch you
on a better time?

315
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,420
Are you really dating
the President?

316
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,285
- When did you two meet?
- Is it true?

317
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:53,583
How do you feel now?

318
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,525
Please say something.

319
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:02,101
Mr. President, please allow me
to begin by addressing your

320
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:05,838
alleged relationship with Miss Choi.

321
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:09,103
Is there any truth to this rumor?

322
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:13,112
She would like to first
ask you about the rumors

323
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:17,242
that is troubling you at the moment.

324
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:23,455
To protest his objection to the
North-South student summit,

325
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,424
we stopped the Minister's car.

326
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:32,698
But he had mistakenly left his
granddaughter and drove off.

327
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:36,535
So we're not kidnappers.

328
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:43,008
Choi Eun-soo is simply
my daughter's teacher.

329
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,945
We had no time to develop
feelings for each other.

330
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:54,875
All I did was hear her advice
on Young-hee's education.

331
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,490
And I'd really like
to point out something here.

332
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:04,897
Shin Kwang-bae
had a sex change,

333
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:08,634
but she's not treated
legally as a woman.

334
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:14,239
She's my best friend
and is like a sister to me.

335
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:19,912
I'd like for you all
not to hurt her any longer.

336
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:21,714
As our country's President,

337
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:27,486
I deeply regret that
I've confused the people.

338
00:33:27,486 --> 00:33:31,690
From now on,
I'll restrain from these acts.

339
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,559
Is your relationship
with the President true?

340
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,461
Please tell the truth.

341
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,496
Yes, it's true.

342
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:40,897
I had feelings
for the President.

343
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:48,607
So I did what I could
to get close to him.

344
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:53,879
By doing this wrongful act,

345
00:33:53,879 --> 00:34:00,018
I've brought trouble
to the honorable President,

346
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,788
so I'm deeply sorry.

347
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:06,392
Didn't the President realize
you intentions?

348
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,987
Will you keep teaching
at his daughter's school?

349
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,278
Miss Choi.

350
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:38,991
Don't be too upset.

351
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:46,159
The President has no choice
but to be a politician.

352
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,559
Why are you up there?

353
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,151
Just because.

354
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm really sorry.

355
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,671
For what?

356
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:27,332
Just because.

357
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:34,680
I bet it's nice to
quit this dumb school.

358
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,648
Envious, huh?

359
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:40,212
I'm going very far away
to the countryside.

360
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:45,916
Did you really like my dad?

361
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,626
Yep!

362
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:56,333
But you're giving up?

363
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:00,936
Yep!

364
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:02,603
Why?

365
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,899
Just because!

366
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,977
When are you coming down?

367
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,617
After you leave.

368
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,414
Okay!

369
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:25,826
I'm done having fun,
so I'm going home.

370
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:31,837
You're the first person
to hit me.

371
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:34,567
And the last, of course.

372
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:38,033
You need to be hit more.

373
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,778
Teacher!

374
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:43,100
Excellent work

375
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,358
Mr. President.

376
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,555
You're 35 minutes
behind schedule, sir.

377
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,934
This year,
there are many paintings

378
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,529
that entail fantasies
of a cyber-future.

379
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,674
When I was young,

380
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:52,210
I'd paint landscapes
of my dreams.

381
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,737
Kids today
are surely different.

382
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,356
Who's the person
standing there?

383
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:05,724
It's me, sir.

384
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:09,094
Your dream must be
to become president.

385
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:10,062
Yes, sir.

386
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:11,363
When I grow up,

387
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:14,766
I want to be a great
president for the people.

388
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:20,136
An honest and great
president like President Han.

389
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:18,997
At a countryside school
in Youngwol Town,

390
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:24,035
a elementary school student dreamed
of becoming president.

391
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:31,276
This boy painted a picture
of his dreams and ambitions.

392
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:35,547
It was rough
yet sincerely made.

393
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:38,583
And into the far future,

394
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:43,588
this boy became president.

395
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:49,561
But this president lied to
the people who elected him.

396
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:55,433
And terribly broke
this woman's heart.

397
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:58,703
My beloved citizens.

398
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,239
Today,
in front of all of you,

399
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,645
I'd like to confess
something to you.

400
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:12,551
Frankly,
I don't play the piano well.

401
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:18,290
For the last election,
I practiced to artificially create

402
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,628
this image of a
piano-playing president.

403
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:27,332
You voted for
a person like this.

404
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:30,836
And I was elected president
thanks to you.

405
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:36,208
But I can't lie
to myself any longer.

406
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:45,283
I'm very embarrassed
for lying to you all until now.

407
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:50,622
My beloved citizens,
I'm very sorry.

408
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:57,796
But I'm not going to
disappoint you any longer.

409
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:01,666
I...

410
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:07,138
I love Miss Choi Eun-soo.

411
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:17,048
She helped me
find myself again.

412
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,150
Ladies and gentlemen.

413
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,849
If I don't hold on to her,
I'll never get married.

414
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,391
Teacher!

415
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,592
Hi.

416
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:11,202
Which one is prettier?

417
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:12,437
This one is, right?

418
00:43:12,437 --> 00:43:14,673
No, this one's prettier.

419
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:16,041
Mine's prettier.

420
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,476
No, both of them are.

421
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:21,513
Teacher, you take them.

422
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:23,743
Thank you.

423
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:08,586
A man who loves this woman
made an unforgivable mistake.

424
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:12,791
But this man desperately
wants her to forgive him.

425
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:16,158
If you were her,
what would you do?

426
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:29,607
Can I answer in a poem?

427
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:32,269
A poem?

428
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:38,443
Can you say Han Min-wook
by character?

429
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,922
Han...

430
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:51,162
Han is the first character
for big mistake.

431
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:52,697
Min...

432
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:55,934
Min is for broken-heart.

433
00:45:55,934 --> 00:46:00,939
Are you prepared to pay for it?

434
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:03,999
Wook...
