1
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,020
What do we say now?

2
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,860
Anything

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,230
Anything you want

4
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,560
How many kids do you have?

5
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,260
Nothing like that

6
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,140
Was I any good?

7
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,250
You don't know how seductive
you really are

8
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,920
So you looks so normal

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,100
You're really fantastic

10
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,820
I thought my whole body
would be sucked into you

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,130
Does your wife know
about your lifestyle?

12
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,810
As long as she doesn't
see it, she's okay with it

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,980
She knew about this
before we married

14
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,720
I've always been like this

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,020
Even before I ran away
from Seoul

16
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
Why did you leave Seoul?

17
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,830
Why'd you spend 2 weeks
in the hospital for a head wound?

18
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,140
That's not fair

19
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,200
One advantage of
living up the hill

20
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,010
- Tricky, aren't I?
- As much as me?

21
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,520
You got me there

22
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,720
Su-jin

23
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,270
this is an internet joke, what's
soccer players' favorite drink?

24
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,230
Penal-tea!

25
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,370
What happened to my hair?

26
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,500
No, it's pretty

27
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,840
I'll brush it when we get home.
Don't worry

28
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,410
it looks good

29
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,720
- Hey, Doctor Choi
- Oh, hello

30
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,320
- We should go fishing sometime, huh?
- Yes, I'll look at my schedule

31
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,590
Bye

32
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,640
Hello?

33
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,810
Hello?

34
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,720
- Who was that?
- No one, maybe they'll call again

35
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,070
It's nice out,
wanna go for a hike?

36
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,500
Why don't you go with Su-jin?
I don't like hiking

37
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,170
I wanted to go as a family

38
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,800
We've never gone out
since moving

39
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,210
It's too late to hike

40
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,010
It'll be lunchtime soon

41
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,950
How about hot springs, then?

42
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,020
I'm a bit stiff these days

43
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,710
We can have sushi on the way back.
How about it?

44
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,900
Mommy, hurry up

45
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,150
Daddy!

46
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,290
- The hot spa was good, huh?
- Yeah

47
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,760
- Do you have some lotion on you?
- You didn't put any on?

48
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,190
I didn't like the one they had

49
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,860
Did you put some on Su-jin?

50
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,130
By the way

51
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,830
- Hon?
- Hmm?

52
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,740
You know Prof Hwang?

53
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,640
He asked me to try
writing again

54
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,110
He thinks I have a lot of time
in a place like this

55
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,220
I guess everyone's out
on Sunday

56
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Stop by the store,
let's get some drinks

57
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,520
Honk! Honk! Big car coming.
Move away, please

58
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,740
Mommy, let's get some ice cream

59
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,670
- Do you want something?
- Anything's fine

60
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,750
I'll wait here

61
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Is something wrong?

62
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,360
Do you know how I got out?

63
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,590
Over the window!

64
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,020
Look at my feet!

65
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,300
Is someone here?

66
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't like such dangerous acts

67
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,380
- I couldn't keep our appointment
- That's no problem

68
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,020
You came to say that,
this late?

69
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,250
The light was on

70
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm leaving

71
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,300
No one saw me

72
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,730
Mi-heun, wait

73
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,210
Our promises are

74
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,580
like sea buoys

75
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,280
They don't really mark anything

76
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,980
Stop there or just float past them

77
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,960
It doesn't make a difference

78
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,980
Mi-heun

79
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
Hey, Mi-heun

80
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,410
Where'd you go?

81
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,520
I was worried about you

82
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,650
I went for a walk

83
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,230
At this hour? In your pajamas?

84
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,900
Who cares?
No one's around to see me

85
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,470
But when did you leave?

86
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,240
When you went to the bathroom

87
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,150
Are you crazy?
Weren't you scared?

88
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,850
No I went to the lake

89
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,550
What's wrong with you?

90
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,800
You make me crazy

91
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,630
Can we do it?

92
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,200
Mi-heun?

93
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,980
It's okay, isn't it?

94
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,780
Here they go again

95
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,650
What?

96
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,920
The wife! She does this
every year

97
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,360
She invites some outsiders

98
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,420
has an outdoor party

99
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,620
and keeps the village up
all night

100
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,470
They say she runs a restaurant
in the city

101
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,600
Probably just a pub

102
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,570
Is there anyplace cool around?
It's so boring here

103
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,110
- Shall we go to the beach?
- The beach?

104
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,520
- Is it nearby?
- Of course, it's not far

105
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,140
Wow, you came pretty far

106
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,850
I love you

107
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,800
Does this mean I lost?

108
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,540
- The game's over?
- You mean it?

109
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,200
Can't I?

110
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,040
No. It's not that you can't

111
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,710
I just said it

112
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,090
for practice

113
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,860
to remind myself of the rule

114
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,470
lf you only knew

115
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,110
You don't know how hard
I'm trying not to lose this game

116
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,010
Oh, it feels so good

117
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,520
Darling?

118
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,980
Wait, wait

119
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,960
Darling?

120
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,650
In-kyu

121
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,290
Darling?

122
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,390
They're looking for you

123
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,900
In-kyu! In-kyu!

124
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,070
Want to put in a pond

125
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,180
and raise goldfish?
Su-jin will like it

126
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
There's a place by my shop

127
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,740
They'll give us a good deal

128
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,340
Let's do it later

129
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,280
No, it's best to do it now

130
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,250
I've one more thing to say

131
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,690
I want to write a novel again

132
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,430
Hello?

133
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,840
Yes, yes okay

134
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,810
- Who was it?
- Wait

135
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,480
What? Where are you going?

136
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,480
Um Mi-sook's mom is sick

137
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,520
- Who?
- You know, at the rest stop

138
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,820
So why do you have to go?

139
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,430
I'm the only one she knows

140
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,200
- But this late at night?
- I'll call when I get there, okay?

141
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,460
I parked at the post office

142
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,360
Is something up?

143
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,730
Not that I know of

144
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,640
It's just, different

145
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,010
Isn't it fun and thrilling?

146
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,610
What'd you say to him?

147
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,180
Why?

148
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,250
Relax

149
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,060
On my way home,
I realized I really needed you

150
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,180
I didn't come to joke

151
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,110
You've got to relax

152
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,290
and take us less seriously

153
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,920
Come here

154
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
Where were you this
afternoon?

155
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
This place was closed early

156
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,270
I just went for a long drive

157
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,280
Honking loudly and
speeding, I bet

158
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,410
I'm going to my mom's
next week

159
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,610
Can I try it?

160
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,620
Want to meet me there?

161
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,510
Can you meet me if I go?

162
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,980
It's my sister's memorial day

163
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,960
Let's meet at night

164
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,990
The garlic is great there

165
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,630
I don't make it often

166
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,220
Take some home for your family

167
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,860
Why didn't you bring Su-jin?

168
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,610
I'm only here for the day

169
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,340
Besides, she's busy these days
playing with friends

170
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,440
Where's the brother in law?

171
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,410
He has a new wife,
don't bother

172
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,020
Hae-jin should get
close to her, too

173
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,090
She's never seen your sister

174
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Shouldn't we go to the temple?

175
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,970
The monks will pray for her

176
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,700
And don't bother coming
next year

177
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,600
We've left this to the monks.
No need for us to fuss anymore

178
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,640
You want to go for a walk?

179
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,590
Do we have to?
It's like downtown Seoul here

180
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,910
Look, just go back

181
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,510
Why'd you come?

182
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,090
If you hadn't,
I wouldn't have waited

183
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,650
Don't get angry

184
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,490
Look at me

185
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,300
I hate the way I am

186
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,330
This is just crazy

187
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,100
No need to drag this on.
Let's end it

188
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,010
I'm not angry with you.
Stop it

189
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,610
lf you're tired of us,
just say it

190
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,480
There isn't any commitment here

191
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,300
It's not that I don't want it.
It's the complete opposite

192
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,400
You don't really understand me

193
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,340
We came way too far

194
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,550
While coming here,
you know what I realized?

195
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,940
What's that?

196
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm disgusted with how I am

197
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,990
how I live, how others live

198
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,560
I even thought of going back

199
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,230
But after 4 hours

200
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,910
I couldn't

201
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,180
It'd be crazy for me to go back,
and there's nowhere I want to be

202
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,920
It's the story of my life

203
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,090
I'm not angry with you

204
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,700
I know I'm bad

205
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,540
I've never kept a promise
in my life

206
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,170
When I get older,
I'll be just like my dad

207
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,480
I ran away from the one I

208
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,290
confessed love to go,
just like him

209
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,790
I cut my hand so
I'd remember not to love again

210
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,300
But here you are

211
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,040
My nurse said rumors about

212
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,140
us are all over the village

213
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,880
Someone in the next town
even asked

214
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,680
how the doc and his lover
were doing

215
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,630
Let's spend the night
together anyway

216
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,300
It'll be our first
full night together

217
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,670
You could call it
our first night

218
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,380
You men like first too much

219
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,250
What if today wasn't the first

220
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,880
but the last,
how would you spend it?

221
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,160
Do the laundry

222
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,490
Clean the fridge

223
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,240
Go to the hairdresser's and say

224
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,770
"Do whatever you want with it"
for the first time,

225
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,910
put Su-jin's things in a box

226
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,590
and write 2014,
so she can find it as an adult

227
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,920
Go to Jinju to eat pizza.
Write a letter to a friend

228
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,230
Look at all my old report
cards and pictures

229
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,870
Oh, and change my underwear

230
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,870
And me?

231
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,410
When will you meet me
on the last day?

232
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,180
When will you meet me
on that day?

233
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,320
From morning till night, all day

234
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:47,460
All day Beginning to end

235
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,030
I wouldn't let you go
for a moment

236
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,840
Let's go

237
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,110
You're right.
We came much too far

238
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,350
The game's over

239
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,990
Let's not meet any more

240
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,150
Say that you love me

241
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,160
I don't want to
play games anymore

242
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,460
- Mommy
- Huh?

243
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,630
I'm hot. Can I get out?

244
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,100
What's all this?

245
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,580
I put the store up for sale

246
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm running off to hide again

247
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,550
So he can't find me

248
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,890
Is something wrong?

249
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,190
Why?

250
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,660
You seem different

251
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,500
Huh?

252
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,140
I've heard about it

253
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,180
They all know except
my husband

254
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,990
When are you leaving?

255
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,460
The next owner will be here
soon

256
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,490
Keep in touch. I'll write

257
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,070
My name's Eun-Yeon

258
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,470
Na Eun-Yeon

259
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,270
Don't say it

260
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,250
No one's called me that
since I left home at 15

261
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,960
I just wanted you to know
my name

262
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,370
Hello?

263
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,640
It's me. Where are the stop smoking
tapes that were in the car?

264
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,150
I threw them out

265
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,350
But they weren't yours!

266
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,680
You knew I was trying to
quit smoking!

267
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,120
You should've at least asked!

268
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,560
- Wait! Someone's at the door
- Shit!

269
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,000
- I'll call you back
- Hey! Mi-heun!

270
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,110
- Who is it?
- Here to construct the pond

271
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,140
- Pardon?
- Pond construction, ma'am

272
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,980
Hey, mister! Sir?

273
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,880
Hey, stop for a sec

274
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,850
I'll take the kid out
for a while

275
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,760
- Okay, but be back before lunch
- I will. Thank you

276
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,790
No problem! Go on

277
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,550
Bye, sweetie

278
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,530
You bastard!

279
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,240
Get on

280
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,570
People are looking.
Get in now

281
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,950
I have to go pick up Su-jin

282
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,490
You go first and wait for me

283
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,300
One big change in life is
more than enough for me

284
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,970
If you and

285
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,810
I live together

286
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,840
we'll just end up repeating
the same mistakes

287
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,150
Just like with your husband

288
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,660
you'll end up lying to me

289
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,500
And I'll meet another woman

290
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,030
and be forced to lie to you

291
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,080
That's absurd

292
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,610
What do you know
about me and my husband?

293
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,450
What's the big change?

294
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,710
I can just eat you up
right now

295
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,680
Like a man-eater

296
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,590
I need you

297
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,520
Don't go seeing anyone else yet

298
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,540
A woman who makes me

299
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,880
warm soup every morning

300
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,590
And has my baby through her body

301
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,320
Coming home at night

302
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,990
and falling asleep in her arms

303
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,370
It's no longer possible

304
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,510
We both tried it before

305
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,120
We both failed at
that sort of life

306
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,770
What were you doing there?

307
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,200
I'm talking to you!

308
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,540
I went to the spa

309
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,740
When did you arrive?

310
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,640
An hour ago

311
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,620
I was here for three hours!

312
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,050
I went home early
but no one was home!

313
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,920
The workers were mad
about missing lunch!

314
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,760
I looked for you
and Su-jin everywhere!

315
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,490
I found your car here,
so I waited

316
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,960
I asked if anyone saw you
or Su-jin inside the spa

317
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,730
They said no!!

318
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,560
I waited since then.
It's six now!

319
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,470
Where's Su-jin?

320
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,970
You know there's nothing
but a motel through there!

321
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,700
Where is she?

322
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,750
Playing at a friend's house

323
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,950
Explain yourself

324
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,320
Is it true what everyone says?

325
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,860
Let go

326
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,170
Get off, now!

327
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,280
Get out!

328
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,620
Now, explain! I'm listening!

329
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,730
You think I'm sacrificing my life
to live in this hell-hole

330
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,860
so that you can fuck some doctor?

331
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,860
I have nothing to say

332
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,470
- Let's end it
- What?

333
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,610
I want a divorce

334
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,580
You think I'm crazy enough to
give you what you want?

335
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,680
God forbid!

336
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,580
I'm gonna make sure you
pay for this!

337
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,960
- When did it start?
- As soon as we moved here

338
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,470
Where do you think you're going?

339
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,330
Stop right there!
You can't go! Fuck!

340
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,330
Hey, miss, is something wrong?

341
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,660
Are you okay?

342
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,660
Are you sure?

343
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,530
How'd this happen?

344
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,080
You're unreal

345
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:57,160
A jerk who seduces crazy women
in the country with bad games

346
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,730
Let's go to the hospital

347
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,770
I can't go into town

348
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,340
Let's just stay here, together

349
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,600
People believe that only the good

350
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,970
can fall in love forever

351
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,950
But the people who love

352
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:30,180
intensely are the bad ones

353
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,520
Immoral, weak,

354
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,990
selfish people

355
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,090
the poor, dark souls

356
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,980
I don't have a picture

357
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,490
No picture of Su-jin!

358
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,360
What am I going to do?

359
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,330
It's at the house

360
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,870
What if I forget her face?

361
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,110
What am I going to do?

362
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,810
What am I going to do?

363
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,080
What if I forget her face?

364
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,660
What are we going to do?

365
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,340
I love you

366
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,500
What shitty luck

367
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,510
Let it go

368
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,810
Right, it's nothing

369
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,820
Where are we going?

370
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,560
I'm scared of your driving

371
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,840
You and I have no place to go
and no place to stay

372
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,360
Let's just go anywhere

373
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,020
But you know, we won't work

374
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,500
Are you okay?

375
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,350
Here

376
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,090
Yes, I'm fine

377
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,350
Deserted by family and friends,
I walked out of the hospital alone

378
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,390
And someone was kind enough
to tell me of his death

379
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,850
I left home

380
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,220
And a year has gone by

381
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,590
When the sun rose,
I got up to work on a day to day job

382
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,730
When I got hungry,
I filled up on cheap food

383
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,330
At night I returned to my one room
home and fell asleep, alone

384
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:58,170
Sometimes, memories would
crowd in and stab my heart

385
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,640
Often times I'd wake up at
night and cry like a mad woman

386
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,980
But I believe

387
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,920
I'm more alive now
than I ever was in the past

388
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,730
It's like I'm walking toward
a world tossed by wind

389
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,730
Vitality starts with misery

390
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:31,800
My sadness reminds
me that I'm alive

391
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,710
That one dazzling moment
in my life

392
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,120
The all too short summer,
that year

393
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,090
I didn't have the chance
to say I loved him

394
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,730
Even now, I remember
I can hear his final laugh

395
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,440
Are you ready?

396
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:05,840
Ah yes

397
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,370
Okay, let's take your picture now

398
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,980
Tilt your head a little
to the right, and turn

399
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,550
That's great

400
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,750
Can you put the bag
down from the chair?

401
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,360
Great

402
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:25,990
Is today a special occasion?
Taking a photo by yourself

403
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,970
No, I just have no picture

404
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,940
