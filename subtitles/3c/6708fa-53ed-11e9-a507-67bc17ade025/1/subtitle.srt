Original Story by

00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,350
KIM, Yun-jin

3
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,980
LEE, Jong-won

4
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,900
GYE, Sung-yong

5
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,870
ARDOR

6
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,220
My name is Lee Mi-heun

7
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,660
I married a senior classmate
the year I graduated from college

8
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,290
We had a daughter and spent
eight happy years together

9
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,340
I devoted myself to
my house and family

10
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,940
My husband loved this about me

11
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,000
This was how we planned
to grow old together

12
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,640
Not finished yet?

13
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,280
Let's wrap it up and go to bed

14
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,410
Leaving this unfolded can
bring bad luck tomorrow

15
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,690
December 24th, 2000

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,990
Even on the night she came over

17
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,060
I believed my life

18
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,430
would always be this peaceful

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,490
Hello?

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,770
Yes, it is

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,140
Yes. Go ahead

22
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,740
I bought some beer.
I didn't want to come empty handed

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,850
I thought I should see
Mr. Kim before I leave

24
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,090
I owe him quite a lot

25
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,820
I wanted to stop by earlier

26
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,470
Anyway, we had a party
around here

27
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,140
He's the only one
who didn't show

28
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,470
It's not that I had to
be there

29
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm leaving early tomorrow

30
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,310
Are you going far away?

31
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,450
Incheon

32
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,880
You know what a foster home is?

33
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,960
It's for abandoned children

34
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,130
I'll be living there with them

35
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,770
Sounds like a difficult job

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,170
Nice apartment

37
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,310
How big is it?

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,880
Oh, there's a flag
in the house

39
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,450
My daughter drew it
in pre-school

40
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,260
Something is wrong with it

41
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,450
But what?

42
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,300
Isn't it upside down?

43
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,910
Right, it is!

44
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,770
I knew something was
wrong with it

45
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,350
How silly!
It's drawn upside down

46
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,490
Sweetie

47
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,600
- She doesn't know anything
- What the? What are you doing?

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Can't you stay with me tonight?

49
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,940
Miss Jung, stop it.
Are you drunk?

50
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,740
But I'm really leaving
tomorrow!

51
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,810
Aren't you sad at all?

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,380
Don't do this, get off me

53
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,890
No, I wanna stay with you

54
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,790
Can I sleep here with you?

55
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,260
Sweetie, huh?

56
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,360
Young-woo

57
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,990
Can I sleep here with you?

58
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,730
I haven't slept in days.
Let me stay, sweetie

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,760
Don't you miss me, honey?
Smell me

60
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,170
I know you love me, huh?

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,770
You two, if you need to
talk, go outside

62
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,650
No, Mi-heun, that's not it

63
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,450
Let go

64
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,610
- She's just drunk, that's all
- Let go

65
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,420
You crazy girl

66
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,050
This house

67
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,400
This house not here!
Don't you know that?

68
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,330
Get out! Get out, now!

69
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,710
Sweetie?

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,510
How disgusting

71
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,690
Was it fun fooling around?

72
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,850
Mi-heun

73
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,460
Get out. It's over now.
Stop it

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,330
Let go!

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,470
What the?

76
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,710
Wanna know what
he said to me?

77
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,090
He said I pull him
in all the way

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,190
He said he'll never forget how

79
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,760
I squeeze him tight inside me

80
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,620
We weren't just fooling around

81
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,300
I even got pregnant

82
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,200
Last month,
I had an abortion, and he

83
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,410
Your husband, I mean

84
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,240
He waited outside the operating
room afraid I'd get hurt

85
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,480
He worried I wouldn't wake up
and he'd never see me again!

86
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,290
We loved each other like
more than you could ever dream of

87
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,690
And you want me to leave?

88
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,230
You gotta be kidding

89
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,030
I've got as much right
to be here as you!

90
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,570
You!

91
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,780
I didn't know there was a knife!

92
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,440
- I didn't know, sweetie
- Daddy?

93
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,980
Su-jin! Go back to your room

94
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,450
Mi-heun, open your eyes!

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,920
What the hell did you
hit her with?

96
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,650
Mi-heun! Mi-heun!
Open your eyes!

97
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:21,940
6 months later

98
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,040
She just moved here
from Seoul

99
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,310
and doesn't know her
way around

100
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,390
- So help her adjust
- The countryside's best for kids

101
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,790
We had a bus for them
until last year

102
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,700
- But the school funds have depleted
- I see

103
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,440
- The head wound is fully healed
- There shouldn't be any problems

104
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,570
Nothing will stop your headaches
I'll prescribe a tranquilizer

105
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,650
You know what a drug addict is?

106
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,380
Snap out of it, Mi-heun, please?

107
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,690
Ma'am? We're at Butterfly Ville

108
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,190
This is where you get off

109
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,950
- Get on
- No, you go first

110
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,060
- Oh! It's you!
- Hello

111
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,850
Coming from somewhere?

112
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,720
- You're getting around well
- I went to the school

113
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,320
- Taking off
- Oh, mister! I'm coming on

114
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,850
Honey? I picked Su-jin up
from school

115
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,790
- Daddy, what's this?
- Oh, that's a TV

116
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,460
If you press here, we can
watch TV Cool, huh?

117
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,570
Mommy, look!
Daddy came to school in this!

118
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,730
- You bought a car?
- Oh, you're up

119
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,740
Well, you'll need a car too,
to get to the hospital

120
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,110
You can use the other car.On
weekends, we'll go around in this

121
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,080
- How's that sound, Su-jin?
- Great!

122
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,180
Wonderful?

123
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,400
Hello? Yes, professor,
this is Hyo-kyung

124
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,960
I'm here for good

125
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,300
I handed over the
publishing company to Chang

126
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,670
and took over the
bookstore over from Dae

127
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,750
No, nothing like that

128
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,270
Well, with my wife's health

129
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,880
No, it's nothing serious

130
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,290
She just needs clean
air and rest

131
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,950
Yes, I think so

132
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll come by sometime

133
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,990
Take care, professor.
Bye, sir

134
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,940
Hi, Mommy!

135
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,840
I couldn't quit, no matter what.
Even after getting lung cancer

136
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,710
Rest stop

137
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,830
A bottle of water, please

138
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,790
- Hey!
- Yeah?

139
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,760
You put a novel
under Reference!

140
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,850
Ah-huh

141
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,760
Don't sit around doing nothing.
Go clean the windows

142
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,910
Fuck the nice weather today

143
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,270
Hello?

144
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,050
Are you the owner of this car?

145
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,820
There's something wrong
with it

146
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,490
What's the problem?

147
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm not sure, it just stopped

148
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,090
When's the last time
you put gas in the car?

149
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,690
Pardon?

150
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,200
Didn't even know that
it's out of gas

151
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
15,000 won, please

152
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,770
- What about the gas can?
- Excuse me?

153
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,310
You have to return it, but

154
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,310
You're not from around here,
huh?

155
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,450
- Just visiting?
- No, I live here

156
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,550
- 3000 won more for the can
- What?

157
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,790
You know doc,
but I don't know you

158
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,660
I ain't never seen you
3,000 won!

159
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,080
How's country life so far?

160
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,620
You moved into the house
downhill?

161
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,240
Didn't change
your car plates yet?

162
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,650
I didn't know
you lived uphill

163
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,020
I was surprised to see you
come out of that house

164
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,730
It's famous around here.
Did you know when you went in?

165
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,420
That does it

166
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,620
Seems like your thoughts
are always somewhere else

167
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,890
Are you okay?

168
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,290
Live here for a month, you'll see.
It'll bore you to death

169
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,950
No mall, no theatres

170
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,090
It's an hour from the city

171
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,930
If you sit around doing nothing,
you'll just go crazy

172
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,670
Doesn't the Mrs have a job?

173
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,250
You must have made
a lot of money

174
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,980
You should come out more

175
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,820
People are saying
you're sick

176
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,890
since you don't
come out Rumors!

177
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,160
Oh, I didn't know that

178
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,530
Don't be offended

179
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,200
It's different
from Seoul around here

180
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,170
Anyway, did you meet him?
Up the hill?

181
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,770
When they moved in,
it was worse than here

182
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,310
Wondering why a young,
handsome doctor

183
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,320
would think of coming here

184
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,920
Do you know the bamboo house?
On the way to So-Jung li?

185
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,100
What about it?

186
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,320
I heard something
happened there

187
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,900
The village was turned upside
down last year

188
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,170
A stabbing!

189
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,910
A woman killed her father-in-law
in broad daylight

190
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,320
The son was such a nice man

191
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm telling you.
The wife ruined him completely

192
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,260
She had some nerve

193
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,600
being butt naked with her
lover in broad daylight!

194
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,930
When the old man caught them

195
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,510
she grabbed the sickle from him

196
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,970
and Gives me chills

197
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,570
just thinking about it

198
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,130
Mommy!

199
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,880
- Wasn't it fun today?
- Yeah, science class was best

200
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,310
Mommy! This is Oh Mi-sook.
She sits left, right, up from me

201
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,280
She takes the bus a long way

202
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,050
Can we give her a ride?

203
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,720
Where do you live?

204
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,960
Seven stops on bus #2
My house is right there

205
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,480
- Bye
- See ya

206
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,480
- Take care, Mi-sook
- Bye

207
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,510
You!

208
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,290
I told you

209
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,250
never to get
in a stranger's car!

210
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,190
You brat! Go inside, now!

211
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,830
Wow! She's scary

212
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,600
No, she's not

213
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,230
Greet her politely next time

214
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,970
Okay

215
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,990
Can I play
at Dong-wook's house?

216
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,900
Okay, but be back
before dinner

217
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,730
Yes

218
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,940
- Did you have fun at his house?
- Uh-huh

219
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,210
What are you doing?
Let's eat

220
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,040
Daddy, I already ate

221
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,010
Did you eat, Hon?

222
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,980
Mommy's sick again

223
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,820
- You said you ate, right?
- Ah-huh

224
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,790
- Let's get ready for school tomorrow
- Okay

225
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,400
Honey?

226
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,470
Why are you crying?

227
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,450
What's the matter now?

228
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,990
These people can die doing that.
Why would they do it?

229
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,850
- It's so stupid
- What?

230
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,990
Maybe you should've died

231
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,970
before she came over

232
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,330
Then I might've died
along with you

233
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,140
No, it would've been better
if I died first

234
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,010
Then I wouldn't have found out.
That would've been nice

235
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,920
I can't do it

236
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,920
I can't go back
to the way we were

237
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,120
But why am I here, in this house,
still sleeping next to you?

238
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,000
Life, it feels so empty

239
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,270
so boring that I'll go crazy

240
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,240
Nothing's worth living for

241
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,910
everything's a waste

242
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,240
Just stop it!

243
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,420
How many times
do I have to tell you?

244
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,350
It was just an accident

245
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,590
I apologized over and over!

246
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,460
I gave up everything

247
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,160
to be stuck here
running a tiny bookstore!

248
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,130
For what? I dedicated my life
to you and Su-jin!

249
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,900
Frankly speaking

250
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,640
you always lay around
like a corpse

251
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,940
but did I ever complain
about you?

252
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,080
You're really something,
Mi-heun! Really something

253
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,150
You're not going to sit here
wasting away your life, are you?

254
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,530
The weather's too nice
for that

255
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,330
Would you like some coffee?

256
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,260
Su-jin, turn down the volume!
Mommy's head hurts

257
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,790
Yes, Mommy

258
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,710
Su-jin, let's go

259
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,650
Kim Su-Jin, quickly

260
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,710
- Where are we going?
- Mommy has to go into town

261
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,520
Quick, go to Dong-wook's place

262
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,720
Okay

263
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,390
Let's go

264
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,590
What's the problem?

265
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,750
My head

266
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,620
it hurts so much
I can't do anything

267
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,700
Let me take a look

268
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,940
Breathe

269
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,010
All right

270
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,080
That's fine

271
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,180
- Does it hurt like this often?
- Yes

272
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,990
Since when?

273
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,860
Since last December 24th

274
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,560
Were you hurt?

275
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,740
Did a specialist look at it?

276
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,640
Yes it's nothing serious

277
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,410
- But your head still hurts?
- Yes

278
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,950
Let's check your blood pressure

279
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,380
I was treated by a neuropsychiatrist.
They're vascular headaches

280
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,020
Please just write the prescription.
It's Xanax and Diazepam

281
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,960
Write it, please

282
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,690
All right

283
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,370
Let me just see your
health insurance card

284
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,440
Lee Mi-heun?

285
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,050
I'm Choi In-kyu

286
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,460
What do you do most of the time?

287
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,390
Sleeping?

288
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,300
Your head hurts because
you stay in sleeping

289
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,340
I really have to get going

290
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,500
Uh, yes, that's right

291
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,640
You shouldn't take too much
Diazepam or Barium

292
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,680
Thank you

293
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,110
Ah, Mi-heun?

294
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,590
Want to play a little game
with me?

295
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,860
Having fun is the best
medicine for headaches

296
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,670
For four months,
until summer's end

297
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,200
let's pretend we're lovers

298
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,870
We'll have fun together
and have sex

299
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,870
Sound intriguing?

300
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,320
But there's one rule

301
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,890
If one of us tells the other
"I love you", then it's over

302
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,600
We can never meet again

303
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,960
So I'm not proposing
a relationship, just a game

304
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,710
Why would anyone play
such a game?

305
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,370
Life's full of changes

306
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,940
I don't like being tied down

307
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,980
Or, maybe it's because
I know I'll never lose

308
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,560
And mostly,
because I find you attractive

309
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,740
Do you play this game often?

310
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,340
Not often, but once in a while

311
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,150
Why can't there be love?

312
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,350
Confessions of love, marriage

313
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,620
Typical steps before sex

314
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,930
I hate it, it's like insurance

315
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,230
I'm not a person
who can fall in love

316
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,700
So how about it?

317
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,410
You look bored, too

318
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,220
I know you'll play it.
You have nothing else to do

319
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,470
They have the best mushrooms
here. Let's get some

320
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,540
Mushrooms, please

321
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,110
Your mom's not out
waiting today

322
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,980
Bye

323
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,260
- See you tomorrow, Mi-sook
- Bye

324
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,800
Mommy!

325
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,960
Mommy!

326
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,970
- Mommy!
- You bitch! Come here!

327
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,940
- Mi-sook!
- Mommy!

328
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,000
Come here, quickly

329
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,880
Hold on

330
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:10,010
You bitch! Come here!
You fucking bitch!

331
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:16,290
Hey, get over here!

332
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:22,930
Get back here!

333
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,750
Shocked?

334
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,390
He's my husband

335
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,030
I met him working at a bar

336
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,530
the first customer
I slept with

337
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,800
He'd drink and then beat me

338
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,680
Went in and out of jail

339
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,490
No matter how far

340
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,650
I try to run

341
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,860
he somehow ends up
finding me

342
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,700
Crazy, ain't it?

343
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,290
Looks like it will rain

344
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,170
It's the typhoon coming

345
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,500
there's always one
around now

346
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,580
Mi-heun?

347
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,040
Hi, Mom

348
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,710
I called
because of the typhoon

349
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,780
Is your place okay?

350
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,020
It's okay

351
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,780
If you're fine,
then bye for now

352
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,290
- Wait, Mom?
- What?

353
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,830
- How's Dad?
- The same as always

354
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,200
- I see
- Then, I'll see you soon. Bye

355
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:30,010
Each time you played,
have you always won?

356
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,120
There's no winner
in this game

357
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,320
just a loser

358
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,600
Have you ever lost?

359
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,700
Only once

360
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,130
to the woman who first
proposed it to me

361
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,230
What happened then?

362
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,610
I asked her to live with me
and to get a divorce

363
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,380
Threats, stalking

364
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,780
I turned worse than scum

365
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,030
Who would play such a game?

366
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,260
Bored women?

367
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,830
Ruined women?

368
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:33,380
There are women
who want to be ruined

369
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,250
Like you

370
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,210
Open your eyes

371
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,110
Don't look at it

372
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,770
No, yours is so beautiful
