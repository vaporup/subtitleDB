1
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,333
There will always be the argument ...

2
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,930
Belive me some of them are a lot of fun.

3
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,903
Believe me, some are very funny.

4
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:32,309
Videogames are meant to be played at home.

5
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:36,009
Relaxing on the couch, between friends.

6
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,540
and they are, and that's fun.

7
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,485
But to play for competition ...

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,318
If you want to get the world record...

9
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:46,190
When you want you name written in to history...

10
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:47,420
You have to pay the price.

11
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,656
With this it's like me and the machine

12
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:54,292
Doesn't matter
If you let me down...

13
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:57,462
Or if somone else doesn't come through.

14
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:00,371
I can always go out there, I'm in control.

15
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:17,095
I am glad that it touch on this.
We think it is important.

16
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,724
Everybody, even grandmother ...

17
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:26,222
Games, checkers, cards,
Present and past.

18
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,257
Show me even a nun or a hermit

19
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:29,963
Who has not played cards or checkers.

20
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:38,236
I do not drink. Do not smoke. I do not take drugs.

21
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,676
I play video games

22
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:43,877
Which I think is
a far superior addiction

23
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,111
Than any of the others.

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,421
I wanted to be a hero.

25
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,016
I wanted to be the center of attention.

26
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,120
I wanted the glory. I wanted fame.

27
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:57,596
I wanted the beautiful girls
to say ...

28
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,656
"Hello. I see you are good at Centipede ."

29
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:04,069
I have somone draw a analogy for me once

30
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,072
that I always remember.

31
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,372
The top French pilot in
World War One shot down 24 enemy planes.

32
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:15,148
The top american pilot,
you don't know his name do you?

33
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,980
Nobody knows,
But it is Eddie Rickenbacker.

34
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:21,112
He shot down 26 enemy planes.

35
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:22,917
The best German, the Red Baron.

36
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,890
Everyone knows the Red Baron.

37
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,588
That because he shot down 87 enemy planes.

38
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:31,563
I mean he was the best.

39
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,160
There is a level of difference between people...

40
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,330
And it translates into some games.

41
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:51,784
Donkey Kong, Pac-Man,
Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Defender ...

42
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:55,245
These are the games that caught the public eye.

43
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,188
These are the games
that people cared about.

44
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:02,058
If you want to be knowned  as being world class.

45
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,494
You gonna master one of those games.

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,293
I like its simplicity ...

47
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:08,242
And that's what you will probably hear from lots of people
that like retro games

48
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,059
They like simplicity.

49
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:14,403
Those games challenged
eye and hands coordination...

50
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,966
Mind, body coordination

51
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,875
Fast reaction time and comprehensive thinking

52
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,278
On a level at which modern games don't..

53
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:24,909
Memorisation and pattern recognization is key.

54
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,384
For you to get a single point further

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,411
in an old game from the eightes

56
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,150
Meant a large increase of skills.

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,488
If you do not know the next pattern coming up...

58
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,927
in a tron cycle event
you will lose your life.

59
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,590
Only the die hards,
who for some reason...

60
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:41,897
really loved those games,
continued to stick with them.

61
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,039
What we have done is
that had mayor tie up the entire street...

62
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,669
so the Life magazine
could come to town...

63
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:55,340
and photographed the world's
greatest video game players...

64
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:59,614
Who have been flown in specially for this Life
photographic session.

65
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,053
All these great superstars are coming
from North Carolina ...

66
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,579
California, Canada
And many other places ...

67
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,650
To be photographed
as the official world champions...

68
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,059
On many different games.

69
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:14,532
That was the first time
Two world-class players ...

70
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,662
Went head-to-head for a competion.
Was in Life magazine.

71
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,393
Without a doubt I met players
that were among the best in the world.

72
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,104
And maybe even with say or do whatever they could

73
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,704
To make people believe
They were the best in the world.

74
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,111
Well, at that time ...

75
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:30,309
He had the world record on Centipide.

76
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,840
But also at that time...

77
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:34,046
He had the world record on
Donkey Kong .

78
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,918
But we didn't know that, because someone else...

79
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,890
was invited to Kansas City ...

80
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:40,392
Who because of a claim they had made

81
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:44,386
It was pressumed they were the
Donkey Kong Champion.

82
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,958
Donkey Kong was the one that I first lied about.

83
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,128
He had submitted a bogus score ...

84
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,138
And I finally met him there with Life magazine...

85
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,402
And I finally sat down to play him.

86
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:58,515
We have not been there long and
Bill said "Come on, let's play."

87
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,781
I went in to the arcade
and sat down with Donkey Kong

88
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,784
And beat him to a pulp.

89
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,376
Well, I was better than the best.

90
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,183
I got 200 000 against Bill.

91
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:12,680
Bill got 800 000
on his first man in that game.

92
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:15,422
He shalacked me.

93
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:18,158
Basically he walked away with his head down
and humbled.

94
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,893
And that brought him to the truth.

95
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,197
and from there we worked together.

96
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:26,599
Well, the Bible proverb says

97
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,438
"that iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another"

98
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:31,000
Bill made me a better person...

99
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:37,074
And did so by making me confess.

100
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:40,177
I pointed out to Steve that he is the person he is today

101
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,586
because he came under the wrath of Bill Mitchell.

102
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,949
In front of the 19 top players
in the nation ...

103
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,460
actually, North America ...

104
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,328
He did the highest Donkey Kong score possible

105
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:54,697
And found out that the game
ends on the 22 board.

106
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,259
Since I so called debut on the scene

107
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,766
in Life in the magazine in 1982 ...

108
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,897
There hasn't been anybody who played even close.

109
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,270
When Billy Mitchell
walks in to an arcade...

110
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,468
You know, everything stops.

111
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:37,840
There is electricity around Billy Mitchell.

112
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,435
Everybody want to crowd around him.

113
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,776
Everybody wants to see him.

114
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:43,214
You know, everything about him is perfect.

115
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,150
Billy is just that person.
He wants to represent.

116
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:47,346
If you could hack in to the machine

117
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,787
an programmed it to play it self

118
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,256
you couldn't even programme it that well.

119
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,055
There is a glamour to Billy
There is a specialness to Billy.

120
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,790
He was the first great, great player.

121
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,297
The fact to the matter is...

122
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:03,030
Bill IS THE best classic arcade gamer of our era.

123
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,299
It has actually carved a part of my personality.

124
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,965
It benefits me every day.

125
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,569
A burning passion for never
settle with what I have.

126
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,841
In my buisness, in my family.

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,246
That is what we compete
has done for me.

128
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,306
He is a winner.

129
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:19,613
Billy Mitchell
is absolutely a winner.

130
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:22,622
It's sort of like being in a maze...

131
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,887
But everything you see is actually sauce.

132
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,415
The all-around most seasoning person

133
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,896
In the hot sauce chicken wings industry.
Yeah, for sure, me.

134
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:34,596
There is a production end of it.
It's the preparation.

135
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,295
When there is a sales end of it...

136
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,964
There is not somebody who accomplishes

137
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,802
all those areas like me I never met.

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,001
He sells is hot sauce and himself.

139
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:46,911
Because he's so charming
And a good ambassador ...

140
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,176
For all gaming because he is positive.

141
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:52,979
There is no reason in my opinion why Billy Mitchell
couldn't end up on weenies box someday.

142
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:04,858
The video arcade classic
has finally been conquered.

143
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,162
On July 4, on a
New Hampshire arcade...

144
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,601
34, Billy Mitchell,
Became the first person...

145
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,835
To master Pac-Man
By recording the first ever perfect game.

146
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,706
To get through every board, getting every dot

147
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,514
Every energizer,
Every ghost that applicaple...

148
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:29,522
To reach to the final
256 screen without dying?

149
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,217
It's impressive, in it's on rights.

150
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:34,324
The success was not just because
someone got a perfect pacman score.

151
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,786
But because Billy Mitchell
got a perfect pacman score.

152
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:56,674
If I have allthis good fortune.
If everythings rolling my way.

153
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,276
If all these balls have bounced in my favor ...

154
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,279
There is some poor bastard...

155
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,722
who is getting his screws put to him.

156
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:19,438
When I got laid off.
And had time on my hands

157
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,064
I was thinking: "What can I do? ...

158
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,907
To kinda feel that I have
control of something?."

159
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:28,938
I looked at the website
Twin Galaxies.

160
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:32,110
Well, I typed in Donkey Kong
world record

161
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:36,088
Some scratchy came up
and saw what the score was.

162
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:42,960
It was held by Billy Mitchell
it was like 874 000.

163
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,896
and I go: "yeah, I can beat that."

164
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,663
We're almost there.

165
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,365
I am not the kind of wife that's needy.
That I need him sit with me on the couch every night.

166
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,464
I don't need that.

167
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,873
What I need is himbeing in the house
helping me with the kids

168
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,537
or I need him being with the kids.

169
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,478
So he would want to come out here to play

170
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,505
And that would drive me crazy.
He is definitely OCD

171
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,017
When he is obsessed with something...

172
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,747
He is so focused and I have to be like "Hello!"

173
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,984
So then I just said:
"You will have to it at night."

174
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,463
Is level 2 easy?

175
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,863
Yes, it's pretty easy.

176
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,004
I've dreamed of being a musican for a living.

177
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,269
That what's my dream was.

178
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,937
It was brought back to me, he was smart...

179
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,707
...he was an athlete, he was talented...

180
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:37,648
and, for whatever reason,
he could never get those to fit.

181
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,193
Steve was one of the original starving grunge bands

182
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,025
Here in Seattle,
just starving.

183
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,089
The only people who came to see him was us.

184
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,861
With his music it's almost like...

185
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,131
he didn't want people to know he was doing it.

186
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,400
He is a total paradox.

187
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,245
He has maybe a little social hangups here and there, that...

188
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,278
that haven't allowed him to be as succesful

189
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,716
in one end as in other ends.

190
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:18,413
They got to the state finals,
and Steve couldn't pitch.

191
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,483
I have probably seen Steve with tears in his eyes

192
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:21,823
More than any other guy I know...

193
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,557
becuase of the frustration that build in him.

194
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,030
and half the time it was on the pitching ground.

195
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,397
He had hurt his arm.
I had pitched him too much.

196
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,203
I was the manager of the team.

197
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:36,735
It was a chance for him to shine in front of thousands of people.

198
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:39,768
That killed him that he couldn't pitch,

199
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,508
Because it is that competitiveness in him.

200
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:57,730
I envisioned him as
an engineer at Boeing.

201
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:02,325
My dad worked for Boeing
30 some years ...

202
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,462
And the plan was to go to Boeing
and be a "lifer".

203
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,995
As they call them.

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,439
But things didn't work out.

205
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:12,548
I don't know if he told you he was laid off
the day we bought our house, yeah.

206
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,182
He never have quite reached that pennacle.

207
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,750
He never quite in any of his endevours

208
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,889
Was regaled as the number one guy.

209
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,092
That was better then the rest.

210
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,964
And was on top of the mountain.

211
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,129
Oh, has just come up short in a lot of things in his life

212
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,901
And just I think, you know ...

213
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,908
nobody wants to do that all the time.

214
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,650
It has my highest score saved up there, since last.

215
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,362
What plunged me in to competitive gaming

216
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,839
never to come out, was Donkey Kong.

217
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:17,240
Donkey Kong .
Well that was THE first ever Mario game.

218
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,369
The whole thing is a construction sight.

219
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,403
There are all these girders and elevators with ladders.

220
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,176
Going from one girder to the next.

221
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,777
The whole goal the whole time is to get passed the obstacle

222
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:30,653
that Kong is throwing at you.
And get the girl.

223
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,488
Donkey Kong is, without question,
is the hardest game.

224
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,427
it's ridocolsy diffucult on the first screen.

225
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,731
Donkey Kong is relasing these barrels.

226
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,132
You got to jump over the barrels.

227
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,328
You got to duck to the barrels.

228
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:46,998
You can grab a hammer,
and hammer the barrels.

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,702
Well, the secret about the barrel board

230
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,040
is that you can actually control the barrels.

231
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,807
It's just above this ladder...

232
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:56,178
Turn a quick left then a hard right.

233
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,911
See how it went down, it went down again.

234
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,215
We got to get passed all the barrels,

235
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,243
get up the ladder.

236
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,256
and as soon as you get to her

237
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,918
Donkey Kong takes her away
to the next level.

238
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:10,862
The average Donkey Kong game
does not last a minute.

239
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,694
It's absolute brutality.

240
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,165
Each of the 18 elveator boards

241
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:17,896
...represents the greatest challenge
in video game playing.

242
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,905
The average gamer of Donkey Kong...

243
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,375
Will never get passed the third elevator stage.

244
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,003
The slighest touch from one of these
springs kills you.

245
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,843
There is no hammer for them,
there is no way to defeat them.

246
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,281
All you can do is avoid them. That's it.

247
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,148
The secret to the third elevators

248
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:36,917
is knowing which spring to go on.

249
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,584
And knowing which spring to move up the ladder on.

250
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,093
And recognizing when to you must retreat.

251
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:45,393
If you don't time just exactly right you will die.

252
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:49,026
It boils down to hardcore skill.

253
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,299
Because it is lined up with the dashed line.

254
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,028
So I go on that one,

255
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:55,899
I now I'm waiting for one to line up with the sawed line.

256
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,408
I have said that from the day I met Steve

257
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,312
that his talent is in his hands.

258
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:04,646
he pitched. He played basketball.

259
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,242
He is a fenomal drawer.

260
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,048
And if you ever seen pictures of his drawings...

261
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,282
But he is very artistic.

262
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:14,123
It's operating on some subconcious level
with him, I think.

263
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,891
When we were driving to Kansas
or whatever family trip.

264
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,763
He would sit there for over a 100 miles
with bang his head

265
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,596
Four-four times against the back of the seat.

266
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:27,767
Five, six, seven, eight, nine ...

267
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,173
Well I have often thought that maybe he is a little autistic.

268
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,541
It's just this obsessive compulsive...

269
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,842
Becuase he would get something on his mind.

270
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,439
He wanted to play drums

271
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,416
I do not know where he got that idea.

272
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,885
This is Dereks drum set.

273
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,284
And is's not too bad.

274
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:47,486
It's does the trick.

275
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:30,264
The actual gameplay involves
so much eye, hand coordination,

276
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,600
mind and body coordination

277
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,435
Fast reaction time
and comprehensive thinking.

278
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,271
And such a high level of
precise execution

279
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,537
so much skill...

280
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,945
involve so much learning

281
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:52,113
you have to have deep comprehensive intelligence.

282
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,591
For years and years it was believed...

283
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,691
that Billys record of 874 000 in 1982

284
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,100
was really the highest score anyone would ever get.

285
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:06,400
In fact, some of us have played this game...

286
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,703
Every day, or week,
or every month since then

287
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:10,003
and no one has gotten even close to that.

288
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,034
No one across that big length of time

289
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,106
will never be able to beat his world record.

290
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,022
Derek, look. You are on TV.

291
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,126
Do you see all? Say Hi.

292
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,568
No.

293
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,265
I was having the game of my life

294
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:45,801
I think 600 000,
and I haven't died yet.

295
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,905
And I started hearing som noises

296
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,973
coming downstairs screaming...

297
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,775
It's all on tape.

298
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,380
That's the tape I had to send in to Twin Galaxies.

299
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,486
Everything in all about...

300
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,518
by practising transcendental meditation...

301
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,154
And I like to see that mirriored

302
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:41,291
In the way I apply myself to the videogame world.

303
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,268
that I seek to find champions

304
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,429
And watch them grow and become even greater...

305
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:49,271
as they begin to unfold more and more
of their full potential.

306
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:50,935
Which is what we do when we do TM!

307
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:55,936
If Walter, through all
these years since 1982 ...

308
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,644
Would not have continued
as a labour of love,

309
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:03,104
then there would be no central orginaztion for
competetive video game playing.

310
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:07,087
Why do we do it?
Because we love this.

311
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,117
Because we enjoy this.
We are fascinated by this.

312
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,685
it is just something in our genes,

313
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,927
That my group, Twin Galaxies,
raise the bander high to do this

314
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:17,743
And move orginized video game playing in to the future.

315
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,334
Walter opened the door...

316
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,675
But at the very least national competetive gaming.

317
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,645
We just happened to call it Twin Galaxies.

318
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,910
The name burst in to my brain.

319
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,008
Walter Day didn't do that by accident

320
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:35,851
He didn't get lucky.
He created his own empire.

321
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,822
Joining us again for videogame news update,

322
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:38,846
I am Walter Day ...

323
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:40,916
At the Twin Galaxies international score board.

324
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,257
Being the warying thing being the score keeper

325
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,285
Because I really get picked on you know.

326
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,458
Because I am the man, you know?
I am a police officer.

327
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,526
Video games need a guy like Bush who will say:

328
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,036
"Look, this is the way we're going to do it"

329
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:55,472
"This is the rule,
and if you don't like it, tough".

330
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,873
You got to have that.

331
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,707
If you didn't have it in football,
Who would win?

332
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,736
How do you declare a champion
unless there are rules?

333
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,476
and if you break em, you lose.

334
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:20,959
The best features about him is also his biggest downfall.

335
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,833
People can just run over him beacuse he is so nice.

336
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,033
Twin Galaxies survives becuase people like Walter ...

337
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:32,009
Like Robert.
People like me...

338
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:36,811
Who participate all for a passion
of competitive gaming.

339
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,077
Nobody draws a paycheck.

340
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,177
I do not see details.
I see big pictures, you know?

341
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,314
I see the big concept
that lies behind the whole issue

342
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:45,448
and then I tweak that.

343
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,686
I can't do details and details.

344
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,559
Twin Galaxies needs a staff of detail orientated people

345
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,620
like Robert.

346
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,696
Anything that is unexplanable,
out of the ordinary ...

347
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,066
We have to keep our eyes out for it.

348
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,798
that is not to say we are infallible.

349
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,798
When I have to watch that pile of eight tapes over there

350
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:06,676
For Dwayne Richards two days Nibble performance...

351
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:08,680
that is 48 staright hours of
paying attention...

352
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,545
To make sure that he is doing everthing correctly.

353
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,374
Package from the Metroid team in Brazil ...

354
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,943
Some Atari 2600 records.

355
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,249
I got to watch that.

356
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,654
These things take time to verify.

357
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,625
And I have to look at every single one of these.

358
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,388
like I showed you over here.

359
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:25,522
This is just 200 video tapes. That's nothing.

360
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,589
This is the real stuff that I have to do.

361
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:31,899
I see world records set in my room
just about every single day.

362
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,651
Some people think a world record is
what is set at the olympics

363
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,798
Or at the end of a baseball season.

364
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:40,300
I see this every single day.
An not just sometimes once.

365
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,335
It's exciting.

366
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,422
Yes, almost.

367
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,120
That's actually good.

368
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,657
Derek, stop it. No.

369
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,601
Stop playing  Donkey Kong .

370
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,798
-- Is Derek?
-- Stop playing  Donkey Kong .

371
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,672
I'm gonna throw away you're rest if you don't stop it.

372
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,005
Somebody has acchomplished something...

373
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:12,203
That not only I can't do ...

374
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:14,075
But nobody else has done before...

375
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,842
And it's exciting
to see that first hand.

376
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,145
That's how you play Donkey Kong .

377
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:24,845
Welcome back.

378
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,881
Bill Gates is not necessarily
The most famous ...

379
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:28,052
In Redmond tonight.

380
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,062
Coming up, you're going to meet
the man who is at the top of his game

381
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,996
A Donkey Kong world record.

382
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:36,763
He was a big celebrity there for a bit in Seattle.

383
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:44,013
I just thought it would be a good achivment.
I didn't think it would blow up to be a big story.

384
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,436
I'm like: "Oh, my God!".

385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,007
Although it was this silly video game thing

386
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:55,111
It's not many of us who has a buddy

387
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:58,385
Who is the best in the world at something.

388
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,858
That was a godsend to him that lasted a couple of years.

389
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,339
We are at
Kamakin Junior High...

390
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,577
And this is the seventh and eight grade science classroom

391
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,879
This is my first year of teaching...

392
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:29,547
And has been a challenge,
But very enjoyable so far.

393
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:40,031
I went to the city university...

394
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,795
Which had a program for one year master's degree ...

395
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,326
And so we roughed it out for a year.

396
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:49,137
And here I am today, so it finally worked out.

397
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,904
It's fun and he's not making it so, like:

398
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:55,137
"This is is science. This is boring."

399
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,613
he talk to us about stuff thats not just

400
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:58,742
like homework and schoolwork

401
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,513
Well, here is...

402
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:06,254
My history with Donkey Kong
Is that I have the world record.

403
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,749
Well, I did not know
it was a world record.

404
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:13,287
it's for Donkey Kong? Oh my...

405
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:15,300
There ... It's ...

406
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:16,892
All science teachers
here are wierd.

407
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,869
Steve deserves a lot of credit for that...

408
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,235
because he also

409
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,207
also broke the record
of Donkey Kong Jr.

410
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,836
He took two of Billys titles

411
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:28,004
right away from him.

412
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,481
I don't mean to sound,
you know, crude or anything.

413
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,950
Bu he did, he did,
Officially, he did.

414
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,909
He was the last world record that Bill ever had.

415
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,210
That was the last one to go.

416
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,486
He had five records
in 1985 ...

417
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:44,292
He had the Donkey Kong and then
Steve Wiebe took it away.

418
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,025
It is far more difficult when you are on top

419
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,830
anyone who's on top, to stay on top.

420
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,359
Billy has a lot of things up his sleeves.

421
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:55,737
He likes to keep quiet
in situations like that.

422
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,868
So you know somebody may have taken him down now

423
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,436
but behind closed doors
Billy has something planned.

424
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,469
That's Billy Mitchell.

425
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:04,641
In my phone it says:
"Never surrender."

426
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,844
If someone beat his record ...

427
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,149
He have a plan to beat it back.

428
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:10,280
I am sure.

429
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,187
The worst thing that could happen ...

430
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:16,558
To give someone the credibility of a score ...

431
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:19,325
That doesn't deserve it.

432
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:22,891
But even far worse than that would be to deny somebody

433
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,393
the credibility when they deserved it.

434
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,633
If I am not there, I don't know.

435
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,039
Get this.

436
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:32,339
I came home one day
And there was two people in my garage...

437
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:35,813
looking at my machine.

438
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:36,837
They wanted ...

439
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,839
They were spies.

440
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:43,551
It was a Saturday in July or August.

441
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:45,887
My mom was here.
and I was getting ready to go to work.

442
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:47,414
These guys knocked on the door...

443
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,859
And I don't think I knew they were going to be here at all.

444
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,523
They said who they were ...

445
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:54,225
And they wanted to come in to look at the machine.

446
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,824
I knew I had to leave and I said ...

447
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,860
"I'm not comfortble in letting you do that"

448
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,964
"I have to go to work.
My mom is here."

449
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,872
Steve is going to be home shortly.

450
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:06,002
You just need to wait.

451
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:08,911
To find out at an ultra elite level

452
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,574
wheter or not a score is good.

453
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,050
Sometimes we have no choice to call in the pros.

454
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,212
Brian Kuh,
the Donkey Kong player

455
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:16,653
Went to Steves place.

456
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:17,780
Bill asked me to do it.

457
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,518
But I had no time to do, so Brian did it.

458
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,959
I went there with one of the most respected player of all time,

459
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,360
Perry Rodgers to back him up.

460
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,762
Billy Mitchell and Twin Galaxies
asked me to

461
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,367
because I live in the area near him ...

462
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,130
to go investigate in it.

463
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,228
So we went out to his house.

464
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,262
I mean I'm the home owner. It is my house.

465
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,171
I am the wife of the Donkey Kong guy.

466
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,732
They should have respected my wishes...

467
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:40,574
And left my mom alone
and not come in, but they didn't.

468
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,706
They took apart his Donkey Kong machine

469
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:45,444
And started taking pictures of everything.

470
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:46,781
Trying looking for an excuse...

471
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:48,548
to try invalidate a score.

472
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:51,420
They saw this box

473
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,222
That has Roy Shildt return adress on it.

474
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,125
They looked over and they said

475
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,153
Roy Shildt?
Why is that name on there?".

476
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:02,964
Roy Shildt is the type of gamer
that would like nothing more

477
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,902
than to see Twin Galaxies get an egg on it's face.

478
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:14,812
I want you to remember
that no punk bastard ever

479
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:18,749
Got a narly piece of poon tang.

480
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:21,480
By being sensitive and considerate.

481
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,613
He calls himself Mr. Awsome.

482
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:26,283
He drives the Awsome mobile to fame and fortune...

483
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,088
As it says on its website.

484
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:31,027
He is jealous of Billy
Because Billy get attention from beautiful

485
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,655
women wherever he goes.

486
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,962
Basically, he wants to be like Billy.

487
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,595
I have seen the world champion
cherry spitter on the Tonight Show

488
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:40,605
with Jay Leno.

489
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,072
And if that guy should be on the Tonight Show

490
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,440
At least I could
be a celebrity for a day.

491
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,707
I did not even get that.
I did not receive recognition.

492
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:49,646
I didn't get to be on any television show.

493
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,649
It's like I was a ghost...

494
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:53,082
And I just don't feel it's right.

495
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,211
I just want
a little recognition.

496
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:57,119
not neccecarly to become a celebrity.

497
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,713
Hey, Billy. How you doin'?

498
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,282
- How are you?

499
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,691
I'm perfect. Haven't you read?

500
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:05,629
Twin Galaxies does a lot to
promote Billy.

501
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:08,189
It is very much to Twin Galaxies advantage

502
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,633
And very much to the whole gaming hobby advantage

503
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,068
for Billy to become a star.

504
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:15,096
When Walter Day
published that book in -97 ...

505
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,438
With all those agredous errors in there

506
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,909
Bill Mitchell saw it.

507
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:20,935
He knew they were wrong.
He knew they were mistakes.

508
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,038
But he tried to pretend that they were real ...

509
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,106
To take my Missile Command
score down.

510
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,177
Roy and I met California Extreme

511
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,553
And I knew that I had the capabality

512
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,921
to beat Billy in Donkey Kong .

513
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,391
Steve Wiebe is the one who unlocked the

514
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:35,518
secrets of Donkey Kong.

515
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,425
To figure out how to get a million points.

516
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:40,431
He offered to buy me a board, a Donkey Kong board...

517
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:42,228
because mine had been broken.

518
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,132
I did not have the money.

519
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,070
So it was a mutual beneficial relationship .

520
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,005
He would buy me a board.

521
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,009
I would have the opportunity
to beat Billys record.

522
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,534
And at the same time I would take Billy down.

523
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:57,014
And seek Roys revenge on Billy.

524
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:00,382
And it seemed good at the time, you know?

525
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,284
Unknowing to me I didn't know the history

526
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:05,882
beetween the, bad blood, Roy and Billy.

527
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:09,451
To attempt something like this for the sole purpose of

528
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:12,759
taking down one of Bills scores

529
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:14,823
Is like... a slap in the face.

530
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,561
They would say I somehow monkeyed with the board,
or something...

531
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,243
But wouldn't have any evidence.

532
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:20,362
They looked at the board,

533
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,032
they took pictures of the board.

534
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,769
and they couldn't find anything wrong with it.

535
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,937
The right gummy substance

536
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:29,379
On the right chip, out of all these chips.

537
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:33,510
On the right spot
On the right board

538
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:38,282
I mean I have to say
there is a conspiracy here.

539
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,884
Any board that's worked on,
could have a problem.

540
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:45,158
To find out that this gamer potentially

541
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:50,106
Have a fraudlent score has upset Billys
master plan for what he wants to do.

542
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:52,126
I mean when you come home and see
two guys in your garage

543
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,262
And you know why, and you have learned why

544
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,363
they are there, you gotta stop

545
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,466
From a guy like Bill Mitchell,
I mean, you know...

546
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,704
Who has done crazy thing after crazy thing

547
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:01,975
After next crazy thing, you know?

548
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,710
Billy Mitchell
was one of the evaluators ...

549
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,876
Which seems a little strange.

550
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:09,876
That the guy whose records Steve
is competing against

551
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:13,448
is deciding whether or not Steves record are valid.

552
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:17,258
Even if that board is a completely legimate board

553
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:19,559
Roy taint on it is too strong.

554
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,998
"Roy is liar, Roy is a cheater"

555
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:24,264
"Roy Shildt is full of crap, Roy is out to get me"

556
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,135
"He's crazy, blah, blah, blah, blah."

557
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:29,800
Well, he has threatned Bill Mitchell physically.

558
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:34,642
Hey, in fact, he has threated Bill Mitchells life.

559
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,978
No, I did not. I did not. I did not.

560
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:42,476
He threatened his own life to make it look like me...

561
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,716
For...
To gain leverage...

562
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,815
With the other...
The other people, I don't know.

563
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:48,553
He figured

564
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,187
He knows that my Missile Command score
is genuine.

565
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,289
No matter what I say,
It draws controversy.

566
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,163
Sort of like the abortion issue.

567
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,601
If you're for it, you are a son of a gun.

568
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:00,571
If you are against it,
you are a son of a gun.

569
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:04,268
Eh, I am not God,
I don't have all the answers.

570
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,709
So I have to be careful how I share my opinion.

571
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,714
Roy was trying to help me out...

572
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:12,842
And I accepted his offer.

573
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:15,011
I just, you know ... It was just too bad...

574
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,850
That association with him...

575
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:19,049
I never thought that would hurt me.

576
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:22,219
We could not accept
a pretender board so to speak.

577
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,959
So we could not
accept the score.

578
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:33,059
I would encouarge Steve just to leave that board behind

579
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:37,633
Leave Roy behind and only play
on other Donkey Kong machines...

580
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,769
like the one at funspot, for example.

581
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,574
To me most important is you travel to a sanction

582
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:43,638
location like funspot

583
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,946
Eh, that makes it official.

584
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:51,081
If tomorrow Tiger Woods goes
and golfs a 59, big deal.

585
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,853
If he does that in Augusta
that's where it counts.

586
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:58,090
He has never really certed himself in a way

587
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,360
that I think he should.

588
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,993
It's been just disappointed so many times

589
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,230
You kinda just throws you're hands up and go

590
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,262
"Well, let's move on to the next thing."

591
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,604
Everything would have fell right in to place

592
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:14,544
But he forgot about one thing...

593
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:18,173
Convincing Steve Wiebe not to be a chump.

594
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,180
I didn't think twice about sending them to back east.

595
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:27,783
I was like: "Absolutley go kick some ass."

596
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:36,763
Hello. My name is Justine Barker
And I am Miss Winnipesaukee.

597
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,769
Welcome to the seventh annual tournament ...

598
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,897
Museum of Classic Games
Funspot in the USA.

599
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,572
Funspot has become the best
recognized place world wide

600
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:51,343
For those who want to set
a world record on a classic game.

601
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,048
Funspot is the Mecca
Of the classic arcade games.

602
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:04,493
That place is awsome.

603
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:07,222
Funspot is the primere place...

604
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:10,462
Where media comes to mix with the superstars.

605
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:13,665
You don't see a lot of DDG...

606
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,730
Which is rotten gorgeuos if you don't know, Girls...

607
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,435
Who are playing the games.

608
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:21,275
The worlds best players of classic games.

609
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:23,247
Are coming to do what they do best.

610
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:25,248
Play well.

611
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,161
Very recently, just a few months back...

612
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,496
I turned 30 and I retired...

613
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,297
And I moved here to New Hampshire.

614
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:46,429
I live right close to Funspot.

615
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,405
I play games at funspot every day now.

616
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,101
When I have 10 pieces of bacon

617
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:51,870
I'm gonna have four hardboiled eggs.

618
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,468
I'm going to have three pancakes...

619
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,172
And hopefully to play some great games.

620
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,771
Here, I am in my garage.

621
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:58,806
We're gonna give Billy Mitchell a call...

622
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,217
see if he's up to a challenge at Funspot.

623
00:34:02,254 --> 00:34:04,347
Let's go ahead and dial him up.

624
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,481
Hi. You've reached Bill Mitchell.

625
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:07,252
Sorry I'm unable to take your call.

626
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,452
Please leave your name and phone number...

627
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,087
And I cal you back as soon as possible.
Thanks.

628
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:14,924
I got a phone message.

629
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:19,837
Hello, Billy. This is Steve Wiebe.

630
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,133
Just calling to see how you are doing.

631
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,766
I'm hoping everthings OK with you.

632
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,675
I'm just seeing what your plans are for Funspot.

633
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:29,771
Walter Day invited me out there.

634
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,042
I wondered if it be cool if we could

635
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:34,279
maybe, kinda, have a friendly competion.

636
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:40,718
I help a lot of people
who wants to go to contest.

637
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:43,319
When I look at diffrent people who are my favorites.

638
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:46,694
Who'd I wanna help, she is at the top of the list.

639
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:50,890
-- Surprise.
-- Oh, my god.

640
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,735
And at the right age of 80,
She's gonna go to Funspot...

641
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,850
And she's going to set a world record on Q'bert

642
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,164
Okay.

643
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,437
-- That's the challenge.
-- Oh, right.

644
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:00,637
-- Is it agreed?
-- Yeah.

645
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,873
All right.

646
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,656
We have a Donkey Kong machine here...

647
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:17,423
that Funspot purchased...

648
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,521
And it may be a little tougher to play here.

649
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,725
People complain about getting too many wild barrels.

650
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,427
Although it is a totally a random element

651
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,028
Eh, if you're going to set a score you come to Funspot

652
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:28,938
And set it on their Donkey Kong that everybody knows about.

653
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,838
They won't give me my record

654
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,675
So they have urged me to come out and do it live.

655
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:37,443
I think it is cooler to do it live to so...

656
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,677
I'm pretty amped up about Donkey Kong.

657
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:42,846
Because I am a serious contender on
Donkey Kong .

658
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,479
I have been trying to beat the score

659
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:47,320
that Billy Mitchell got back in 1982.

660
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,123
Nicole, she was stressing me about

661
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:54,495
being home this weekend with the kids,
without me.

662
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:55,965
She's pretty sick of the Donkey Kong thing.

663
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,059
It doesn't seem to die.

664
00:35:58,103 --> 00:35:59,297
This is a big weekend,
I really hope...

665
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,634
that this fellow shows up

666
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,435
Because he like to tell you that

667
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,499
he is the Donkey Kong champion.

668
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,409
And, um, the fact to the matter is

669
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:10,209
All of us have not seen him play Donkey Kong.

670
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:12,375
Nobody really noticed me at first, I was kinda looking

671
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:16,217
who I'd pay

672
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:19,018
the money to get in the tournament.

673
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:21,082
I recognized Robert Murzack.

674
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:23,856
He's got 30 second away from dying.

675
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:27,422
So I pretty much walked over to the
Donkey Kong machine.

676
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:29,296
Well, we might have a good story.

677
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,165
It looks like the mysterious player...

678
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:32,897
On the west coast,
Steve Wiebe are here ...

679
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,370
Eh, playing Donkey Kong  .

680
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:36,397
So maybe I'll stop watching the tournament

681
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,204
And we'll go over to see him.

682
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:41,811
-- Hello, Walter.
-- You did it man.

683
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,444
Yes.

684
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,224
No, I do not think so.

685
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:00,524
A week or a few days ago.

686
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,032
Steve, apparently as I understand...

687
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,055
Is here right now...

688
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:05,399
To prove to everyone that he gets
what it takes.

689
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:09,498
But you know with Donkey Kong, it's a little random.

690
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:14,103
You could, um, bad luck
With the barrels.

691
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:15,578
With the fireballs.

692
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,080
with the transport or elevators.

693
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,379
Because that's a tough machine.

694
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,580
People think that
the machine is possessed.

695
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,383
Even Bill thinks it's possessed.

696
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:27,755
But, um, if Steve pulls 850 000 or hisgher...

697
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,953
On this machine,
that's a good score.

698
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,222
Billy Mitchell is the champion.

699
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:37,791
I guess that makes me the prodigy.

700
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:40,737
So we got the prodigy against the newcomer.

701
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,332
You can make a comparison
between an athletic event and

702
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,602
With this, because this is, you know ...

703
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,667
This is four days of alertness

704
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,179
And paying attention and, um, you know ...

705
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:51,614
Not as hard as doing a
decathlon or a triathlon ...

706
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:52,911
But still very, very hard.

707
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,321
Would you like to respond?

708
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,329
It's Funspot.

709
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:06,625
Hello?

710
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:08,325
Hello, Brian. How are you doing?

711
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,663
Steve Wiebe walked in...

712
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,862
so I've been over at the Donkey Kong the whole time.

713
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:13,302
Eh, what do you think?

714
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:15,033
Eh, I gonna be, um, you know, playing...

715
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:16,904
Over Steve Wiebes shoulder.

716
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,499
All right. I talk to you later.

717
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:19,532
-- Ok.
-- bye.

718
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:20,805
Bye.

719
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,980
Brian Kuh came over.
It is one of the guys that

720
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:34,685
came to my house that fateful afternoon...

721
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,626
To check out my machine.

722
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:40,995
We are about to pass 520 000
On one man.

723
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,329
So we really have, ah...

724
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:46,167
A memorable game here
at the Funspot tournament.

725
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,466
Maybe I'll skip dinner and

726
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:48,494
and squeeze in a game.

727
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,474
And come back with a score on there.

728
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:53,569
-- Enter Brian.
-- Yes.

729
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,618
That ape is very, very cunning ...

730
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,145
And he will do what he needs to, to stop you.

731
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:07,521
I could'nt get up fast enough and it got me on the left.

732
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,861
I scored 229 000 points.

733
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,528
Pretty weak game, considering
I have played a few already.

734
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,539
A little bit half of what Steve scored

735
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:22,835
And Steve is up again.

736
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,210
Okay. You'd said you start with Qbert .

737
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:38,950
You dedicated time to

738
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,083
You said you give up some of you other vices ...

739
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,353
In order to practise.

740
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:44,088
We're not gonna lose,
were not gonna be dissappointed.

741
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,117
We are going there to win.

742
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:48,360
But I have one project
One thing far more important.

743
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:51,994
What I need you to deliver is this

744
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,864
What is this?

745
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,772
It is the score they wanted to see for a long time and

746
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,004
I've held it far too long.

747
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,875
You give it to Robert or Walter.

748
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,778
You can lose your luggage,
But don't lose the tape.

749
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,279
I'm doing it just for the fun of it.

750
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,685
When I do an actual score I do it in person.

751
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:11,916
He's a very devious person

752
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:15,949
He works things out to his ends very well.

753
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,853
We are really seeing a great game here.

754
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:23,230
Hey, almost ... Eh, Steve
Almost lost a man right there...

755
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,256
At the end of that court.

756
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,894
He got a lucky break

757
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:29,270
The randomness went the opposite way
that it usally goes.

758
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,275
And, eh, Steve is still going here.

759
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,804
Steve Wiebe is on his second man.

760
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:05,342
He's at 696 000.

761
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,275
-- Who is this?
-- What? This is Steve Wiebe.

762
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:12,577
-- I won't bother you any more.
-- No problem.

763
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:13,914
-- I wanted to say welcome.
-- Yes.

764
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:15,612
-- Yes, equally.
-- Agreed.

765
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,615
He could beat if he

766
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,524
he got to have a really good game.

767
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:26,219
I don't think he knows the tricks that Billy knows.

768
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:29,028
But I hear he is really good at the
escalators stage.

769
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:36,329
Well, right now Steve Wiebe has
870 000 points ...

770
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:38,137
On an active game of Donkey Kong.

771
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:40,406
Hey, if clears a few more boards

772
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:42,709
he's gonna have a shot at getting to the kill screen.

773
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:43,839
As far as I know ...

774
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,610
No one has ever acheived the kill screen

775
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,175
On the Donkey Kong machine at Funspot.

776
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:52,519
Numerous classic games
all have something in common.

777
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,752
They have an end to the game play.

778
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,488
There is not quite enough memory
For the final board.

779
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,689
It is called the "kill screen"
Because, basically ...

780
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:00,993
There is no way to finish the level.

781
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:05,435
At som sort of random data or code
inside the program

782
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:07,937
Ends up getting used
for what you see on the screen.

783
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:11,635
Donkey Kong is really strange,
it actually lets you play

784
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:15,444
the kill screen level for
about five seconds or so.

785
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,469
Everything looks normal ...

786
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:19,278
And, suddenly, Mario jumps and dies on you.

787
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:24,278
The people who could get, besides myself,

788
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:28,486
That have been seen getting to the end
of Donkey Kong...

789
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:33,930
Gee, now that I think about it
I don't think anybody has.

790
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:58,313
If anybody want to see there

791
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:00,620
is a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up.

792
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:03,149
There is a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up.

793
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,025
If anybody wants to watch.

794
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,529
You got to be able to perform
in the show ...

795
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:08,122
with someone who is a contender.

796
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,327
Staring straight at you, staring at the game.

797
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:12,131
Possible even playing mind games with you.

798
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,535
I mean, it's part of being a champion.

799
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,198
You have to overcome it.

800
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,367
There is a potential Donkey Kong
Kill Screen if you wanna watch.

801
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,572
I can tell you he's not on my side.

802
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:24,911
He is a disciple of Billy.

803
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:27,509
He's gonna have to play it perfectly.

804
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:29,679
He is at the hardest part at Donkey Kong.

805
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,587
And, um, you know,
It's not gonna be any easier.

806
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,488
So we may have an exciting moment here.

807
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:37,153
Or, you know, the pressure
might get to him.

808
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:39,129
One of those random element might happen.

809
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,858
Sounds like he just cleared another board.

810
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:44,095
Or we could have a wild barrel.
Or some aggressive fireball.

811
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,569
I thought I was gonna be the first Funspot kill screen.

812
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:49,038
And the I had three fireballs trapped me.

813
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,337
I had the hammer in my hand, they still got me.

814
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,605
So anything can happen at Donkey Kong.

815
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:56,204
So for someone else to beat
me to the kill screen would be a let down.

816
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,010
But let's see what happens.

817
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,949
Maybe he'll crack under the pressure...

818
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:02,214
And maybe I'll get my chance to do it first.

819
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,949
There is a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up

820
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:08,356
If anybody wants to see it.

821
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:10,053
Hey, Todd, if you are interested ...

822
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,062
There is a might be a Donkey Kong
kill screen...

823
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,495
In a couple of minutes.

824
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:21,601
I think the energy kind a hit me,

825
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,937
I feeling kind a like a zombie.

826
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,875
In the middle of the game.

827
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,810
But towards the end, I got...

828
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:30,405
A little bit of a natural rush going from the crowd.

829
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,143
And the excitment.

830
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:33,810
So that kind a boosted me

831
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:36,945
And put me over the top,
to complete the game.

832
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,556
The kill screen kicked in.

833
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:51,424
This is the highest
Donkey Kong score done in public.

834
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:53,528
Hey, Walter Day stated that this

835
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,732
was the highest score ever done

836
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:57,798
and this is the first kill screen achieved

837
00:44:57,842 --> 00:45:00,333
On Funspots machine.

838
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,312
Steve Wiebe has become
the third person

839
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,780
to reach a Donkey Kong kill screen.

840
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:10,448
This is completly hard verification.

841
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:11,614
You know what I mean?

842
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,590
There is nothing stronger than having it be done

843
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:14,989
in front of a crowd.

844
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:17,290
The process it's stands for itself.

845
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,660
He did in front of all of us, and this solves any kind of

846
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,562
doubt that there have ever been.

847
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:27,401
Now you will get all the praise
you deserve

848
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:29,633
and that's just the way it is.

849
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,309
And guess there was kinda like an impron to

850
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,745
the press conferance

851
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,408
After the score happened.

852
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,610
There were cameras during the game.

853
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:41,982
There were cameras on Steve Wiebe.

854
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:45,045
There were cameras on the crowd
looking at Steve Wiebe.

855
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,254
There were a lot of other witnesses
in the crowd.

856
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,227
And people watching it, so ...

857
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:55,221
We have a verified score
on a legitmate Donkey Kong machine.

858
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:56,290
for Steve Wiebe now.

859
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:01,066
We just got off the Internet

860
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:04,097
Where a log on the front page of Twin Galaxies ...

861
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:08,840
The news story that Steve Wiebe
Just scored 985 600 points ...

862
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:10,403
Which essentially recogonized

863
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:13,110
is officially a first place score.

864
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,584
So he have been announced as a world champion.

865
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,677
We'll see what happens now with Steve

866
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:21,351
putting the pressure back on Billy Mitchell.

867
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:22,720
Thank you.

868
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,625
I think it hit him pretty hard.

869
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:26,652
Thank you for voluntering your phone

870
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:27,857
this was an important call...

871
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:30,924
Oh, no, no. I understand.

872
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,196
Yes, I can imagine.

873
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:34,431
He probably wasn't real thrilled.

874
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:39,727
Yes, he saying that the tape

875
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:42,646
-- I guess don't share that with everybody.
-- No, well.

876
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:49,411
We got everybody on the invation only list.

877
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:52,115
And, um, you know what? Walter is here.

878
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,624
We are just telling jokes and having fun.

879
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:56,285
Eh, who is there? Like Todd and Duane?

880
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:57,919
Yes.

881
00:46:57,962 --> 00:46:59,827
What I mean is probably a good idea

882
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:01,388
if I say hi to Todd.

883
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:02,421
Actully would you believe he's in a middle

884
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:03,956
of a Lady Bug game.

885
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,832
I do not think we wanna interupt.

886
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,031
We have a Lady Bug cabaret in the cabin.

887
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,596
And Todd got a score going.

888
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,902
Well, okay, can I get Walter on the phone.

889
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:15,878
Eh, a couple of hours
we were all at the Funspot

890
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:18,245
And, um, Brian Kuh said ...

891
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:21,649
that Billy had a delivery for us here at the cabin.

892
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,482
Oh!

893
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:25,978
Brian Kuh he is kinda like

894
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:27,354
a really good friend with Billy.

895
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,484
He talks to him all the time.

896
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:32,792
Eh, he said everybody is gonna
want to see what's on the tape.

897
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:36,526
Brian Kuh is there?

898
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,035
He knows everything to do with the tape.

899
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,334
He knows to guard the
tape with his life.

900
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:43,295
I explained to him

901
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,241
he could lose life, but don't lose the tape.

902
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,546
Who wants to hear the announcement?

903
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:53,948
So even in Florida the long
arm of Billy Mitchell.

904
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:56,418
Has reached in here to Funspot seven ...

905
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:58,979
To cause more interesting developments.

906
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:02,584
Now we're gonna start on this TV screen,
the video tape.

907
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,686
And essientilly
Steve Wiebe or Brian Kuh ...

908
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:09,096
Or anybody else can also beat the score on that tape

909
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:11,533
about four'a'clock tomorrow afternoon.

910
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:14,834
He will give them 10 000 dollars, okay?

911
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:18,035
We know that Billy Mitchell
can pay these promises too, okay?

912
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:21,738
So he has it, while I'm trying to get a million live

913
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:26,239
He has it said out so that people
at Funspot

914
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:29,912
Can gather around. And look at his tape..

915
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,782
Well, here we are.
We got cameras on the screen ...

916
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:34,813
Cameras on the crowd.

917
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,383
No one is gonna miss this moment.

918
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:38,122
998 2.

919
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:42,061
Here we go.

920
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:46,035
We have every eye in the crowd focused
on the screen.

921
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:48,867
Everybodys looking, every cameras on here.

922
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:50,897
We are not gonna miss this for anything.

923
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:55,771
I don't think there is any distractions.

924
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:57,804
That can pull everone away right now.

925
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:02,078
Oh, look at that.

926
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,988
With the bonus, we have the
first million point game of Donkey Kong

927
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,648
And the result says zero.

928
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,818
And the score reach zeros all the way across.

929
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,727
Not even Helena of Troy
had that much attention.

930
00:49:20,604 --> 00:49:24,062
Billy kinda steal the show
and is not even there.

931
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:28,408
It's kinda the way they, you know ...

932
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:32,404
Was kinda diffusing what I was going for

933
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,941
And hyping up Billys videotape

934
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:42,090
1 047 200 points...

935
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:43,753
It is the highest score that has ever been.

936
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:45,762
I do not know. I suppose that Walter
Must go to the office ...

937
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:48,094
To that computer, now, does he?

938
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,699
Okay, go and hand Walter the phone real quick.

939
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:54,701
Hello, Billy.

940
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:57,036
Pretty good, it's all been wonderful.

941
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,133
Billy is probably the closest person

942
00:49:59,176 --> 00:50:00,768
to being a Jedi than any of the players.

943
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:04,941
And he refers to it, with homour
as Obi-Wan Konobian people

944
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,159
Steve Wiebe
Not having the opportunity...

945
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:21,187
to view everything that Bill Mitchell does

946
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:23,894
I mean Bill Mitchell plays at a great advantage.

947
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:28,621
When Billy Mitchell is watching
Steves world record winning tape

948
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:31,365
He is in a postition to study Steves technique.

949
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,103
When the man said:
"I wanna see your papers"

950
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,440
And Obi-Wan Kenobi goes

951
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:36,036
"You don't need to see our papers"

952
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,547
And, suddenly, the guy says: "you can go"

953
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:38,878
"I do not need to see your papers."

954
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,386
You saw the tape,
which is no doubt a copy.

955
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,363
Because I am sure
he didn't send the master.

956
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:59,893
He is going to send a copy or the master to Rob Murczak

957
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:03,373
Who is the chief referee of Twin Galaxies.

958
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:07,275
I tried to promote Twin Galaxies
As: "integrity above all."

959
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:11,213
Eh, I will do that with my dying breath.

960
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:16,311
And if a gamer knowingly cheats or tries to
pull anything past us

961
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:19,550
We will make sure that the score is not recognised.

962
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,530
Did the gamer pause at any time?

963
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,901
Illiegal glitches or glitch abuse

964
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:46,678
Did they cheat?

965
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:48,947
Did they paused the game after load-up

966
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,250
For the purpose of using a flying razor head

967
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:53,552
And reload the game
with different settings?

968
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,818
I got to look at things like that.

969
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:58,225
This tape might be done in a week, a week and
a half,

970
00:51:58,262 --> 00:51:59,286
to answer your question.

971
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,731
Walter is entering us in to the internet as we speak.

972
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:14,505
Well, Billy Mitchell is being upgraded

973
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,410
we are officially submitting his score.

974
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:20,406
Eh, 1 047 000 and, how much Billy?

975
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:52,443
It is kinda ironic that he went

976
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:56,283
He was a guy that always pushed for live scores.

977
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,721
And now here I am at Funspot, busting my ass

978
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:00,815
To do a live score...

979
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:03,190
And he just send these tape scores now.

980
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:04,353
And then beats the record.

981
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:12,897
World Record head quarters,
can I help you?

982
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:16,929
If this score Donkey Kong defines Billy Mitchell

983
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:20,171
Then why could he not find his time to go to Funspot?

984
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,007
Steve did. Steve has a job.

985
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:23,342
Steve has a family. Steve has kids.

986
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,371
He went. Why can't Billy?

987
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:30,012
I think he feels that pressure, to...

988
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:33,352
Meet people's expectations of him...

989
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,188
And he put a lot of preassure on himself

990
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:37,454
And if he does'nt succeed

991
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:40,190
I think he feels like he has failed them.

992
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,790
And he feels that deeply, I think.

993
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:52,131
If I were to break a million
he would maybe show that...

994
00:53:52,176 --> 00:53:53,905
you know, I have already done it.

995
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:56,777
Because no one knows that
I have done it too.

996
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,192
I have'nt really thought too much about, eh ...

997
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,868
You know, the controversy.

998
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:23,964
I kinda let it go since I went
to Funspot.

999
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:27,272
Did my best, got my score up.

1000
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:31,213
I have been killing myself at school, like, 12 or 14 hours...

1001
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:34,046
Preping three classes
And grading..

1002
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:36,018
every day
after school.

1003
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:37,111
I'm there until eight.

1004
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:43,891
A lot of my songs are like big rocksongs

1005
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:48,193
with lots of guitars and lots of layers of vocals.

1006
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:50,564
Here is one called three lies,
I'm gonna sing this to you guys

1007
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:54,298
In the midst of this cold summer day.

1008
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:56,397
This is who I really am.

1009
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,237
I'm some glap who are supposed to be
an artist

1010
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,436
who is up there just getting wild and crazy.

1011
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:10,175
Because I am --
I am being Mr. Scorekeeper...

1012
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,653
I've been doing it for 25 years so...

1013
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:13,918
there is a lot of this automatan that get turned on.

1014
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:15,865
"Well, yes. and the reason for that is"

1015
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,559
"and the reason for that is this," you know?

1016
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,255
Now I am ready to...

1017
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:20,627
I am ready to let it go.

1018
00:55:28,872 --> 00:55:30,669
No matter how many people get involved in this

1019
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:32,004
It is still my child,

1020
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:34,335
because it came right out of my psyche, you know.

1021
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:37,711
But still the others are more attached to it.

1022
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,739
And they belive they need it more.

1023
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:42,274
Part of the reason I'm still here doing it

1024
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:47,120
is them to help them have the benefit of this

1025
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:48,556
or happiness of this...

1026
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:50,822
So it could go on and continue
to benefit people.

1027
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:52,089
Because it is in such a place

1028
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,927
that I dont have to do Twin Galaxies

1029
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:55,954
But I really would like to see it

1030
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,160
have closure that's positive.

1031
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:02,199
Boy, I got cold fingers. It's cold.

1032
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:08,806
I often have people asking me what
my handle is. What my three intials are.

1033
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:14,879
I mean, come on.
I tell people: "Look at me."

1034
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:17,079
What do you think my three initials were?

1035
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,683
If you do not know, you are not
looking hard enough.

1036
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,688
T.I.E.?

1037
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:26,059
No.

1038
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:27,893
Which one was I wearing yeasterday?

1039
00:56:27,931 --> 00:56:29,523
- The flag -
- U.S.A.

1040
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:33,764
U.S.A. So I have had Latin friends,
canadian friends

1041
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:36,739
And I always had to keep the americans on top.

1042
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,609
Hello. This is a message for Walter.

1043
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:45,342
I am Craig Glenday
calling from Guinness World Records.

1044
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:46,542
Guinness from England called, they want me to call
them back immedietly.

1045
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:52,149
Hello. Craig speaking.

1046
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:54,851
Craig, this is Walter Day from
Twin Galaxies, how are you?

1047
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,587
They are announcing to the world that they
trust everything we do.

1048
00:56:57,628 --> 00:56:59,118
And that they rely on everything we do

1049
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:02,063
as being true and honest,
and so that's why they are going with us

1050
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,966
as the official scorekeepers

1051
00:57:05,002 --> 00:57:07,800
and providers of electronic game industry content

1052
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,100
for their upcoming books.

1053
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:10,231
It has become very complicated.

1054
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:12,570
So to have someone
like Walter and his team...

1055
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:14,406
They know everything there is to know ...

1056
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:18,141
about computer games,
Eh, it was for us a godsend.

1057
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:20,172
Since older people also read you're book

1058
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:21,878
a certain number of people would care

1059
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:24,386
what the world record is on
Donkey Kong.

1060
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:27,390
We look forward being a part of Guinness.

1061
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,483
Yes, yes. Being here is already a reward.

1062
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:30,925
You know, working with Twin Galaxies.

1063
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,623
You just recorded a big piece of Twin Galaxies
history, you know.

1064
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:37,724
There are announcing to the world
that we are the official scorekeepers

1065
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:40,236
And people will
have to be verified by us.

1066
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,534
Wait till you see the poster upstairs I just did

1067
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:44,938
To turn the process of submitting to
Guiness.

1068
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:46,533
In to a contest.

1069
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:49,306
When you want to put our score up.

1070
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:52,577
And you wanna have the title of
world champion.

1071
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:54,948
You're competing against everybody in the world.

1072
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:57,886
You want a title
for your own living room?

1073
00:57:57,921 --> 00:58:00,788
Man, I'll send you that title.
You're own arcade

1074
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:02,587
I'll sign it and make up a paper

1075
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:04,423
and I'll send you a plack.

1076
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:06,258
You want your name in
Guinness Book of world records...

1077
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:08,662
And the Twin Galaxies international
scoreboard?

1078
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:11,793
You have to earn it.
I have to earn it.

1079
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:15,100
There is a lot of scores I gotten.

1080
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,902
When the time comes
And the pressure is that hard...

1081
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:21,172
I will have to do it in public for them.
As I always have.

1082
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:33,686
Is that truthfull?

1083
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:41,628
Is that true? Then I better get practising.

1084
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:47,628
The only thing to do...

1085
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:50,902
is to go somewhere and brake
1 047 000 live.

1086
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:54,900
That would be the only way to do it
for sure, you know?

1087
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:57,778
There would be no getting screwed over.

1088
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:00,840
I have been kicked like the dog for so long

1089
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:03,751
I don't trust referees.

1090
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:07,197
This is the contest that getis them in to the
Guiness Book of World Records.

1091
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:09,183
So they will have that inspiration.

1092
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:11,421
As far as my skills...

1093
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:13,895
Yeah, I'm feeling like I'm at the top of my game.

1094
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,125
I would love to see Bill
defend his title...

1095
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,690
against Steve Wiebe head-to-head.

1096
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,760
That be great.
It's all about head-to-head competion.

1097
00:59:20,804 --> 00:59:22,965
It's kinda like my top four students to go:

1098
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:26,339
"Yeah. When are you going to kick
that guys ass?"

1099
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:31,678
And I go: "Watch your language".
I go: "I'm gonna do it here soon".

1100
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:34,980
If someone is going to break a classic arcade
game record.

1101
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:37,384
They gonna have to come prepared.

1102
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,047
That's what I need.

1103
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:41,387
So I could be at my best, have him there.

1104
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:51,791
I was hoping Billy would be there
so we can compete head-to-head.

1105
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:56,828
He has always been an applicant
to live scores.

1106
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:59,034
But now all of a sudden he is
Mr. Videotape.

1107
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:04,441
I mean, to win is like so important.

1108
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:08,008
But obviously do things that are against the rules...

1109
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:10,849
And knowing your heart
you did not do it correctly...

1110
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:12,616
And get credit for it...

1111
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:17,717
What kind of?...
Is there any satisfaction in that?

1112
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:19,490
I do not see any.

1113
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:37,439
I just need one favor from you.

1114
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,916
I know that after all
you done for me...

1115
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,748
...give me a shoot at it without you...

1116
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:45,550
being my backbone.

1117
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:48,615
I need to attack by myself.

1118
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:53,459
It says: "Good luck,
Steve, in Donkey Kong."

1119
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:54,758
-- Well.
-- Knocke them dead.

1120
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:55,924
-- I will.

1121
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:00,998
"Work is for people who
can't play video games.

1122
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,629
--"Billy Mitchell."
-- That's right.

1123
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:07,769
Out of the entire global classic gaming hobby.

1124
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,836
There is one significant rivalry...

1125
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,940
That's equaelient to the big
rivalries in history...

1126
01:01:12,983 --> 01:01:17,545
Yankees - Red Socks, Maris - Mantle,
The Heckle and Jeckle.

1127
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:20,215
All big rivalries
of history.

1128
01:01:20,257 --> 01:01:21,588
This is up that on that level.

1129
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:23,718
Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe...

1130
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,285
are going for the top spot

1131
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:29,628
in the forthcoming book of world records
on Donkey Kong.

1132
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,157
Hello, Billy. This is Steve Wiebe.

1133
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:34,768
Really think
We need to settle this thing.

1134
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,328
May the best man win.

1135
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:39,035
We'll be seeing you next week.

1136
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:40,372
He knows I'm going to be there.

1137
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,344
It's just a skip away.

1138
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:45,542
Hops, skips and jumps froms his house...

1139
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:48,176
There is really no excuse for him not to be there.

1140
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:53,753
Never leave home without it:
How to win at "Donkey Kong."

1141
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:55,385
Yes, so ...

1142
01:02:01,564 --> 01:02:04,795
The Guinness... A lot of people are...

1143
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:06,495
Yes, a lot of people read that book.

1144
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:38,390
Thi is technically a weight lifting glove...

1145
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:39,993
Because I discovered in the eighties...

1146
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:41,025
That you could buy...

1147
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:42,766
a weight lifting glove that was fingerless

1148
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,467
and I used it to play
Marble Madness.

1149
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:47,203
Do you see the double padding?

1150
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:49,541
Occasinally I use this to avoid calluses...

1151
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:51,444
from certain joystick games.

1152
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,949
You can do
Marble Madness track all day long.

1153
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,558
Excuse me guys.
I got a celebrity in this car.

1154
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:15,332
-- Can I cut in front of you?

1155
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:22,973
-- Did you get dropped off?
-- I got dropped off.

1156
01:03:23,013 --> 01:03:25,379
-- Was Billy driving?
-- Billy was driving.

1157
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,719
Well anyway, welcome to
The Dodge City of videogames.

1158
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:33,484
Thank you, Walter. I am happy to be here.

1159
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:37,284
I get you some out of there.

1160
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:52,406
What do you need?

1161
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,842
In order: 693500...

1162
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:00,007
Okay.

1163
01:04:19,936 --> 01:04:21,028
Yes. Nicole.

1164
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:23,130
Hello. I am Nicole.

1165
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:26,398
And that is the little Derek, huh?

1166
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:27,808
Yes.

1167
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:31,437
-- The faster, yeah.

1168
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:38,880
I'm afraid that if he can't do it.
He's gonna beat himself up about it

1169
01:04:38,922 --> 01:04:42,449
I do not know if that's the forum
in which he will be succesful.

1170
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:43,720
I'm mean, I know he can be succesful.

1171
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,523
I'm jus afraid, what if it doesn't happen.

1172
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,996
-- Goodbye, Derek.
-- Derek, give daddy a hug.

1173
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:49,430
What are guys gonna do?

1174
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:52,094
-- We just gonna go home.
-- Go swimming.

1175
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:53,500
Go swimming? That sounds fun.

1176
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:54,935
Okay. Let's go.

1177
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,495
-- Goodbye.
-- I love you.

1178
01:04:57,874 --> 01:04:59,535
Goodbye. Thanks.

1179
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:05,175
Yes, the longer I wait, the more I'm...

1180
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:07,877
pressing, I get more nervous.

1181
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,385
If I get it the first night,
I will be eary.

1182
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,420
Steve Wiebe is a trooper.

1183
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:15,686
Steve Wiebe has come to three events...

1184
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:19,957
To proof himself in the fire of
in person competion.

1185
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:23,762
And under the stress of having
all eyes on him.

1186
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,318
Yeah.

1187
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:54,489
-- Is"Wib"or"Wibi"?
--"Wibi."

1188
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:55,498
-- Well.
-- Sorry.

1189
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:57,397
Twin Galaxies
calls me Wib, so...

1190
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:58,422
Okay.

1191
01:05:58,468 --> 01:05:59,628
-- And that's a common mistake.
-- Yes?

1192
01:05:59,669 --> 01:06:01,000
either that or "Waib".

1193
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,198
At least, you get the correct presentation...

1194
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:04,297
Steve Wiebe is who I wanted to be...

1195
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,137
when I grew up playing Donkey Kong .

1196
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:07,234
he is quite the player.

1197
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:03,659
Maybe they like it if I lose,
I got to try losing sometimes.

1198
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,863
Oh, I can break a million.
I've done it.

1199
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:09,872
I've been on pace.
In two games I got to 850...

1200
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:14,673
I thought I was gonna do it
but... I just got in a bind.

1201
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:32,991
Does this have my name on the back or something?

1202
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:34,053
What does it say?

1203
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:38,392
It says: "You have a yearning for perfection."

1204
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,604
Because he is in his own business...

1205
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:45,766
Is very flexible for him.

1206
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:48,902
He can go over to the schools
for events.

1207
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:50,674
He was at an Easter egg hunt the other day.

1208
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,613
He will come in the office someday...

1209
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:54,378
And you'll say: "Gee, where is Billy?".

1210
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:55,543
"Billy is not here."

1211
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:59,043
I told him last night that he had to come...

1212
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:01,113
That there was o reason for him not to be here.

1213
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,352
He said: "I have 15 reasons why I can't come".

1214
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:04,382
I said they are all Bullshit.

1215
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:05,587
This is after one thirty in the morning.

1216
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:08,685
I said: "they are all bullshit because I have 15
reasons why you have to be here tomorrow"

1217
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:11,092
He had a chance to play him at Funspot this year.

1218
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:13,193
He had a chance to play him
in Pompano Beach.

1219
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:17,434
He had a chance to play him
at California Extreme.

1220
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,737
There is three of them I can think of right there.

1221
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,903
Why wouldn't he play against Steve?

1222
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,809
Because he is afraid he is gonna lose.

1223
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:28,215
I traveled 3000 miles to give myself a chance...

1224
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:30,742
to get the world record
and be in Guinness.

1225
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:33,984
I hope he can at least
come 10 miles...

1226
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:37,759
and put his game on the line.
So you make the call?

1227
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:39,557
Where are you?

1228
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:43,692
Well, we are all here.

1229
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:46,395
We are all seated, ready to order so...

1230
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:50,663
Eh, well, I can't make out a list here.

1231
01:08:50,707 --> 01:08:53,232
We got Tom Rogers and his girl.

1232
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:56,074
We got Shawn, Fran, Jason and..

1233
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,959
That's fair, is'n it?

1234
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,063
Okay.

1235
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,642
I am really sorry that he did not come.

1236
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:30,771
-- Bill?
-- Yes.

1237
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:36,149
Well, you know Mark and Steve came...

1238
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:39,552
unexpectadly and without invitation,
Hard to keep them away.

1239
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:40,578
Yes.

1240
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:41,988
And Bill just don't want anything to do with him.

1241
01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:44,150
Yes.

1242
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:47,022
Oh, right see you.

1243
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:58,836
He has got a plan, so when he comes out...

1244
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,638
Because Billy is Billy, you know.

1245
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:03,736
And he is gonna come out with a bat.

1246
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,280
Oh, Billy Mitchell always has a plan.

1247
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:09,241
-- He likes to keep secrets.
-- Yes.

1248
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:11,310
He likes surprising people.

1249
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:14,584
He likes people seeing
him do the unexpected...

1250
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:16,182
And say: "Oh, boy, I did not realise ...

1251
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:17,556
--"That you was gonna do something like that, Bill."
-- Yes.

1252
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:18,821
That's how he is.

1253
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,352
It is annoying when somebody is ahead of you.

1254
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:22,421
When you are not the lead dog

1255
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:26,765
the view does not change,
And I always wanted the view...

1256
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,668
He has got the Roy Shildt excuse.

1257
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:32,333
He's got... He is not gonna show up.

1258
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:36,277
I have heard a lot of talk about Billy Mitchell ...

1259
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:40,942
And I've heard a lot of talk of
strange videos and things.

1260
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:45,386
But I have not heard much in a way of him...

1261
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:48,254
Getting in front of a camera crew
or people...

1262
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:51,522
And winning a record in front of people.

1263
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,258
I have not heard about that yet
maybe he did that 25 years ago.

1264
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:57,163
But I have not heard
of him doing it lately...

1265
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,191
And makes you wonder why not.

1266
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,544
What have we got here.
It's here.

1267
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:43,474
Hello, Billy.

1268
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:06,599
Vdeo games are meant to be played...

1269
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:11,505
In a competitive environment,
Under pressure, organised...

1270
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:14,305
Where, you have to perform, literally,
on demand

1271
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:19,508
Never. Never.

1272
01:12:23,286 --> 01:12:26,778
And when you do that
you have far more credibility...

1273
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:29,791
Then someone who says:
"Oh, I did that last week."

1274
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:31,190
No matter how good you play tennis.

1275
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:32,956
No matter how good you play golf...

1276
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:35,122
if you don't play when you have to play

1277
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:37,655
If you don't play when the preassures on

1278
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,930
You really are not good enough.

1279
01:12:50,947 --> 01:12:55,407
I can handle losing
If he would at least compete against me.

1280
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:56,918
I'm not afraid to lose.

1281
01:12:56,953 --> 01:12:59,979
I'm some no name guy from Washington.

1282
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:03,321
Billy tries to live up to this image...

1283
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,487
Of being the greatest ever...

1284
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,828
And so he's afraid of that
if he loses, it will remove his shine.

1285
01:13:24,046 --> 01:13:27,015
I have spent three days now...

1286
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:28,038
the fatigue is starting to set in...

1287
01:13:28,084 --> 01:13:31,520
Mentally, you know...

1288
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:35,115
Starting over it takes a toll on you.

1289
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:56,776
Steve Wiebe I think
is a very straight shooter.

1290
01:13:57,747 --> 01:13:59,408
This is the last day, right?

1291
01:13:59,448 --> 01:14:03,316
I think that he gets influenced sometimes
by people

1292
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:05,513
And that is probably one of
his lessons.

1293
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:07,954
To be stronger in himself.

1294
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,618
You know what I mean? We all have lessons.

1295
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,497
- Okay.

1296
01:14:23,506 --> 01:14:26,373
Oh, there it is. This is the last shot.

1297
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:32,066
I'm done.

1298
01:15:34,477 --> 01:15:36,638
So heartbreaking.

1299
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:40,743
I guees it's not even about
Donkey Kong anymore.

1300
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:42,808
-- What is this about?

1301
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:45,582
Just... I do not know.

1302
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:48,852
It has become
just a game in trying

1303
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:52,019
For me, trying
to get a score recognized...

1304
01:15:52,728 --> 01:15:57,290
And trying to beat this empire
that I've

1305
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:01,269
been trying to break through.

1306
01:16:01,303 --> 01:16:04,830
He is not cunning and manipulative and mean

1307
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:07,775
He is a decent person in the heart.

1308
01:16:08,778 --> 01:16:12,043
In the end, that's all that matters.

1309
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:25,553
In a funny sort of way it's like being
the king...

1310
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:27,926
and having the advisers speak your
opinions

1311
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:31,057
but the trying to choose
the right answer

1312
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,898
And the right path of action
based on the advise.

1313
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:39,568
I think that Steve Wiebe has to be
viewed on his own merit ...

1314
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:44,068
Without anything alleged which may
have happened

1315
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:46,581
Steve Wiebe feels fine to me
Doesn't he to you?

1316
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:48,947
Steve Wiebe, could you come up here?

1317
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:58,326
For some reason I keep on thinking of "Wib".
Sorry.

1318
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,760
Steve is special.

1319
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:02,058
Steve has gone through a long history...

1320
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,691
That I don't need to burden you with...

1321
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:05,791
But I just wanted to tell you that...

1322
01:17:05,835 --> 01:17:07,132
I wanted to congratulate you

1323
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:10,229
and shake your hand again,
Because, as far as I am concerned...

1324
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,103
You are a top player...

1325
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,473
Worthy of the highest regard of
Twin Galaxies ...

1326
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:17,138
And we are very honored to recive your
video tapes...

1327
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,647
at any time you want to record them

1328
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:20,944
Because we think, you're...

1329
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:23,008
skill set is on the highest level and

1330
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:25,282
you are a member of the family
You are great.

1331
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:27,814
So you are okay,
you're great.

1332
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:29,791
-- You are a great performer.

1333
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:40,598
I can only speak for myself,
but I have talked to Steve...

1334
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,194
I talked to his wife,
I talked to his kids

1335
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:44,832
I've met with him.
Talked to him in detail.

1336
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:47,775
And speaking for myself
I have no question about

1337
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:52,304
his integrity, his abality.
Or anything else.

1338
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:55,511
He has proven himself not just
as a Donkey Kong player...

1339
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:57,416
but as a person of...

1340
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:00,616
someone who really
desires to do the right thing.

1341
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:03,320
Do you agree with ...?

1342
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:04,417
I am not familiar with this situation.

1343
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:17,934
I feel that I have won and I tried...

1344
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:21,238
And I hope people will remember, you know...

1345
01:18:21,277 --> 01:18:24,678
and these name tag over here.

1346
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:35,824
After I returned from the trip
Walter e-mailed me...

1347
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:37,883
And it had these words...

1348
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:40,760
"Steve, your Donkey Kong acchomplichments
were fantastic".

1349
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:43,691
"After soulsearching, we at Twin Galaxies"

1350
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,599
"wish to apologize to you
for such inconsederate treatment"

1351
01:18:46,635 --> 01:18:49,035
"We look forward to your future exploits"

1352
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:50,060
"And are excited about the"

1353
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,766
"amazing high score breakthrough"

1354
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:54,241
"you will be bringing to the
Donkey Kong community".

1355
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:56,267
"Blessings and friendship. Walter Day."

1356
01:18:56,312 --> 01:19:00,442
So that's his,

1357
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:05,351
way he wanted to bring peace to this situation.

1358
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:09,882
--! Dad!
--! Dad!

1359
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:11,051
Are you cold?

1360
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:33,370
He was searching, you know? He wanted something...

1361
01:19:33,415 --> 01:19:36,407
And wanted that for him
cause I wanted him to be happy.

1362
01:19:36,452 --> 01:19:38,886
So now I see that.

1363
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:40,513
Do not do that.

1364
