1
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:04,477
Oh!

2
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,143
Ooh.

3
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,476
Good God!

4
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,754
So, you had fun up there.

5
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,152
I was blending;
that's what agents do.

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,521
Would you please stop?

7
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,890
I'd like to get to Banning's
table before morning.

8
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,485
Whoa! Hey, slut, thanks.

9
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:58,396
I hate celebrities
who brush off their fans.

10
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,957
Banning's girlfriend
has been drinking.

11
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,559
Okay, she might be
able to tell... Clark!

12
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:03,569
Yes.

13
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,570
Stop.

14
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,469
Get on the scene, Sex Machine.

15
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,401
Great job, man.

16
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,070
Hi.

17
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,942
Hi. Good evening.

18
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,446
Hello.

19
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,505
Well, we're all

20
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,575
vaguely honored
you could join us, I suppose.

21
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:22,213
Singing is my favorite
type of music.

22
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,813
Oh, admirable.

23
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:25,722
Regrettably, this is

24
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,727
my vacuous fiancee.

25
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:29,285
I think her name is Cheryl

26
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,887
something.

27
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,023
Oh, charmed.

28
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,625
I could look at you all day.

29
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,897
Do you ever dance
unprofessionally...

30
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,735
Emperor?

31
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:40,933
Let's see what I can do.

32
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,333
Oh, excuse us.

33
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:46,777
Of course.

34
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,848
Do you know how to mambo?

35
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:50,941
I hope so.

36
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,417
Whoo!

37
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,861
Hmm... '92 Dasani.

38
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,895
Gentle bouquet with a hint
of vinyl polychloride.

39
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,568
Earthy yet... ethereal.

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,100
Cheers.

41
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,408
Oops.

42
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,574
I spilled.

43
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,089
You and Banning seem very close.

44
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,388
Tell me about his work.

45
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,191
I don't want
to talk about him.

46
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,891
I want to talk about you.

47
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,866
You're such a handsome devil.

48
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,927
So are you.

49
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,407
When I can't sleep at night,
which is quite often

50
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,035
I step into my
laboratory and I play.

51
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,170
It's not work, you see.

52
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,407
It's glorious

53
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,144
wet... play.

54
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:02,485
Well, maybe I can
come over and play.

55
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,980
That would be very nice.

56
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,961
The thing is, I, uh...

57
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:14,126
I have a small problem...
trusting people.

58
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:19,264
I don't know if I can trust
myself with you, Deitrich.

59
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:21,706
Well, maybe we can come up

60
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,369
with a way for you to pro...

61
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,882
Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,478
Oh, bloody hell.

63
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:39,856
He drives a BMW,
registered to Clark Devlin.

64
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:43,385
You told me you
dealt with Devlin

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,092
with the skateboard bomb.

66
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:49,158
Yeah, well, he looks
pretty alive to me.

67
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,102
Pretty good dancer.
He's all over Cheryl.

68
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,968
You want me to do
something about that?

69
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:54,940
No.

70
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,135
Maybe the rancid tart

71
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,337
might actually be
of some use for once.

72
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,709
Get the boys, would you?

73
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:05,513
Whoo! I am so bushed.

74
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,543
I'm sorry,
you'll have to excuse me.

75
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,452
Unfortunate interruptus.

76
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,389
So, my long streak of love,
here is the key

77
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:12,652
to the hospitality suite

78
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,820
should you feel the need
to spend the night.

79
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,386
Good-bye.

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,455
Well, I think I'll just go up

81
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,832
to room 7-2... excuse me... 6-8

82
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,496
and take a long, hot bath

83
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:28,064
in room 7-2-6-8.

84
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:28,836
Good night.

85
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,864
Good night.

86
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,516
And once again,
we end up with nothing.

87
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:40,314
I can get her to talk.

88
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,786
And say what?

89
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,119
Oh, Emperor,
would you sign my bra?

90
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,455
Oops, I'm not wearing one.

91
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,592
What is it with you and bras?

92
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,960
She has information.

93
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,465
Oh, right, and that's why you
have to go up to her hotel room.

94
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,695
You have never seen my work.

95
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,670
This is what
Clark Devlin does best.

96
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,195
Can I go home?

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,867
No, you have to cover me.

98
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,535
With what, a shot of penicillin?

99
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,543
Huh?

100
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:05,544
Fine.

101
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,910
I'll be waiting by the pool.

102
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:08,915
Oh, wait.

103
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,917
What's her room number again?

104
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,418
7-2-6-8.

105
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:15,717
7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8.

106
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,779
Yoo-hoo!

107
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,948
Cheryl!

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,457
Hey, you little devil.

109
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,319
What kind of bubbles
do you like?

110
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,623
Little...

111
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,997
...or big?!

112
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,464
Hang it for me, will you?

113
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:11,444
So...

114
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,639
I know you can dance, but...

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,477
what else can you do?

116
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,573
Get on the bed.

117
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:17,583
I'll show you.

118
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:19,919
Oh!

119
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,919
Okay, Mr. Devlin,
let's see your magic.

120
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,460
Oh, my God, your hands
are like a machine.

121
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,523
Oh, I am never working
with him again.

122
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:37,502
So, tell me about Deitrich's
good friend, Walter Strider.

123
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,401
Oh! Never heard of him...

124
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,499
but I know Dry Martini.

125
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,908
Maybe someone should mix us
a couple.

126
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:48,345
Y-O-U spells "you."

127
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:52,774
Oh.

128
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,845
You're smart.

129
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,550
Really?

130
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,716
And a good speller.

131
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,090
Thanks. I graduated
top two-thirds

132
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,924
of my sixth grade class.

133
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,228
What a gentleman.

134
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:16,067
Look, it's Cocktail Barbie.

135
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,599
Take your clothes off
and stay a while.

136
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:18,633
L-I like my clothes on.

137
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:19,645
Kinky boy.

138
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,703
Wh-Wh...?

139
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:21,679
Where did you
get that pin?

140
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,648
Oh. Deitrich.

141
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:24,809
Want to have a closer look?

142
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,545
Huh?

143
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,746
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,553
Look at the time. I got to go.

145
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,718
Oh, Emperor.

146
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,223
Where are you going?

147
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,322
What are you doing?

148
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,127
Oh, Emperor.

149
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,434
Oh, where are you going

150
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,938
you naughty boy?

151
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:49,567
I adore romance when it's rough.

152
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,439
Whoo!

153
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,315
Get back here!

154
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,187
You're dead meat!

155
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,385
Come on!

156
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,573
Take a bath.

157
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,477
Oh, yes, because I've been
a dirty, dirty girl.

158
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,438
Go fill the tub.

159
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,574
Do you like it with bubbles?

160
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,584
Hot bubbles.

161
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,552
Oh, yippee!

162
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,553
Yippee!

163
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,525
Tiny bubbles in my wine...

164
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,288
Makes me feel fine

165
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,386
Come on, her voice reminds me
of my mother.

166
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,532
Is that room service?

167
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,356
What's happening?

168
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:19,161
What's going on under those
cute little boxers of yours?

169
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,905
Emperor, the bubbles
are perfect.

170
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,644
Come to mama, Emperor!

171
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,053
Coming!

172
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:49,494
Ow!

173
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,745
Help!

174
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,286
Say good night... agent!

175
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,418
Del Blaine. Del Blaine.

176
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,302
Sorry.

177
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:43,816
Emperor...

178
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,908
This is not what I signed up for!

179
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:45,975
I need my bathroom bud.

180
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,179
Shh. She's in there taking a bath.

181
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,118
What happened to your nose?

182
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,315
Sorry!

183
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,326
Honeymooners.

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,555
Yes, some things never change.

185
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:58,427
Emperor!

186
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:00,523
Emperor, come back!

187
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,932
Please!

188
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,228
Oh...

189
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,240
Go! Get going.

190
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,232
Ouch!

191
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:15,907
Can't you do anything?

192
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,677
Why are you so mad?

193
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,981
Gee, let me think.

194
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,920
Because big, ugly men
are trying to kill me?

195
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:24,388
Because I got stuck

196
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,359
with a millionaire playboy
dilettante for a partner?

197
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,554
You don't care
how you make people feel.

198
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:30,687
I happen to be

199
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,221
an extremely sensitive person.

200
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,255
Ow!

201
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,236
Okay, you think
you know feelings.

202
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,397
Look at me.

203
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,931
How do I feel?

204
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:43,942
Sick.

205
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:44,908
Sad.

206
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,172
What about now?

207
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,107
Constipated.

208
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,249
Creepy.

209
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:54,844
Horny.

210
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,447
Is funny.

211
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,117
Is angry.

212
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,591
Is crazy.

213
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,957
You know nothing.

214
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,462
This is why you don't have
a boyfriend.

215
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,863
No wonder you didn't get
anything from Banning.

216
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,834
Oh... right, I didn't
get anything from Banning

217
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,201
except where
his friggin' lab is.

218
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:13,967
Where?

219
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,531
Let's see if the great master
"agent" can figure it out.

220
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,635
Banning said he sometimes
has trouble sleeping.

221
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,645
Big secret.

222
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,307
All men have trouble sleeping.

223
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:25,249
Sometimes at night, he goes
down and works in his lab.

224
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,514
He sleeps in his lab?

225
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,180
He sleeps in his bedroom.

226
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,850
His lab's in his bedroom?

227
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:32,653
No.

228
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,523
Get your facts straight.

229
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,529
His lab is at his house...

230
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:40,828
his casa, where he lives...
get it?

231
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,297
Excellent.

232
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,897
You passed the test.

233
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,839
I put in a good word
with the boss.

234
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,399
Well, let's go
see Chalmers tonight.

235
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:51,375
No.

236
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,537
Keep him out of this.

237
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,375
Just you and me.

238
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,608
You know,
if you're so good at this

239
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:57,172
why-why don't you tell me
something about me?

240
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,014
Okay.

241
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:03,112
You have big crush on me

242
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,716
and I know your
name is Del Blaine.

243
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,488
First of all, you wish, and...

244
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,887
my real name is Delilah.

245
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:14,092
Delilah?

246
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,696
Suits you.

247
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:19,838
Hey...

248
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:20,861
Hmm?

249
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,150
Ooh!

250
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,312
Oh!

251
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,913
Oh... oh, Emperor!

252
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,014
Hey!

253
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:41,390
Oh, God, Clark,
isn't anything sacred?

254
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,362
Oh, rug burns are so sexy!

255
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,092
It's the driver.

256
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:47,099
Oh, my God.

257
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,201
Thank you.

258
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,434
Invitations?

259
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,806
Oh, yes.

260
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:58,811
Why don't you offer him
five bucks?

261
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,472
I have them somewhere.

262
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:02,606
Birds of a feather...

263
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,639
Nice party, huh?

264
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,616
So, you're the strong,
silent type, huh?

265
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,348
That's the whole
bouncer package.

266
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,187
I didn't mean your package.

267
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,193
Thank you...

268
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,718
Dr. Schwartz.

269
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,729
Shalom.

270
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:18,752
Come, darling.

271
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,500
Product launch, my ass.

272
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,867
Let's go find
Banning's lab.

273
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,501
Let's go.

274
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,295
Are you trying to get me alone?

275
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,493
Where'd they go?

276
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,002
Don't tell me
the great Clark Devlin

277
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,096
can't come up with an answer.

278
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,445
Although

279
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,544
he can walk on water.

280
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,822
It's a trick, right?

281
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,133
Come on.

282
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,511
Wow!

283
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:24,182
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.

284
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,190
What?

285
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,589
Oh, uh, uh, I mean

286
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,390
sometime I speak of myself
in the third person.

287
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,692
Hmm, Del Blaine
thinks you're a freak.

288
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:34,265
Have you cleaned the tanks?

289
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,401
What are they doing down there?

290
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:38,425
I don't know.

291
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:39,836
When you're done here

292
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,066
you can go and sweep the tunnels.

293
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:42,096
Don't use the blower!

294
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,506
I can tell the difference.

295
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,407
And don't touch the tequila
for me and Mr. Banning.

296
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:46,570
Whatever you say there,
Dr. Simms.

297
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:47,579
Yes, Dr. Simms.

298
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,580
Louder!

299
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:50,639
- Yes, Dr. Simms.
- Yes, Dr. Simms.

300
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:53,208
We better hope the little
ones follow the queen.

301
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,310
Well, if they don't

302
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:55,547
the stock is going
to be worthless.

303
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,112
"Follow the queen"?

304
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,124
Huh? Have you seen Cheryl?

305
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:00,352
Maybe he's gay.

306
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,553
Cheryl? No.

307
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,856
Man, let's get out of here.

308
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,328
Let's go have a smoke.

309
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,729
It still stinks.

310
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:13,839
Hey.

311
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,932
How did you...?

312
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,533
Whatever.

313
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,544
Look at this.

314
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,073
He's pinpointed
the national reservoirs.

315
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:26,379
He's going to poison
the water?

316
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,443
Not with that stuff.

317
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,612
It's too detectable

318
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,144
and there's
government safeguards.

319
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:31,486
Let's check out the computer.

320
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,889
Now you're thinking.

321
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:38,122
Who are they?

322
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,995
They shouldn't be in the lab.

323
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,590
Let's go.

324
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,534
Oh, my God.

325
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,536
Oh, your God what?

326
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,935
DNA recombinant microbes

327
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,905
carrying a T-4 genome.

328
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,430
English.

329
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,943
Genetically induced
hydrogen-oxygen barrier.

330
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,502
Normal person's English.

331
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,741
Dehydrating water.

332
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,578
Drink it,
you'll shrivel up and die

333
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,208
but the big question is,
how is he possibly

334
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,014
going to introduce it
into the water supply?

335
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,752
I think we better go.

336
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:04,756
Huh?

337
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,757
Go.

338
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,619
Quick, over there by the wall.

339
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,358
Nobody here.

340
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,164
Let's check the hatchery.

341
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,707
You're on my foot.

342
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,503
What was that about?

343
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,446
Shh! Go!

344
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,040
How did they miss us?

345
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,074
What, are they blind?

346
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,246
Don't look up my skirt.

347
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,807
Banning's got the bacteria

348
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,839
but he has to transport it
from his lab to the water.

349
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:05,873
There's no way he can.

350
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,146
Maybe with airplanes.

351
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,585
Not possible.

352
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,885
Besides, even if he could get it
to a reservoir undetected

353
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,220
an alarm would trigger

354
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,953
the second the surface
of the water's broken.

355
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,257
You're really smart.

356
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,660
It's an act.

357
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:18,754
I'm an inexperienced girl

358
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,425
who's trying to bluff
her way through.

359
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,491
You are?

360
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:23,934
Come on, stop humoring me.

361
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,459
Just be honest.

362
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:28,939
Honest?

363
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,067
All right.

364
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,737
You think
I'm the great Clark Devlin.

365
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:37,672
Yeah, hello?

366
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,116
Steena, I can't talk right now.

367
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:46,491
Yeah.

368
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,187
Yeah, I can handle it.

369
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:51,889
Bad news?

370
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,923
Can we go somewhere
and be... alone?

371
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:57,060
Sure.

372
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,705
I didn't know
you were so strong.

373
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,038
Take off your clothes.

374
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,168
Let's not do anything
we'll regret.

375
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:06,940
Take off your clothes.

376
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:07,946
What's happening?

377
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,607
Look, I knew
the second I met you

378
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:10,979
you weren't Clark Devlin.

379
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:12,984
Now take off the tuxedo.
It doesn't belong to you.

380
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:14,883
I wanted to tell you,
but I just didn't know how.

381
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,944
Take off your clothes.

382
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,820
What is that?

383
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:19,825
Hey!

384
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:20,826
Whoa!

385
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,827
You, out here!

386
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:22,759
Okay.

387
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,228
Take the clothes.

388
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,230
Okay.

389
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,094
Slow down.

390
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:27,120
My name is Jimmy Tong.

391
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,326
I'm Mr. Devlin's driver.

392
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,857
He asked me to find
Walter Strider.

393
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:30,891
I don't want to hear

394
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,267
any more of your lies.

395
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:33,532
Now, give me the watch
and the shoes.

396
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,062
Now, where's Clark Devlin
and how did you think

397
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:36,267
you were going
to get away with this?

398
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:37,639
Things happened.

399
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,076
I decided to go with the flow.

400
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,309
What about the underwear?

401
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,941
They're mine.

402
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:46,542
L-I mean, my roommate.

403
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,574
Jimmy.

404
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,618
Suits you.

405
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:55,186
These are my roommate's, too.

406
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,558
Go finish your business.

407
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,698
Have you seen the Emperor?

408
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:04,725
No.

409
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:06,696
Impolite to leave

410
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,639
without saying good-bye
to the host.

411
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:10,665
I was just looking for Deitrich.

412
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:11,937
I'll take you to him, then.

413
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,648
Like a big terrier
with a little rat.

414
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,118
I think she was
down in the lab.

415
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:24,782
Well, at least your interest
in water was genuine.

416
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,950
Look, I'm here because of you.

417
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:30,052
You wanted to know
if I could be trusted?

418
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:34,225
I bet this tux
is just your size.

419
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,633
Thank you.

420
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,107
We got a positive location
on Blaine, sir.

421
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,083
How long till we get to her?

422
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,982
20 minutes.

423
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,044
I've transmitted
the coordinates.

424
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:58,784
Dear Mr. Devlin

425
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,850
I did the best I could,
but it wasn't good enough.

426
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,385
I did not find Walter Strider
for you.

427
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,660
I also lost your tuxedo.

428
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm sure you will get it back.

429
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:14,533
I guess I will go back to being
what I was before I met you.

430
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:15,562
Oh!

431
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,499
Water Strider.

432
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,137
Water strider.

433
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,180
Water strider!

434
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,647
Stupid!

435
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,845
My beautiful little darlings.

436
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,614
Gerris maginatus.

437
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,951
Species native
to Southeast Asia.

438
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,514
Commonly known
as the water strider.

439
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,153
Walter Strider.

440
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,423
Yes, the water strider.

441
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,555
Very good. Very good.

442
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:14,293
Well, it's brilliant.

443
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,301
They touch down
on the reservoirs.

444
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,303
Their little feet transfer
a deadly bacteria

445
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,066
without breaking
the surface of the water

446
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,266
so no alarms sound,
and it looks like

447
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,901
a nasty little trick of nature.

448
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:25,910
Fortunately

449
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,707
there is one drinkable
water source.

450
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,607
Yours.

451
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:34,515
Deitrich,
you're a genius.

452
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,578
Too bad it won't work.

453
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,121
Oh... you so wrong.

454
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,993
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong.

455
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,224
It will work because
my plan is perfect.

456
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:49,428
Sorry, Mr. Banning,
it's your plan... and mine.

457
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,766
Um... it's ours.

458
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,203
Shut up. Explain.

459
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:55,263
Oh, all righty.

460
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,707
The life cycle
of the Gerris maginatus

461
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,643
begins with mating...

462
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:03,774
something Dr. Simms
is not personally familiar with.

463
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,716
Anyhoo, the insects swarm

464
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,218
to freshwater

465
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,618
where fertilized eggs are then
deposited on the underside

466
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:12,954
of lotus leaves
and hatch into larvae.

467
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:15,983
Spare me
the Discovery Channel blather.

468
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,223
Tell me why it won't work.

469
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,390
Yes, tell us.

470
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,195
Why it won't work?

471
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,499
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

472
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,028
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

473
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:32,533
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually...

474
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:35,877
much like Simms here.

475
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,040
Therefore...

476
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,049
they won't mate.

477
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,348
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

478
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,081
Is this true?

479
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:46,751
No, I knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

480
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,259
Very well.

481
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,158
And then you remember
cousin Doris?

482
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,527
No, Simms, the bugs.

483
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:53,861
The bugs.

484
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:56,891
Oh, you're not going
to believe this hootchie

485
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:58,368
are you, Mr. Banning?

486
00:25:58,403 --> 00:25:59,392
Oh, yeah?

487
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:02,430
Ask him if I lied
about the tuxedo.

488
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:05,534
This tuxedo is...
it's all right. It's...

489
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:06,635
"All right"?

490
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:08,612
That is the most incredible
piece of technology

491
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,512
on the planet.

492
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:16,181
And I am laying it
in your big, hot hands.

493
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,815
Mr. Banning, release the bugs.

494
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:19,824
Go ahead.

495
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:20,825
Do what he tells you.

496
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,451
You might have a chance
at second prize

497
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,984
at a junior high school
science fair

498
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,725
but you can forget your dreams
of world domination.

499
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,494
Slip into it, Deitrich.

500
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,434
See how it feels.

501
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:44,439
The other ten percent's
in there.

502
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,848
You've got plenty of it.

503
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,427
Hey, Dr. Schwartz.

504
00:26:57,461 --> 00:27:00,454
Tell your boss
Clark Devlin is back.

505
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,303
Drapes nicely.

506
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,028
Well, it certainly puts
a spring in one's step.

507
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,002
Happy to have lightened
your loafers, Deitrich.

508
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,594
One question.

509
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:40,900
Why are you doing this?

510
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,902
Hey, what the hell is this?

511
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:51,245
This is the moment where
50 CSA commandos storm in

512
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,478
take you,
your pretentious accent

513
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:55,008
your jackass sideburns

514
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:57,180
to the Federal pen where,
guess what?

515
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:01,818
All they serve is highly
chlorinated tap water.

516
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,852
Presenting Clark Devlin.

517
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:16,766
Have I told you how amazing
you look in this tuxedo?

518
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,802
Simms, prepare for release.

519
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,336
With pleasure, sir.

520
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:25,043
Hatchery doors opening.

521
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,414
Water sources targeted.

522
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:31,013
Pods will begin releasing
striders in five minutes.

523
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:38,992
Maturation level: 85%.

524
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,103
Why are you here?

525
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,104
I've come to save you.

526
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:47,105
That's great.

527
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,039
What about the big guys
with the big guns?

528
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:55,973
For years, I've heard about you.

529
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:59,347
Now we finally meet, I find
that the great Clark Devlin

530
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:01,511
is nothing more
than an ordinary man

531
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:05,148
who's about to die
an extraordinary death.

532
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,248
You're right

533
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,191
except for one thing.

534
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,625
My name's Tong.

535
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:10,685
James Tong.

536
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,231
You okay?

537
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,241
Uh, Jimmy, is there

538
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,401
something you want to tell me?

539
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:25,432
Later.

540
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,305
Oh, you've got
a good suit as well.

541
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,860
All right!

542
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:45,828
Let go!

543
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:32,810
X-4 genome bacteria-induced

544
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:35,108
water striders: 100% mature.

545
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:39,812
Bacteria drop sites identified.

546
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,512
Pods now opening.

547
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,181
What are you doing?! No! No!

548
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:47,157
She's ruining everything.

549
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:50,593
Electrical malfunction.
Hatchery door is disengaged.

550
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:53,792
Ah, I knew girls like you
in high school.

551
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,356
Yeah? Did they do this?

552
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,192
Uh-huh, they did.

553
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,228
Mr. Banning, you must
open the hatch manually.

554
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,365
Sod off.

555
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:06,173
Manual hatch release required.

556
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,544
Manual hatch release required.

557
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:27,754
Rotate valve counterclockwise
to open hatch.

558
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,052
Get off.

559
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,227
Bloody open!

560
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,025
Manual procedure complete.
Hatchery doors opening.

561
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,570
Airborne striders
awaiting queen release.

562
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,314
Hatchery doors opening.

563
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:22,148
Clark!

564
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:24,951
I mean, Jimmy, help me!

565
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,048
I'm busy.

566
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:29,318
All mature striders
ready for release.

567
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,420
Bacteria-laced microbes
fully activated.

568
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,965
His head's about to explode.

569
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:41,995
Look at him.

570
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,301
Look at him!

571
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,871
You might know a few tricks

572
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:52,042
but you're just
a sad, pathetic man.

573
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:19,141
Smoking is bad for your health.

574
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:20,144
You okay?

575
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,145
Yeah, duh.

576
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,203
By the way, nice going.

577
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,579
Now millions of people are going
to die of dehydration.

578
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:25,640
You left the hatch open.

579
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,414
They're not flying away.

580
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,249
Yeah, what are they waiting for?

581
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,191
They are waiting...
to follow the queen.

582
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:37,751
Airborne striders
awaiting queen release.

583
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,923
Oh, my God.
For once, you're right.

584
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:41,694
The queen is going
to lead the striders

585
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,724
to freshwater sites
all over North America.

586
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,895
Quick, grab it
before it's released.

587
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,598
Queen strider disengaged.

588
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,334
Alert!
Queen strider disengaged.

589
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,468
Let's go.

590
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,711
He's got the queen!

591
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:06,053
Wait!

592
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:09,788
You dropped it.

593
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,190
Don't move!

594
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,318
Oh!

595
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:33,444
Ow.

596
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,427
Sir, excuse me,
I deserve to see this.

597
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:26,253
Ugh.

598
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,230
Trouble.

599
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:47,143
Okay, okay, make hustle, ladies.

600
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:48,447
Let's go. Let's go.

601
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,680
Watch out, Aqua-Lung.

602
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,485
Hey, pal, nice suit.

603
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:53,491
It's okay, kitten.

604
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:54,753
Everything's going
to be all right.

605
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:55,782
It is not okay.

606
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,556
You just decked the hero.

607
00:36:57,595 --> 00:37:01,258
L-I'm a genius and I can testify
for a piece of immunity.

608
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,529
Also, I'm from
a neutral country...

609
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:04,796
Shut it.

610
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,895
Well, looks like we
got here just in time.

611
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:08,337
Oh, to what? Take credit?

612
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,398
Oh, you're hilarious, Blaine.

613
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:11,999
Winton Chalmers, CSA.

614
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,068
I spearheaded the operation
that took down Deitrich Banning.

615
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,670
I bet you're Jimmy Tong.

616
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:17,578
Here's your tuxedo.
You happy now?

617
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:20,880
Well, I will be when I get it
safely back to headquarters.

618
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,318
By the way, Blaine,
not a bad job

619
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,685
for your first time
in the field.

620
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,189
Well, I didn't do it alone.

621
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:28,158
She always says
nice things about me.

622
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,353
When you finally

623
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,021
do something right,
you deserve the credit.

624
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,120
Well, sir

625
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:33,562
it's an honor to help

626
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:35,566
the United States of America.

627
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,828
I feel exactly
the same way, soldier.

628
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,665
You don't think you're going
to be able to get away

629
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:41,069
with a bureaucratic pat
on the butt, do you?

630
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,470
Well, I'm hoping to.

631
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:55,113
Ooh, man down, people.

632
00:37:57,322 --> 00:38:03,659
Well... there is one thing
you can do for me.

633
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,663
And that would be?

634
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:07,825
All right, tracking
systems locked on.

635
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:09,731
Anybody screws up
and your ass is mine.

636
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,961
Block off this end
of the street.

637
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:11,969
Roger that.

638
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,402
All right, we're at
T minus 30 and counting.

639
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,735
Is everyone in position?

640
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:15,864
Manhole agent up.

641
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:18,603
Flower lady, hot dog vendor, go.

642
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,235
Replace the hot dog vendor.
Come on, hustle.

643
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:21,336
Let's go.

644
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,108
This is Bird Three,
the street is secure.

645
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,671
Uh-oh, bike messenger.

646
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:27,344
Hostile forces moving in.
Go on, Randall, take him out.

647
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,352
Roger. T-14 descending.

648
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:30,946
Advance the lead
operation vehicle.

649
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,725
Bring in the package
as soon as I cross.

650
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:35,817
Roger that.

651
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,555
Hustle, people.

652
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,562
The package is on the move.

653
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:40,587
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time.

654
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,660
How's our package?

655
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:45,066
I forget what to say.

656
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,263
But you can do this.

657
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,271
Focus. Go.

658
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,272
Huh?

659
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,273
Go.

660
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,638
Package dropped.

661
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,540
Roger. Target locked.

662
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:54,238
Jimmy, what do you say?

663
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:03,777
The name's Tong. James Tong.

664
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,846
I'm the man. I'm the man.

665
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,482
Del, did you tell him
to say that?

666
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,686
No. Well, sort of.

667
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:10,694
Oh, God.

668
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:11,820
Come on, ladies, relax.

669
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:12,887
He's just pumping out
pheromones.

670
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:13,898
Clark, shut up.

671
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,559
I do believe I'm in charge
of this operation.

672
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,624
Package is locked on target.

673
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,226
Why did you wear those pants?

674
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,032
He's stopping.

675
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:21,902
- What's he stopping for?
- Why is he stopping?

676
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,736
Use the door, Jimmy.

677
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:23,832
He's really
breathing heavy now.

678
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:24,842
Have you seen her?

679
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,343
He's out of his league,
if you know what I mean.

680
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:27,344
Shh!

681
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:28,640
- He's like a hunter.
- It's the gallery owner.

682
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,705
Randall, quiet.

683
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:32,147
Nice.

684
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:33,548
Clark, please,
would you focus?

685
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:34,642
He's about to speak.

686
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:35,414
Open your mouth.

687
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,715
Hi.

688
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:37,846
- He said, "Hi."
- Hi.

689
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,856
That's the girl?

690
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,585
He came up with that on his own.

691
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,649
She's not that pretty.

692
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:42,819
Jimmy, smile, come on.

693
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,487
Move on to something else...
quick.

694
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:45,826
He doesn't look so good.

695
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:46,852
He doesn't look so good.

696
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:47,922
He doesn't look so good.

697
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,456
- Jimmy? Jimmy?
- He doesn't look so good.

698
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,296
Clark, give him a line.

699
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:51,302
Steena, shut up.

700
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:53,167
- Just look deep into her eyes...
- Clark, no.

701
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:53,932
That crap doesn't work...

702
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:54,961
Looks like
he's hyperventilating.

703
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:56,064
If I remember rightly,
it worked...

704
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,472
Don't listen to them.
Listen to me.

705
00:39:57,508 --> 00:40:00,238
I can't think with you
screaming in my ear.

706
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,370
Everybody calm down, all right?

707
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:02,379
Not you, her.

708
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,675
No, no, her, her.

709
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:04,909
Look deep into her eyes...

710
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,007
It's me.

711
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,041
...and tell her you had a dream
about her last night.

712
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:08,848
Clark, be quiet.

713
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:09,875
Del, will you shut up?

714
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:10,945
Uh...

715
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,650
I hate to say this, Jimmy

716
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,783
but don't take advice
from women about women.

717
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:15,850
Shut up.

718
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:16,882
Clark, you've been reassigned.

719
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:18,054
The voices are screaming in my ear.

720
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:19,256
Hey, if you can hear me

721
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,060
wipe that look off your face.

722
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:22,191
Remember me?

723
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,200
Hooters.

724
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:25,693
Soul patch.

725
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:28,103
Okay, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

726
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,106
I'm the love of my life...

727
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,107
No, no! No, no!

728
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,108
You're the love of my life.

729
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,939
No, you never tell them
you love them, Jimmy.

730
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:35,104
Can you have... dinner with me?

731
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,704
Get out.

732
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,739
Pretty sure he craps
his pants, people.

733
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:39,750
I just want to have dinner.

734
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:40,751
Get out now.

735
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:41,752
- Lunch?
- Now!

736
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:42,844
Oh!

737
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,354
All right, we're
terminating this mission.

738
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:45,947
Pack it up and roll home.

739
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,756
I think I blew it, Mr. Devlin.

740
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:51,318
Jimmy, I wrote the book
on this stuff.

741
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:53,262
Trust me, you didn't blow it.
You outgrew her.

742
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,264
Maybe.

743
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:55,390
Tell you what.

744
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,593
Take the weekend off.
First thing Monday morning

745
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:58,602
we'll head for somewhere with
more interesting prospects.

746
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:00,536
How about Monte Carlo?

747
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:01,538
Sounds good.

748
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,005
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.

749
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,474
Thanks, everybody.

750
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:05,476
It's okay, Jimmy.

751
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,477
Hang in there.

752
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:07,978
Next time.

753
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:10,446
Well, if you were trying
to get her to notice you

754
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:11,505
mission accomplished.

755
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:13,642
What are you planning
for the second date?

756
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:14,673
Running at her with a knife?

757
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,880
It's difficult for me.

758
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:17,888
What is so hard?

759
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,446
You just have to say
something like...

760
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,253
"Excuse me, you want
to go get some coffee?"

761
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:25,058
When I around beautiful
women, I can't talk.

762
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,997
Sure. Beautiful women.

763
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,260
You know, a real knockout.

764
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,165
Like the beautiful lady
in the gallery.

765
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:32,191
Thank you.

766
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,329
Thank you very much.

767
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,237
What's wrong?

768
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:37,673
Nothing.

769
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,437
What?

770
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:41,877
You can't tell how I feel?

771
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:44,711
You look sad.

772
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:45,977
No.

773
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:47,917
Sick?

774
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:48,919
No.

775
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:51,421
Constipated?

776
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:52,548
No.

777
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,989
A little.

778
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,357
Tell me, what's wrong?

779
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:59,830
It's just no guy would ever
do anything for me

780
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:01,855
like what you did for her.

781
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,059
Or tried to do.

782
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:04,625
You know why?

783
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:08,935
Because you are
a pain in the butt.

784
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,498
Yeah, nice working
with you, too.

785
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:14,102
Hello.

786
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:16,010
Delilah, excuse me.

787
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:19,141
You want to have a coffee?

788
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:21,811
I only drink organic green tea.

789
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:24,110
Wrong answer.

790
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:26,419
You're never going
to have a boyfriend.

791
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:27,424
Fine.

792
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:31,292
Coffee. I love coffee.

793
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,990
You learn quick.

794
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,658
Is that your happy face
or your horny face?

795
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:39,567
I tell you later.

796
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,144
James. James...

797
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:51,148
Tong...

798
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:54,140
Cut.

799
00:42:57,989 --> 00:42:59,354
Oh...

800
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,416
Couldn't tell you
what I'm about to say.

801
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:04,683
Purse!

802
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:08,732
Cut.

803
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:10,131
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:12,859
Huh?

805
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:18,708
The bird hit the guy.

806
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:19,710
Huh?

807
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,041
Is this a bunch of crap.

808
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,272
Is this a bunch crap?

809
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,712
Bunch of crap.

810
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:25,010
Okay.

811
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:28,507
You think I'm speak
very good English, huh?

812
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:30,817
What's in your head,
flies out your mouth.

813
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:33,289
What's in your head,
fly from your mouth.

814
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:34,518
What's in your mouth...

815
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:36,754
That's okay. Cut.

816
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:37,761
No wonder.

817
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:39,854
This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.

818
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:42,321
That's...

819
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:46,930
That's... thought...

820
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,903
Frog?

821
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:48,871
Fraud.

822
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:50,874
Look at...

823
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:52,569
Look at her ugly face.

824
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,271
Every time I look...

825
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,405
Every time, she just like this.

826
00:43:58,382 --> 00:43:59,644
How can I act?

827
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:01,311
- Can we do a single on me?
- No.

828
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,319
Action!

829
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:03,547
Aah...

830
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:05,789
No, no, no.

831
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,415
Cut! Cut!

832
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:14,794
Let's follow 'em.
They'll take us to the lab.

833
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:15,856
Who?

834
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:18,527
Let's...

835
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:21,703
Cut.

836
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,230
I got the happy partner
over here.

837
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:28,809
Jimmy.

838
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:29,813
What do you...?

839
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:35,451
She smile the whole movie.

840
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:37,818
Waste of film, waste of time.

841
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:40,517
What is she doing?

842
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:41,320
Hit me!

843
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,018
Oh, no!

844
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,652
You're fast.

845
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:46,026
But I'm faster.
