1
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
- Come on.
- Central Security Agency.

2
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,535
This is Wallace.

3
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,274
Operation Big Drip
is cresting Level Two.

4
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,645
I need Devlin.
I need him now.

5
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,706
Hold, please.

6
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,717
No, no, don't put me on hold!

7
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,616
Mother...

8
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,930
Hello, Agent Wallace.

9
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,992
I need your nine-digit
security code, please.

10
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,466
Hello? Agent Wallace?

11
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,099
Agent Wallace?

12
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,606
Agua la vista... baby.

13
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
Hello, my name's Jimmy Tong

14
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,255
and I was wondering
if there's anything I could say

15
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,284
that would convince you
to have lunch with me.

16
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,524
Oh, Jimmy, you're so cute.

17
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,998
Let's go back to your apartment

18
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,058
and make like... donkey.

19
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,194
You got me nervous again.

20
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,262
It's just a salesgirl.

21
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,865
To you... but to me...

22
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,071
I dream of her

23
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,669
before I ever saw her.

24
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,180
No, that there! That!

25
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,181
Shh.

26
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,477
That is the line.

27
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,575
Go tell her that. That line.

28
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,314
Listen.

29
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,446
Hi.

30
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,956
My name is Jimmy Tong.

31
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,085
When I see you,
I have a wet dream.

32
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,094
Is that what I say?

33
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,095
No, no, you know...

34
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,960
just ask her out to lunch now

35
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,091
and later,
we work out that line.

36
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,033
But hurry up, man.
We be wasting time, man.

37
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,228
Come on. We have to drive.

38
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,464
And whatever you do,
do not be yourself.

39
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,908
Just joking.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,612
Thank you so much.

41
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,742
You're welcome. Good-bye.

42
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,290
I can do it.

43
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
Hi. My name's Jimmy Tong.

44
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,358
Okay...

45
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,632
Hi.

46
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,007
Hi.

47
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,173
Pretty colors.

48
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,115
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

49
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,414
Okay.

50
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,386
Ah...

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,427
Just between us guys...

52
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,397
you don't come around
here for the art, do you?

53
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,593
Who would?

54
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,693
Heh. Yeah.

55
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,671
Uh... let me,
as owner of this gallery

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,937
give you a little bit
of friendly advice.

57
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,906
Don't waste any time.

58
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,006
You go over there and
you ask Jennifer out.

59
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,380
You think so?

60
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,783
Yes. That way, she can say no

61
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,312
and we can get on
with our little lives.

62
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,255
Thank you for your advice.

63
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,125
Yeah.

64
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,235
Hello. My name Jimmy Tong.

65
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,368
What can I say to convince you
to have lunch with me?

66
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,498
Oh!

67
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

68
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,635
I'm terr... I didn't...

69
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,209
Come here, you little runt.

70
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,178
Hi. Hello.

71
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,992
Get back here! Come here!

72
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,126
Where'd you go?

73
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,033
Where are you?

74
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,468
Sauer... sauerkraut
or sauercrop?

75
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,994
Sauerkraut?

76
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,803
Hey... hey, hey!

77
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,939
Hey! I just washed that car.

78
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,471
What the hell
wrong with you, boy?

79
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,347
Want I jam this in your ass
and break it?

80
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,012
You want a go? Come down here.

81
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,782
Whoa, whoa, wait, oh.
Not too fast.

82
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,153
Not too fast.

83
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,248
Hey, I just want to talk.

84
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
Eh, eh, you do that
there, man. You do that.

85
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,056
Oh, you're scared now.

86
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,297
Just-just go
and get yourself

87
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,027
some training wheels!

88
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,466
Go get a tattoo of a chicken!

89
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,436
- Go!
- I thought all your people know karate.

90
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,666
Not everybody Chinese
is Bruce Lee.

91
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,699
Just calm yourself, eh,
Jimmy, calm yourself.

92
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,472
Just not my day.

93
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,882
Whoo! Wow.

94
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,714
Do you think you can get me
to 70 Fleming Street?

95
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,084
Of course. Wait a second.

96
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,020
You Jimmy Tong?

97
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,256
That's who I am.

98
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,285
Who are you?

99
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,923
The name is Steena.

100
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,661
So, how come you drive so fast?

101
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,690
More fares.

102
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,396
Mmm. Is that why
you had your license

103
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,405
suspended nine times
for speeding?

104
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,997
But no accidents.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,337
Do you remember where I'm going?

106
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,808
70 Fleming.

107
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,743
Get me there before
I finish putting on my makeup

108
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,245
and I'll, uh, double the meter.

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,474
You serious?

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,382
Do I look like
I have a sense of humor?

111
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,884
Okay.

112
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,223
Hurry, open the gate!

113
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,695
Hey, Jimmy... ho, ho, ho, ho!

114
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,062
LAZY ASS! OPEN THE GATES!

115
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,465
I'M ON MY COFFEE BREAK.
SHUT UP, OLD MAN!

116
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,662
IT'S JIMMY, YOU FOOL!

117
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,567
DON'T RUN OVER THE CHICKENS!

118
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,736
You drive too fast!

119
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,353
Yeah, I got mascara
and eyeliner left.

120
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,328
You got five blocks.

121
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,966
Don't tell me
you're slowing down.

122
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,343
You know, you drive like
an old woman.

123
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,110
Hmm.

124
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,279
You're not scared, are you?

125
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,816
Hey, you!
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,911
Back off, buddy.

127
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,353
She's mine.

128
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,947
Oh, it's you, miss.

129
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,220
Well, you lived up
to your reputation.

130
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,227
The job is yours.

131
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,956
I have a job. A good one.

132
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,931
Oh, yeah? How much do you
make at this "good job"?

133
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,264
$475 a week, plus tips.

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,600
So how would you like to make
$2,000 a week

135
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,071
plus room and board?

136
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,368
When do I show up?

137
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,398
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

138
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,639
You'll be driving
Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.

139
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,340
Good day, miss.

140
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,713
Now, you!
Out of here!

141
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,748
Good morning, Mr. Tong.

142
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,000
Huh.

143
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,518
You put your face on
without me, huh?

144
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,291
Please have a seat.

145
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,330
Those are the house rules.

146
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,996
Memorize them.

147
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,939
Especially number one.

148
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,966
"Never talk directly
to Mr. Devlin."

149
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,136
If you have any questions

150
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,645
you'll find
all the answers in there.

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,741
And, if I were you, I'd get rid
of the mildew on the chin.

152
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,309
My soul patch?

153
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,344
Uh, yeah.

154
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,424
You like working
for this Devlin guy?

155
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,359
I don't work for him.

156
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,313
I'm not a professional driver,
but I'd always believed

157
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,619
that thing you're staring
into is designed

158
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,922
for the monitoring of traffic,
not passengers.

159
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,019
Am I wrong?

160
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,131
While I'm really enjoying
our time together

161
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,261
shall we try moving?

162
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,734
Wallace has been my partner for years.

163
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,904
Something's happened to him.

164
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,072
He wouldn't just disappear.

165
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,206
Now, you get your job done

166
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,215
and find my partner.

167
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,341
So tell me how.

168
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,907
You're the head
of an intelligence agency.

169
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,976
Why don't you be intelligent?

170
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,680
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

171
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,813
Well, why don't you call me back

172
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,448
when you do understand
what I'm talking about.

173
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,487
Did we just take
the Balsam Road exit?

174
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,498
Of course.

175
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,864
You have to take
the surface street.

176
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,760
Sorry.

177
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,737
Did you get a copy
of the rules?

178
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,866
Did you read them?

179
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,101
Jimmy, let me tell you
something, my friend...

180
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,778
I hate the rules.

181
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,112
Take Grant Boulevard
all the way.

182
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,117
The lights are timed.

183
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,618
Thank you.

184
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,144
And, Jimmy...

185
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,157
crank the music up.

186
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,818
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,490
C.S.A. HEADQUARTERS

188
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,797
Deputy Director Chalmers,
ladies, gentlemen

189
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,702
I present to you
Special Agent Wallace.

190
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,866
Deceased two days, 14 hours,
five minutes... approximately.

191
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,535
Pretty interesting.

192
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,601
Now, why don't you, uh,
tell me a little about him?

193
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,637
Well, in simplest terms,
he drowned in his bathtub.

194
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,615
Contusion here suggests
he hit his head

195
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,914
fell prone, unconscious.

196
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,113
The man infiltrated
a Serbian death squad

197
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,348
with not even a scratch.

198
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,482
He goes down in a bathtub?

199
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,491
Life's a bitch.

200
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,822
You want to put him
back in the fridge?

201
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,589
He didn't drown, sir.

202
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,653
He was murdered.

203
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,394
Does that make life
a little less bitchy?

204
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,299
And-and you would be?

205
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,928
That's Del Blaine, sir.

206
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,598
She's having a filter installed

207
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,664
between her brain and mouth
next week.

208
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,801
So you don't think he drowned?

209
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,176
Well, sir, there was water
in his lungs

210
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,578
but the pulmonary vein

211
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,275
was filled with
collapsed platelets

212
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,647
indicative of dehydration.

213
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,118
He died of thirst.

214
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,120
Thirst.

215
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,382
And it wasn't just
city tap water.

216
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,253
The mineral profile fit
a high-end bottled water

217
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,518
but what was really weird
is that

218
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,685
it contained a strain
of bacteria that I, so far

219
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,092
haven't been able to culture.

220
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,896
Anyway, uh... didn't
mean to interrupt.

221
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,061
Ooh, the woman seems to know
a lot about water.

222
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,163
Yeah. She thinks she knows
a lot about a lot of things.

223
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,970
You know, we have a special
situation in the field.

224
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,408
I think we could use
your talents.

225
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,708
You interested?

226
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,179
When do I start?

227
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,772
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?

228
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,579
Rumors and innuendo.

229
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,108
Del, I could tell you
a thing or two

230
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,414
about Clark Devlin.

231
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,888
Uh, you think we
could keep our minds

232
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,720
out of the gutter
for about a second?

233
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,918
Meet me upstairs
in an hour.

234
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,654
You might just become

235
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,286
Clark Devlin's next partner.

236
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,853
I'm going to need

237
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,196
that Gerris marginalis
as soon as possible.

238
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,825
Yes. My contacts in Guatemala

239
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,529
have what you're looking for,
I'm sure.

240
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,902
Good.

241
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,201
And, meanwhile...

242
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,243
I'll take one of these
beautiful Uticella marginalis.

243
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,039
Just gorgeous.

244
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,687
Now, you're going to call me?

245
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,018
Is your phone number on file?

246
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,284
I'm having a bit of trouble

247
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,053
with the phones at the moment.
It might be better

248
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,559
if you dropped it off yourself.

249
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,754
It may take a while.

250
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,762
Well, why don't you

251
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,161
familiarize yourself
with the route?

252
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,189
There's a little gathering
at my house tonight...

253
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,361
a fund-raiser for
the Natural History Museum.

254
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,200
I would so love to have you.

255
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,737
Should I send a car?

256
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,504
I drive myself.

257
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,840
Admirable.

258
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,779
Eight o'clock.

259
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,839
And, uh, be sure
not to wear anything

260
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,579
too distracting, or no one
will get their checkbooks out.

261
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,490
How did you learn
to be so smooth?

262
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,515
I've seen the way you drive.

263
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,550
And the same instincts I do.

264
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,856
You lack confidence.

265
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,524
The girl in the art gallery's
not beyond you, you know.

266
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,827
You know about her?

267
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,333
Every time we leave the house

268
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,359
we go by the art gallery
and slow down.

269
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,700
You just need a little polish.

270
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,731
I'll never be a Clark Devlin.

271
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,766
Don't tell anyone this, Jimmy,
but there's a lot less

272
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,745
to Clark Devlin
than meets the eye.

273
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,871
I've got a couple of good lines

274
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,279
and a couple of
very expensive suits.

275
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,907
Apart from that,
we're exactly the same.

276
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,918
How about
a couple hundred million?

277
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,476
Trust me...
90% of it is clothes.

278
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
The other ten percent?

279
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,553
The other ten percent's
in there.

280
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,989
You've got plenty of it.

281
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,256
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
can I ask you a big favor?

282
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,489
Yeah?

283
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,895
Can I stop wearing my hat?

284
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,805
All right.

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,864
Thank you.

286
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,205
No, just stay smooth.
Remember... smooth.

287
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,369
Thank you.

288
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,471
Steena, Devlin.

289
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,177
This driver, this Jimmy,
I like him.

290
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,413
Let's get him a proper suit.

291
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,852
Something sexy. You pick it out.

292
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,822
All right.

293
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,518
Always a delight
talking to you, too, darling.

294
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,293
Home, James.

295
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,956
Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.

296
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,039
Oh!

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
Oops.

298
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,512
Watch your step.

299
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,310
Thank you, sir.

300
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:37,578
Oh...
This definitely not a rental.

301
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,583
Hello.

302
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,517
My name's Clark Devlin.

303
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,611
Would you like to dance?

304
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,315
Would you like to dance?

305
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,491
Admirable.

306
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,128
There is just one rule.

307
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,093
Never touch my tuxedo.

308
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,263
I didn't.

309
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,362
Good.

310
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,804
Don't.

311
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,774
Yes, sir.

312
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,107
Jimmy.

313
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,134
Get the car.

314
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,339
Let's go for dinner.

315
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,413
Yes, sir.

316
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,126
What'll you have? It's my treat.

317
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,156
Anything.

318
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,168
All right.

319
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,693
Two Whoppers,
hold the onion, extra ketchup.

320
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,467
Toast the bottom bun only,
medium well-done.

321
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,700
Two large fries,
extra well-done.

322
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,733
Two chocolate milkshakes,
however the chef likes.

323
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,744
That's it.

324
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,678
Your order's ready.
Pull forward.

325
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,215
That's pretty quick.

326
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,742
It's fast food. Anything else?

327
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:49,811
Yeah.

328
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,846
I'll have a personal pizza,
crispy crust.

329
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,721
He doesn't eat out much.

330
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,421
They don't serve pizza
at Burger...

331
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,194
New item, huh?

332
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,101
Do you have chicken chow mein?

333
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,861
Thank you.

334
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,169
- Jimmy?
- Yes?

335
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,203
It's a drive-through.
Let's drive.

336
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,646
Watch out!

337
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,414
Watch it, man!

338
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,653
Sorry, pal.

339
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,785
Let's go.

340
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,539
Why are we running away

341
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,700
from a skateboard?

342
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,471
I think it's probably a bomb.

343
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,477
I thought you said a bomb.

344
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,882
What do you mean, a bomb?

345
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,558
No good. Out!

346
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,737
Mr. Dev...

347
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,670
Move!

348
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,086
Jimmy, you okay?

349
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,098
I'm fine.

350
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,326
You okay, boss?

351
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,834
Yeah.

352
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,668
Yeah, all in a day's work, eh?

353
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,570
Look.

354
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,003
Oh, damn.

355
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,747
Mr. Devlin.

356
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,373
You got any aspirin?

357
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,440
Who did this to you?

358
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,850
Water stri...

359
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,820
Walter Strider... he's the one?

360
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,652
Wat... er... stri...

361
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
Walter... Walter Strider.

362
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,525
No... no police.

363
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,358
Okay. Uh...

364
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,227
I need an ambulance right now.

365
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,458
His name is...

366
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,366
Trust nobody.

367
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,994
Uh... his name is...

368
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,567
Brad Dillford.

369
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,141
Wear it.

370
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,050
Wear...

371
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,089
Boss! Boss!

372
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,127
Hold on, boss. You'll be fine.

373
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,430
Give me the clipboard.

374
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,436
I'll take care of you.

375
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,030
Wa...

376
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,563
stri...

377
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,802
- Huh?
- Sir!

378
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,866
Oh!

379
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,309
Please wait in the waiting room.

380
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,312
Okay.

381
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,314
I will find Walter Strider.

382
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,315
Hey! Hey!

383
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,941
Huh? I'm sorry.

384
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:41,612
I promise.

385
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,815
What do you want

386
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,290
my mother's maiden name for?

387
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,589
Last time she was
in here, I was born.

388
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,119
I'm sure my dad had something
to do with it

389
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,153
at least I hope so.

390
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,224
Dr. Angela.

391
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,327
Where is Dr. Angelo?

392
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,496
Dr. Angelo.

393
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,132
Are you Dr. Angela?

394
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,309
Dr. Angela.

395
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,939
Dr. Ang... ela.

396
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,970
Hey!

397
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,746
There's no smoking
in a hospital.

398
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,377
I was nervous. How is he?

399
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,717
He might be here a while.

400
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,949
You might want to get him

401
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,617
some things from home
in case he comes to.

402
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,683
Oh.

403
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,125
He had this clutched
in his hand.

404
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,628
I don't know
if it means anything.

405
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,995
"Orderly with wheels

406
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,431
to the front desk."

407
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,834
I do need Dr. Angelo.

408
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,837
Dr. Angelo.

409
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,499
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.

410
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,441
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

411
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,146
BANNING, INC.,
FLOATING HEADQUARTERS

412
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,744
I'll tell you,
I'm pretty excited.

413
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,415
I mean, nervous,
but I'm excited.

414
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,753
I'm pumped, you know.

415
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,850
I knew I was doing good work
for Banning International

416
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,155
but I didn't know Mr. Banning

417
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,128
would be taking so much notice
of me so soon.

418
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,154
I'll say this, though,
when I'm CEO of this place

419
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,597
I won't be having
my headquarters

420
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,464
in the bottom of a boat,
you know what I mean?

421
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,734
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?

422
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,366
He questioned my growth projections.

423
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,815
No, that's not it.

424
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,978
I don't like his hair.

425
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,247
Mr. Banning.

426
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,056
So, word filtered
down to me

427
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:33,155
that you don't share my optimism
about our company's future.

428
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,063
Oh, no.

429
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,032
Actually, I just...

430
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,863
Drink?

431
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,233
Oh, yes, thank you.

432
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,067
I just felt that to meet

433
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,573
your projections, pretty much
every person on Earth

434
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,871
would have to drink
only Banning Springs water.

435
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,502
Yes, indeed.

436
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,981
Water, Mr. Lundeen,
comprises 60% of your body.

437
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,915
Don't you find it incredible

438
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,613
that two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom can combine

439
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,383
to create something
so beautiful

440
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,117
so useful, so essential?

441
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,182
I find water to be

442
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,387
miraculous.

443
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,089
Do you think I'm silly?

444
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,722
Not at all.

445
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,764
Feeling thirsty?

446
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,429
Yes.

447
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,098
You're helping me out
by being a guinea pig

448
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,437
for a new product.

449
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,406
Oh, I see.

450
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,239
What a brilliant idea.

451
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,677
Water that makes you thirsty.

452
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,704
What's in it?

453
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,772
Salt?

454
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,543
There's no profundity in salt.

455
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,779
Bacteria.

456
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,881
Once ingested

457
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,553
its DNA will instruct
your cells' cytoplasm

458
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,655
to spill electrolytes
into your bloodstream

459
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,996
causing dehydration.

460
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:43,830
It's virulent

461
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,961
but, unfortunately,
it's too fast.

462
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,266
Way too fast.

463
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,139
As we speak, your internal
organs are shriveling.

464
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,078
You're becoming as dry as...

465
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,082
Well, as dry
as your limited imagination.

466
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,519
Gentlemen,
fetch the vacuum, won't you?

467
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,583
Thank you.

468
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,857
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf,
Sondheim, Springsteen...

469
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,028
No Strider.

470
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,876
Wow.

471
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,942
Welcome to the Tactical Uniform
Experiment.

472
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,749
Tuxedo recognizing new user.

473
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,589
Mapping user's
neurological structure.

474
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,220
Activate wristwatch
for desired function.

475
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:54,999
Demo...

476
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,557
Okay, show me.

477
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,636
Uh-oh.

478
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,467
Caution... demolition mode.

479
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,904
The Tuxedo will consider

480
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,808
any object a target
and act to destroy it.

481
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,186
Oh, what's happening?

482
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,418
Exit the demolition mode
immediately.

483
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,174
Mr. Devlin, is everything
all right?

484
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,541
This is Jimmy.

485
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,978
I think Mr. Devlin wants you
to clean his room tomorrow.

486
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,948
It's a little bit messy.

487
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,177
I think he threw the party.

488
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,480
Should I send someone up now?

489
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,077
No. Maybe after he leaves.

490
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,110
Very good.

491
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,756
Hmm?

492
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,360
Hello?

493
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,594
Are we on?

494
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,568
Are we on what?

495
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,570
C.S.A. OPERATIONS

496
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,663
I take my work seriously,
Mr. Devlin, so please

497
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,934
stop using
that ridiculous accent.

498
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,941
What?

499
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,999
What accent?

500
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,032
All right.

501
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,101
You're the senior officer.

502
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,407
I'll play it however you want.

503
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,812
Deitrich Banning is holding
a meeting with water CEOs.

504
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,817
The Agency wants us to find out
what he's planning.

505
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,479
Wh-What about Walter Strider?

506
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,953
Who is he?

507
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,819
I don't know. You tell me.

508
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,051
Okay.

509
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,855
So, we will meet tomorrow.
V-15, 10:00.

510
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
I'll be wearing a gray suit.

511
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,265
Your code is "nice rack."

512
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,267
I'll respond

513
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,031
"I forgot my bra."

514
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:14,732
That passes

515
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,330
for humor around here.

516
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,671
10:00, V-15.

517
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,472
What's the cross street?

518
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,602
Very funny.

519
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,983
May I join you?

520
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,650
Uh, yeah.

521
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,993
Nice rack.

522
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,900
Hello.

523
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,343
Mr. Devlin, there's been
a change of plans.

524
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,846
But I'm here already.
Where are you?

525
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,211
Don't get all pissy about it.

526
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,977
They just told me,
so I'm telling you.

527
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,143
We'll meet tonight

528
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,675
8:00, Pier 17,
base of the silo and...

529
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,813
forget the password.

530
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,156
Oh, now you tell me.

531
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,717
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

532
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,729
I got to go.

533
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,730
Guy in the raincoat. Get him!

534
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,731
I see you tonight. Sorry.

535
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,732
Stop!

536
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,165
Get back here, you creep!

537
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,382
So, we've got five minutes
to get into position.

538
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,587
I secured the rooftop.

539
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,027
The equipment's good to go

540
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,257
and I just have to say

541
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,290
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

542
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,395
Clark Devlin?

543
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,437
I'm Del Blaine.

544
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,308
Have we met before?

545
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,245
No.

546
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,838
Good.

547
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,679
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

548
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,709
I'll follow you.

549
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,515
Ladies first.

550
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,786
Okay.

551
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,190
A couple of details changed
from what was in the file.

552
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,219
You read it?

553
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,231
The files are crap.

554
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,357
Give me the
short version.

555
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,061
Deitrich Banning's
holding a meeting

556
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,434
of international
water company CEOs.

557
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,699
We think he's trying
to force them

558
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,070
into selling
their companies to him.

559
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,301
Where are you going?

560
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,365
Huh?

561
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,637
I'm thinking.

562
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,338
We had Agent Wallace
working undercover

563
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,641
at his bottled water factory.

564
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,874
That is, until last week.

565
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,506
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

566
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,177
to tell us that the operation
had reached critical mass

567
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,379
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

568
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,762
As you requested, a Klineholtz
bolt-action nine-millimeter

569
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,101
titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope

570
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,164
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

571
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,176
My favorite gun.

572
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,577
But I don't kill
people anymore.

573
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,581
Killing?

574
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,378
You're planting a bug.

575
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,909
It was all in that "crap" file.

576
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,750
Go look through your binoculars.

577
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,792
They're arriving.

578
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,795
Ready?

579
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,059
It's critical we get
a listening device

580
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,690
in Banning's meeting.

581
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,530
Range... 962 feet.

582
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,432
Aim for the briefcase.

583
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,441
Should be a piece
of cake for you, sir.

584
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,284
You kind of missed.

585
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,317
In the year 2001

586
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:01,382
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

587
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,088
Today, bottled water costs more
per gallon than gasoline.

588
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,395
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

589
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,196
We at Banning Springs

590
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,532
have developed
a new filtration process

591
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,128
that would protect your assets

592
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,539
against the biological holocaust
that's coming.

593
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,133
Looks like we got company.

594
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,439
CSA would be my bet.

595
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,412
You've heard what I have to say.

596
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,043
Now I'd like to hear you.

597
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,144
How much is this plan
going to cost us?

598
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,656
It won't cost you a penny,
out of pocket.

599
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,055
All I ask is to become

600
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,821
your slightly-more-
than-equal partner.

601
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,056
Banning says he's got
the only process

602
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,586
to make their water safe.

603
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,121
But to use it,
they've got to give him

604
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,963
half of their companies?

605
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,263
He's trying to muscle
these guys

606
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,271
into selling
their companies to him.

607
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,034
Banning says that their
water sources are in danger.

608
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,337
Something about everyone
being defenseless

609
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,206
against more deadly
forms of bacteria.

610
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,439
I can barely make out
what he's saying.

611
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,208
Do you want to listen to this?

612
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,284
What do you think
that means, sir?

613
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,287
Del Blaine!

614
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,585
Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

615
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,683
Yeah, I'd really like
some help up here, sir.

616
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,052
Del Blaine!

617
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,893
Do you hear me, sir?

618
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,558
I know this is not
near as exciting

619
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,091
as most of your missions,
but could you humor me

620
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,830
with just a little
professionalism?

621
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,304
I would really
love some help...

622
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,602
What are you doing?

623
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,673
What's with the jumpy-jumpy?

624
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,680
Take off your headphones!

625
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,113
- What?
- Your headphones!

626
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,859
Okay, Chapter Six
of the training manual.

627
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,758
Unarmed assailant...
frontal attack.

628
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,092
Begin!

629
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,098
Stomach, head! Stomach, head!

630
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,137
God!

631
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,167
What's my name?!

632
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,406
Yeah!

633
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,950
You okay?

634
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,056
Oh! Where the hell
have you been?!

635
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,860
Stop pushing!

636
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:21,762
Aah, my hand!

637
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,596
Whoa!

638
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,041
Yeah! Not bad.

639
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,481
Sir?!

640
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,476
Sir, are you okay, sir?

641
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,126
Don't let go! Don't!

642
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,127
No, no, no, let go!

643
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,990
You're-you're-you're ripping...

644
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,522
my sl-sleeve! You-you...

645
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,027
No, no. No, not, not my...

646
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,972
Sir!

647
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,271
My ring.

648
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, my God!

649
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,014
Oh, my... Oh!

650
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,737
This was not...
part of the plan.

651
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,545
Del Blaine?

652
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,950
Del...

653
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,427
Confidence.

654
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,805
Del...

655
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,148
Nice of you, moron.

656
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,048
Not in the manual.

657
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,088
Creep!

658
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,915
Del Blaine! Stop!

659
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,691
Get off of me!

660
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,119
Why didn't you stop?

661
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,925
God, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

662
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,727
How do you...
fall off a building

663
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,324
and end up... uh...

664
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,665
You okay?

665
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,068
Would you stop that?

666
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,045
It's okay.

667
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,410
I am in the car
with a psychopath.

668
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,438
We are not safe.

669
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,575
Are you upset?

670
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,777
Why would I be upset?

671
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,150
I've always wanted
to begin and end my career

672
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,779
with a big fat failure!

673
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,154
Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin.

674
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,216
It's my first time.

675
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,354
I mean... every mission
is like my first time.

676
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,560
It's so difficult
being Clark Devlin.

677
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,966
Oh.

678
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,436
Sorry.

679
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,830
Aah!

680
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,603
I didn't do that.

681
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,612
What...

682
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,012
i-is wrong with you?!

683
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,448
I'm not who you think I am.

684
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,609
Stay away!

685
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,211
I'm a little over-amped
myself right now.

686
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,846
Let's just call it a day.

687
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,789
Get some rest and medication.

688
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,654
What?

689
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,785
We'll be in communication.

690
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,885
Oh.

691
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,730
I don't have your phone number!

692
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,469
C.S.A. TARGET RANGE

693
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,376
Who am I kidding?

694
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,005
I have no idea what I'm doing

695
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,208
or why I'm doing it.

696
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,409
I felt the same way

697
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,112
when I took my first
field assignment.

698
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,244
Then I met Clark Devlin

699
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,777
and life just got
a whole lot better...

700
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,154
and a little more complicated.

701
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,681
Let's, uh, can we get
a close... can we...?

702
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,624
How do we pan down...

703
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,922
Yeah. Just hit the
second button there.

704
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,521
DEL:
Everybody warned me,
he was unorthodox

705
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,532
but he's way irrational,
bordering on nutso.

706
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,261
We'll just get, uh... That's it.

707
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,928
There, yeah. That's it, there.

708
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,027
Look at that.

709
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,799
Move it over, over just a bit.

710
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,101
He's getting under your skin,
isn't he?

711
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,335
He got under my skin once

712
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,207
and I'm still feeling it.

713
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,878
Yeah, you told me.

714
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:12,939
What about his English?

715
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,213
Oh, I can never understand
half of what he says

716
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,913
but don't you just love
his accent?

717
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,785
She can't hear
anything from here...?

718
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,653
No, I don't think... Whoa!

719
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,216
God, I wish I was
still back in the field.

720
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,356
How do you like me now?

721
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,766
She's got issues, man.

722
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:37,774
Holy...

723
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,900
Can your, uh, can your

724
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,068
girlfriend shoot, uh...

725
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,304
A groin out of a target?

726
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,312
Let's go.

727
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,211
Let's get our nails done.

728
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,512
Okay.

729
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,484
Have a nice day, boys.

730
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,444
"Dr. Angelo, Dr. Angelo..."

731
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:56,357
They ran out of "Get well soon."

732
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,021
You said to wear this,
but I don't know.

733
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,055
Being Clark Devlin is not easy.

734
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,800
Hello.

735
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,000
So, Mr. Devlin

736
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,508
how are you feeling today?

737
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:14,871
Not so good, I'm afraid.

738
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,573
Well, you've got a few hours

739
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,171
to pull yourself together.

740
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,239
What do you mean?

741
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,717
After the fiasco
of planting the bug

742
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,776
I'd say we have
only one choice:

743
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,311
Level One surveillance.

744
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,322
In other words...

745
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,550
Infiltration.

746
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,320
Banning's going to be at
the Lanford Hotel tonight

747
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,293
entertaining three
of his new partners.

748
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,491
Chalmers has agreed to...
get us at the next table.

749
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,431
Is this a black-tie event?

750
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,991
No. But I'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

751
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,663
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.

752
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,262
Meet you there at 8:00.

753
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,603
Water... strider...

754
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,607
What?

755
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,630
Water...

756
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,337
Mr. Clark Devlin.

757
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,470
Stri... der...

758
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,673
What are you doing?

759
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,011
Huh?

760
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,482
Uh, he needs help.

761
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,109
Security! Security!

762
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,350
Del Blaine.

763
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,442
Hey.

764
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,113
I know how partial you are
to that monkey suit of yours

765
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,349
so I got gussied up.

766
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,414
Good job. You gussy very well.

767
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,154
Oh, and here's a little
something for you.

768
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,422
Hmm?

769
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,451
Oh.

770
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,293
Thank you.

771
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,162
Sorry, I don't have
anything for you.

772
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,895
It's a video camera.

773
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,594
Shh. Act normal.

774
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,570
We don't want everybody to know.

775
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,593
Sorry.

776
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,606
Good evening.

777
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,607
Good evening.

778
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,630
Uh, name, please.

779
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,642
Name?

780
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:53,734
Um...

781
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,271
Lincoln.

782
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,047
Washington.

783
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,615
Washington.

784
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:09,749
You're a billionaire

785
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,227
and you try to grease
the guy with seven bucks?

786
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,162
You think I have money
to throw away?

787
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,496
You on the list?

788
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,693
Perfect.

789
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:18,723
Let me talk to him.

790
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,327
No. You know what,
we'll do this my way.

791
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,861
I've got a T-135
disorientation module.

792
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,271
You just stand there.

793
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,869
Hi. Could you...
hold this for me?

794
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,572
Aw, thanks.

795
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,447
Now, where did I put
those tickets?

796
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,446
What's happening, Snowman?

797
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,578
What's happening?

798
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,418
What's happening, Snowman?

799
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,514
What's happening, Snowman?

800
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,286
Hey... what's happening?

801
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,258
Oh, hey.

802
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,288
I can't believe it.

803
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,960
James Brown.

804
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,868
The Godfather of Soul.

805
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,301
- What's happening?
- Hello.

806
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,330
Mr. Brown.

807
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,603
Forgive us for bothering you.

808
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,543
We came to see your show and...

809
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,205
Yeah, she forgot
to make reservations.

810
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,214
Don't worry about it.

811
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,545
I can get tickets
for the front row for you.

812
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,743
Oh, thank you very much,
Mr. Brown.

813
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,149
See? The things work out.

814
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,053
There's one more thing
I'd like to say, um...

815
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,784
It's not the in thing today

816
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,189
to give compliments
to a young lady

817
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,318
but I just got
to let you know that...

818
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,159
you got a nice rack.

819
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,688
Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.

820
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,893
Enjoy the show.

821
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,067
What...

822
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,401
is wrong with you?!

823
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,099
He f-fell down by himself.

824
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,869
You killed James Brown.

825
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,137
No, he's fine.

826
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,302
He's not fine.

827
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,471
And Banning is going to leave.

828
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,480
Don't panic.

829
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,947
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

830
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,244
Are you... praying?

831
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,014
Miss Cleo told me
this would happen.

832
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,918
$4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo?

833
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,855
Just go out and tell them

834
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,983
Mr. Brown is not here.

835
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,517
There will be another act.

836
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,722
Nice to meet you.

837
00:48:55,098 --> 00:49:02,800
And right about now,
it is style time!

838
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,003
If you will,
ladies and gentlemen

839
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:09,570
introducing the hardest-working
man in show business

840
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,945
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Dynamite...

841
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,213
James Brown!

842
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,851
Uh, l-ladies and gentleman...

843
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,054
What's going on?!

844
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,620
Mr. James Brown will not be
appearing tonight...

845
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,398
due to unforeseen circumstances

846
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,130
but stay right where you are

847
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,869
because the Lanford Hotel is
really proud to present

848
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,206
the Last Emperor of Soul.

849
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,542
And, um, well, here he is.

850
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,351
Hi.

851
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,910
Hi, everybody. Good evening.

852
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,957
How are you tonight?!

853
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,186
Go home!

854
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,595
Who wants to get funky tonight?!

855
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,153
Go ahead and make it funky.

856
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,460
Yeah.
