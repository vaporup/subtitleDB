1
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,067
<i>Eternity...</i>

2
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,246
<i>Why even have the word?</i>

3
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:44,219
<i>Nothing lasts forever.
Everyone knows that.</i>

4
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:22,134
<i>LAST LOVE, FIRST LOVE.</i>

5
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,460
What do you think?

6
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,057
Shanghai is just like Tokyo, isn't it.

7
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,195
Business is very competitive here.

8
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,366
Your two years here
will go by in a flash, Mr. Hayase.

9
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,973
When it's over,
you won't want to go home.

10
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,614
I'm Onda, Branch Manager.

11
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,795
Everybody, I'd like to introduce.<i>..</i>

12
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,229
Hayase Takashi,
from head office in Tokyo.

13
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,066
He's a talented designer.<i>..</i>

14
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,339
who's here to work with us...

15
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,449
So we can win out
in the Chinese market.

16
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,821
I ask you to help him get used
to things here as fast as he can.

17
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,291
Nice to meet you.

18
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,111
'Nice to meet you.'That's all.

19
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,841
A good businessman
doesn't waste words.

20
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:49,523
You must be tired. Take the
weekend and relax at the hotel.<i>..</i>

21
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,063
and be ready to go on Monday.

22
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,061
Your place will be ready tomorrow.

23
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:59,798
You're not drinking, Mr. Hayase!
Have some Lao Jiu.

24
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,639
I'm, uh, on the wagon.

25
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,567
Want some?

26
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,442
Hello, sir.

27
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,177
We have a reservation for
Mr. Hayase, from Imura Auto...

28
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,583
One moment...

29
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,453
No rest for the wicked!

30
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,460
I shouldn't say this,
but Mr. Hayase is not very sociable.

31
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,203
It was a sudden transfer.

32
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,770
And abroad, too. That's upsetting.

33
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,971
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

34
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,317
He's sure taking a long time
in the toilet.

35
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,649
Ah, Mr. Chen...

36
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,252
I thought you were gone.

37
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,419
I saw Mr. Hayase leaving.

38
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,203
Hello?

39
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,798
Excuse me?

40
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,036
Can you check on that gentleman?
I think he's drunk.

41
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,781
Are you all right, sir?

42
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,921
Have you checked in?

43
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,328
Speak Japanese, will you?!

44
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,133
Don't you know how?

45
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,702
Um...

46
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:04,538
I'm Hayase, of Imura Auto.
Could I have my key, please?

47
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,139
Min, come here.

48
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,676
He forgot his coat.

49
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:21,282
Take five, then we'll start again
from the top.

50
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,992
Lin, could I see you?

51
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,889
What is it?

52
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,868
What? Oh, no!

53
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,211
Professor?

54
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,789
Sir...

55
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,200
Is it true I failed
the make-up exam?

56
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,276
Well, I wouldn't quite
put it that way...

57
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,577
I'll do anything!

58
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,916
Please, sir!

59
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,211
Anything?

60
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,420
<i>Will you teach Chinese?</i>

61
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,256
Twice a week,
to a Japanese businessman?

62
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:43,989
Me?

63
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:50,397
I can't find anyone
who'll commit to six months.

64
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,907
I'd be very grateful
if you would...

65
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,445
Starting tonight at 6.

66
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,616
Here's the text.

67
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,955
Promise?

68
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,391
There she is!

69
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,633
Sucker!

70
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,404
You told him you'd do it?

71
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,306
I'm counting on you.

72
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,349
Oh, here's your test paper.

73
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,663
You did very well!

74
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:57,006
You're awful!
You were all in on this!

75
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,378
One, two... two days.

76
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,568
<i>Yes.</i>

77
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,008
You musn't get up!

78
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,810
You're on an IV, you know.

79
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,090
Wait here.

80
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,895
Doctor! Doctor!

81
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,222
<i>Stay still!</i>

82
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,029
Bring his file.

83
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,464
Calm down.<i>..</i>

84
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,842
<i>OK. Give him his clothes.</i>

85
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,181
Where did these come from?
All he had on was a shirt!

86
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,141
Here.

87
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,024
Yeah, we'll manage.

88
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,124
OK, fine.

89
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,763
It's only his first day!

90
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,561
Yes?

91
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,341
It's <i>s</i> Moriguchi.

92
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,441
Mr. Hayase says
he won't be in till this afternoon.

93
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:45,115
New-car sales in Shanghai are up
30 per cent in the first half alone.

94
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,678
No one knows how much
latent demand there is.

95
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:53,715
They like the extras on Japanese cars,
like navigation systems.

96
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,419
We're fully competitive that way.

97
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,260
I'm sorry. Something came up.

98
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,173
Over here, Mr. Hayase.

99
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,420
Are you on late shift?

100
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,480
Are you sick?

101
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,257
No. Watching my weight.

102
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,426
You don't have to
watch your weight!

103
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,590
Without these I'd bloat.

104
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,099
I could use some.

105
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,156
Another time.

106
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,606
I think the MX2
is the key to the market.

107
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,875
The dealers like it, too.

108
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,681
We'll need an advertising plan.

109
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,649
Price is a problem.

110
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,125
It costs four or five times
the average annual salary.

111
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,627
So we have to think about
what we can leave out.

112
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,731
I'll recheck the reports.

113
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,099
It's a Chinese course
for corporate students.

114
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,635
It starts tonight.

115
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:27,312
Twice a week for six months.
That should give you a start.

116
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,683
What's wrong?

117
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:15,765
This gentleman wants
his luggage.

118
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,597
Check the register again.

119
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,658
Yes, sir.

120
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
Min...

121
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,346
I'll handle it.

122
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,807
Oh, right...

123
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,742
Thank you... uh...

124
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:11,843
Hayase!

125
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,382
Sawai!

126
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,361
So you're in Shanghai.<i>..</i>
How are you doing?

127
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,989
I haven't killed myself.

128
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,605
Didn't the psychiatrist
say you were all right?

129
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:35,507
All the counseling in the world
doesn't help any.

130
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,142
It's been six months.

131
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,415
I know you can't just forget...

132
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,491
but you're still not yourself.

133
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,360
Yes, she betrayed you.

134
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,264
But that just shows how much
she was in love with Takimoto.

135
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,038
Look, let's just forget it.

136
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,946
I couldn't tell you, but I sensed that
from her parents at the funeral.

137
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,075
So forget it, OK?

138
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,977
I'm going.

139
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,487
It's still early!

140
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:24,051
No, I've got to move into
my new place tonight.

141
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,683
<i>OK.</i>

142
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,027
Get back to Tokyo in one piece.
I've got no one to drink with.

143
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,463
Don't worry. I'm fine.

144
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,063
See you.

145
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:43,877
Takimoto's still in hospital.
He must feel pretty bad...

146
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,083
about not dying with her.

147
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:12,829
Morning.

148
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,394
Careful!

149
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,771
Morning, Dad.

150
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,704
Don't be in such a rush!

151
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,206
Hi.

152
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,577
Sorry I'm late.

153
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,727
Poor Tohto!
Every morning the same!

154
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,941
I was late coming home,
and all these guys were hitting on me!

155
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,305
And you loved it!

156
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,103
Don't you worry about me?

157
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,007
You're tougher than me!

158
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:05,281
We're not kids anymore.
I, at least, am a grown woman.

159
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,518
We're the same age.

160
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:13,655
I need you to come to the University
twice a week and pick me up.

161
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,558
Twice?! I have to work!

162
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,737
So do I. I teach Chinese.

163
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,797
OK, OK.

164
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,773
Mr. Hayase... they've decided
on the MX2 name.

165
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,314
Did you see the e-mail?

166
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,268
Takimoto!

167
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:54,598
You're still up?

168
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Yeah.

169
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,469
<i>Rie brought us something to eat.</i>

170
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,938
Hi.

171
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,511
Since you were both up all night...

172
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,172
Um...

173
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,787
I gave it a name.

174
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,449
Yeah? What?

175
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,849
Don't laugh.

176
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,017
What?

177
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,787
How about 'Eternity'?

178
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,625
'Eternity'?

179
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,664
'The car you'll love forever'...

180
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,198
'Never to be forgotten.'

181
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,198
I like it. It's cool.

182
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,438
So let's suggest it
to the management.

183
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,638
Even if they listen to us or not.

184
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,046
That shouldn't be a problem.

185
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,144
We've sweated blood over it.

186
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:51,625
<i>'Eternity' ...a dream!</i>

187
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,997
But one to believe in.
It's our work, after all.

188
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:07,401
Mr. Hayase, I hear that you were
on the MX2 development team...

189
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,970
Wow! They've brought in
the heavy artillery!

190
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,908
I'm out of that now.

191
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:23,149
Was it something I said?

192
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:34,065
I made some changes after
the meeting. Could you check them?

193
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,236
You know Shanghai
better than I do.

194
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,799
Uh, sure.

195
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,936
Good night.

196
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
<i>Hayase...</i>

197
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,113
I'll come, too.

198
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,054
You're leaving now?

199
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,584
Why shouldn't I?
It's quitting time, isn't it?

200
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,650
'Night.

201
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,456
'Night.

202
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,520
Good night.

203
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,294
Take an umbrella.

204
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,536
It looks like rain.

205
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,646
Show up at your Chinese lesson
tonight, OK?

206
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,049
I've got hopes for you.

207
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,612
See you.

208
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:29,852
How do you do.
My name is Fang Lin.

209
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,252
Please sit down.

210
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,869
You're the teacher?

211
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,277
What did you do
to get roped into this?

212
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,982
Why don't we do this:

213
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,331
We'll both just pretend
that I'm coming for lessons.

214
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,363
Then you can go
hang out with your friends.

215
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,470
Then it's a deal?

216
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,047
Sit down please.
The lesson is still in progress.

217
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:42,420
You've come here for work.
This is my work. I am responsible.

218
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,356
There's the bell.

219
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,791
You were late.
I'll extend the lesson.

220
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,305
I'm sorry.

221
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,543
You were trying your best.

222
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,311
Here.

223
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,126
You'll catch cold.

224
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,952
See you.

225
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,587
Wait!

226
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,527
I'll come next time.

227
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,404
What's the matter?

228
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,512
What's with him?

229
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,275
Why?

230
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,851
He's kind of weird.

231
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,517
No, he's not.
He's my Japanese student.

232
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,926
You seem like friends.

233
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,991
What do you care?

234
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,822
Hey<i>!</i>

235
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,834
I came to give you a ride.

236
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,374
You don't have to come in the rain!

237
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,807
Hey, what's wrong with you?

238
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,077
At first I thought he was a jerk.

239
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,746
And?

240
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,950
He's nice.

241
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,718
To tell the truth, at first
I thought he was nice.

242
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,428
Then I thought he was a jerk,
then I decided he wasn't.

243
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,904
All because of an umbrella?

244
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,338
He must have been soaked!

245
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,341
I think he likes me.

246
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,077
What do you mean?
You only just met him.

247
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,777
So what?

248
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,018
I trust my instincts.

249
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,484
People are together for years
and still they break up.

250
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,222
You've never fallen in love
at first sight?

251
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,962
Well, you know.<i>..</i>

252
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,867
That's your problem.

253
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,334
Don't you care about love?

254
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,736
Sure I do.

255
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,064
Here.

256
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,398
No, thanks.

257
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,679
What's wrong with you today?

258
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,174
I'm not in the mood for milk.

259
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,812
What I need is a drink.

260
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,892
But isn't it great?

261
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:08,091
The lessons you got forced into
might turn out to be fun.

262
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:13,598
Hey, Sis...

263
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,339
can I ask a favor?

264
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,305
Mr. Onda will love this!

265
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,818
Mr. Hayase?

266
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:37,452
It's Fang. Thank you for
helping me out yesterday.

267
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,020
My umbrella?

268
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:47,402
I'd like to have our next lesson
at my home. Would you mind?

269
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,763
Uh, right now I'm...

270
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,741
A contract with
a big distributor like that!

271
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,506
All that talking paid off,
I guess.

272
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,701
Great!

273
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:02,418
So make sure you come, OK?
You promised.

274
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,609
<i>Hayase...</i>

275
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:05,713
In there.

276
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:06,911
Uh, OK.

277
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,015
He's busy, I guess.

278
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,889
Did he say no?

279
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,390
Then it's OK.

280
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,730
Yeah, I guess he just
couldn't talk in the office.

281
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,762
The Japanese are like that.

282
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,001
But you've got nerve, Lin.

283
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,738
What if he finds out?

284
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,737
He's too mature to get upset
over that.

285
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,384
Sounds like love at first sight!

286
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,820
For him, maybe.

287
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,220
I've never asked anyone out before.
I'll be mad if he doesn't come.

288
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,491
The peppers look fresh.

289
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,794
Are they?

290
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,597
Sure!

291
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,069
Then I'll have some.

292
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,135
Lin...

293
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,770
Lin?

294
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:16,178
I need some leeks and ginger.

295
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,449
Not right now!

296
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,869
Hello.

297
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,292
Mr. Hayase!

298
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:50,772
Mr. Hayase!

299
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,949
It's here. Come up!

300
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,110
Hello.

301
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,486
There's lots to eat.

302
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,857
But... our lesson?

303
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,394
We eat, we get to know each other,
and you learn new words.

304
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,627
Good idea, huh?

305
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,276
Did you make all this?

306
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,513
There's lots more. Sit down.

307
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,984
Is your guest here, Lin?

308
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,720
Hello.

309
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,730
This is Mr. Hayase.

310
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,033
This is my father.

311
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,036
Welcome. Sit down.

312
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,001
He says, 'Welcome.'

313
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,139
'Hayase'. How do you do.

314
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,243
'Pleased to meet you.'

315
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,572
Is it good?

316
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,240
Yes, it is.

317
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,233
He likes it.

318
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,714
Yes, Min is a very good...

319
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,246
We've already started.

320
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,785
You're late!

321
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,121
This is Mr. Hayase.

322
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,289
My elder sister, Min.

323
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,223
Let's have a drink.

324
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,988
Um...

325
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,660
<i>.</i>..'Pleased to.<i>..</i> Meet you.'

326
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,694
Please, sit down.

327
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,426
I'll do that.

328
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:02,778
My sister works in a hotel.
She speaks very good English.

329
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,240
Cheers.

330
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,654
Can you speak English?

331
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,495
What did you just say?

332
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,837
Um...

333
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:33,234
That your sister cooks very well.

334
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,499
Oh, no!

335
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,814
He says he thinks
that you did the cooking.

336
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,121
Well, since he knows,
go and make more, OK?

337
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,812
Oh, OK.

338
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,146
Thanks.

339
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:19,720
<i>Shanghai Mingliu Auto.</i>

340
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,557
Hello, Mr. Onda.

341
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,001
Let's get directly to the point.

342
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,764
We want to ask for one thing.

343
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,468
We'd like you to rethink the price
of the 'Eternity'.

344
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,873
What do you say?

345
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,885
We've worked hard
to reach the price we're at.

346
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,819
How much lower do you want?

347
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,016
12 per cent.

348
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,093
That'll be hard.

349
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:11,003
If that's the case, would you agree
to handle our line exclusively?

350
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,378
I wanted to ask 15 per cent.

351
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,972
However, I will agree...

352
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,644
to try and sell
5,000 of your cars a month.

353
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,051
You know our network.

354
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:36,713
Can any other dealer
do anything like that?

355
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,397
<i>What's the problem?</i>

356
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:50,573
He wants us to lower the price,
and he'll sell 5,000 a month.

357
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,869
5,000?

358
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,481
What, hamburgers?

359
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:02,817
How will he suddenly just start
selling 60,000 cars a year?

360
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,759
He'll be giving them away.

361
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:11,130
Mr. Hayase, isn't it?

362
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:19,999
I went to university in Japan,
so I speak Japanese.

363
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,742
Here I don't speak it.

364
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,107
'When in Home,' as they say.

365
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:34,286
Surely it's to be expected
we'd speak in Chinese here.

366
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:41,490
But you've apparently just arrived,
so today will be a special case.

367
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:49,000
Do you know how many cars
we sell in a year?

368
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,744
Do you know how many people
live in Shanghai.<i>..</i>

369
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,813
<i>and the three provinces
around it?</i>

370
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:06,253
We sell more than
100,000 vehicles a year.

371
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:14,157
There are 190 million people
in this Yangtzi Delta area alone.

372
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,061
That's 1.5 times
the population of Japan.

373
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,309
What did you come here for?

374
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:32,506
Why did you come to Shanghai?

375
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,274
To sell cars, I assume.

376
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,881
Are you really interested
in selling cars?

377
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:46,987
<i>Mr. Li...</i>

378
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,488
<i>a car...</i>

379
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:57,063
has certain characteristics,
and a policy behind its manufacture.

380
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:02,036
Those are values you ignore,
aren't they.

381
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,578
Or at least
you don't understand them.

382
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:17,223
We're not just making
a cheap automobile, you know.

383
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:22,658
'Eternity' isn't a car
for the mass market here.

384
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,790
Hayase!

385
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,666
What I want now
is a car for the masses.

386
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:33,408
Ordinary people don't drive
Mercedes or Volvos.

387
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:39,206
It's just because you aren't
a brand with high status.<i>..</i>

388
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:43,381
that we have
such high hopes for you.

389
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:49,815
'Eternity' is a fine car
for the mass market.

390
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:56,730
Buyers will find out
what a good car it is...

391
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:01,059
And value it for themselves.

392
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:16,432
Mr. Li.<i>..</i> We'll think about it and see
what we can do to improve the price.

393
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:25,255
Mr. Onda, I have great faith
in you.

394
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:34,117
Please remember, though,
that we can do fine without you.

395
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:45,477
I apologize. I spoke out of turn.

396
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,416
And I said things I shouldn't have.

397
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:57,326
However, you and I both.<i>..</i>

398
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,786
make a living selling cars.

399
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:05,765
If we don't sell cars,
we don't make a living.

400
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:12,904
You don't look to me
as if you understand that.

401
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:20,039
And to talk business
with someone like that...

402
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,443
is a waste of time.

403
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,091
Hayase!

404
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,511
You have to keep your hopes up.

405
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,056
As I've said before.<i>..</i>

406
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:13,465
you should be in hospital.

407
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,764
Will that make me better?

408
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,243
Will an operation cure me?

409
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,582
What do you want to do?

410
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,885
Go see a film?

411
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,546
Yeah! I'll go!

412
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,086
Lin?

413
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,117
Well...

414
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,559
Oh, that's right! Your lesson!

415
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:38,097
Oh, the Japanese guy!

416
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:43,803
Maybe we'll go to the movies.

417
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:49,107
But I'm hungry, so maybe
we'll just get something to eat.

418
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,769
Suit yourself!

419
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,708
You're resigning?

420
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:59,452
I see...

421
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:07,154
Your ex-boss, Sejima,
is an old friend of mine.

422
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,189
Unlike him, I had to
work my way up.

423
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:17,064
But back when we were in Planning
we got along really well.

424
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,609
We still competed a lot.

425
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,179
I heard what happened to you.

426
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:35,150
You'd taken a six-month leave,
but Sejima suggested you for here.

427
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,954
He's a high-flier
without much sympathy...

428
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:43,997
But he said a plodder like me
might be able to take care of you.

429
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,168
Let's take the rest of the day off.

430
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,567
Your day's shot anyway.

431
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:02,575
When I first came here.<i>..</i>

432
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,952
It was fields
where those skyscrapers are.

433
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:13,619
My title was 'Manager',
but it was just me and Mr. Chen.

434
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:20,433
I haven't told anyone yet...

435
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,568
but I'm posted back to Tokyo.

436
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,177
Of course that's only
after 'Eternity' is well on its way.

437
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:34,612
Which after today may not happen...

438
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,617
Well? Nice place, huh?

439
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,671
The simple life here
appealed to me.

440
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,903
I spend my weekends out here.

441
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,123
I had a similar experience
to yours.

442
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,992
My fathers company failed...

443
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,001
and he killed himself.

444
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,937
<i>So no university for me.</i>

445
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,540
You get hurt...

446
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,452
by things you can't control.

447
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:53,952
You can choose
either to do nothing.<i>..</i>

448
00:55:55,786 --> 00:56:00,201
or to try and do something
about it.

449
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,531
Know what I mean?

450
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,386
When things get rough,
come out here.

451
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,449
You can use the place
when I'm gone.

452
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:28,761
But in return, if all of you
don't run things right here...

453
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,564
I can't go home in peace.

454
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,551
'What do you like?'

455
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:47,437
'Who do you like?'

456
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,035
I'll lock up.

457
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,505
Thank you.

458
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:26,569
Good night.

459
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,079
Hello.

460
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,585
The office is closed.

461
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:44,227
I want to... see Mr. Li.

462
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:50,563
Uh, Imura Auto... Hayase.

463
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,037
I'm very sorry.

464
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,869
Office hours are over.

465
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:04,884
Uh, could I... Mr. Li...

466
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:07,213
If you insist...

467
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:18,624
I'm in a meeting.
Tell him to go away.

468
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,867
There's another guy like you
here to see me.

469
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:32,875
One of your employees.
The cheeky one.

470
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,683
Come on, will you!

471
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,624
Give me a hand!

472
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,226
Please!

473
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:56,927
What's wrong?

474
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,763
What do you want?

475
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,073
Hey! Driver!

476
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,274
It's right by here!

477
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,475
Get off!

478
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,845
Careful. You'll get hurt!

479
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,378
Go away! Go hustle
some girl who speaks Jap!

480
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,019
Driver!

481
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,332
Look, I haven't eaten all day!

482
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,867
What are you doing?!

483
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,132
Hey<i>!</i>

484
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,906
Come on, please!

485
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,447
Out of my truck!

486
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,312
Please! I mean it!

487
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:10,233
We've got to lighten the load.

488
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,761
It's moving! Get in!

489
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,147
We did it! Thanks!

490
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:58,207
Thank you!

491
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:34,046
One... two... three!

492
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,015
What?

493
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,231
I'm doing this for you!

494
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:45,588
OK, next.<i>..</i>

495
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:57,810
Hey, isn't this...

496
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:13,517
Lin's going to be mad
you didn't go for your lesson.

497
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,301
Come on!

498
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,104
Lin? Mr. Fang? You here?

499
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,546
Oh, man!

500
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:42,214
What's the matter?

501
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:43,849
I need a favor.

502
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,954
I had an accident with my truck.

503
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,292
What happened?!

504
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,457
The load shifted.

505
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,333
This man helped me out.

506
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,898
<i>Mr. Hayase...</i>

507
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,603
Take your coat off.

508
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,574
Look.

509
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:09,511
Can you fix that?

510
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,607
Sure.

511
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:11,914
That's some tear!

512
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:12,646
Where's Lin?

513
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:14,347
She's not back yet.

514
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,580
Uh-oh!

515
01:05:48,345 --> 01:05:49,346
Thanks.

516
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,683
Why did you take him home
before I got there?

517
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:54,882
I only took him to your place
because you might be there.

518
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,357
What's the point
if I didn't see him?

519
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:04,596
You're not really in love
with this guy, are you?

520
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,860
Why shouldn't I be?

521
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,826
Oh, come on!

522
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,906
You're not his type.
And anyway, he and Min...

523
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,372
What about Min?

524
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:25,717
There's something between them.

525
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,179
Don't be stupid.

526
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,925
No way! He's just friendly
because she's my sister.

527
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,621
I wonder.<i>..</i>

528
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,394
With men and women,
you never know.

529
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:42,159
What would you know?

530
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:45,463
You're just jealous.

531
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,567
I am not!

532
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,522
There's a dealer who says
he'll talk to us again.

533
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,715
<i>Will you come with me?</i>

534
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:07,191
Uh, sure, Mr. Hayase.

535
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,251
No problem!

536
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:10,123
Thank you.

537
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:12,655
<i>OK...</i>

538
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,259
I'll make some copies.

539
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,933
Mr. Hayase! Could I see you?

540
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,395
Yes?

541
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:26,409
Sorry about last night.

542
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,638
<i>Not at all.</i>

543
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:31,315
We didn't meet,
but the result's the same.

544
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,444
Great, huh?

545
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,221
We've signed the deal.

546
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,127
We'll be working together.

547
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,128
Mr. Onda...

548
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:21,130
<i>Mr. Hayase...</i>

549
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,567
Can you fix it?

550
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:37,934
Go away. I can't concentrate.

551
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,711
I'm checking to make sure.

552
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,717
You think I don't know my job?

553
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:48,922
You don't usually come anywhere
near me when I'm working.

554
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,383
Oh, you're home.

555
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,993
Hi.

556
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,592
No time for that!

557
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:07,104
It has to be cleaned
before we give it back to him.

558
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,967
Quick, quick!

559
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,074
<i>Hurry, Dad!</i>

560
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,382
Did you buy a new dress?

561
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,686
Show us!

562
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,749
Come on!

563
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,527
OK, OK!

564
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,364
Hey, it's a suit!

565
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,705
A present for him?

566
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,176
Gotta go.

567
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,576
See you.

568
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,002
Bye!

569
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:56,647
You've got a date
with that Japanese guy?

570
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,890
It's not a 'date'.

571
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:38,158
He's already left.

572
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:43,260
He was going to a concert
at the Shanghai Grand Theatre.

573
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:14,524
What's the matter?

574
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:21,403
I can't let myself.<i>..</i>

575
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,911
<i>.</i>..fall in love.

576
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,643
Min...

577
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,448
I promised to meet
Mr. Hayase tonight.

578
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,427
But I came home.

579
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:50,366
I had a feeling there was
something between you two.

580
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:56,941
Don't worry about Lin.

581
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:00,905
You're both my daughters.

582
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,846
I want you to remember
as many good things...

583
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,417
as you can.

584
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,861
Could you turn on
the radio, please?

585
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,465
But...

586
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:47,606
I love you.

587
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:58,918
I love you.

588
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,947
You deceived me!
You're horrible!

589
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,012
<i>Lin!</i>

590
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:42,262
Why are you meeting in secret?!

591
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,388
We weren't trying to hide.

592
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,727
My own sister!

593
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:48,158
I don't believe this!

594
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,630
It's not your sisters fault...

595
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:53,139
I hate you! Both of you!

596
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:55,369
I hate you!

597
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:57,832
<i>Lin!</i>

598
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:07,995
Doesn't she have...

599
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:12,631
any chance at all?

600
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,816
So Lin's not here...

601
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:44,424
You should be in hospital,
you know.

602
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:55,874
I want to be here with you and Lin
for every last minute that I can.

603
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:01,379
And Dad, I still don't want you
to tell her.

604
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:05,613
Lin's a big girl now.

605
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:10,580
You can't hide it from her forever.

606
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:20,957
I just don't want her worrying
or feeling sorry for me.

607
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:24,566
Whenever someone does.<i>..</i>

608
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:28,665
I start thinking about it
and I just feel sicker.

609
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:37,634
I want to stay here with you
as if nothing was wrong...

610
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:44,889
right to the end.

611
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:49,995
Otherwise I'll be too scared
to handle it.

612
01:30:33,395 --> 01:30:36,239
How long is this going to go on?

613
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:43,850
You're both awful.

614
01:30:51,013 --> 01:30:54,551
All this time
you knew I liked you.

615
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:02,600
Are you really in love with Min?

616
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:12,706
I never really compared
the two of you.

617
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,845
It's just...

618
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:21,414
I fell in love with Min.

619
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:25,617
But I won't be seeing her again.

620
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:30,296
I don't believe you!
You're just lying again.

621
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:45,001
No. There's such a thing as
unrequited love, you know.

622
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:46,978
I'm just like you.

623
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,038
Stop that!

624
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:52,882
Liar! It's all lies!

625
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:56,182
If Min didn't like you...

626
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,884
she wouldn't have.<i>..</i>

627
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,202
Lin...

628
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:24,482
let's go home.

629
01:32:26,608 --> 01:32:27,746
No!

630
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:33,787
You won't be seeing her again, huh?

631
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:36,288
You aren't here for me!

632
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:41,264
Why are you still lying to me?

633
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:44,136
Why are you doing this?!

634
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,192
<i>Lin!</i>

635
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,502
It's not like that!

636
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:48,563
Let go!

637
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:50,207
<i>Lin!</i>

638
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,836
Come on.

639
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:53,811
Dad...

640
01:32:53,869 --> 01:32:55,849
I'll talk to her.

641
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:56,746
No!

642
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:59,513
Come with me!

643
01:33:00,008 --> 01:33:01,487
We have to talk.

644
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:54,502
Goodbye.

645
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:23,996
<i>Min hasn't got long to live.</i>

646
01:35:26,755 --> 01:35:30,328
<i>The doctor told her that
six months ago.</i>

647
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:44,339
She didn't want you
to be unhappy.

648
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:49,687
She thought if you knew
you'd worry yourself sick.

649
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:55,156
She was afraid of that,
so she kept it a secret from you.

650
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,821
She also said she wouldn't see...

651
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,065
<i>Mr. Hayase again.</i>

652
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:11,198
Lin...

653
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,280
we have to leave Min free
to do what she wants.

654
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:33,491
Breakfast's ready. Lets eat.

655
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,506
Lin! Breakfast!

656
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,167
<i>Eat.</i>

657
01:36:51,773 --> 01:36:53,343
I'm not hungry.

658
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:54,808
Lin?

659
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:14,521
Hi.

660
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:18,404
Why did you have to pick today
to be late?

661
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:30,875
I'm going to work hard, save up
and buy a truck.

662
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:36,381
I'll start my own business
and buy you a huge condo.

663
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,757
The biggest there is.

664
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:51,127
No matter who you might love,
I love you.

665
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,923
I'm back.

666
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:15,158
Hi.

667
01:39:15,216 --> 01:39:16,422
You look busy.

668
01:39:16,484 --> 01:39:17,485
Tired?

669
01:39:17,552 --> 01:39:18,394
No.

670
01:39:18,553 --> 01:39:19,827
I'll take a break.

671
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:23,528
Want some tea?

672
01:39:30,532 --> 01:39:31,704
Why don't we...

673
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:35,371
go out for dinner tomorrow?

674
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:37,072
Sure!

675
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:42,243
It's been ages since I was out
with just the two of you.

676
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,512
I'm buying.

677
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:46,252
It sounds like fun.

678
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,762
Mr. Hayase!

679
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:10,176
Today I have a favor to ask.

680
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:16,751
Can we skip the lesson
and just go for a walk?

681
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:30,134
Would you mind
if I put my arm in yours?

682
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,403
I won't again.

683
01:40:56,684 --> 01:40:57,684
What?

684
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:06,728
Min's waiting in there.

685
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:15,446
Go on!

686
01:41:16,704 --> 01:41:17,705
Lin...

687
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:27,423
Goodbye. Be sure and come
to your next lesson.

688
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,588
Dad...

689
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:33,647
Did it work?

690
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:36,450
Like a charm.

691
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,091
Very good.

692
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:40,663
That was a great idea.

693
01:42:41,055 --> 01:42:43,592
Well, let's us go and eat.

694
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,196
Somewhere like that?

695
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:53,041
Let's go somewhere cheaper.

696
01:42:59,374 --> 01:43:00,374
<i>Dad!</i>

697
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:38,338
Hello?

698
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:43,150
You're here again?

699
01:44:45,746 --> 01:44:48,283
Me? Oh, not too bad.

700
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,650
Sorry?

701
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:52,018
Yo.

702
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,030
You look different.

703
01:44:57,525 --> 01:44:58,525
Yeah?

704
01:45:01,729 --> 01:45:02,730
I'm glad.

705
01:45:04,866 --> 01:45:06,209
I brought someone.

706
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:44,677
It's been a while.

707
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:47,674
Yeah.

708
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:56,186
Are you OK?

709
01:46:01,255 --> 01:46:05,362
There's nothing really
I can say to you...

710
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:13,901
But I had to atleast see you.

711
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:25,621
I know it's not something
I can apologize for...

712
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:35,064
I loved her every bit as much
as you did.

713
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:45,167
I just wanted to tell you that.

714
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:58,581
All the best.

715
01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:04,618
Oh...

716
01:47:07,154 --> 01:47:10,692
<i>.</i>..come back to work.

717
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:15,166
That's what I did.

718
01:47:33,848 --> 01:47:35,828
Let's have a drink.

719
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,655
Mmm!

720
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,721
<i>Will you have some wine?</i>

721
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,233
All right.

722
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:45,136
Thank you.

723
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:47,799
Min...

724
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:49,196
It's good!

725
01:47:53,067 --> 01:47:56,605
A <i>toast...</i>

726
01:47:57,705 --> 01:47:58,809
Welcome!

727
01:47:59,173 --> 01:48:00,652
Cheers.

728
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:06,647
Let's eat.

729
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:09,357
Help yourself.

730
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:11,086
I'm starving!

731
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:14,726
Hey, I've got an idea.<i>..</i>

732
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,097
What?

733
01:48:20,728 --> 01:48:22,401
Let's take a picture.

734
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:25,472
Sure!

735
01:48:30,371 --> 01:48:31,042
Here goes.

736
01:48:31,105 --> 01:48:33,381
Let me take it.

737
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:36,544
Over here.

738
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:45,094
Smile.<i>..</i> One, two, three.<i>..</i>

739
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:51,660
Take one of just me, will you?

740
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:53,630
OK. Then me, too.

741
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:54,694
Sure.

742
01:48:56,897 --> 01:48:58,570
Make me look good.

743
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:01,546
It's going to go up beside Mom.

744
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:51,551
Smile.<i>..</i>

745
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:02,670
One, two, three...

746
01:53:53,527 --> 01:53:54,528
<i>Eternity...</i>

747
01:53:55,462 --> 01:53:58,534
<i>Why even have the word?</i>

748
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:05,580
<i>But if eternity is
the accumulation...</i>

749
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,911
<i>of each second, each day...</i>

750
01:54:10,377 --> 01:54:14,086
<i>then I think now
I want to believe in it.</i>

751
01:54:17,217 --> 01:54:20,926
<i>Eternity doesn't belong
to one person alone.</i>

752
01:54:24,391 --> 01:54:28,840
<i>It's a hope
that connects you to someone...</i>

753
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:33,169
<i>that connects you
to something.</i>
