1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
...you don't even deserve sympathy

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,000
Hear Chuni Babu?
A courtesan talking of romance

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Am I to learn of her what love is,
what romance be? What is amour?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Love mirrored in your soul, amour
God's gift to life's design, romance

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
How regrettable Chuni Babu
Your friend possesses none...

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of soul, or intent or purpose

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,500
That thing you flash
time and again Dev Babu...

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
the money, it lies at the feet
of harlots in brothels

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,000
If you be so vain, return to me
what I spent on you

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Two nights

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You owe me 2 nights, Dev Babu.
No more shall I dance...

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
not until you come.
These eyes will await you

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,050
"F" for friendship, she came seeking,
you found a foe. You owe two nights

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,000
O'faithless lover

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Music plays

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let slip the veil

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the revelry begin

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- Revelry awaits you, Chandramukhi
- No Appa. Not until Dev Babu arrives

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Pure gold.
Custom made, in Lucknow

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
I also have a gold nose ring

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,500
I wish to tie the dancing bells
to your feet, Chandramukhi

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do wear the nose ring and
allow me to unscrew it afterwards

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Desist from such ardour Kali Babu.
Get too close and you will burn...

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in the very lamps that light up
nights of revelry

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At the next instance of insolence
I'll give you a nose ring and...

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the rest of the revelers
may take pleasure in unscrewing

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
In a marketplace
full of beauties...

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
such spirit
is what draws me to you

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
But the one you
await so eagerly...

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
has no interest
in you or your music

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,500
It was some Paro's firefly that ran
into your fires crying Paro-Paro

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,500
- Never will he return, Chandramukhi.
- He will come, he will Kali Babu

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
- You will see. That's from my heart.
- Why not take on a bet?

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If he doesn't come before
the candle has burnt out...

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
then you will wear these
dancing bells...

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,500
- ...only for my pleasure.
- I accept

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
And if he comes...

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
then you shall leave
wearing these very dancing bells

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Agreed

40
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,470
Whose footfall?

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,430
Whose shadow?

42
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,780
Who knocks at my heart?

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,120
Who is come?

44
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,320
Who paints me this emerald?

45
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,740
My joy...

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,380
is killing me

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,920
No Moon I ever desired...

48
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,970
nor stars I ever seeked...

49
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,440
complaints I have none...

50
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,130
every sorrow I have hidden...

51
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,650
every taunt I laughed off...

52
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,290
thorns I embraced...

53
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,350
their blossoms have wounded me

54
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,710
But whenever I have prayed...

55
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,390
of The Lord...

56
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,440
I have always seeked you

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,380
Who paints me this emerald?

58
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,380
Is killing me

59
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm slain

60
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Slain

61
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Slain

62
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,000
You aren't accustomed to the drink.
Why drink beyond your limits?

63
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,460
What fool drinks
to stay within limits?

64
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,600
I drink that I may force myself
to stay on...

65
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,000
looking at you,
tolerating you...

66
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,970
that I may lose my senses,
to help me forget Paro

67
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,500
But Chandramukhi...

68
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,520
such are memories of Paro,
they won't even let me lose my senses

69
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Why, after all I drink, do memories
of her haunt me day and night?

70
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Why...

71
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,850
oh why?

72
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,000
Why, does man become so naive?

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why make mistakes?

74
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Why... for foible...
so harsh a punishment?

75
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,000
Why?
As to be rent asunder?

76
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,500
One enters matrimony,
and the other...?

77
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,340
Slain

78
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,430
In what fain folly...

79
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
he forsakes the lotus...?

80
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,250
For a paper flower?

81
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,000
Dev Babu!

82
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,160
I... I fall

83
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,860
- Dev Babu
- Don't touch me! I despise you!

84
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,520
I can't bear to see woman
come to this. Begone

85
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,470
Never again shall
I stand at this door

86
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,920
But yes, whenever
I come to think of Paro, I shall

87
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,120
And come the guilt pangs,
I shall come

88
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,770
For where else can I go?

89
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,590
- There... I have sentenced myself.
- Why punish yourself so?

90
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,210
Because every day,
my heart is put to trial

91
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Me Lord!

92
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Me Lord!

93
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Me Lord!!!

94
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,580
"Every day,
this romance is tried"

95
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
"I... I object..."

96
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,140
But every day,
the verdict is the same

97
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
"Saraf Narayan Mukarji I object,
objection overruled!"

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
"Devdas Mukarji I object,
objection overruled!"

99
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,960
"You are convicted"

100
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,000
"You are guilty and you...
you drink till death."

101
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
"Yes Me Lord"

102
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
"No objection"

103
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,500
No...

104
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No... No...

105
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Paro

106
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,500
The new bride has laid to rest
all my worries

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,500
With Parvati's arrival our
lost days of joys are here again

108
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Meet Yashomati's mother-in-law.
This is Parvati

109
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,500
To Bhuvan Chaudhary,
you'd more likely be...

110
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
- ...a daughter than his wife.
- Whatever I am to him...

111
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you and I are like sisters.
We should be embracing each other

112
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
But you are many years
my elder

113
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,000
From what I see, in Manikpur,
wives are better endowed than daughters

114
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
- No Badi-Ma?
- Our daughters, we send away...

115
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,500
in hope that they will be cared for,
but we're disappointed. No, Badi-Ma?

116
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
Yashomati.
I was eager to meet you

117
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
We ought not to be cross with kin.
You and I are of the same age

118
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
So you decide,
how we will relate to each other

119
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Mother and daughter?
Or friends?

120
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,500
Ma

121
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,500
- What's this, Ma? All this...?
- Gifts, from your Ma

122
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You'll look great

123
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Parvati, will you keep to your daughter?
Won't you give us company?

124
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,000
I do not like the smoking pot.

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The smoking pot has pride of place, Parvati

126
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't think so, no pride in what
goes up in smoke

127
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,000
Wonderful, mother-in-law!
I delight in your words

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,500
I have been so eager to see you.
We missed each other's weddings

129
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My obeisances

130
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Touching your feet was a pleasure.
I have been given my wish

131
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How I wish I had attended
your wedding...

132
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
if only to have my wish of
pulling you up by your ear

133
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Why, pulling you up by the ear
was a pleasure

134
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
This first acquaintance,
I shall always remember, mother-in-law

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Remember the relationship too

136
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,210
Dev Babu. What happened?

137
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Dev Babu

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Dev Babu

139
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,770
If I am so despicable, if my touch
be so abhorrent, then why...

140
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,880
did you come into my life?

141
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
In my solitude I was content.
Why be my messiah of misery?

142
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,000
Chandramukhi?

143
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,450
That stopped the spasm didn't it?
Divert your attentions and...

144
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,190
- ...the deepest wounds may be healed.
- Which is what I am upto

145
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,030
Stop it, you've had enough

146
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,000
Why not say I've lived enough?

147
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How could I...?

148
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,770
You have Paro, memories of Paro
All I have is you, my Midas

149
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,970
A touch
and iron is made to gold

150
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,500
Are you pricing yourself or me?

151
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
In a world of relationships...

152
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,500
what value a woman
of easy virtue?

153
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Nothing

154
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,820
Besides, you won't even give me
the right to touch you

155
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:39,040
- Are you in love with me?
- Or you could ask me if I breathe

156
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,230
You breathe, Chandramukhi

157
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,520
What will you get out of it?
I have no home, no heart

158
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,630
Loving isn't only about receiving.
Love, I have traded many times

159
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,220
But loved, I have but once

160
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,660
Pour more into a chalice filled,
and what happens?

161
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,070
It spills,
to the ground

162
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,980
So too my cup floweth over,
with Paro

163
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,260
More can only spill...

164
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,980
to fall, and in the falling,
take you down too

165
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,800
But in the spilling, the wine
must've been caressed by the chalice

166
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,140
Then spill...

167
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,590
some more

168
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,780
Where is Devdas?
I must see him

169
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,550
- Asleep. You can't see him now.
- Can I not? I'm here to take him

170
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,650
I'm not leaving him
in this hell

171
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Dharamdas!

172
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,340
- Master...!
- Who gave you my whereabouts?

173
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,260
Chuni Babu

174
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,510
Babu-ji...

175
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,060
Babu-ji won't even see my face.
Why has he sent you?

176
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,180
Anyway, he will be displeased
to see me as I am

177
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,570
Sir Narayan Mukherjee will have
to hang his head in shame

178
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,200
- Go! Go Dharamdas, go away.
- Listen Deva...

179
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,970
Your father is no more

180
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,050
Too bad

181
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,000
All of a sudden... how...?

182
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
He was a nice man

183
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,590
Such men aren't born too often

184
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,500
He was a good man

185
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,060
Babu-ji has earned...

186
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,820
another title, no?

187
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Late Sir Narayan Mukherjee

188
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,880
We loved each other dearly

189
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,670
But too bad, this is too bad

190
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,920
Late, Sir Mukherjee...

191
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,000
was a good man

192
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,350
- Does Devdas drink every day?
- When doesn't he drink?

193
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,220
Alcohol, day and night.
Lives on it

194
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,320
- Why don't you stop him?
- But only if he'd stay at home

195
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,740
Rarely does he come home.
There he lies in Chitpore...

196
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,110
in Chandramukhi's brothel, all day

197
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,400
The room upstairs is practically
Deva's residence

198
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,110
Devdas! He lives in a brothel?

199
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh God

200
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,640
Such days I have lived to see

201
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,940
- Have you seen Chandramukhi?
- When I went to fetch Deva...

202
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,000
...I saw her.

203
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
What is she like?

204
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,650
Sweet deceit, as they say.
Famous courtesan, uses her charms

205
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,790
She plunders, he squanders. We must
rescue our Deva from the hell, Paro

206
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,200
I cannot tell him anything,
but he'll surely listen to you

207
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,460
He holds you in high esteem,
he can't refuse you

208
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,760
Please Didi, tell her

209
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,790
Only you can stop him, Paro.
Only you can stop him from drinking

210
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,210
- Dharamdas, get a hold on yourself.
- You'll see him won't you?

211
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,120
Paro, do you want me to malign you,
to give you a bad name?

212
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,630
Had we given ourselves a bad name,
we might've ended up together

213
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,590
- You're happy, aren't you Paro?
- Oh it's a different world, Dev

214
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,160
Huge manor, vast estates,
important people, great debates

215
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,530
Great debates!
You've matured Paro

216
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,850
You even look like an aristocrat.
Huge red dot, large eyes...

217
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,740
big dreams...

218
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,420
huge manors,
vast estates...

219
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,260
and grown-up children

220
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Paro... Paro, Paro. Ei!

221
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,320
Those large eyes,
I can keep watching

222
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,050
But I can't bear to see
big teardrops in those eyes

223
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,160
Just as well that you came by.
I got some things I wish to return

224
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,630
Who knows, I might never return

225
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,000
Come Paro... come

226
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,790
Stand right here

227
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,460
Look...

228
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,350
at yourself. Remember...?

229
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,950
"Arre O'Deva"

230
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,890
What happened Paro?

231
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,570
"Deva, I lost my anklets.
Have you seen them?"

232
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,120
No, not I

233
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,330
I stole them

234
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,790
And you knew I did it
and why I did it

235
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,670
All day, the chime of your anklets,
and-Deva-this-and-Deva-that...

236
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,970
And your pot

237
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,170
And here, the memento
of our love, our parting

238
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,690
You just left, that was the end
of the relationship

239
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,570
But I'm still tied
to all these, Paro

240
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,440
And I am tied
to memories of you

241
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,320
- What's that?
- A few coins

242
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,200
- Three Rupees.
- All they're worth are memories

243
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,330
Mine, aren't they? You thief

244
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,370
I'll take them back,
but only with usury

245
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,950
- How much interest will you take?
- Two percent

246
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,140
At two percent...

247
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,790
six cents a month

248
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,930
72 cents a year

249
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,520
For 13 years...

250
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,270
13 years, Paro

251
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,830
9.36

252
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You've become good at arithmetic.

253
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Circumstance taught me, Paro

254
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,780
Let's talk of something else

255
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,870
Paro, why not turn matchmaker
and find a bride for Devdas?

256
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,490
- I hear Manikpur girls are nice?
- Yes, but you want a beauty, no?

257
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,850
No, not a beauty.
Just someone like you

258
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,760
- Someone who is pleasant?
- No, must be a bit naughty

259
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,790
Should be able to quarrel with me.
Like I said, she should be like you

260
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,340
- You can find them by the thousands.
- Spare me the thousands

261
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,990
Just let me come to grips with
only one, of the likes you. Enough

262
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,670
- Give up drinking, Dev.
- No, Paro.

263
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,210
- Try.
- No

264
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,400
You can give it up. Promise me
that you'll never drink again

265
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,280
Can you promise
you'll forget me?

266
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,030
It's rather late, Paro

267
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Dev!

268
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm not leaving
until I have your word

269
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,750
- I can't.
- You can

270
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,280
- One can do anything one wants.
- Can you elope with me tonight?

271
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,680
- What are you saying?
- Can you elope with me?

272
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,470
- You've no one to look after you.
- Can you elope with me?

273
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,940
- I had only one dream. To serve you.
- If there's love, there's no fear

274
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,790
- One chance to fulfill my dream?
- Can you elope with me? Can you?

275
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,660
- Come with me. I'll care for you.
- Can you elope with me, Paro?

276
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,730
I can't bear to see you like this!
I feel like dying, Dev

277
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,120
I feel like dying

278
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,820
If serving me makes you happy,
then so be it

279
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,850
I promise you, before I die
I'll surely come to your doorstep

280
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,180
Swear... Swear that, by me

281
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,700
Heartless

282
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,830
Your mother is squandering money.
Given so charitable a disposition...

283
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,210
- ...soon the coffers will be empty.
- Absolutely right, Kumud

284
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,500
But how can I stop Ma?

285
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You're such a complete fool

286
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:02,770
- You can't. But I can stop her.
- You will stop her? But how?

287
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,970
The keys to the vault? With you?
Ma has been looking for them

288
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Kumud!

289
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,790
I've hidden the keys.
You will say that the keys are lost

290
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,020
- What...?
- The vault keys are lost

291
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,050
And the vault has been robbed

292
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,760
The key...

293
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,550
to the money

294
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,660
Brother-in-law! You...?
So early? In the offices?

295
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,200
And alcohol...? Without as much
as a care for the family prestige?

296
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,660
What will people say?
What will your mother think?

297
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,980
You didn't consider that
when you were stealing the keys?

298
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,710
What will people say?
What will your Chhoto-Ma think?

299
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,290
The wealth of our forefathers
may not be squandered over alcohol

300
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,250
The keys left by our forefathers
may not be stolen like this

301
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,250
I'm making this clear.
Under no circumstance...

302
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,370
- ...am I parting with the keys.
- You will turn in the keys

303
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,370
Today and now

304
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,270
Right here

305
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,630
To my mother

306
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,390
Do not think I am so weak.
I too hail from a family of landlords

307
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,200
I have seen money by the chestfuls
in my father's house

308
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,480
Have you seen the streak of madness
that runs in the family?

309
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,000
Dev!

310
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,550
- What are you upto, Dev?
- Brother you surely agree that...

311
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:53,270
...I have as much right as you to the
wealth that our forefathers left us

312
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes.
Why are you pouring alcohol?

313
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm putting on fire my share.
Save your share if you can

314
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,600
- Dev, I'll give you anything you want!
- As of now...

315
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,250
- ...only the keys.
- Which you will never have

316
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,140
Kumud! Give him the keys.
Else, he'll burn down the office

317
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,650
Let him do whatever he wants.
I'm not scared of empty threats

318
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,410
He's actually burning the place down!
Call Chhoto-Ma

319
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,550
- Give him the keys, Kumud.
- No

320
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,590
He's crazy!
Are you out of your mind, too?

321
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,320
- No!
- Give him the keys

322
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,650
What's up Kumud?

323
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,000
What's happening in this house?

324
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Chhoto-Ma

325
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,860
Chhoto-Ma, you were looking for the keys
to the vault, weren't you?

326
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,340
I caught him with the keys
and he threatened me

327
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,810
He won't part with the keys
and he wants his share

328
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,880
Else, he'll burn the house down.
I pleaded with him...

329
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,450
You want your share?

330
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,000
That is your only share, Dev

331
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,870
No one in this house
ever understood you

332
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,880
All of us are responsible
for your ruination

333
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:40,190
Before we lead you to worse,
leave this house

334
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,470
Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro

335
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,200
Paro said, leave drinking.
Now you say, leave this house

336
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,730
One day, He will say...

337
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,150
leave this world

338
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,950
Hereby I rescind all my rights
to everything in this house

339
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,390
But I am part of you.
That right no one takes away from me

340
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Not even you

341
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Do you know, what you're asking for?

342
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,320
It's no easy undertaking,
it's an ancient ritual

343
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,420
For the ritual, one must fetch
the soil from a courtesan's doorstep

344
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,530
In that soil, is built
the image of the goddess

345
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,000
I know

346
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,740
And go where men daren't even walk
in daytimes for fear of censure?

347
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,240
Why Badi-Ma? Don't humans live there?
Is there no air...?

348
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,800
No sun in those quarters?
Do rains refuse to visit them?

349
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,000
Nature doesn't discriminate.
Should we?

350
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,000
Parvati is right.
Even Subhadra wanted it done

351
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Very well,
as our Parvati wishes

352
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,000
- But remember, it's the Durga Puja.
- Rest assured

353
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,880
I'll tell Mahendra
to facilitate your journey

354
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,810
Devdas lives in a brothel?

355
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
A lady is here, wants to see you.
She's also asking about Dev Babu

356
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Must be Paro

357
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,760
Paro...?

358
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,260
- How did you know I'm Parvati?
- Dev Babu told me...

359
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,000
...should a woman come asking for him,
she can only be Paro

360
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
What are you doing?

361
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,200
My obeisances to the woman,
whom I shall never be able to replace

362
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,900
I have heard of exotic women here,
but you possess the wile too

363
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,980
Only if you'd see,
I have a heart too

364
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,310
Chandramukhi...
isn't that your name?

365
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,140
They also call me Devdasi

366
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,420
- You are famous.
- Not anymore

367
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,000
Why?

368
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,090
At angel's touch, I learnt
of a sacrifice I never knew

369
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,290
How strange of a courtesan
to swear by fidelity

370
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,480
Curious too...

371
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,510
what draws an aristocrat
to a courtesan's doorstep?

372
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,150
Where is Dev?

373
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,520
I too am eager to hear his footfall.
Six months it has been...

374
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,090
- ...since I set my eyes on him.
- You lie

375
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,260
- If you don't trust, look around.
- Or do you assume I won't?

376
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,460
How long do you think
you can keep Dev here?

377
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,670
Only so long as the beauty,
the youth, the money?

378
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,690
What's your endgame?
You must have fleeced Dev

379
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,120
I'll pay you more. I can't bear
to see Dev suffering this hell

380
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,550
How strange

381
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,650
The very Paro who drove Dev Babu
to insanity, wants to buy him

382
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,930
And what may you have to offer me?
Can you offer social recognition?

383
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,440
Can you possibly
make him love me?

384
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,350
Or make it possible
that I may touch him, just once?

385
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,140
Dreams, longing, hopes,
that he has kindled in my heart...

386
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,160
might you make them come true?
Can you?

387
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,000
No, you cannot deliver

388
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,710
- And I will not give you Dev Babu.
- And I will take him away

389
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:16,090
And no one is stopping me. Not you,
not social sanction, not even Dev

390
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,140
Not to forget, courtesans
aren't destined to have husbands

391
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,890
Courtesans have no destiny, lady

392
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:49,860
From your perspective,
you can see nothing. From mine...

393
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,450
you will find him everywhere

394
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,500
Look, there he is,
in the flame of the lamp

395
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,760
There he lies,
in folds of the covers

396
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,060
In that half a chalice...

397
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,040
his thirst lies, unquenched.
His fragrance still lingers

398
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:16,460
Take it all, if you can. The light,
the folds, the fragrance, all of it

399
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,350
All yours

400
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,590
- But I cannot give you your Devdas.
- You love Dev so dearly?

401
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,330
I only worship him

402
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,020
Now I'm assured.
Dev isn't lonely anymore

403
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,950
Oh I forgot what I came here for.
I want to perform the Durga Puja

404
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,730
From your doorstep,
I want soil

405
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,990
May I...?

406
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,300
- What is this?
- I came for Dev. Instead...

407
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,170
it's something I entrust you with

408
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,280
I will expect you for
the Durga Puja. Do come

409
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Chandramukhi...

410
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm so happy to have you here

411
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm glad

412
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,000
How could I refuse your invitation?
I had to come

413
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,000
Have you met Dev?

414
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,000
Parvati?

415
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,430
Who is this?

416
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,480
Chandramukhi, my friend.
She comes from Calcutta

417
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:16,810
Bless you, consider this your home.
Parvati, don't let her go too soon

418
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,830
Sure. You will leave only after
the celebrations

419
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,970
No Paro! I can't stay here

420
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,180
Why not? It's been ages since I had
a heart-to-heart chat with someone

421
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,210
Come, let celebrations be the ruse
for forgetting our woes

422
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Let's sing, dance,
give ourselves a little to live

423
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,920
- No...
- Our joys might touch Dev

424
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,270
- Paro, listen to me.
- No refusing. For Dev's sake

425
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,350
Come Kali Babu, the chess game
isn't over yet

426
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,000
The real chessgame
is being played here

427
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,020
Devdas' Chandramukhi comes.
To meet Devdas' Paro

428
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,390
- Who's Paro?
- Mother-in-law

429
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,060
Parvati. One move and
I've checkmated all four

430
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,610
Paro

431
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,330
Chandramukhi

432
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,440
Bhuvan Chaudhary

433
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,360
Devdas

434
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Deva...

435
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,830
Deva, the day is dawning

436
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,000
But forever, this heart
will live in darkness

437
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,550
- Shall we go now?
- To whom?

438
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,170
One by one,
all my relationships are over

439
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,080
Between my father and I
there was no love lost, right?

440
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,450
I was his tempest
and he was my whip

441
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,720
Even my brother figured first
in mother's lullaby, right?

442
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:01,360
My brother and I never hit it off.
He's practical, I'm impractical

443
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,920
One inculcates a humorous
relationship with a brother's wife

444
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,260
I was the one who ended up
being the butt of the joke, right?

445
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,160
And there was Paro
and I love her...

446
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,300
you know...

447
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,150
so much

448
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,900
So much, right?

449
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,800
Paro!!!

450
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,550
Now she is estranged too

451
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,850
But there's one...

452
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,650
one Chandramukhi.
Loves me dearly

453
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,470
But...

454
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,840
priest?

455
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,800
Priest...

456
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,890
- Are you familiar with the last rites?
- Of course

457
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,200
- Will you perform the ritual?
- Of course. Who is the deceased?

458
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,740
- Devdas Mukherjee
- Are you insane, Deva?

459
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,840
- You'll perform your last rites?
- Give me my last rites

460
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,800
Priest, go away

461
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,130
Deva! What madness is this?

462
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,720
Come back

463
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,130
Unto the departed Soul...

464
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,390
grant salvation, Lord

465
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,760
Come back, I beg of you

466
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,600
The throb...

467
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,370
sways my heart

468
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,680
I dare that evil eye
or let thunder strike

469
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,820
I'll wear my dancing bells

470
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,780
In my anklets...

471
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,230
I will give in
to the ecstasy...

472
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,900
of the throb...

473
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,580
that sways
my heart, my soul

474
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,540
What chimes?

475
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,870
What's that love in eyes?

476
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,510
Why the crescendo?

477
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,090
Is it longing?

478
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,490
He's in the red dot I wear

479
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,680
He's in the dream in my eyes

480
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,200
You're obsessed

481
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,840
Your heart beats for him

482
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,210
I remember him in the chime

483
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,960
I remember him in the tinkle

484
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,110
You've given me a world...

485
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,530
of your own happinesses

486
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,470
Never desert him

487
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,420
Marry him

488
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,270
To him you are priceless

489
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:57,370
I am worthless

490
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,170
Wonderful

491
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,050
What a display of true colour

492
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,990
An aristocrat and a courtesan
come together

493
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,400
- What are you saying, Babu?
- That which you see, Badi-Ma

494
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,630
And what everyone is watching

495
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,790
This woman, whom Mother-in-law
calls a friend, is a whore

496
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,020
Yes Mother-in-law?

497
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,190
What am I hearing Parvati?

498
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,340
- Why are you silent? Answer.
- She is embarrassed

499
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,130
Landlords did keep whores

500
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,730
Now even a lady of the manor makes
friendships in brothels. Wonderment

501
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:00,400
That's stripping without touching, Chandramukhi.
You started the farce. I ended it

502
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,390
No Kali Babu, if men could
enact farce, what need for whores?

503
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,980
You would've had
your brothel too

504
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,600
Chandramukhi!!!

505
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,150
You know it
and it's commonplace

506
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,720
It is the aristocrat
who brings cheer to the brothels

507
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,550
And bastards are born
of aristocrats of your ilk

508
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:23,220
Call them illegitimate if you will,
but aristocracy runs in their veins

509
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,320
Company of the aristocracy doesn't
confer status to the courtesan

510
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:31,200
Absolutely correct, Badi-Ma. But why
should the lady be embarrassed?

511
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,770
If she spoke a few kind words to me,
it's because she considers me human

512
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,710
He who frequents the alleyways
of disrepute ought to be ashamed

513
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,870
The very dens littered with trophies
of the lust of his forefathers

514
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,970
Have you thought, Kali Babu? You might have
a sister somewhere in the brothels

515
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,140
Why sister? You might even
visit your daughter's...

516
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,880
In the soil
at the courtesan's doorstep...

517
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,290
is moulded the image of the goddess.
The soil isn't impotent

518
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,900
Now the farce ends

519
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,830
I return, lady...

520
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:25,790
back to my world,
to those disreputable alleys...

521
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,620
where I might someday find
Dev Babu again

522
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,230
Farewell

523
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,970
Before leaving,
I wish to apologise

524
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,330
Talking in public
about Chandramukhi was a mistake

525
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:04,240
I didn't make the other mistake.
I told your husband and Badi Ma...

526
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,000
about your friendship with Devdas

527
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,500
You liked twisting my ear?
I would cut your nose to spite your face

528
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,500
Goodbye

529
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,500
Not at Parvati,
fingers will be raised at us

530
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,000
The matter must end
here and now

531
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:29,000
- Did you ask for me?
- Yes Parvati

532
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
- I would like to know...
- ...who Devdas is?

533
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Devdas is a childhood friend,
he was body, I was soul

534
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,000
He is my love and he is my vanity
and he is with me, always

535
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,000
- Do you realise what you are saying, Parvati?
- Same as what you told me

536
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,000
You're now the lady of the manor, Parvati.
The mother of my children. No doubt

537
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
- But Subhadra, I can never forget.
- Subhadra was my wife

538
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,500
Subhadra was your first love.
Devdas is mine

539
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,250
First love, like years
can never be obliterated

540
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,000
Parvati, you are forgetting.
You are the lady of the manor

541
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:18,000
Maybe that's reason for my guilt?
I'll accept any penalty you decree

542
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Of course you will be punished, Parvati

543
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,000
The very men who paid obeisances
to this manor are enjoying a farce

544
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:36,000
You may never step out of the manor.
This is your punishment

545
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,500
But what punishment, Parvati?
We are the ones being punished

546
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,660
The lamps we lit in celebration
have set fire to our house

547
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,080
Always put out the fires
that threaten your home

548
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,890
Fun, frolic and friends

549
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,580
Without you, life was desolate.
With you, comes the cheer

550
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:30,530
Why care for outcomes?
Let's raise cheer

551
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,410
Yes friend?

552
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,730
Let clink the glasses

553
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:54,190
Let clink the glasses,
whatever the outcome

554
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,690
Let clink the glasses,
whatever the outcome

555
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:27,000
And hear the chhalak-chal in the swirl

556
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,120
Music, when my cup floweth over

557
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And hear the dhamk-dhamk-dham
inside your heart...

558
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
when you clink the glasses

559
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,030
This madeira...

560
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,300
This madeira showers
a rain of memories

561
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,760
In every spill, madeira
cheats the heart

562
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,290
The madeira coursing down tells...

563
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:42,780
tales of hearts

564
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,180
Like lightning in hearts,
it strikes clouds of sorrow

565
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,380
And when it reaches the heart...

566
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,740
it evokes...

567
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:01,120
memories of her

568
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:06,270
Oh for a glimpse...

569
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,070
Oh for a glimpse of her

570
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,590
That's...

571
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,640
what little I pray for

572
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,360
So little I pray for

573
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Mira dances for her
Ghanshyam...

574
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,000
she dances in gay abandon

575
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Hear the jhanak-jhank-jhan
in the chime of her anklets

576
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm in love,
I don't care for censure

577
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,500
And how...

578
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:21,650
Now hear the thirak-thirak?
That's my heart dancing away

579
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,550
Even a drop of alcohol
is poison for him

580
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,940
Any moment may be treacherous

581
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,600
Try to keep him in good cheer

582
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Oh God!

583
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:08,280
What is this Dharamdas?
Cry and you will make me cry too

584
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,740
And people will call me a courtesan
who cannot enact a farce

585
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,000
We got to keep Dev Babu
in good cheer, no?

586
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,300
Game over. I win again

587
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:29,300
No point playing with you!
You've robbed us blind

588
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,890
A few more games with you and
you'll make me sell this brothel

589
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,240
Stop giggling and get lost

590
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,110
Time for your medicine.
I'll send it over

591
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,740
- In a chalice. Else, it won't work.
- Even contemplating it is lethal

592
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,320
Met Paro?

593
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:55,480
- How did you find my Paro?
- If love be personified...

594
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,290
Paro's would be the being,
hers the very heart

595
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:06,230
Forbidden though it is, I always
end up with a metaphor about eyes

596
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,490
One Paro
and one, Chandramukhi

597
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,550
One, sentimental, vivacious

598
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,210
And you...
how delicate, how demure

599
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,270
She is fickle, like a doe,
gushing like a river...

600
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:26,670
the liar, the butterfly, the Moon
and you...?

601
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:31,120
Poem? Ballad?
Some tears, sometimes fire

602
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,500
- Everyone loves her.
- And you, unloved by all save me?

603
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,500
Chandramukhi...

604
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,500
What is this, Chandramukhi?
I was likening you to fortitude

605
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:21,480
What you turn out to be? Wax doll?
Look at you, melting away

606
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:27,650
Will you let the candle melt away
and cast me in dark?

607
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:42,040
You've done much for me, Chandramukhi.
One more favour

608
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,300
- Let me leave.
- No! You know not what you suffer

609
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,610
- You know it and I suffer.
- Then why must you...?

610
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,760
I must face myself
before I'm lost

611
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,630
May a servant follow you?

612
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,850
I cannot bear to see my death
mirrored in your eyes

613
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,530
I have been given heaven and earth

614
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,950
Will we meet again?

615
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:04,500
What the Judge of virtue and vice
will pronounce for you I know not

616
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But in the afterlife, should we meet
I won't be able to renounce you

617
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,500
Deva...

618
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,370
- Deva, what is the matter with you?
- What's the matter...?

619
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,300
Are you all right?

620
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,000
- How come you haven't left?
- I'm not leaving you all alone

621
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,400
- Are you afraid I'll drink again?
- Alcohol is poison for you

622
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,500
- One drop...
- And I'm dead?

623
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,190
Yes! You were delirious,
that's why I didn't leave you

624
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:51,810
And enough of this journey.
You've had your say and I've had enough

625
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:55,210
At the next station, we change the
train and we go to see your mother

626
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,760
At the next station,
you go back to your compartment

627
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,000
- Why are you so stubborn?
- Put out the lights

628
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,000
And tomorrow, I'm taking you
to a doctor. Always fickle

629
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,740
Passengers to Sonarpur, Garia,
Phoolbagan to detrain

630
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,960
Dharamdas, you're back?

631
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,500
Chuni Babu?

632
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,780
Friend! How are you?

633
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:42,510
Small world it is, that's why
we keep bumping into each other

634
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:50,680
- So where and how have you been?
- Right here and I'm fine

635
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:59,090
- Tell me how you have been.
- What with me, I'm soaring

636
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:05,260
But you look... pale.
What gives, friend?

637
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,380
For a moment I was in a quandary.
Is this my star of Chitpore?

638
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,830
- No, I'm all the same.
- Even if you aren't, here I am

639
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,630
Let's raise cheer.
It's been long, let's have a party

640
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,980
So what if we aren't in a brothel?
Even train compartments will do

641
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,670
If not the dancing bells,
let's cheer the rhythm of the rails

642
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:32,380
If not Chandramukhi,
let it be between her paramours

643
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,060
Here you are

644
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:46,550
- No Chuni Babu, I don't drink.
- Someone has extracted a promise?

645
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,540
- No.
- Then do it, for friendship's sake

646
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,480
After ages! Let's live it up.
Why not?

647
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,560
In a tomorrow, may we be?
Might not

648
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:04,410
You'll be. As for me,
you never know

649
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:23,570
My share of life I've lived,
now I'm counting on my heart

650
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:30,590
What with the world, it will even
grudge you your last breath

651
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:36,360
Encore! How sweet!
That's poetry

652
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,370
Shards of the heart,
they call poetry. I don't care

653
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:45,790
Encores? Wonderful

654
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,610
Encore, encore

655
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,900
Hey Dev Babu...

656
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,210
what's happening?

657
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,850
What's ailing you?
Have you taken a cure?

658
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,580
I'm incurable, Chuni Babu

659
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,850
- Then why did you drink, knowing...?
- For friendship's sake, Chuni Babu

660
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:20,930
Friendship? You take me for
a stranger? Not again, not again...

661
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,430
No stranger, Chuni Babu.
You're the closest to me

662
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:32,500
I've even imbibed your metaphor.
The Sunrise of life...

663
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,930
the salutations...
then the solace...

664
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,600
and in seconds, time takes
such a turn Chuni Babu...

665
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,840
- ...all ties with life are severed.
- No Dev Babu

666
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,730
The Sun...

667
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:52,780
the song, the serenade,
sympathy between friends

668
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:58,870
- But separation... no...
- It all ends, Chuni Babu

669
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,160
No

670
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:09,290
Silence? So deathly?
As if I'm dead already?

671
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,820
I swear by our friendship...

672
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,200
this silence...

673
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,310
is stifling

674
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,550
And you know Chuni Babu,
miles to go...

675
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,790
before my thirst is quenched

676
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:35,510
Oh when will my thirst
be quenched?

677
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,000
- Chhoti-Ma! Chhoti-Ma!
- What happened?

678
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,500
- What happened Chhoti-Ma?
- What happened to Chhoti-Ma?

679
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Blood...?

680
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:38,780
Pandua. Passengers to Manikpur,
Mirzapur, Mirgaon, detrain

681
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,360
If serving me makes you happy...

682
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:53,350
I promise you, before I die
I'll surely come to your doorstep

683
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,000
Swear... Swear that, by me

684
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Are we there?

685
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,000
Dev Babu, the journey has just begun.
What's wrong with you?

686
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,730
Devdas... come to me, my darling

687
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,570
All day tramping around the village
with that Paro

688
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:56,090
Not another moment
for you in this house

689
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:05,040
- Deva! I'm not letting you leave!
- Dharamdas! Don't let him go

690
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:07,930
Stop Dev

691
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,000
Faster, please

692
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,610
Very little time left

693
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:28,750
Yes sir

694
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:39,860
Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro

695
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,560
Paro said, leave drinking.
Now you say, leave this house

696
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
One day, He will say,
leave this world

697
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Here's Manikpur.
Brought you in before sun-up

698
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,500
Whom are you seeing in Manikpur?

699
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,500
Paro...

700
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Paro...

701
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,500
Who...?

702
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'm here, Paro

703
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,200
- What is the matter, Parvati?
- Someone called out to me

704
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,500
So late at night? Go to bed.
You must be mistaken

705
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,940
Picked him up at Pandua station.
I don't know...

706
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,690
something happened to him overnight.
Never said where to, in Manikpur

707
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,000
What's that crowd outside?

708
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Some stranger has been lying there
all night. Counting his last, maybe

709
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Poor soul, must've come to return
something he owed in this lifetime

710
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
God rest his soul

711
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:57,440
No chance of survival,
Mahendra Babu

712
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,310
He's breathing his last

713
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:07,870
- Paro...
- She is manifest in Death

714
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:11,710
She is the life-force

715
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Paro!

716
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,000
What is the matter, Parvati?

717
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,070
These letters might provide a clue

718
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,390
She is Eternal peace

719
01:14:53,240 --> 01:15:00,050
If you are inattentive Parvati,
you needn't say the prayers. Leave

720
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,450
For some wish unfulfilled, must be,
he isn't giving up his ghost

721
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:12,440
The policeman has identified him.
He's from some Tal Sonapur

722
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Tal Sonapur...

723
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:18,770
- What's the name?
- I don't know

724
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,700
- Mahendra Babu knows.
- Will you please call Mahendra?

725
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,980
- I said, call Mahendra.
- Yes

726
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Mahendra Babu!!!

727
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,500
Mahendra Babu!!!

728
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,210
- Yes?
- Chhoti-Ma wants to see you. Now

729
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:59,020
- Yes Chhoti-Ma? You summoned me?
- Yes, who's the man lying outside?

730
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,800
Someone from your village,
one Devdas Mukherjee

731
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:08,040
- Who?
- Devdas Mukherjee

732
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,850
- How do you know?
- Two letters in his pocket

733
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,990
- One, to Dwijdas Mukherjee.
- His elder brother

734
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,560
- And to one Kaushalya.
- Yes, his mother

735
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,930
- The name was tattooed on his arm.
- At a fair. It rained

736
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,110
- Incomplete tattoo...
- Also a torn necklace of pearls

737
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,290
Hit me here...

738
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,960
Where are you going Chhoti-Ma?

739
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,000
By now
they must've taken him away

740
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,560
Chhoti-Ma, stop...

741
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,770
- What happened to Chhoti Ma?
- What's going on in this house?

742
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,390
Why this screaming?
What's up Mahendra?

743
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,670
- Ma is going out! For some Devdas!
- She has gone insane, stop her

744
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,260
Stop, Parvati!

745
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,800
Don't let her step
outside the manor

746
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,090
Stop Chhoti-Ma

747
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:46,650
Stop! Babu-ji forbids you

748
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,390
Secure the doors
