1
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,170
Badi Ma, Dwijdas, Kumud, Dharamdas, Padma
where's everybody?

2
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,150
Look, here's Devdas' letter.
Devdas is returning from London

3
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,850
Really Bhabi...? (Bhabi: Sister-in-Law)
Happy tidings!

4
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,590
- Dwijdas! You hear? Devdas is coming!
- I don't think so. Ma is lying

5
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,680
- You're lying, Ma.
- Here's the letter

6
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,190
Show me the letter

7
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,440
- Shubhankar! My Devdas is coming!
- Really?

8
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,860
Give your brother the good news

9
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,360
Badi Ma... Badi Ma...
my Tempest is coming home

10
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,980
Thank God

11
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,260
- Compliments, lady!
- Not in tears Dharamdas

12
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,450
I want a promise. I am going...
to receive Devdas. I alone.

13
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,260
Yes, but wind the clocks once again.
After so many years! My son is back

14
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,760
Winding clocks won't make time move,
nor any faster brings the son home

15
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,800
I know Kumud! But look
how my heart throbs

16
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,850
Oh when will the day give way
to the night...?

17
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,430
Drum up the cheer!
Let the music play

18
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,870
What joyous tempest stirs my heartstrings!
Drum up the cheer

19
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,960
- Let the music play!
- Welcome the onset of Tempest

20
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,000
Ei Kaushalya Didi, look.
Shondesh for you

21
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,160
- Sumitra! Lovely timing!
- Sumitra-Kaki's timing!

22
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,750
Always opportune.
And your "Shondesh" is famous!

23
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,910
- Hear that Didi?
- Let her talk. Guess who's coming?

24
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,760
I know! Mr Chattopadhyay...?

25
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,700
Silly! You won't believe this!
My Tempest, my Devdas is coming!

26
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,140
- Really Didi...?
- Yes, yes, really!

27
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,990
Thank Goddess Durga

28
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,370
- My compliments, Didi!
- I'm seeing my son after 10 years

29
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,680
What might he look like? What might
he sound like? What will he tell me?

30
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,300
How am I going to survive tonight, Sumitra?

31
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,090
How I wish I wouldn't blink!
What if he walks in right then?

32
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,040
Yes Didi. I only remember Devdas, the boy
who'd walk up to my house...

33
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,250
- ...peep around the door to ask me...
- "Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?" (Kaki-Ma: Aunt)

34
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,480
There she goes, into the act

35
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,600
And when Dev stormed out,
I'd send Paro to find him

36
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,310
- Found him always in guava orchards.
- And Dharamdas would haul him in...

37
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,080
- ...by his ear! Some friendship!
- And when Devdas was leaving...

38
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,520
going abroad for his studies,
how my Paro ran after his buggy...

39
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,210
as if possessed. Arre O'Deva

40
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,450
Arre O'Deva

41
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,480
In that scorching sun,
her feet blistering on the gravelly soil...

42
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,850
yet she ran on, screaming,
I'm going with Dev

43
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,030
- I'm going abroad too!
- Paro, are you out of your mind?

44
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,860
Send her abroad? My silly girl

45
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,510
She owed Dev three Rupees

46
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,550
- Paro!
- Let me go. I got to give him his 3 Rupees

47
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,720
A lamp lit for a loved one
draws the wayfarer home

48
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,500
For 10 years, in that belief
she kept that lamp alight for Dev

49
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,020
Not once she let the lamp go out!
I must tell her, she'll be glad

50
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,980
- She will be overjoyed.
- Yes Sumitra, go

51
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,030
It's your son who's coming home
and she is the happier for it

52
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,550
Why not? She's our neighbour.
Paro and Devdas...

53
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,750
- ...were childhood friends.
- What's left of that childhood?

54
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,910
Both are grown ups now...
Kaki-Ma's "Shondesh"?

55
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Paro!

56
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,820
- What's up Kaki-Ma?
- Manorama, where is Paro?

57
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,530
Where else? Must be in her room,
talking to her lamp

58
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,350
- Not lamp!
- Devdas

59
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,330
- Oh God.
- What's the matter?

60
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,780
The news I have for her
will drive her mad with joy

61
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,040
What news?

62
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,900
Paro, Devdas is coming

63
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,740
- Really?
- Yes, Devdas is coming

64
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,540
They're preparing for a welcome!
Kaushalya-Didi is nearly going mad

65
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,260
The whole house is
in raptures...

66
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,420
Silly, are you crying?

67
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,820
Let not tears of joy
douse the lamp before Dev arrives

68
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,430
No power on Earth can put out
this lamp

69
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,300
Shall we put the mighty lamp
to test?

70
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,130
At season's change...

71
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,200
comes...

72
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,760
cloudwaves

73
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,850
A waft...

74
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,730
will come...

75
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,360
to blow out this lamp

76
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,530
This longing I didn't let die

77
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,790
This longing I never let die

78
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,590
This lamp, my love...

79
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,780
will never be extinguished,
this flame of my love

80
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,040
My love, come to me my love

81
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,760
Now come to me

82
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,210
As this lamp burns...

83
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,650
I'm burning in my every pore
and my heart

84
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,200
Now come to me

85
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,930
Come to me, my love

86
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,680
Distance parted us...

87
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,770
there was the pain of parting

88
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,140
My eyes yearned...

89
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,840
but there you were...

90
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,560
glittering, glowing...

91
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,670
awash in joys...

92
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,640
while here...

93
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,780
I burned...

94
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,220
while here, I burned

95
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,740
Once again, clouds thunder...

96
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,140
raining in thunderous rhapsody

97
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,830
Tempest strikes again...

98
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,860
but my lamp is never doused...

99
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,420
my love, my flame...

100
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,410
no matter how much the rains,
tempest and thunder torment you

101
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,960
Come now, come to me, my love

102
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,590
Come, my love

103
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,000
She's crazy

104
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,360
She's naive

105
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,640
Oh yes, with a gust of wind
will come the one you seek

106
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,370
My love...

107
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,890
come to me my love

108
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,820
The passion,
she will never let die

109
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,330
My love, this lamp is you

110
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,510
Hurry! The buggy is here!
Kaushalya, quick

111
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,030
- Devdas is here!
- Coming

112
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,040
I was lighting the welcome-lamp.
Tell Badi-Ma

113
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,940
If you take so much time,
Devdas will give himself a welcome

114
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,050
Give himself a welcome?
Today, I'm welcoming him

115
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,250
Wait a minute! I get to see Devdas first.
Everyone shut your eyes

116
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,840
- For my sake.
- All right?

117
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,270
Lady! I don't believe! Could the
world change so much in ten years?

118
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,040
Deva is as tall as my shoulders,
my very shoulders he sat upon

119
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,560
- See him and you'll forget to blink!
- Don't torment me! Where's my Dev?

120
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,040
Got off on the way. Said, he will
be back after seeing "My Paro"

121
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,070
Should be here any moment

122
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,840
Chhoto-Ma, you wanted to be the first
to set your eyes on Devdas?

123
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,690
Will it be Paro's eyes now?

124
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,260
Chhoto-Ma, what to do with this?

125
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,380
Paro

126
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,930
I think it's Devdas

127
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,110
Devdas...

128
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,490
how have you been? Fine?
Come in son, welcome

129
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,160
Bless you, son

130
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,410
You look just like an Englishman!
We've been so eager to see you

131
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,970
- Kaushalya-Didi is dying to see you.
- Where is Paro?

132
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,400
She was here a moment ago

133
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,990
She said, let Devdas come
and I'll do this and I'll do that

134
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,890
I'll fight with him and scratch him.
Now you're here and she's hiding

135
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ei Paro

136
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,430
- Can I go upstairs?
- Yes son, go on

137
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Paro?

138
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,500
How have you been Paro?

139
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,450
Won't you turn to see my face?
We're meeting after so many days

140
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,210
Days? For you, maybe.
For me...

141
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,240
10 years, 6 months,
4 days and 6 hours

142
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,030
- You never missed me?
- I did, Paro.

143
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,980
Lies! Only 5 letters in 10 years?
There are four seasons in a year

144
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:47,160
- Couldn't you write once a season?
- Makes sense. You're a big girl, Paro.

145
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,470
Takes time!

146
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,010
The desire to meet the sea
turns the stream into a river

147
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,720
Then why take time
to show your face?

148
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,920
Like sighting the Moon after ages,
I fear I'll leave you breathless

149
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,520
- Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

150
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,660
Till moonrise Paro, spare the Moon,
to see which leaves me breathless...

151
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,010
the Moon's radiance?
Or your vanity?

152
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,930
Paro, I hate the thought
of someone else touching you

153
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,430
- Look, Devdas is here!
- Let him come

154
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,640
- Don't be cross.
- I don't want to talk to him

155
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,990
- Tell him to go away.
- But Ma...

156
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,200
- I said, I don't want to...
- Ma

157
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,310
Go, I don't want to see your face

158
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,790
Why, what's so ugly
about my face...

159
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,280
that neither Paro
nor you want to see?

160
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,070
After 10 years of waiting,
the neighbour gets to welcome you?

161
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
Go back to your Paro

162
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,570
- Won't you open your eyes?
- I won't

163
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,420
Won't see me either?

164
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,980
- Very well, I'm going away.
- Where...?

165
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,260
- Where are you going, Dev?
- Dev, stop

166
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,970
Why did you let him leave?
I was just joking

167
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,630
I was joking too

168
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Dev...

169
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,200
My prodigal son returns a lawyer.
But no let up on the mischief?

170
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,250
- Babu-ji...? (Babu-ji: Father)
- He left for his chambers early...

171
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,930
- ...something urgent.
- I know, I know

172
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,590
Complaints every day!

173
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,700
Dev and Paro never went to school.
Dev caught smoking

174
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,970
All day tramping around the village
with that Paro

175
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,600
Not another moment
for you in this house

176
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Now get out!

177
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The day I left,
he wasn't at home

178
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This day I return,
he still isn't here

179
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,600
You know, the British government
is knighting him

180
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,180
- Really?
- Yes, and he'll be so glad to see you

181
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,760
- Really?
- Glad he is, at work

182
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,820
In my home, fathers welcome sons
returning home after years...

183
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,000
- ...with arms outstretched.
- Same here, child

184
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Devdas! Come to me, my darling

185
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Badi-Ma... (Badi-Ma: Grandma)

186
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,560
I told you to get me
a nice foreign watch

187
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,510
Have you brought it?

188
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,890
No, but I bring fortuitous times

189
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
Look...

190
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,430
over here... but I can't even
make out clearly

191
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,070
- They use only paper?
- And sometimes, not even that

192
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,100
I never shook hands

193
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,410
What are you upto?

194
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,370
Give my box back to me

195
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,390
Give it to me

196
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,060
- What's happening?
- Nothing

197
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,020
Watching Devdas?
How do you find him?

198
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,390
- I'm not telling.
- Tell me...

199
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,120
- ...how do you find him?
- Like a fool

200
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,860
- What did he say when he met you?
- I didn't show him my face

201
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,070
- Swear that by your mother?
- I swear

202
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,370
- Poor thing, must've been pining.
- Let him pine

203
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,460
Don't make him suffer so

204
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,030
Else, he'll come peeping
around the door...

205
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,840
and ask me,
"Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?"

206
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,770
Only in the moonlight
he gets to see my face

207
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,770
- What brings the Moon down to Earth?
- To take your breath away

208
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,090
- What are you doing?
- Seeing how good my guess was

209
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,610
- Accurate?
- Could never be wrong

210
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,490
- How come?
- Known you for ages

211
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,390
- What's this?
- Platter

212
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,300
- I know. But what's on it?
- My excuse

213
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,140
- Shondesh for me?
- See for yourself

214
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,940
- Empty...?
- That's the excuse, silly

215
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,540
Goodness!
What a temper!

216
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,050
You make a fine example
of how to lose temper, Dev.

217
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,030
You're the same

218
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,300
You too, are just
like you were

219
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,480
- Like what...?
- Unsophisticated

220
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,950
Naturally, after all,
you're London-returned

221
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,780
- London's a big city, isn't it Dev?
- London's entirely different

222
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,810
Great personalities, great debates.
Huge thoroughfares, huge edifices

223
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,070
London's Trafalgar Square,
pigeons, doves...

224
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,630
The Queen's Palace

225
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,310
And milling crowds,
everywhere

226
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Do you know, Paro...

227
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,940
Londoners live in a world
of their own

228
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,000
You too?

229
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,000
Of course. You are so silly.

230
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Mention not...

231
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,000
Say, you never missed the village?

232
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,700
Never, never, except...

233
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,000
when I was fed up of the food at
the hostel, I missed Ma's dishes

234
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,000
That's it

235
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,880
And back in London,
when someone screamed at me...

236
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,160
I was reminded of my father.
No one else

237
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,480
On evening walks, I contemplated
Dharamdas and his buggy

238
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,650
On sleepless nights,
grandmother's gentle pat

239
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,780
Nothing else

240
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,790
Dev... and...

241
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,720
- And...?
- I...?

242
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,280
Never. Or was it once...?

243
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,650
- No, you never came to mind, Paro.
- I never came to mind...?

244
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,880
Matters that come to mind
are matters that matter. But...

245
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,480
- ...you don't matter, Paro.
- True Dev, only you matter

246
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:41,480
5 letters, 5 times a day.
How many times did I read them each year?

247
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,400
- And how many times in ten years?
- Multiplied by...?

248
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,670
18,250 times.
That's how much you matter...

249
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,500
and ten years to the day,
I have kept alive the flame I lit for you

250
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,940
- How many hours has it been burning?
- If I were to count...

251
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:10,240
87,600 hours. So much you matter,
every second I remembered you

252
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,000
- How many seconds to a day?
- I know, I'll tell you...

253
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,490
You're bad at arithmetic

254
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Ei ei, Paro!

255
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,000
There were times when I missed you.

256
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
When...?

257
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,290
Whenever I breathed

258
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,790
For them, reminiscences,
those who can be forgotten. Silly

259
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,820
So effortlessly you counted off
those seconds?

260
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Without as much as a thought
to every passing second...

261
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,940
that carried me away?

262
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:55,320
In the flame of the lamp that
you lit, it was I who burned

263
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,500
87,600 hours

264
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,140
Shall I tell you what's
on my mind for sometime?

265
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,200
Two names on your mind.
Paro and Devdas

266
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,370
Mr Landlord! How did you make out?

267
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,630
Kumud was saying, Dev and Paro
are upto new antics

268
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,310
For hours they stare at each other
through binoculars

269
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,370
Shondesh is her excuse for
coming over. I don't like it

270
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,140
And Sumitra is daydreaming
of Paro's wedding to Devdas

271
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,170
Daydreams never come true, Kaushalya.
Neelkanth married an actress

272
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,210
Disgraced himself. In an alliance
with a disgraced family...

273
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,570
am I to bring
my family to ridicule...?

274
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,650
Right, but you know Sumitra.
She shoots off her mouth

275
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,180
What if she storms in someday
proposing an alliance?

276
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,240
- The answer will be "no"
- Why will the answer be "no"?

277
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,270
A knight and a landlord. And the
roof over our heads is leaking

278
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,700
Leaking...?

279
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Sumitra

280
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,000
- Even my postal address has changed.
- Really...?

281
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,500
Really

282
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,600
"Neelkanth Chakraborty,
Old Mansion"

283
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,060
What's lacking in our Paro?
She's pretty, she's literate

284
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,520
I only got to spread the word.
Tens of boys will be ready...

285
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,880
- ...to pay a bride-price for Paro.
- Really?

286
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,630
Yes. You are worrying overmuch

287
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,570
Someday we will get a proposal...
from them. You'll see

288
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,570
Till then, I leave you to
your musings. I'm off for my nap

289
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,940
Mr Landlord! Have a care!
Your old mansion is crumbling

290
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,200
Broke my back

291
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,320
- All this jewellery! All for me?
- You will give me a grandson

292
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,470
Won't I give you something?

293
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,450
Badi-Ma has opened up her
treasure trove. Loot her

294
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,680
I must!

295
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,750
Badi-Ma! How exquisite!
I must wear this

296
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,340
- No, that one isn't for you.
- Then, for whom?

297
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,200
- For my Devdas' bride.
- Let's see

298
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,750
Give it all away to Devdas' bride!
I want none of this

299
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,600
Here's your elder daughter-in-law

300
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,040
And everyone's all agog about
someone who's yet to come

301
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,040
Nice bracelet, isn't it?
It'll look great on your arm

302
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,110
In my father's house
maids wear bracelets like these

303
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,540
Then consider yourself a maid,
right Badi-Ma?

304
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,470
Yes! I'm maidservant in this house.
My brother-in-law! Always after me

305
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,510
You're making a mountain out
of a molehill. I was joking

306
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,360
- If you disapprove, I won't even marry.
- I hate being ridiculed

307
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,130
Why rib her all the time?
Badi-Ma you could've said yes...

308
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,970
if only to please her. You know
her nature. And she's pregnant

309
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,170
And you've brought her to tears.
Now I got to placate her. Woe betide

310
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,590
No matter how much honey you add,
neem is always bitter

311
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,630
How do you like this bracelet?

312
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,770
- Just like you. Exotic.
- Whom are you giving it to?

313
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,000
You want to see?

314
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,640
- Take this.
- And do what?

315
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,790
Look through it. This bracelet
is for whoever you see in it

316
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,480
Goodness! Sumitra?

317
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,260
- Is she the one? Are you mad?
- Yes, but not entirely. Look up

318
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,810
- That's Parvati.
- Nice...?

319
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,770
- Yes nice, but I see her every day.
- Do you see her as my bride?

320
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,610
- Wretched girl!
- Now what's up?

321
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,140
- Staring at me through binoculars!
- Goodness

322
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,000
- She's gone hiding.
- She must be embarrassed

323
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,950
- Been chatting over binoculars?
- Yes Badi-Ma

324
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,000
Take a look,
what's the wretch upto?

325
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:58,600
Goodness! She's watching me
out of the corner of her eyes

326
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,100
Ran

327
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,330
Have you run in too, Dev?

328
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,670
Wretched boy

329
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,350
How to make mountains
out of a molehill...

330
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,060
I'll show my mother-in-law.
Chhoto-Ma...

331
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,590
- So you got caught peeping.
- You got caught too

332
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,180
And I was sentenced
to punish you

333
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,340
For you

334
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,520
- What...?
- Gift

335
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,600
You might as well put it on me

336
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,580
So many bangles

337
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,520
Silly

338
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,490
Forget it

339
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,650
- Tell me Dev, where is London?
- Way west

340
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,770
- Where sets the Sun?
- Paro?! In the West

341
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,430
The Sun rises over London
five hours late every day?

342
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,980
- Yes
- Is that why you're late...

343
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,220
- ...about understanding everything?
- Yes...

344
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,700
Dolt from London!
Can't even take my bangles off

345
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,940
How will you ever make me wear
a bracelet?

346
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,170
My cruel lover is heartless

347
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,330
My cruel lover is so heartless...

348
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,560
he doesn't even know how I pine,
he's just a ruthless slaver...

349
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,800
oh cruel, please...

350
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,050
How do I say this,
whom do I tell?

351
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,820
God, he doesn't know how I hurt...

352
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,970
he knows not...

353
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,040
how heartless

354
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,890
You were far away,
yet so close...

355
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,640
now you're close
yet distant...?

356
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,210
I don't know...
yet I know

357
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,650
You were far away, yet so close...
now you're close, yet distant...?

358
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,560
Come...

359
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,010
to me

360
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,620
- Adorn me with the bangle
- Let me read your palm

361
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,080
- Don't tease me
- Lots of money

362
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,320
- Now don't...
- Your marriage

363
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,760
- Do my bidding
- You'll marry an old man

364
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,960
- How do I say this...
- About your wedding

365
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,530
- Whom do I tell... God
- You'll never marry

366
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,060
Fool, he doesn't even know...

367
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,750
he just doesn't know

368
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,570
Shame!

369
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,780
You see how the childhood love
blossoms into youthful romance?

370
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,540
For all Sumitra's "Shondesh",
do send a sweet message to Sumitra

371
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,730
Tell her, Paro has come of age

372
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,880
What are you upto?

373
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,440
What am I upto?

374
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,540
- What's up? What's wrong with Ma?
- Your mother has gone mad.

375
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:34,100
Yes! Mad with joy. Because no more
will I dream the dream I dreamt

376
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,420
- And why?
- Because it's coming true

377
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,500
- Ma, what dream...?
- Which dream? Silly!

378
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,490
- I'm invited to a huge mansion.
- I know, Kumud has conceived

379
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:51,480
Also, Kaushalya-Didi wants to see me.
She says, Paro has come of age

380
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,020
We ought to think
about Paro's wedding

381
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,750
True Paro, when you step into
that house in bridal finery...

382
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,020
there will be dreams in your eyes,
under the veil drawn over your face

383
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,040
But we'll listen in joyous rapture
for the chime in your anklets

384
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,830
The guests are all here.
Where is Sumitra-Kaki?

385
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,730
Dreaming of Paro's wedding.
To Devdas. You know...

386
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,930
- I've found a nice match for Paro.
- Who...?

387
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,580
Old Mr Chattopadhyay

388
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,500
Ei Kaushalya Didi!

389
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,640
My compliments, sister!
Best wishes for a grandson

390
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,550
Sumitra, Sumitra, Sumitra. Don't overdo it.
There's still time to go

391
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,560
Only a few months, no?

392
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,950
Then the baby's wails
will resonate through the mansion

393
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,390
- Not sister, I'll call you grandma.
- You should get Paro married soon

394
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,470
- I'd like to call you grannie too.
- That's what I'm here to discuss

395
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,950
I must discuss something too.
Girls in your family fetch a bride price?

396
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,430
No, that was olden custom.
We will give our Paro away

397
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,460
So it's final. I'll give Paro away
in wedding. All the expense is mine

398
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,320
- Paro is my daughter too.
- No, giving the daughter away...

399
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,290
is a dream every parent dreams.
About the expense, we can share it

400
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,970
- Then it's decided, Sumitra.
- Really Didi?

401
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,890
- Yes, really.
- Therefore Kaki-Ma, you will be...

402
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:44,650
the master of ceremonies tonight.
A stunning dance for the guests?

403
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,210
- Oh no, not I...
- Why not? Don't you belong...

404
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:53,070
- ...to a family of theatre dancers?
- Yes Didi, but that was ages ago

405
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,060
No Kaki-Ma, no excuses.
Tonight you sing and you dance

406
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,860
- No dear, not I...
- Are you embarrassed? Just imagine

407
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,970
- You're dancing at Paro's wedding.
- Now I can't refuse, can I?

408
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,300
So be it.
Radha and Krishna and love divine

409
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,150
Dearest love

410
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,800
The Moon alone...

411
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,940
in night's embrace...

412
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,290
in moonlight vigil,
night's desire...

413
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,240
sang run-jhun run-jhun
a breezing gust...

414
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,780
into a radiant night...

415
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,030
rode in fireflies
on a palanquin of stars...

416
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,410
as the word played
on stilled lips

417
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,710
Then to the cadence
of drums and cymbals...

418
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,890
the duffle was struck...
then...

419
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,130
into the rhythm swayed...

420
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,370
my lovely Radha

421
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,210
Into the rhythm Radha swayed

422
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,290
Then he came from nowhere
and he said... I love you

423
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,140
Dear love...

424
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,680
oh but I'm afraid

425
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,920
Oh dearest love

426
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,760
No, not my wrist...

427
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,560
oh, how shameful

428
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,370
Leave me...

429
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,370
I beg of you

430
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,160
No, don't force me...

431
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,530
spare me

432
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,760
Dear love

433
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,240
No...

434
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,570
I'll curse you for this

435
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,490
Madman! Go away

436
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,900
Don't torment me

437
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,950
Oh dearest love...

438
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,410
dear love...

439
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,950
oh but I'm afraid

440
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,740
Love me

441
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,790
On the banks of the Yamuna...

442
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,490
Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love

443
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,270
Of desire in their hearts
rose a song to their lips

444
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,540
Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love

445
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,040
Thirsting in every breath,
searing passion in their hearts...

446
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,280
Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love

447
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,640
The word on stilled lips,
Krishna and Radha are in love

448
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,600
What is this?

449
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,840
The token of betrothal...

450
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,360
of my daughter to your son.
Paro and Devdas

451
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,840
Are you in your senses, Sumitra?
I invited mother and daughter...

452
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,640
to entertain my guests
with some melodrama

453
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,680
Instead, you are out
to work magic?

454
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:08,020
Kumud, you were right!
Sumitra-Kaki's timing is opportune

455
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,180
She does know how to
take advantage of opportunity

456
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,340
As a child, her daughter stole
guavas from our orchards

457
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:23,220
- Now she sets her sights on my son?
- No Didi, that isn't true

458
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,650
Devdas and Paro were
childhood sweethearts

459
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,460
They are in love, they can't live
without each other

460
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:35,290
In a large family, maybe you never noticed.
But I know how they yearn

461
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,600
Please do not refuse Didi,
even if it means...

462
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,870
that you will have nothing more
to do with me afterwards

463
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:48,920
Why draw water from poisoned wells?
You may not betray the traits

464
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,150
But your genes remain the same,
that of the dancing girls

465
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,390
Yes, we landlords eat fish...

466
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,240
but we won't let bones
stick in the gullet

467
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,400
For one, you are a neighbour.
Worse, as a family, disgraced

468
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,170
Even if you may momentarily forget
your disgrace, but your standing?

469
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,560
Don't you try to palm off
your bad coin

470
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:16,770
Chhoto-Ma, let it pass Chhoto-Ma.
We can always talk Dev out of it

471
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:23,980
Which leaves Parvati. If she can't
contain herself, send her to Dev

472
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,820
Honour among landlords
isn't sullied by such affairs

473
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,840
Unbecoming of a landlord's woman!
Don't interfere when elders speak

474
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,840
Enough! Replying to you
is beneath my dignity

475
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,560
My sister you were.
From now on, merely Kaushalya

476
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,760
And Kaushalya, you too sang
the day my daughter was born

477
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,120
Remember Badi-Ma? She took
my daughter from my arms...

478
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,240
saying Paro was her daughter!
With a smile, I had even said yes

479
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,450
Little did I know that even
in the big landlord's mansion...

480
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,280
a lady of the house could be
so narrow-minded...

481
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,160
as to count guavas stolen
from one of her orchards

482
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,240
Count, how many guavas did
my daughter steal? Tell me

483
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,300
Counting guavas?
By the count of it...

484
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,900
I've fed your son many more times
than your count of stolen guava

485
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,880
Stolen

486
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,900
And the disgrace?
Yes, we do sell our daughters

487
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,830
But you trade too, Kaushalya.
We sell our daughters, openly

488
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,030
But you swallow the dowries
and the daughters too

489
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:52,220
Good or bad, the coin is known by
it's tinkle. But you wouldn't know

490
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:58,110
Because you're deaf enough
not to know your son's heart

491
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,370
Blind you are, that you
do not see their love

492
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,310
Now soon you will stand dumbstruck
in witness your son's ruination

493
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:18,190
I swear, my daughter will marry
into a family richer than yours

494
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:25,320
In a week. If I fail, then come,
mourn my death on day eight

495
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,770
I came to wish that you would beget
a handsome son

496
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:37,810
But all I can wish is to see
that a daughter you be given

497
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,610
Paro, I hear your mother
is giving you away...

498
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,590
into a rich family.
Do you know your husband's name?

499
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,970
- Devdas.
- Even after all that happened...

500
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,720
- ...will Dev marry you?
- I'll ask him and I'll tell you

501
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,790
Is there anything left to ask?
She was insulted so gravely

502
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,030
- Dev didn't insult her, did he?
- Will you walk up...

503
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,020
to ask Dev to marry you?
Won't that be embarrassing?

504
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,760
Why be embarrassed about asking
for what is yours?

505
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:33,730
You're married, yet you don't
know what a husband means?

506
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Paro?

507
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,890
Are you all right?

508
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,510
So late at night?
In the dark...?

509
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,590
- Weren't you afraid?
- No, now I'm afraid of no one

510
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,750
- Not even of being maligned?
- No, when I am with you...

511
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,650
I don't even care about getting
a bad name

512
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,760
- Why... here... now...?
- Why does the river head to sea?

513
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,730
Why does the sunflower
always face the Sun?

514
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,030
And why comes Paro
heedless of her dignity...?

515
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,490
Why unheeding my family honour
do I venture out in dark of night?

516
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,610
Why do I seek refuge at your feet?
To all questions, a single answer

517
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:46,410
For the same reply, far too many
questions asking to be answered

518
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,940
There are no questions,
not as long as we're together

519
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,060
- That's what they don't want.
- What do you want?

520
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,290
Happiness, for you

521
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,730
But my father won't look at it
from our perspective

522
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,090
We'll win him over

523
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,920
What if he doesn't relent?

524
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:17,430
- Where there's love, there's no fear.
- Where there's smoke there's fire

525
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,350
In fires of attrition,
I don't want us...

526
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,590
- ...to be consumed.
- I'm doomed, in any case

527
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,660
Be it with you, or without you

528
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,730
- Let me drop you home.
- You're coming with me?

529
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,760
Without fear of censure?

530
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:00,090
Even the cur is wary of the door
it's kicked out of

531
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:05,080
What you can't get away with by
light of the day, you try by night?

532
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,960
Why don't you, mother and daughter
start a brothel?

533
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,500
Not even a pimp would advise
his daughter to do that

534
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Dev!!!

535
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Paro!

536
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,980
With the lamp,
I saw you burn for Devdas

537
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:39,910
I treasure your feelings. Were you
to have asked me before leaving...

538
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:45,020
I would not even mind if you were
to have been whore for a night

539
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,180
- Ma, I just went to ask him!
- And received what in reply?

540
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,160
Not alone, you carried with you,
the honour of our family

541
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,930
Have you left your honour behind?

542
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,390
Let it pass Babu-ji.
Why make a mountain out of a molehill?

543
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,800
By the way,
what to do about Paro's shawl?

544
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,800
Tell him to return it.
This marriage isn't happening

545
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I shall do no such thing

546
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,000
Don't forget yourself, Dev!

547
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,560
You forget whom you are addressing

548
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:32,040
A hot-headed landlord who will send
his fellow-man's daughter...

549
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,850
- ...to a brothel.
- Gentlemen's daughters...

550
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:39,690
never steal out of
neighbours' rooms at 2 a.m.

551
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,000
So great was her compulsion
and it was you who compelled her

552
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,000
Enough!

553
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,900
- I will brook no argument from you.
- Nor do I wish to talk to you

554
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,780
Fine. It's decided

555
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
I object

556
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Don't you realise?

557
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,850
Our family ranks are far higher
than theirs

558
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,141
I object

559
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,000
Yet, it's the same food we eat?

560
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,740
Our hierarchy, status, standing

561
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,000
Even the British government
is informed of us

562
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I object

563
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,670
- Yet, the same soil we tread upon?
- The bird that soars...

564
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,770
can never have any relationship
with fish in the waters

565
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,990
Yet, man on Earth relates
to God in Heaven?

566
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I said, I object

567
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,930
Stop Dev

568
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,000
Dev, everything can be resolved.
I'll talk to Babu-ji

569
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,600
- But don't leave the house.
- No Dwij

570
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,440
Childishness!

571
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,050
- Over something so trivial...?
- Trivial for you, not for me

572
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,280
Not for me a life praying
for every breath

573
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,230
- Dev, we'll talk to Babu-ji...
- Stop Dev

574
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,680
- Dev stop.
- Stop! Listen to me

575
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,730
Stop him, Kumud

576
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,130
You aren't going anywhere.
Your mother is talking to the master

577
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,360
- Everything will be fine.
- No Dharamdas

578
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,440
The tempest ought to pass.
If I stay on, much will be undone

579
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,710
Listen to me

580
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,120
Lady...

581
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,140
Dev is leaving, Paro

582
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,940
It's as much his test as it is yours.
See for yourself...

583
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,900
what he cares for, you or family?
Is he taking you with him?

584
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,780
Or is he deserting you?
If he isn't taking you along...

585
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,140
then you shall do
your mother's bidding

586
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,180
Stop Deva! I won't let you leave!

587
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,470
- Stop.
- Out of my way

588
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,300
Paro. That night, all sense
of reasoning deserted me

589
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,150
I was left vacillating
as if between pendulous scales

590
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,470
You wouldn't want me to displease
my father to make you happy...

591
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,130
would you?

592
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:27,660
Why does the river go to sea?
Why the sunflower gazes at the sun?

593
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,320
Instead of hunting answers,
why not let the question pass?

594
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:39,850
What was between us, was no more
than childishness. There's no love

595
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,890
From now onwards,
you are the girl next-door

596
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,290
And I, your friend Dev

597
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,890
Paro, get dressed, come downstairs.
Hurry. Your in-laws are here

598
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,580
My love! Oh why did you
leave me smouldering?

599
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,850
Why did you snub out the flame?

600
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,180
Ei Dev...

601
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:22,990
Friend, you aren't asleep yet?
Are you a stranger in my home?

602
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,920
Nothing of the sort, Chuni Babu.
I'm just not feeling sleepy

603
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,970
Here... Drink up...

604
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,010
- You know I don't drink.
- Then what gives?

605
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,180
If "h" is for happiness in life,
why are you so looking so harassed?

606
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:47,810
- So harried as not to feel at home?
- Nothing of the sort

607
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,950
- Fought with your parents?
- No

608
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,500
Or are you nursing
a wounded heart?

609
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:01,340
My point! That's my point!
"H" for heart and for hurt

610
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,750
And the two are related
so closely my friend, oh-so-closely

611
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Have you suffered no pain?

612
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,350
for men may see but no more
than a smiling face

613
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,840
You know what I make family with.
Just me and my wealth

614
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,410
And therefore it was
that I adopted music

615
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,770
The "Thumri" for my daughter,
and the "Dadra", my son

616
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:35,650
The "w" in words is tricky, making for
warmth, worn, wealth, worlds, wisdom...

617
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:43,700
wastrels and wishes. Worship too.
A well-wisher and your waywardness

618
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:52,910
Get over this insanity and let's go away.
Way away. I feel walled-in

619
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,430
- But Chuni Babu, where to?
- Wherever you wish

620
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,290
Where you go every night

621
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,440
There, where the anklets tinkle?

622
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,500
Where are you taking me, Chuni Babu?

623
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,500
This city is known as the pool of happiness

624
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It looks like a graveyard to me

625
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,500
Everyone has another opinion

626
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Some call it the grave of unhappiness
and to some it's the save of happiness

627
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,000
You are there, where is day in night time

628
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,250
How are you ladies?
Look, whom I've brought to you

629
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,310
- Who is it?
- My classmate from London

630
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:56,110
Where are you lost Dev Babu?
Come, here too I hold court

631
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,200
Welcome my friend, enter

632
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,020
Chandramukhi

633
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:47,580
Your mirror couldn't bear to see my face.
I'm sorry for your loss

634
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:55,890
If sorrow be joy's harbinger,
every loss signals what gain shall be?

635
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:01,250
Wonderful Chandramukhi!
Even your words are so seductive

636
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:08,420
But do use the kohl, to ward off
the stranger's evil eye

637
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,730
- You are much amused?
- Naturally

638
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,370
I see someone trying
to ward off the evil eye...

639
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:20,150
while women
on the marketplace...

640
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,310
vie to be seen

641
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,770
You touch upon eyespeak
and you have stolen my heart

642
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:34,760
What I took for stone,
breathes the life into me

643
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,420
So you see Dev Babu?
On "c" and Chandramukhi...

644
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,140
didn't I warn you she's
cause of such amazement?

645
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,260
Chuni Babu also begins with a "c"

646
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:52,790
Of c's and cause célèbres
and Chandramukhi...

647
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,860
you saw how clumsy
she made me look?

648
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:34,160
Jasmine makes fragrant...

649
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,410
her lovely dark tresses

650
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:42,210
Radha's face is aglow, electric

651
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,660
Her gait, seductive

652
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:30,100
Krishna stopped her

653
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,250
He surprised Radha with a kiss

654
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,420
Surprised Radha with a kiss...

655
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:37,710
with a kiss

656
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:43,330
Radha's veil was slipping away

657
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:55,420
Do not tease me,
Radha pleaded

658
01:06:56,570 --> 01:07:00,400
Why are you teasing me?

659
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,620
But Krishna was obstinate

660
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,460
He shamed Radha

661
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:37,100
That night,
Krishna wouldn't listen

662
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:42,920
But whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna wouldn't listen

663
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:48,510
Oh, why are you teasing me?

664
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,880
A pot of milk...

665
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,020
Radha carried on her head...

666
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:19,940
when she heard...

667
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,760
Krishna's footsteps...

668
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,680
and her heart...

669
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,910
skipped a beat

670
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,250
Radha pleaded, don't hold my arms
so hard, then her bangles broke

671
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,710
But that night...

672
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:09,740
whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna wouldn't listen

673
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:13,390
Oh stop teasing me

674
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,500
Mesmeric

675
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:07,380
Where are you off to?
Tarry, the night has just come of age

676
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:12,780
I made a big mistake! I shouldn't
have written that letter to Paro

677
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:19,560
- I want to go to Paro.
- Who's Paro? Wait, wait for me

678
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,610
Bad manners, walking out
on a performance

679
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:28,310
Dancing to an audience
of drunken men...

680
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:30,610
is shamelessness

681
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,860
You are a woman, Chandramukhi.
Realise who you are

682
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,470
Woman, mother, sister,
wife, friend

683
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,790
When she is none...

684
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,830
she is whore

685
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,620
Could you be some else,
Chandramukhi?

686
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,900
Price. For our time together

687
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,780
Keep it

688
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,670
Friend...

689
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,280
See? Someone I wanted
to stay on, is gone

690
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,000
In what are you lost?

691
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Such anguish in those eyes

692
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,060
Does anguish make you anxious?

693
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:32,310
Have courtesans no hearts?
Is she denied the right to love?

694
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:36,660
Of course! If there be amour,
paramour there is too

695
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:39,540
- Will you do me a favour?
- Say it

696
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,580
For just once,
will you bring him?

697
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,850
Promise, I cannot. But try, I shall.
Only for you

698
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,600
Look at her! Paro is as resplendent
as the Moon tonight

699
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:01,470
Had Devdas been here,
he'd know what he has lost

700
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,650
My Paro is lucky

701
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,980
Her wedding procession is coming
all the way from Manikpur...

702
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,310
- ...like a train of lights.
- You haven't seen it

703
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,700
The bride's mother must not watch
her daughter's wedding procession

704
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,450
Lest the mother gives
the bride the evil eye

705
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:18,800
And after tonight no one will ever
call her Paro

706
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,060
Just Parvati

707
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,040
Kaki-Ma

708
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,400
Is Paro in?

709
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:35,160
The wedding procession
is about to arrive

710
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:39,000
You can see her.
Let's go, Manorama

711
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,740
I'm back Paro

712
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,960
- Why?
- I've come back to you. Forever

713
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,840
When my wedding procession
is at my door?

714
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:05,570
No Paro. There's still time.
I'll convince my parents. I'll tell them...

715
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:11,200
Your parents! Haven't I...?
If honour matters to your family...

716
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:14,810
doesn't honour matter to us?
Your father may be a landlord

717
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,740
Doesn't my father count? No matter
how lowly we bride-sellers are...

718
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,900
- ...we never cheat anyone.
- I never cheated you, Paro

719
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,260
Then why did you leave me?
And... and that letter?

720
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,260
Paro you know, your Dev never does
anything deliberately

721
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,460
I was naive

722
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:41,850
Naivete! How naive can you be Dev?
On a whim, you give me a bracelet?

723
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,310
On a whim, you write saying
there's no love lost! Naivete?

724
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,560
- Paro forever... another whim?
- Paro! Your wedding procession

725
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,420
Time to part

726
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,970
- I don't accept this marriage!
- What difference? I accept

727
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:06,950
- Then, I'm going to tell everyone...
- ...I went to see you at 2 a.m.?

728
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,460
- You want to malign me?
- Malign you... I?

729
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,230
How could you think?
Paro, if you ever say that again...

730
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:18,500
What will you do? Hit me?
Ever since I was a child...

731
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,110
have you held me in fief?
And when I ask for my right...

732
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,890
- ...you do a volte face?
- Enough! Stop it Paro

733
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,430
- Such vanity is no good.
- Why should I not be vain?

734
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,590
What are you Dev,
but wealthy and handsome?

735
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,710
I possess virtues, beauty.
And after tonight, riches too

736
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,600
From now on, I am more
than an equal to you

737
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,760
If you be a landlord, I take pride
in being an aristocrat

738
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,330
Such vanity?

739
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:01,790
- Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

740
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,970
What have you done?

741
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:28,420
I have scarred you, like the Moon.
With the mark of my love

742
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:06,380
On joyous night...

743
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:13,040
when her bridal procession arrived...

744
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,870
slowly, a sea of sorrow...

745
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,100
rose, stilled in her eyes

746
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,270
To lilting lutes...

747
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:29,420
her eyes told the tale

748
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,450
Always, it was you I loved...

749
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,360
and I loved and I loved...

750
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,820
and I loved forever

751
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,910
Forever I have longed for you
as I have longed for nothing else

752
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,870
My heart has worshipped you...

753
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,200
worshipped you and worshipped...

754
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,710
and worshipped but none else

755
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,940
Never...

756
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,930
never, never, never...

757
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,010
and none else

758
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,360
Sorrow clouds a joy...

759
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,660
shades of anguish darken her...

760
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,790
as she goes to tell her beloved...

761
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,220
only to tell her beloved

762
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:24,110
The wound you have left me with...

763
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:30,830
only adds to my beauty

764
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:37,560
My wound I will preserve
as your mark...

765
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:44,080
that anoints my forehead

766
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,060
My beloved...

767
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,610
oh beloved...

768
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,640
without you...

769
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,760
my life is incomplete...

770
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,680
vacuous...

771
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,600
empty...

772
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:59,030
my life is empty...

773
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,450
Carrying memories
of moments past...

774
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,680
with burdened steps
she walks...

775
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,500
her heart cries...

776
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,580
her eyes weep...

777
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:27,130
her heart...

778
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,810
resonates

779
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,520
Childhood memories...

780
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,570
of relationships...

781
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:42,770
swinging in the rain...

782
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,260
smiling...

783
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,990
drawing laughter...

784
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,880
annoyed, being placated

785
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,140
Every moment...

786
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,340
etched into my heart...

787
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,170
in the flames of my lamp...

788
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:03,250
I am carrying...

789
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:06,770
away

790
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,660
My beloved...

791
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,570
without you...

792
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:17,340
my life is nothing...

793
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,430
nothing at all

794
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,620
Always, you I loved...

795
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,730
and I loved and I loved...

796
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,430
and I loved forever

797
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,060
I loved, loved, loved

798
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,520
You, I loved and loved

799
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:52,790
I loved and loved

800
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,830
Only loved and loved and loved

801
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,120
Deva! Open up!
What are you doing?

802
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:32,670
- Open up! What madness is this?
- For my sake! Open up

803
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,760
I said it! Don't tear Deva and Paro apart!
But who listens to me?

804
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,580
- What's going on?
- Look! Tell him something

805
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,670
- Narayan, tell him.
- No point. Leave him alone

806
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,550
- The fire will die down on its own.
- But look...

807
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,500
Kaushalya!

808
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,360
Time plays games with everyone

809
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:03,450
My daughter treads upon silver now!
But look...

810
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,290
look at your son. It's your pride
that he sets afire

811
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,170
Two acts to the melodrama!

812
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,370
In Act One
my daughter and I danced

813
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,790
Act Two:
Now you and your son will dance

814
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,680
- Why is the new bride so dejected?
- Because last night...

815
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:47,010
- ...husband and bride slept apart.
- That's for the first night

816
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:49,120
It's said to be ominous.
But it's over

817
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,810
From tonight, man and wife
will sleep together

818
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:56,090
Are you harassing the bride?

819
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,210
Sit... sit... sit Parvati

820
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:06,000
You know, we had everything here,
but the Moon. And now you're here

821
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,290
Now you are the lady of the manor

822
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:11,550
Also a mother to these children

823
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,820
From his first wife,
Bhuvan has three children

824
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:19,850
- Your son, Mahendra.
- Obeisances, Chhoti-Ma

825
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:24,650
- And our youngest, little Kalika.
- My obeisances, Chhoti-Ma

826
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,180
And Yashomati, the eldest

827
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:31,920
She's angry. You must placate her

828
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,160
And all of you...

829
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,950
you must adorn
the bride exquisitely...

830
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,440
for her nuptial night

831
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,520
Have you familiarised yourself
with the manor?

832
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,300
- Yes.
- You have my word, Parvati...

833
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:53,010
in this manor, you will have
no problems about anything

834
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,640
Except one

835
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:00,120
- It is difficult to bide time here.
- Oh but time flies here

836
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:06,840
- I do not understand...?
- A while ago I was a new bride

837
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,370
And in no time, I'm Chhoti-Ma
(Chhoti-Ma: Little Mother)

838
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,910
From bride to "little Mother",
I'm transformed. In no time

839
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:19,780
I wish to tell you something.
I married because my Ma insisted

840
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:24,840
My children needed a mother,
and this manor needs a lady

841
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,290
And you...?

842
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:34,240
Subhadra... was my first wife

843
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,790
You're now the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children...

844
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:44,240
and my new bride, no doubt.
But Subhadra, I can never forget

845
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:50,320
The ominous first night may be over.
But we will stay distanced, forever

846
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:55,440
My mistake or my sin,
call it what you may...

847
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,840
but do forgive me, Parvati

848
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,310
Good morning friend, good morning.
You're lucky, my friend

849
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,450
I ask help of the spirits
to knock me out of my senses

850
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,420
You won't even touch the spirits
and yet you are inebriated?

851
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:30,810
You missed telling me? Or made
a pariah of me? Paro and paramour

852
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,130
Both spelt with "p"! Your stupor
has unravelled all your secrets

853
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,370
Who brought me here?

854
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:44,670
My lover is so faithless

855
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:50,820
How regrettable, to be rescued
off the streets by a prostitute

856
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,820
This one is an ingrate Chuni Babu!
Bites me for the love I gave him

857
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:03,300
My word! She helped you out of
humane concern. You were sick

858
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:08,110
She picked you up from the streets.
You've come to, after two days

859
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:13,480
She never slept a wink, nursed you,
sat through your cries for Paro

860
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,910
Insult instead of gratitude?

861
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:23,730
Let it pass. It's a landlord trait.
Never mind their little trespasses

862
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:29,810
You left as if, forever.
But as luck would have it...

863
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,070
I find you once again.
Medicine...

864
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,280
you need it. Now

865
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:41,840
Your medicine, I don't need.
I'd rather have lain there

866
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:47,420
Just fall unconscious once again.
I'll dump you where I found you

867
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,580
Yes Chuni Babu?

868
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,670
- What is this?
- Chuni Babu says...

869
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,150
you've been here for two nights.
Lamps in your boudoir went unlit

870
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:04,130
This is price. For two nights
you wasted on me

871
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,770
Now I know,
why Paro abandoned you

872
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,440
Let alone love...
