1
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,200
My father died suddenly.

2
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:03,604
I only found out last night.

3
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,958
The mayor informed me by phone.

4
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:08,399
I couldn't believe it.

5
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:13,367
My hometown is Sanhetun,
a village in the mountains.

6
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,518
I left home to work in the city.

7
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,926
I was so busy
that I haven't been back in years.

8
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:23,883
My father was the village schoolteacher.

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,163
He taught there all his life.

10
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,086
I am the only child...

11
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,405
...the only one from our village
who went to college.

12
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,923
I am very worried about my mother.

13
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,806
I am afraid she can not
cope with this sudden change.

14
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,964
Come in and take a break.

15
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:16,483
I've got to get back.

16
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,883
Thank your boss again for me.

17
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,967
Thank you.

18
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,642
Mother?

19
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,327
- Mother?
- Yusheng.

20
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,118
Mayor, Uncle Xia.

21
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,242
I saw the car and I knew you were back.

22
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,726
Come in. It's warmer inside.

23
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,082
Sit down.

24
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:02,799
I couldn't tell you much over the phone.

25
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,806
Now that you're here
I can explain everything.

26
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,402
For many years, your father had wanted...

27
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,685
...to rebuild the schoolhouse...

28
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,601
...but there were always reasons
we couldn't.

29
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:19,562
He brought it up again recently,
and the village agreed.

30
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:26,839
We had the materials we needed,
but not enough money.

31
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:29,243
Your father's mind was made up.

32
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,560
He began travelling around,
trying to borrow money.

33
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,119
He went all over the county.

34
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,678
If he thought there was a chance,
he'd go after it.

35
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:41,677
On the last trip, on his way home...

36
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,487
...he ran into a heavy snowstorm.

37
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,524
He was stuck in the storm and he got sick.

38
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,038
He was too sick to be moved.

39
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:54,883
He was in bad shape when he got back,
so we took him to the hospital.

40
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,123
They examined him
and found that he had a heart problem.

41
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,438
We've known your dad all these years...

42
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:04,122
...but never knew he had a heart condition.

43
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:07,083
They tried saving him, but it was no use.

44
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,484
Your father then passed away.

45
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:14,246
- Where is my father now?
- In the provincial hospital morgue.

46
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:20,321
We have been waiting for you to return
to discuss this with you.

47
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:24,000
Last time I spoke with him,
he seemed fine.

48
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,598
He had gotten older, plus the bad storm.

49
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,161
At his age, it was too much for him.

50
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,442
It would have been hard on anyone.

51
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,244
The heavy snowstorm
was too much to handle.

52
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:43,484
The village intends to arrange a car
to bring your father back...

53
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:48,082
...back here to bury him in the village.

54
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,680
That's what we planned.

55
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:56,207
That's fine. Go ahead.

56
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,519
But there is a problem.

57
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:02,523
Your mother doesn't want to use a car.

58
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,847
She wants your father to be carried back.

59
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,281
What do you mean?

60
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:13,044
It's an old tradition.
We'll carry him on the road home...

61
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:16,641
...so your father won't forget his way.

62
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,521
It's a superstition.

63
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,638
And she wants to walk with us.

64
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:25,807
- So, let's do it.
- We want to do it.

65
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,325
He was our village teacher.
Everyone respects him.

66
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,966
But our young people
have all left for the city.

67
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,766
They've gone away to work.

68
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:37,163
Only old people and children are left.

69
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:40,166
Due to this circumstance,
we are planning...

70
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,923
...to bring your father back by tractor.
It'll take only half a day.

71
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,757
We would like you
to persuade your mother.

72
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,760
Thank you for your concern.

73
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:53,520
- I will talk it over with her.
- Good.

74
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:55,281
Where is she?

75
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,199
Probably at the schoolhouse.

76
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,518
She's been there every day since he died.

77
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:03,558
She just sits there
and doesn't listen to anyone.

78
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:06,606
She goes there whenever she has time.

79
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,440
- Is she okay?
- I think so.

80
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,286
I am only afraid--

81
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,882
- Is it the old schoolhouse?
- Yes.

82
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,561
I'll go to see her.

83
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,441
- Mother.
- Yusheng.

84
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,167
It's so cold. Let's go home, okay?

85
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,800
Your father passed away.

86
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:53,640
Let's go home, Mother.

87
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,843
We can never see him again.

88
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:25,163
Get on the bed. It's warm there.

89
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:31,802
- Yusheng.
- Yes.

90
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,566
Bring me my loom.

91
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,078
Why do you need the loom?

92
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,567
I want to weave something.

93
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,001
Weave what?

94
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,197
A cloth to cover your father's coffin.

95
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,562
Mother, don't weave it.

96
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:52,806
I'll go buy one instead.

97
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,204
I don't want you to buy one.

98
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,720
That loom is so old.

99
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:03,237
It's been broken for years.
Nobody uses it anymore.

100
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,598
Ask Uncle Xia to repair it.

101
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:12,277
I think you are too tired lately.
You need rest.

102
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:15,356
I have to weave the cloth for him myself.

103
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,319
I'll go buy one right now, okay?

104
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,518
No! Just bring me the loom.

105
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:56,001
The only loom left in the village
is this one of your mother's.

106
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,166
She's guarded it like a treasure.

107
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,567
She wants to repair the loom
and weave the cloth.

108
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:06,397
It seems like she's determined
to have your father carried back.

109
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:10,360
Carrying the dead is an old custom.

110
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:15,641
We have to yell
when climbing the mountains...

111
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:19,761
...crossing the river,
and passing the crossroads.

112
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,121
What do we say?

113
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,518
We tell him that this is the road home.

114
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:30,119
Everyone yells at him
so that he remembers his way home.

115
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,638
Uncle Xia, if we do
what my mother wishes...

116
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,004
...will it really be so difficult?

117
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,965
It is a problem, yes.

118
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,684
We don't have the manpower.

119
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:43,922
All our young people have left.

120
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,962
No one has followed this custom
since the Cultural Revolution.

121
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,996
I don't want her to weave the cloth.

122
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,877
But I don't know how to stop her.

123
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,883
It seems as if having father carried home
is all that matters to her now.

124
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,768
I know about your wishes for the funeral.

125
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:32,517
Yes.

126
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:36,681
I think it won't be easy for the village.

127
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,639
Don't you worry about that.

128
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:44,601
Your father lived here for 40 years.

129
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,925
He taught many generations of kids.

130
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:54,327
He worked long hours all these years.

131
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,919
The villagers should pay
their last respects to him.

132
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:04,204
The mayor agrees with you.
It's just that it will be difficult.

133
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,484
I feel that it is the same...

134
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,006
...if we have him carried back
by men or by a tractor.

135
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,281
It is not the same.

136
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:20,602
Whatever it takes,
we have to have him carried back.

137
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,845
If the village doesn't help,
we will do it ourselves.

138
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:33,078
We must go to carry your father back.

139
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,805
Mother, take a break tonight.

140
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:46,727
I have to finish this cloth.

141
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,285
You seem too tired lately.
You need to rest.

142
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,168
You can go to sleep in your father's study.

143
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,238
I have to finish this cloth tonight.

144
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:58,319
This picture was taken
the year my parents got married.

145
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,436
My father was not from the village.

146
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,719
He came here to teach.

147
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:09,567
The story of my parents' courtship
is well known in the village.

148
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:13,760
Practically everyone here
has heard about it.

149
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,603
My mother had just turned 18.

150
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:20,246
My father was 20.

151
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,766
My mother told me...

152
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,761
...my father arrived
by a horse-drawn carriage.

153
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,884
This is our new teacher.
His name is Luo, Luo Changyu.

154
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:04,406
- Is that Di? What's all the racket for?
- Nothing.

155
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,879
I heard they all went
to see the teacher this morning.

156
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,923
- Has he arrived yet?
- Yes.

157
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:15,318
Great. Our village finally got
its own teacher.

158
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,802
- What does he look like?
- He's a young man.

159
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:23,242
A young man can teach?

160
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:26,120
He must be talented.

161
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:30,282
- Where is he staying?
- The village council office.

162
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:33,246
Good. There is a heated bed
in the council office.

163
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,087
Where will he eat?

164
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,046
He'll eat with a different family each day.

165
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:42,562
When it's our turn,
we should make a good meal.

166
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,798
Di, what are you doing?

167
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:50,716
Nothing.

168
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:55,163
Why did you change into new clothes
just to see the teacher?

169
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:05,036
My grandmother was already blind by then.

170
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:10,084
Mother said when Grandfather died,
Grandmother cried until she went blind.

171
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:16,399
After Grandfather died, Mother was
the only one to take care of Grandmother.

172
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:21,278
Grandmother's only wish was
to find a good husband for Mother.

173
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,524
She had many men propose to her.

174
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:26,003
But my mother didn't like any of them.

175
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,484
When my father arrived,
the schoolhouse wasn't completed yet.

176
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:38,558
The mayor asked all the men
to help finish it.

177
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:43,077
According to one of our village customs,
a new building must have...

178
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,245
...a red cloth wrapped around its beam
for good luck.

179
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,918
The cloth is called the "Lucky Red Banner."

180
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,523
It must be wo ven
by the most beautiful maiden in the village.

181
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:55,964
This task, of course, fell upon my mother.

182
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,640
Perhaps she already had my father in mind.

183
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,925
The red cloth she made
was especially beautiful.

184
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,762
The village had two wells back then.

185
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,958
The old well was called the "Front Well."

186
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,562
The newer well was called the "Back Well."

187
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:23,927
Most people used the Back Well
since it was closer to the village.

188
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:28,042
After my father arrived,
my mother started to use the old well...

189
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,443
...because she could pass by the school.

190
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,637
Back then, when the village had
a big event like building a new house...

191
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:30,963
...each family prepared a dish...

192
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,927
...for the men working on the site.

193
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,722
My mother prepared her best dishes...

194
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,086
...hoping my father would eat
what she made.

195
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:04,926
In the old days, women were not allowed
to participate in many things...

196
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,325
...such as building a new house
or digging a new well.

197
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:11,445
Superstition had it
that women would bring bad luck.

198
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,844
When they built the schoolhouse,
women could only...

199
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,078
...watch from a distance.

200
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:46,156
- What did you make today?
- Steamed bread.

201
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,921
- Di, what did you make?
- I made onion cakes.

202
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:51,921
I brought rice steamed in lotus leaves.

203
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:54,602
Steamed rice is not as good
as onion cakes.

204
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,765
- Did you save some for your boyfriend?
- Shut up!

205
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,043
They just pick up any dish at random.

206
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,039
They don't know who made what.

207
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:05,806
I wonder who ate my dumplings.

208
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:13,207
Put them here.

209
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:11,478
You're already done with the banner?

210
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:14,118
I was going to come get it from you.

211
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:18,238
- Give it to me.
- It's okay. I saved you a trip.

212
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:22,238
This is a beautiful banner.

213
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,676
The school is almost finished.

214
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,801
The first lesson will be Chinese literature.

215
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,807
- Is the teacher happy with the food?
- Yes.

216
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,438
- Does he eat what we make?
- Yes.

217
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,886
Does he grab the food like you guys?

218
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:42,244
No. He's a gentleman from the city.
He is not like us.

219
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,965
So how does it work?

220
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,763
We always ask the teacher to pick first.

221
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:18,639
"In life...."
Read after me.

222
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,039
"One must have a goal."

223
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,718
Let's start from the beginning.

224
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:31,839
"Reading and writing opens one's eyes."

225
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:39,525
"Writing and counting benefit one's life."

226
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,078
"Keep a journal faithfully."

227
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,601
"Know the present, know the past..."

228
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:03,160
When I was young, my mother told me
my father had a beautiful voice.

229
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:07,679
My mother is illiterate
She didn't understand the text.

230
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:11,160
But she couldn't resist my father's voice.

231
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,086
She went by the school
every day after that.

232
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:20,004
For most, the novelty of the new school
wore off after a while.

233
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:21,760
But not for my mother.

234
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:24,357
For 40 years, she went to listen.

235
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,963
It became part of her life.

236
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,723
"Have respect for your elders."

237
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:54,117
My mother heard that each day
after school...

238
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:56,842
...my father walked some students home.

239
00:24:56,968 --> 00:25:00,597
She started waiting beside the road,
hoping to meet my father.

240
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:16,442
"The birds sing with the beautiful sun."

241
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,243
"Their songs wake the beautiful flowers."

242
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,088
- Who is she?
- That's Zhao Di.

243
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:39,000
- Is she from the village?
- Yes.

244
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:43,642
Di, the teacher is asking about you!

245
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,837
- Teacher, you want some water?
- Yes.

246
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:32,245
- Let me get it for you.
- No, I can do it myself.

247
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,517
- Let me do it.
- I can do it, thanks.

248
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:40,518
You're the teacher, you shouldn't bother.
Let me do it.

249
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,447
Come on.

250
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,117
I can.

251
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:59,882
Di, how come you came to the Front Well?

252
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:16,238
- Tomorrow it's our turn to have you over.
- I know.

253
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:36,196
My father told me the first time
he went to my mother's house...

254
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:39,039
...she stood in the doorway.

255
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:43,846
Leaning against the door frame,
she looked like a figure in a painting.

256
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,642
That's the image he would never forget.

257
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:57,280
- Di, is the teacher here?
- Yes.

258
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:00,803
I could tell by his heavy footsteps.

259
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,606
Come in. Let me see.

260
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:06,237
My mother's eyesight is no good.

261
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,837
This teacher is very tall.

262
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:12,198
Sit down, please.

263
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,757
The food must taste good to you.

264
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,767
You sound like you're enjoying it.

265
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:08,876
How long have you been in our village?

266
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,607
About a month.

267
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:13,441
- Have you gotten used to it?
- Yes.

268
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:14,927
That's good.

269
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,484
- You're from the city?
- Yes, from East Gate.

270
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,725
How did you choose Sanhetun?

271
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,117
After graduation, I had nothing to do.

272
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,927
One day I saw someone on the street
signing people up.

273
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,364
I signed up without asking what it was for.
I ended up here.

274
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:32,279
- Do you regret it?
- No.

275
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:33,357
Why not?

276
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,287
I like it here.

277
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,406
- Are you married?
- No.

278
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:44,485
- Are you engaged?
- No.

279
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:54,918
Di will do it. Just sit down, please.

280
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:12,326
Do you remember this bowl?
The white and blue design?

281
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:16,321
No, I don't remember it.

282
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:19,400
- Did you eat the food brought to the site?
- Yes.

283
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:22,807
It seems Di's hard work
wasn't appreciated.

284
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:25,562
Di didn't tell me, but I knew everything.

285
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:29,921
When you were building the school,
she made all her best dishes.

286
00:37:30,008 --> 00:37:32,044
She always used that bowl...

287
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:34,797
...hoping you would choose her dish.

288
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,118
Even I wasn't allowed to touch it.

289
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:41,517
I remember now.

290
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:43,837
You do?

291
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,044
No wonder the bowl seems familiar.

292
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:48,124
- You ate from this bowl?
- Yes.

293
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:50,246
What did you eat?

294
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,837
On the first day, I made onion cakes.

295
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,647
On the second,
scrambled eggs with onions on rice.

296
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:03,918
On the third day, mushroom dumplings.

297
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,318
What a shame, three delicious meals.

298
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:08,805
Mushroom dumplings are my favourite.

299
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:11,118
I'll make you some this afternoon.

300
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,158
- That's too much trouble for you.
- Not at all.

301
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,126
You've just finished lunch,
and now you're planning dinner.

302
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,245
Di, show the teacher out.
He must be very busy.

303
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:22,446
Yes, I should go.

304
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,559
You look pretty in that red jacket.

305
00:38:40,648 --> 00:38:42,445
I remember it from the day I arrived.

306
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,281
Don't forget to come back for dumplings
this afternoon.

307
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:58,284
You shouldn't make the dumplings.

308
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:00,797
- Why not?
- So you won't regret it later.

309
00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:04,362
- What will I regret?
- You know it yourself.

310
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,879
This teacher is a nice man.

311
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:09,004
But he's out of our class.

312
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:12,242
What are you talking about?
They're only dumplings.

313
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:15,161
Don't play dumb. I'm just being honest.

314
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:17,604
You'd better forget about him.

315
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:49,240
- I won't go back.
- You've got no choice.

316
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,240
I came to say goodbye.

317
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:27,525
Where are you going?

318
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,926
- Back to the city.
- What's happened?

319
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,236
Nothing.

320
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,958
I saw you arguing with someone.

321
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,640
Was that what it was about?

322
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,003
Who was he?
Why do you have to go back?

323
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:41,407
It's no big deal.

324
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:43,638
He just wants to ask me some questions.

325
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,840
- Can't he ask you questions here?
- It's not up to him.

326
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:52,920
Will you come back?

327
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:54,327
Of course!

328
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:56,040
I have classes to teach.

329
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:57,959
When will you be back?

330
00:41:58,288 --> 00:42:00,324
By the 27th at the latest.

331
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:03,885
I will be back before
the school holiday starts on the 28th.

332
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:11,562
- Come in and have some dumplings.
- I can't.

333
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:14,242
I have things to do before I go.
Don't wait for me.

334
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:18,159
He's waiting for me.

335
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:20,525
Tell him to come, too.

336
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,758
Anyway, you have to eat.

337
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:29,326
Okay, I'll be back.

338
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:32,442
I'll wait for you.

339
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:35,443
This is for you.

340
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:38,598
It goes well with your red jacket.

341
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:50,160
I'll be waiting.

342
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:06,042
What is going on? No more classes?

343
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,642
- He's in some political trouble.
- What?

344
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,764
I don't understand it either.

345
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,039
Maybe he'll be back soon.

346
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:35,806
The teacher's left.

347
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:43,720
- The teacher's left?
- Yes.

348
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:46,083
- When?
- The mayor just saw him off.

349
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:12,162
My mother retraced her steps every day...

350
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:14,724
...searching back and forth.

351
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:18,798
She had to find the clip
that my father gave her.

352
00:49:57,008 --> 00:49:58,760
Bowl and pot repair.

353
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:05,321
Please come in.

354
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:39,086
I charge for the nails I use.

355
00:51:39,168 --> 00:51:41,728
This will cost you more than
buying a new bowl.

356
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:44,447
Just tell me how much and I'll pay you.

357
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,928
- Is it a family heirloom?
- No.

358
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:51,444
Did it belong to someone special?

359
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:53,246
You could say that.

360
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:55,397
Who?

361
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:58,963
I'm doing it for my daughter.

362
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:02,040
The man who used it left...

363
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:04,562
...and took my daughter's heart with him.

364
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:07,242
I want to repair it
to keep the memory alive for her.

365
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:11,886
I'll make it all perfect again.

366
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:15,003
Your daughter will have a perfect memory.

367
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:53,439
Di, what are you doing?

368
00:52:53,808 --> 00:52:56,276
Nothing. I need some water.

369
00:53:50,288 --> 00:53:52,006
Two times two equals four.

370
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:53,647
Two times three equals six.

371
00:53:54,888 --> 00:53:56,560
Two times four equals eight.

372
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:58,606
Two times five equals ten.

373
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,202
Two times six equals twelve.

374
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:03,765
Two times seven equals fourteen.

375
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,286
Two times eight equals sixteen.

376
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:09,125
Two times nine equals eighteen.

377
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:12,520
Three times three equals nine.

378
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:17,160
Three times four equals twelve.

379
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,358
Three times five equals fifteen.

380
00:54:20,848 --> 00:54:22,600
Three times six equals eighteen.

381
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:25,717
Three times seven equals twenty-one.

382
00:54:26,048 --> 00:54:27,800
Three times eight equals twenty-four.

383
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:31,116
Three times nine equals twenty-seven.

384
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:28,763
My father told my mother,
when he was teaching the kids...

385
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:31,847
...he could always look up
and see the red banner.

386
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,200
The banner reminded him
of my mother in her red jacket.

387
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:40,198
The mayor kept insisting
on covering the ceiling properly...

388
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:42,199
...but my father never let him.

389
00:55:42,888 --> 00:55:46,278
That's why the ceiling
was never completed.

390
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:43,201
My mother sat in the classroom
for hours that day.

391
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:46,007
The door was open,
and the mayor saw her there.

392
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:49,084
He understood what it meant.

393
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:53,439
Once he knew,
the news got around the village quickly.

394
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:57,999
Back then, arranged marriages
were the norm.

395
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:02,320
Mother was the first in the village
to express her love freely.

396
00:58:12,608 --> 00:58:15,122
On the day my father promised to return...

397
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,677
...my mother started waiting at dawn.

398
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:20,718
She remembered his promise...

399
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,318
...that he would return on the 27th...

400
00:58:23,528 --> 00:58:26,406
...before the school holiday began
on the 28th.

401
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:28,758
He had to be back before that.

402
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:46,761
It's so cold outside. Where have you been?

403
01:00:47,608 --> 01:00:49,360
Get into bed to warm yourself up.

404
01:00:58,808 --> 01:01:01,641
You're burning up! You have a fever!

405
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:36,368
I know you went to wait for the teacher.

406
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:39,565
Everyone says he's in trouble
and won't be back.

407
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:41,445
You've got to let go.

408
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,199
I'm going to the city to find him.

409
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:49,166
Are you crazy? You're ill!

410
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:52,007
Di! Come back!

411
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:34,565
My mother didn't make it to the city.

412
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:36,240
She fainted by the road.

413
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:39,646
Someone saw her
and got word to the mayor.

414
01:02:40,848 --> 01:02:44,045
The mayor and my uncle
brought her home on a cart.

415
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:49,243
The mayor said that day
my mother's hands were like ice.

416
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:54,196
She was wrapped in a heavy blanket
on the way home.

417
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:56,165
But they couldn't get her hands warm.

418
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:04,126
I don't think it's too serious.

419
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:07,166
It's a bad chill, but she is strong.

420
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:13,802
Mayor, is the teacher coming back?

421
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:19,884
I don't know the answer.

422
01:03:21,168 --> 01:03:23,477
He should have been back by now.

423
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:28,123
Maybe someone can write to him.

424
01:03:28,528 --> 01:03:31,838
I don't know how to help her
if he doesn't come back.

425
01:03:31,928 --> 01:03:34,726
Even one glimpse of him
would be good for her.

426
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,120
"Spring is here."

427
01:03:50,168 --> 01:03:51,886
"It melts the snow."

428
01:03:56,168 --> 01:03:58,124
"The grass turns green."

429
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:01,600
"The farmers sow."

430
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:06,564
"The oxen plough the field."

431
01:04:08,408 --> 01:04:10,364
"The wild geese return."

432
01:04:12,168 --> 01:04:14,124
"The frogs begin to hop..."

433
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:19,597
Di, you're awake.
You've been sleeping for two days.

434
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,037
Di, the teacher is back.

435
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:26,479
He came back last night.

436
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:28,644
He came straight here.

437
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:31,037
He sat with you for a long time.

438
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:33,766
Isn't it good news?

439
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:37,125
He came back for you.

440
01:04:38,448 --> 01:04:40,040
"Full of energy..."

441
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:44,080
"..our spirit comes alive..."

442
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:50,840
"..full of new hopes..."

443
01:04:53,368 --> 01:04:55,643
"..full of new wishes."

444
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,285
"Spring is here."

445
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:03,919
"It melts the snow."

446
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:09,524
"The grass turns green."

447
01:05:11,648 --> 01:05:13,525
"The farmers sow."

448
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:17,844
"The oxen plough the field."

449
01:05:19,688 --> 01:05:21,644
"The wild geese return."

450
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:25,879
"The frogs begin to hop."

451
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:31,724
"Robins start to sing."

452
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:39,363
"Spring is the season to sow."

453
01:05:42,768 --> 01:05:44,804
"Everything starts to grow again..."

454
01:05:50,848 --> 01:05:52,520
Mr. Luo!

455
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,959
Luo, Di is here to see you!

456
01:05:56,408 --> 01:05:57,761
Sir!

457
01:05:58,528 --> 01:05:59,881
Di is here!

458
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,403
That evening my father had to leave again.

459
01:06:08,488 --> 01:06:11,685
He left the city without permission
just to see my mother.

460
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,680
He couldn't stand it
when he heard about my mother.

461
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:16,526
So he sneaked back.

462
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:20,839
For this disobedience,
my parents were kept apart...

463
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:22,759
...for another two years.

464
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:28,007
Someone told me
that on the day my father...

465
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:31,000
...finally returned,
my mother put on her red jacket...

466
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,446
...my father's favourite...

467
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:37,597
...and stood by the road, waiting for him.

468
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:41,398
From that day on,
my father never left my mother again.

469
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:02,200
This is the story
of my father and my mother.

470
01:07:02,328 --> 01:07:05,843
This road is a part of their love story.

471
01:07:07,008 --> 01:07:10,603
This is a dirt road that leads
to the city from our village.

472
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,008
My mother had waited for my father
on this road...

473
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:17,006
...with love and trust, for many years.

474
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:21,125
So she wants to walk this road
with him for the last time.

475
01:07:22,808 --> 01:07:24,127
Mr. Mayor?

476
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:28,763
- Who is it?
- It's me, Yusheng.

477
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:36,760
What is the matter, Yusheng?

478
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:38,679
- I need to see you.
- Come in.

479
01:07:39,048 --> 01:07:40,800
It's cold out there.

480
01:07:41,568 --> 01:07:43,286
How can I help you?

481
01:07:44,408 --> 01:07:46,364
I've thought it through.

482
01:07:47,048 --> 01:07:49,881
- I want to do what my mother wishes.
- Carry him back?

483
01:07:50,048 --> 01:07:52,004
It's still a problem, though.

484
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:54,564
We don't have enough men, right?

485
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:57,765
How about hiring some men
from the neighbouring village?

486
01:07:59,128 --> 01:08:01,198
Hiring people sounds easy...

487
01:08:02,968 --> 01:08:04,526
...but how do we pay them?

488
01:08:04,608 --> 01:08:07,247
Just tell me how many men we need.

489
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:11,840
For a short distance, about 10.

490
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:14,921
But this is a long trip.

491
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:17,199
I think we need about 16.

492
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:20,446
We need two shifts. That's 32 men.

493
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:23,368
And we'll need others to carry chairs...

494
01:08:23,688 --> 01:08:26,122
...so people can rest along the way.

495
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:30,805
That comes to about 35, 36 men.

496
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,041
How much per person?

497
01:08:35,568 --> 01:08:38,207
100 Yuan each should do.

498
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:41,081
35, 36 people.

499
01:08:41,168 --> 01:08:42,840
How much in total?

500
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:46,921
That's 3,500 or 3,600 Yuan.

501
01:08:48,448 --> 01:08:50,439
We need to buy cigarettes.

502
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,007
And wine, too.

503
01:08:55,088 --> 01:08:57,079
Got to ward off the cold.

504
01:08:57,168 --> 01:09:00,240
We'll also need a little extra
for emergency use.

505
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,047
Let me think.

506
01:09:02,288 --> 01:09:04,882
Around 4,000 Yuan.

507
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:15,083
Here's 5,000 Yuan.

508
01:09:15,848 --> 01:09:17,998
- Is that enough?
- It's plenty.

509
01:10:02,928 --> 01:10:05,203
Mrs. Luo, come and see Mr. Luo.

510
01:10:06,408 --> 01:10:08,046
Please don't cry.

511
01:10:08,128 --> 01:10:10,278
Don't let tears fall on him.

512
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:23,161
Mr. Luo, we are going back to the village.

513
01:10:26,248 --> 01:10:28,967
That day, over 100 people
came to the ceremony.

514
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:32,199
The mayor told me
they were my father's students.

515
01:10:32,648 --> 01:10:35,560
They heard about his death
and they all came back.

516
01:10:37,288 --> 01:10:39,358
Many came from other towns.

517
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:42,325
Some drove from the city.

518
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:46,725
The mayor said
some came from as far as Guangzhou.

519
01:10:47,768 --> 01:10:51,727
Some tried to come but didn't make it
in time because of the snowstorm.

520
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,284
I didn't recognise most of them.

521
01:10:55,608 --> 01:10:57,564
Many of them were older than me.

522
01:10:57,928 --> 01:11:00,601
I don't know when my father taught them.

523
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:03,038
I didn't know how to address them.

524
01:11:03,808 --> 01:11:07,562
Anyway, as the mayor said,
they were all my father's students.

525
01:11:10,328 --> 01:11:12,239
Take the money back.

526
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:15,039
Why? Didn't you pay them?

527
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:16,641
They won't take it...

528
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:18,480
...not even the ones we hired.

529
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:20,399
No one wants the money.

530
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:22,001
Take it back.

531
01:13:55,768 --> 01:13:57,486
At my mother's request...

532
01:13:58,048 --> 01:14:00,721
...my father was buried
next to the old well.

533
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:03,683
The village has running water now.

534
01:14:04,848 --> 01:14:07,043
No one draws water from the well now.

535
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:10,922
My mother said that my father
can overlook the school from here.

536
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:15,238
She asks to be buried next to him
when the time arrives.

537
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:26,607
After my father's funeral...

538
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:29,805
...the mayor came to talk
about rebuilding the school.

539
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:32,165
He said the city had granted funds...

540
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:35,001
...and the village families
had donated money.

541
01:14:35,528 --> 01:14:38,565
He said we must fulfil my father's wishes.

542
01:14:38,928 --> 01:14:41,237
Yusheng, give me your money.

543
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:51,966
Mayor, we've saved over the years.

544
01:14:54,528 --> 01:14:56,803
Take it to rebuild the school.

545
01:14:57,088 --> 01:15:00,080
I can't take it. You need it for yourself.

546
01:15:01,048 --> 01:15:03,801
With my husband gone,
you have to take it.

547
01:15:04,728 --> 01:15:06,878
All right, I'll take it then.

548
01:15:07,288 --> 01:15:10,166
You are the first,
but surely not the last to help.

549
01:15:11,888 --> 01:15:13,719
I am leaving tomorrow.

550
01:15:14,088 --> 01:15:17,398
Mother has asked me
to go to the schoolhouse one last time.

551
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:23,285
Mother said the next time I come back,
the school we know will be gone.

552
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:29,442
Your father helped build this school.

553
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,998
He taught here for so many years.

554
01:15:34,408 --> 01:15:36,876
He spent more time here than at home.

555
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:42,597
Changyu, can you hear me?

556
01:15:43,728 --> 01:15:46,879
The mayor will rebuild the school.

557
01:15:48,088 --> 01:15:50,841
They'll build a tall and wonderful school...

558
01:15:52,288 --> 01:15:54,006
...just as you wished.

559
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:58,647
A great school.

560
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,244
Your wish will be fulfilled.

561
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,322
They will start building next spring.

562
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,597
You won't have to worry anymore.

563
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,079
When the school is completed...

564
01:16:16,248 --> 01:16:18,842
...l will hang a Lucky Red Banner there.

565
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:28,039
You may rest in peace now.

566
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:37,606
You know your father.

567
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:41,363
He was a sincere man.

568
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:44,207
He always wanted you
to become a teacher...

569
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:47,005
...to take over for him.

570
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,640
You went to a teachers' college...

571
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:54,638
...but you never taught a day of class.

572
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:57,561
If you could have taught,
even for one day...

573
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:02,166
...you could have fulfilled his dream.

574
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:11,842
Then you could have gone back to your life.

575
01:17:14,288 --> 01:17:17,007
There's no teacher now...

576
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:22,802
...no sound of children reading aloud.

577
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:26,606
The mayor said a new teacher
was on the way.

578
01:17:31,288 --> 01:17:35,201
No other teacher's voice is
as good as your father's.

579
01:17:37,128 --> 01:17:39,596
His voice was so crisp.

580
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:43,484
After 40 years,
I still can't get enough of that voice.

581
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:46,640
I can still hear it.

582
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:53,238
Mother, I've made up my mind.

583
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:55,916
You should come to the city with me.

584
01:17:57,288 --> 01:17:58,767
No, thank you.

585
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:02,686
I won't leave your father.

586
01:18:02,968 --> 01:18:06,040
I don't want to leave you here by yourself.

587
01:18:08,888 --> 01:18:10,401
Don't worry about me.

588
01:18:10,488 --> 01:18:12,524
I can take care of myself.

589
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:16,967
- How are you doing in the city?
- Very well.

590
01:18:17,528 --> 01:18:19,359
Don't worry about me.

591
01:18:20,008 --> 01:18:21,919
Do you have girlfriend?

592
01:18:23,568 --> 01:18:25,286
Let's not talk about it.

593
01:18:25,688 --> 01:18:27,838
You're not young anymore.

594
01:18:28,968 --> 01:18:30,640
Don't be so picky.

595
01:18:32,728 --> 01:18:35,606
Listen to me. Find yourself a nice girl...

596
01:18:36,568 --> 01:18:39,685
...and bring her home to meet me.

597
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:50,485
Your father's gone.

598
01:18:51,088 --> 01:18:53,443
He was worried about you.

599
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,597
Children leave home eventually.

600
01:19:02,448 --> 01:19:04,723
We couldn't keep you here forever.

601
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:12,919
As parents...

602
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:17,607
...we never stopped worrying.

603
01:19:20,448 --> 01:19:23,326
Your father missed you so much.

604
01:19:26,688 --> 01:19:28,963
You were always in his thoughts.

605
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:35,886
Please don't cry.
It's not good for your health.

606
01:19:37,168 --> 01:19:40,478
With your father gone,
it's hard not to feel lonely.

607
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:52,807
I know.

608
01:19:55,008 --> 01:19:57,761
You must work hard
and make a good life for yourself.

609
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:06,200
"One must respect social norms."

610
01:20:10,928 --> 01:20:13,362
"Have respect for your elders."

611
01:20:22,928 --> 01:20:25,396
"In life, one must have a goal."

612
01:20:27,608 --> 01:20:30,042
"One must learn to read and write."

613
01:20:35,408 --> 01:20:38,525
"Writing and counting benefit one's life."

614
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,323
"Keep a journal faithfully."

615
01:20:51,248 --> 01:20:54,046
"Know the present, know the past."

616
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:02,360
"Spring, summer, fall and winter..."

617
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:09,324
"...east, west, south, north..."

618
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:18,439
"...in everything there is a purpose."

619
01:21:23,528 --> 01:21:26,406
I gathered the students early that morning.

620
01:21:26,768 --> 01:21:29,407
I said I would teach them for one day.

621
01:21:29,568 --> 01:21:31,286
The mayor asked me why.

622
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:34,440
I said it was for my mother
as well as for my father.

623
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,683
I stood in my father's place...

624
01:21:38,128 --> 01:21:40,517
...where he stood for so many years.

625
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:45,526
I felt sure he could hear my voice
and those of the students.

626
01:21:48,048 --> 01:21:51,802
The book I am using
is the same one he used that first day.

627
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:54,284
It is not the official textbook.

628
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:56,564
It is a book he wrote himself.

629
01:21:57,928 --> 01:22:00,317
"One must learn to read and write."

630
01:22:04,248 --> 01:22:06,318
"Keep a journal faithfully."

631
01:22:11,608 --> 01:22:13,997
"Know the present, know the past."

632
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,398
"Spring, summer, fall, winter..."

633
01:22:26,928 --> 01:22:28,964
"...east, west, south, north..."

634
01:22:34,568 --> 01:22:37,002
"...in everything there is a purpose."

635
01:22:42,968 --> 01:22:45,801
"Have respect for your elders."
