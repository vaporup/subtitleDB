00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:14,206
Mum!

3
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,101
Mum!

4
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,692
Mummy!

5
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:40,211
Mum!

6
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,566
Mum!

7
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,690
I had the dream again.

8
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:57,701
"And he climbed down that chimney,

9
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,981
"straight into the huge black pot.

10
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,886
"And that was the end
of the big, bad wolf."

11
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,941
Did they really kill the wolf, Mum?

12
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,421
I'm sure they did.

13
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,821
I'll kill the monster when it comes.

14
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:18,204
I'll smash its head in.

15
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,141
It's time to go to
sleep now, sweetie.

16
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,621
It's very late.

17
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,731
Can we read it again?

18
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,901
"A long time ago...
just yesterday, in fact...

19
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:38,048
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

20
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,781
- What have you done?
- It's not broken. It just slipped.

21
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,061
I don't want you firing things
off in the house anymore.

22
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:55,101
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,562
Please don't!

24
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,101
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,621
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,141
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,341
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:08,581
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,421
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:13,861
- I don't want you making weapons anymore.
- It doesn't work if you don't look at me.

31
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,244
This monster thing has
got to stop, alright?

32
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,363
Don't do that!

33
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,373
Ready?

34
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,091
Come on.

35
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,661
Quick. You're late already.

36
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:47,381
What have you got in there?

37
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,126
See you later, alligator.

38
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,501
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

39
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,621
What?

40
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,501
One with your milk in it.

41
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,301
I don't want milk.

42
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:08,366
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

43
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,421
Just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

44
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:16,741
Get to work, woman.

45
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,701
Do you want a cuppa?

46
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,621
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

47
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,661
Aw. It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

48
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,876
Right?

49
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,605
Amelia? Your son's
school is on the phone.

50
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:42,021
Oh, my God. Did he hurt anyone?

51
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:44,642
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

52
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,341
I'm going to have a
serious talk with him.

53
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,581
Mrs Fanning, we've had the talks.

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,221
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

55
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:55,221
We're going to have to
employ a monitor for him.

56
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,461
Monitor?

57
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,341
He'll be separated from
the other children.

58
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,062
The monitor will supervise
him one-on-one.

59
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,381
Samuel won't cope with this.

60
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,781
He already feels so different.

61
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,541
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

62
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,621
Mrs Fanning,

63
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,982
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

64
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:13,701
You know, Samuel doesn't
need a full-time monitor.

65
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,861
What he needs is some understanding.

66
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,461
I have 24 other first
graders in that class.

67
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,861
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

68
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,421
I think I'll just
find another school.

69
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,821
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

70
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,781
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

71
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:28,502
that sees my son as a human being

72
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,422
and not just as another
problem to be gotten rid of.

73
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,302
That is very unfair.
We're only trying to help the boy.

74
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,661
Please stop calling him 'the boy'.

75
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,089
His name is Samuel.

76
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:47,501
We can see Ruby and Aunty
Claire at the park today.

77
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:51,421
You can play on that swing you
like for as long as you like, OK?

78
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,341
Mrs Bruen hates me.

79
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,211
No, she doesn't.

80
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,530
Just need a break, that's all.

81
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,649
Don't tell Aunty
Claire what happened.

82
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,421
I'll tell her later.

83
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:12,650
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

84
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,701
Sam, don't bother the lady.

85
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,261
No, no, no. That's alright.

86
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,061
We have to go home and see Daddy,
though, haven't we?

87
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,622
My dad's in the cemetery.

88
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,781
Oh. That's...

89
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,661
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

90
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,261
Samuel.

91
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:28,621
I'm sorry. He just...

92
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,381
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

93
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:34,381
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

94
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,101
We have to go.

95
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,529
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

96
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,181
The artist was so drunk, he vomited.

97
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,781
Right in front of his
own installation.

98
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,701
Lost all these sales.

99
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,661
You're not listening.

100
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,342
I am. I am.

101
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:51,342
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

102
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,262
Ruby! Don't play there. It's wet.

103
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,742
Mum! Mum!

104
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,772
I'm gonna smash its head!

105
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,892
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

106
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,701
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

107
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:12,050
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

108
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,168
I was hoping Ruby would
change her mind.

109
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,821
She doesn't want a joint
party with Sam this year.

110
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,981
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

111
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:24,501
She wants to have a princess party.

112
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:26,661
Mum! Mum!

113
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,102
That's OK.

114
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,261
We don't have to come.

115
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:32,141
You can still come.

116
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,221
Mum!

117
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,341
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

118
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,341
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

119
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:40,850
Mum, I can go really high! Watch.

120
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,661
Maybe you want to celebrate his
birthday properly this year, anyway.

121
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,901
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

122
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,501
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

123
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,421
and then this birthday
thing rolls around

124
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:57,088
- and I end up feeling awful.
- I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.

125
00:08:58,601 --> 00:08:59,901
We'll be fine.

126
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,022
We'll be absolutely fine.

127
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,005
Mum! Look at me!

128
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,005
Mama!

129
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,741
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

130
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,661
You look tired, little one.

131
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,901
Have you been in the wars today?

132
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,261
A few wars.

133
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,821
He's had a big day, that's all.

134
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,381
He's just exhausted.

135
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,142
Poor little sweetheart.

136
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,501
Bugsy.

137
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,181
Come here, little girl. Hello.

138
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,701
You look tired too, love.

139
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,061
You OK?

140
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,181
Nothing five years
of sleep wouldn't fix.

141
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,981
I'll put your rubbish
out for you, Grace.

142
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,621
No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.

143
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,446
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

144
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,725
You can choose one tonight.

145
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,581
Where did you get this?

146
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,326
On the shelf.

147
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:44,021
"If it's in a word or it's in a look,

148
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,006
"you can't get rid of the Babadook.

149
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,901
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

150
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,781
"then you can make friends
with a special one...

151
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,571
"a friend of you and me."

152
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:06,741
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

153
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:11,261
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks...

154
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,661
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

155
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:17,581
"That's when you'll know he's around.

156
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,123
"You'll see him if you look.

157
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:26,181
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

158
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,062
We might read another
one tonight, hey?

159
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,170
But you said I could choose.

160
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,861
"This is what he wears on top.

161
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,243
"He's funny, don't you think?

162
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,363
"See him in your room at night..."

163
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,404
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

164
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:51,382
Mum?

165
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,366
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

166
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,331
Mummy?

167
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,582
Mummy?!

168
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:04,501
"How sweetly they sung, telling
of the happiness and loveliness

169
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,581
"that lay at the bottom of the ocean

170
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,327
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

171
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:19,061
It's that time of
night again. Time...

172
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,421
If that's what the
doctor ordered, I...

173
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,702
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

174
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:38,886
Do you...

175
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:01,502
Mum!

176
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,261
- It's in my room!
- What is?

177
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,981
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

178
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:09,501
No, no, no. This is
not going to happen.

179
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,141
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

180
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:14,061
It's just a book.

181
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,341
It can't hurt you.

182
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,981
You've had a big day.

183
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,807
You're just exhausted.

184
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:26,370
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

185
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:31,541
Nothing bad's going to happen, Sam.

186
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,287
I'm gonna protect you.

187
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,132
Mum, it's 9:00.

188
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,501
He's not running a fever anymore.

189
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,701
No, no, no. My sister's
gonna take him. Put it back!

190
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,462
Put it back or it goes in the bin.

191
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,581
Sorry. What was that?

192
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:08,981
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

193
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:11,741
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

194
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,284
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

195
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:20,332
Samuel... no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

196
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,981
88. Number 88.

197
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,822
Two fat ladies.

198
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:33,381
Good, Elaine!

199
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,207
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

200
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,541
Number 11.

201
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,221
Who has number 11?

202
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,221
Legs 11.

203
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:47,253
Hey? See what else we've got.

204
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,101
5 billion.

205
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,722
Anyone got 5 billion?

206
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:07,013
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

207
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:12,181
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

208
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:14,821
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

209
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:18,205
Fine. Yeah. Just a
bunch of old people.

210
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:23,181
You don't have to be fine, you know.

211
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,461
Just a bit stressed at the moment.

212
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,525
Why don't you go home?

213
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,621
Old cranky bitch...
she goes after lunch.

214
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:33,501
I can cover for you.

215
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,328
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:39,582
I'll give you my pay.

217
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:41,421
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,621
You've got a sick boy.

219
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,421
Life's too short.

220
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,181
You're so sweet, Robbie.

221
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,581
- You should go.
- Yeah.

222
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,965
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

223
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,621
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

224
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,821
Rung you a million times.

225
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:48,821
What happened?

226
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,821
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

227
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:53,861
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

228
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,021
Just talking to the air...
even freaked me out.

229
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:57,021
I'm so sorry.

230
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,421
You need to get him to
see someone, Amelia.

231
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,261
It's not normal for a kid to
carry on with this rubbish.

232
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:01,661
It's not rubbish. It's real!

233
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,009
Don't you talk to your
Aunty Claire like that.

234
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,941
Where did you get those firecrackers?

235
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,781
You got them for me on the internet.

236
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,446
Well, that's the end of the internet.

237
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:16,142
If the Babadook was real,
we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?

238
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,621
It wants to scare you
first then you'll see it.

239
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,381
Well, I'm not scared.

240
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:24,382
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

241
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:25,981
That's enough.

242
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,461
You will be when it
eats your insides.

243
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,061
I've decided you're not having
your birthday with Ruby this week.

244
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,011
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

245
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,661
Samuel.

246
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:51,621
Ladies and gentlemen, Mum and Dad,

247
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:54,181
life is not always as it seems.

248
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:57,301
It can be a wondrous thing.

249
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:01,846
But it can also be very treacherous.

250
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:12,461
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

251
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:15,651
I'm gonna trap the
Babadook like this.

252
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:21,221
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

253
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,523
Samuel.

254
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:33,981
I was just putting something back.

255
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:36,341
- All your father's things are down there.
- He's my father.

256
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,018
You don't own him!

257
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,483
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

258
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,087
Can I come in?

259
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,062
Hey, matey. This is for you.

260
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,741
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

261
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,487
I'm not sick.

262
00:21:56,841 --> 00:21:58,981
Oh. I-I thought...

263
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,581
No, he's not, actually.

264
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:03,542
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

265
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,541
You said that's not true.

266
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,021
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

267
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:08,069
- who still believe in monsters?
- I hate you!

268
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,582
She won't let me have a birthday party
and she won't let me have a dad!

269
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:24,767
Don't eat it.

270
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,084
The Babadook did it, Mum.

271
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,901
Go and watch a DVD and
I'll make something else.

272
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,101
- The Babadook did it!
- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

273
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:49,661
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,

274
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:54,901
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

275
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,861
Life is not always as it seems.

276
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:01,821
It can be a wondrous thing.

277
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:05,701
But it can also be very treacherous.

278
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,942
In this DVD,

279
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:12,381
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

280
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:18,085
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

281
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,205
Do you think this is funny?

282
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:46,331
Oh, no. No. No!

283
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,581
Give it to me!

284
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:53,932
Do you wanna die?

285
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:05,622
Don't let it in! Don't let it in!

286
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:09,181
Don't let it in! Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

287
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,210
Don't let it in!

288
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,449
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

289
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:34,541
I've already got this doll, Mum.

290
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:35,821
Now she's got a twin.

291
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,282
They can go shopping together.

292
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:42,582
Off you go.

293
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,221
He's just really tired.

294
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,562
Go and play right now.

295
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:02,061
Claire tells me you're a writer.

296
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,661
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

297
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:07,061
What kind of writing did you do?

298
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:10,862
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

299
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:13,182
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

300
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:14,581
It must be difficult.

301
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:17,901
I do volunteer work with
some disadvantaged women

302
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:20,541
and a few of them have
lost their husbands

303
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:23,413
and they find it very hard.

304
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,502
How's Richard's merger going?

305
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:30,581
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

306
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:33,261
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

307
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:34,381
Tell me about it!

308
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,621
I don't even have time to go to
the gym anymore. It's ridiculous!

309
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,181
That's a real tragedy.

310
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,381
Not having time to go to the
gym anymore. How do you cope?

311
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,381
You must have so much to talk about

312
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:45,285
with those poor disadvantaged women.

313
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,501
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

314
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,212
I'm not hurting anybody.

315
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,405
Bye.

316
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,249
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

317
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,541
How would your mum
know if it's real or not?

318
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,501
She never comes to our house.

319
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,901
Mum told Dad she didn't
want to go to your house

320
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,701
'cause it's too depressing.

321
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,581
The Babadook would eat
your mum for breakfast.

322
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,021
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

323
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:31,102
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

324
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,422
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

325
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,902
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

326
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,301
Isn't it time you moved on?

327
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,782
I have moved on.

328
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:42,101
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

329
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,142
What strain is that on you, Claire?

330
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,821
You're not even good
enough to have a dad.

331
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:48,781
Everyone else has one and you don't.

332
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:50,381
I do have a dad!

333
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:53,141
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

334
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:56,101
and you never stop to ask
me anything about mine.

335
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:58,654
I do! I want to know how you are.

336
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:00,582
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

337
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:02,701
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

338
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,221
I can't believe you just said that.

339
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,661
You can't stand being
around him yourself.

340
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:10,062
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

341
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,662
- That's not true!
- And your mum doesn't want you.

342
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,818
No-one wants you.

343
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,701
What did you do?!

344
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:29,572
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

345
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,381
Is she alright?

346
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:36,901
Stay here and look after the children
or do you want another one to get hurt?

347
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:41,781
Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!

348
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,181
Mummy! Mummy!

349
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:46,021
Mummy!

350
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:49,861
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

351
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,581
There is no Babadook!

352
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,723
Get out!

353
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:02,541
- Get out!
- Samuel?

354
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,701
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

355
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:07,461
Get out! Get out! Get out!

356
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,061
Please help me!

357
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,443
There's something wrong with my son.

358
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:43,621
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

359
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,421
That's when the brain overheats.

360
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:48,501
- It always looks worse than it is.
- I've never seen anything like this.

361
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,501
We'll have to wait until
the tests come back.

362
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:52,221
All his other results are normal.

363
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:56,222
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

364
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,901
Very committed to the monster theory.

365
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,532
That's an understatement.

366
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,821
All children see monsters.

367
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,805
Not like this.

368
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:07,781
And it's getting worse.

369
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:10,381
He's becoming aggressive.

370
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:11,901
He could see a psychiatrist.

371
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:13,461
I can refer you.

372
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:14,981
Takes a few weeks to get in.

373
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:16,442
That'd be great.

374
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:21,182
But can you just give
me something for now,

375
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,848
just to make him sleep?

376
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,491
Just until...

377
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:29,803
just until we get an appointment.

378
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,741
Please?

379
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:37,341
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

380
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:40,621
and when we go home tonight, this
whole nightmare will start up again

381
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,821
and I am really...

382
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,886
I'm really not coping.

383
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:51,181
I can give you a short
course of sedatives.

384
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,501
Just until the tests come back.

385
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:58,181
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

386
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,404
It's really bad.

387
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:11,421
These can make children feel foggy.

388
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,582
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

389
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,661
They'll certainly help
him sleep, though.

390
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,408
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

391
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:24,422
Why don't people like me?

392
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,421
Why do you say that?

393
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:30,488
Ruby said people don't
like me 'cause I'm weird.

394
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:35,481
Sometimes people say
things that aren't true.

395
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:44,172
You just need to take your medicine,
have a big sleep and not worry.

396
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:47,021
I don't want you to die.

397
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:50,021
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

398
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,406
Did you think that about
my dad before he died?

399
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,541
Just take your pill so
you can go to sleep.

400
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,782
I've got the day off tomorrow.

401
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:05,741
Maybe we could do something?

402
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,982
Will these make the Babadook go away?

403
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,422
I think so but you have to promise
me not to mention it again.

404
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:16,301
I promise to protect you if
you promise to protect me.

405
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,061
Then I won't mention it.

406
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:22,221
I promise to protect you.

407
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,171
Come on.

408
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,087
Come on.

409
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,421
Can you stay here with me?

410
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,261
Yes.

411
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,502
I love you, Mum.

412
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,530
Me too.

413
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,381
Her nose is broken in two places.

414
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,501
- She may need surgery.
- I'll pay for everything.

415
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,181
You can't even pay your own bills.

416
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:52,501
Look, I really have to go.

417
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:56,142
Claire, I think someone is
stalking me and Samuel.

418
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,461
What?

419
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:59,422
A book turned up at our place.

420
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,901
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

421
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:04,621
and put it on our doorstep.

422
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:07,901
Amelia, I just can't
help you right now.

423
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:10,741
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

424
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,901
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

425
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:14,938
I have to go.

426
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,531
Claire!

427
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:38,652
Hello?

428
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:44,261
Babadook...

429
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:48,486
dook... dook.

430
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,141
Hi.

431
00:38:57,241 --> 00:39:00,941
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

432
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,221
Can you tell us what happened?

433
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,061
Somebody sent me a children's book.

434
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:08,981
And?

435
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,021
And it contained violent
and graphic images

436
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:13,981
of my child and me being murdered.

437
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:15,901
Can we have a look
at the book, please?

438
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,061
I burnt it.

439
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,661
You burnt it?

440
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:21,741
Yes.

441
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:24,442
Well, unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do about it.

442
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:29,581
He's been making phone
calls to me as well.

443
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:30,821
What's he been saying?

444
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:34,342
Nothing, just making these... noises.

445
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,101
How do you know it's the same person?

446
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:38,462
Because of what he wrote in the book.

447
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,141
The book you burnt?

448
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,523
Yes.

449
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,282
OK.

450
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,724
Don't worry about it.

451
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,741
Did you get your things done?

452
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,821
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

453
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,542
That's why she shakes like this.

454
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:20,422
Samuel, you don't have to say
everything that goes through your head.

455
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,902
Oh, it's alright, love.

456
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:27,702
He wanted to know so
we talked about it.

457
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,261
He sees things as they are, that one.

458
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,901
Oskar was the same.

459
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,541
He always spoke his mind.

460
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,606
Do you have to keep
on bringing him up?

461
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:43,501
Hey, Bugsy.

462
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:46,421
Hey.

463
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:48,337
Hey!

464
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:54,283
Don't come in here.

465
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,221
I don't want to buy anything.

466
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,221
Are you Amelia Vanick?

467
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,221
Yes.

468
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,701
I'm Warren Newton and
this is Prue Flannery

469
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,421
from the Department
of Community Services.

470
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:17,381
My son's only been away for two days.

471
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:20,781
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

472
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:22,901
If I could just come
in and meet Samuel

473
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,125
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

474
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:30,821
I'm just in the middle of cleaning
up the house at the moment.

475
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,921
I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.

476
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,421
Hello, Samuel.

477
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:43,567
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

478
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:46,181
How are you?

479
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,741
I'm a bit tired from
the drugs Mum gave me.

480
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:53,661
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

481
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:55,461
He had a fit yesterday.

482
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:58,741
I'm really tired, actually.

483
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,692
That's no good.

484
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,221
May I have a glass of water, please?

485
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:09,685
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

486
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,901
It's a real mess.

487
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:20,221
I just found this
cockroach infestation.

488
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:21,701
I normally have the house sprayed.

489
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:23,501
I did actually already
have it sprayed

490
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,221
but there's this hole in
the wall behind the fridge

491
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:28,125
and that's why I...

492
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,021
I didn't mean a hole in the wall.

493
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:37,421
There was a hole in the wallpaper.

494
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:39,621
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

495
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:42,003
We've caught you at a bad time.

496
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,581
I'll leave you with this.

497
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:48,821
We're required to come back in a
week to talk through your options.

498
00:43:48,922 --> 00:43:51,249
Here's my card.

499
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:56,969
Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.

500
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:20,581
- What was that noise I heard?
- I didn't hear any noise.

501
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:22,781
Wind howling, doors slamming.

502
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:25,853
I declare, I think this house is haunted.

503
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,741
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

504
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,661
Are you sick?

505
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,201
Oh, no, Granny.

506
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,461
It's only 6:00.

507
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:39,101
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

508
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:40,501
No.

509
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:43,725
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

510
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,602
You have to stay up
for a while, sweetheart.

511
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:08,101
Where's its mother, Skip?
Koalas don't leave their babies about.

512
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:11,413
- Are you off now, Dad?
- Yep. Soon as I fuel up.

513
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:13,581
Tell Jerry I'll keep
in touch on the radio

514
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,963
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

515
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,381
"And the Prince and the Princess

516
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:22,221
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

517
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:24,922
"for the rest of their days."

518
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:06,741
Babadook...

519
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:10,542
dook... dook.

520
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:45,981
What are we doing?

521
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,741
We're going downstairs.

522
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:50,328
- Why?
- Because we are.

523
00:48:08,162 --> 00:48:10,902
Iris, Iris, Iris.

524
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:12,661
No.

525
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:01,981
Glass and mirror attachment.

526
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:05,381
Clean and polish shower doors or
mirrors for a streak-free shine.

527
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:08,461
As part of your steaming special, we'll
even include the garment and upholst...

528
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:12,130
Oh, I don't want to give
it to anyone at work.

529
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:18,008
Alright. Give all my shifts away.
That's just what I need.

530
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:20,861
I can't help it if I'm sick.

531
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,527
What do you expect me to do?

532
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,206
You do that!

533
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:43,643
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

534
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:47,933
I need to eat something.

535
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:55,442
I couldn't find any
food in the fridge.

536
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:00,021
You said to have them with food.

537
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:03,821
I'm really hungry, Mum.

538
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:07,781
Why do you have to
keep talk, talk, talking?

539
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:09,661
Don't you ever stop?

540
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:13,141
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

541
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:16,501
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

542
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:20,886
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

543
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,341
I'm so sorry.

544
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:57,690
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

545
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:02,061
I've had absolutely no sleep.

546
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,648
I didn't know what I was saying.

547
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:08,250
I'll cook you something. Hey?

548
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:10,501
What would you like?

549
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,691
I'm not hungry anymore.

550
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,981
We really need to get
out of this house.

551
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,649
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

552
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:30,090
Do you want to go to Wally's?

553
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:33,301
You can have anything
you want. Alright?

554
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:37,162
Even ice-cream for
breakfast if you like.

555
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:42,181
Give it back! Give it back!

556
00:51:42,281 --> 00:51:46,102
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

557
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:47,981
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

558
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:49,646
Sit down, please.

559
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,501
Where are we going?

560
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:59,771
I just want to drive
for a little while.

561
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,861
Mummy! Mummy!

562
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:19,261
Babadook.

563
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,102
You ran straight into me!

564
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:35,611
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

565
00:52:36,162 --> 00:52:39,021
Oh, driving on the wrong side
of the road with a kid in the back.

566
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:40,901
You could've killed someone!

567
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:46,442
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Hey! Crazy bitch!

568
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:55,523
Hi, sweetheart.

569
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:04,851
Mum?

570
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,608
I can call Aunty Claire.

571
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:14,326
I can call and she can come over.

572
00:53:17,401 --> 00:53:18,701
Mum?

573
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:23,404
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

574
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:27,964
Mum. Mum, look at me.

575
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:55,653
It's nice and warm in here.

576
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:01,169
I don't want you to go away.

577
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:05,370
I'm not going anywhere.

578
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,606
Mum?

579
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,006
Mum, I don't think we
should stay here tonight.

580
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,061
I can call Mrs Roach.

581
00:54:33,162 --> 00:54:37,048
I don't want you to call anyone.

582
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,287
I just need to sleep.

583
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:48,329
- Mum...
- Leave it!

584
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:20,369
There's something in the house.

585
00:55:34,202 --> 00:55:35,941
There's someone in the house!

586
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:32,963
Mrs Roach can we come
and stay the night?

587
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,621
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

588
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,942
Has someone broken into the house?

589
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,901
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

590
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,742
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

591
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,942
Oh, I was so worried.

592
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,421
I told him not to call anyone.

593
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:56,261
He asked if you could stay the night.

594
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:58,982
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

595
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:01,204
I really have to go,
though, now, Gracie.

596
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:03,902
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

597
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:05,422
Yes. Talk soon.

598
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,211
No worries. Talk soon.

599
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:14,010
I told you not to call anyone and
you deliberately disobeyed me.

600
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:16,942
Do you want to frighten Mrs Roach?

601
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:19,061
An old lady who can hardly walk?

602
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:20,852
Do you want to make her sick?

603
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:24,723
Get that bloody thing off!

604
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:33,301
Is this the only way I can
trust you not to embarrass me

605
00:57:33,402 --> 00:57:35,046
in front of our neighbours?

606
00:57:39,361 --> 00:57:41,086
Is this what I have to do?

607
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:53,061
I'm sorry, Mummy.

608
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:55,221
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

609
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,141
What'd you say?

610
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:58,741
I said the Babadook...

611
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:00,301
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

612
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:03,982
He's just something you've made
up in your stupid little head.

613
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,421
I just didn't want you to let it in!

614
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:09,981
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

615
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:11,501
Alright, Samuel?

616
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:13,941
Nothing is coming in here tonight.

617
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,731
Nothing!

618
00:58:51,201 --> 00:58:53,461
I feel sick.

619
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:57,661
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

620
00:58:57,762 --> 00:58:59,221
Mum, I don't think I need...

621
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:02,446
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

622
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,089
Good boy.

623
00:59:48,642 --> 00:59:50,127
Mum!

624
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:10,003
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

625
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:14,368
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

626
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,801
Hey.

627
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:19,411
Hey!

628
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:41,131
Here we go.

629
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:48,843
There's more where that came from.

630
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:07,472
What's the secret?

631
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:13,181
- ...letter of Max's, didn't you?
- No, not for a minute.

632
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,981
Don't lie. You called
me a jezebel. Why?

633
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,102
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

634
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:18,812
With fresh meat.

635
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:22,111
Only five...

636
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:25,683
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

637
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:31,502
Police say the woman used a
kitchen knife to stab her son.

638
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:33,581
His body was found in their basement.

639
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:36,221
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

640
01:01:36,322 --> 01:01:40,302
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

641
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:42,181
Little is known about the tragedy

642
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,981
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

643
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,301
He had just turned seven.

644
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:03,927
Samuel?

645
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:09,531
Wake up, Mummy.

646
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,490
But you're the one
who's asleep, sweetheart.

647
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:22,485
Don't go down there.

648
01:02:26,801 --> 01:02:28,652
It's not safe.

649
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:07,050
I thought you were dead.

650
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,567
I thought you were dead.

651
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:26,409
We're gonna be together.

652
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,208
You just need to bring me the boy.

653
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:54,781
You mean Samuel?

654
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:57,288
You can bring me the boy.

655
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:01,366
You can bring me the boy.

656
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:04,582
You can bring me the boy.

657
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:05,941
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

658
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,061
I think it's going to rain.

659
01:04:08,162 --> 01:04:09,421
No.

660
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:40,885
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

661
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:54,381
Oh, no.

662
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:01,725
No! No!

663
01:06:09,241 --> 01:06:10,581
Bugsy!

664
01:07:57,881 --> 01:07:59,461
Samuel!

665
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,411
Samuel.

666
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:12,171
Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.

667
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:17,009
You don't want him to die, do you?

668
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:22,261
Samuel.

669
01:08:22,361 --> 01:08:25,486
Are you listening to me?

670
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,301
Let me in, you little shit!

671
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,661
Let me in!

672
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:34,901
Let me in!

673
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,381
Let me in!

674
01:08:36,481 --> 01:08:38,357
Let me in!

675
01:09:00,722 --> 01:09:02,782
You little pig!

676
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:06,461
Six years old and you're
still wetting yourself.

677
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:08,542
You don't know how many times

678
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:12,301
I wished it was you,
not him, that died.

679
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:13,981
I just want you to be happy.

680
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:17,285
"I just want you to be happy."

681
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,661
Sometimes...

682
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:25,341
I just wanna smash your
head against a brick wall

683
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:28,461
until your fucking brains pop out.

684
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:30,461
You're not my mother.

685
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:34,501
- What did you say?
- I said you're not my mother!

686
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:37,902
I am your mother!

687
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:43,301
Run, run, run, as fast as you can!

688
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:47,861
Get away!

689
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:49,701
Didn't I tell you not
to play with weapons?

690
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:39,581
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

691
01:10:39,681 --> 01:10:41,662
I just wanted to make
sure you were OK.

692
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:44,542
I'm OK.

693
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:50,221
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

694
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:54,341
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

695
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:59,341
But I just wanted you to know that
I'd do anything for you and Sam.

696
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:01,610
I love you both.

697
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,445
Samuel.

698
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:10,805
I'm sorry.

699
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:15,142
I understand you're scared.

700
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:18,982
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

701
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:22,251
I haven't been good at all.

702
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:28,289
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

703
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:35,012
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

704
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:39,861
We're going to stay there tonight.

705
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,971
Do you want that?

706
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,211
I want to make it up to you, Sam.

707
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,849
I want you to meet your dad.

708
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,007
It's beautiful there.

709
01:12:08,362 --> 01:12:11,041
You'll be happy.

710
01:12:17,201 --> 01:12:19,005
Sorry, Mummy!

711
01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:07,221
Mum!

712
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,302
Mum!

713
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:11,729
I'm not leaving you.

714
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:17,811
Mum? Mum?

715
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:27,285
You said we'd protect each other.

716
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,082
I know you don't love me.

717
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:38,301
The Babadook won't let you.

718
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,842
But I love you, Mum.

719
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,488
And I always will.

720
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:57,606
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

721
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:03,941
I don't want you to go away.

722
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:05,461
No! No! No!

723
01:14:05,561 --> 01:14:07,844
Mummy!

724
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:57,021
Mummy!

725
01:14:57,121 --> 01:14:59,021
Mummy!

726
01:14:59,122 --> 01:15:00,902
Mummy!

727
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,261
Mummy! Mummy!

728
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:05,341
Mummy!

729
01:15:05,442 --> 01:15:06,861
Mummy!

730
01:15:43,282 --> 01:15:44,541
What is it?

731
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,606
You can't get rid of the Babadook.

732
01:16:15,681 --> 01:16:17,043
What do you want?

733
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,165
What do you want?

734
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,861
No.

735
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:03,052
Keep breathing.

736
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:09,211
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

737
01:17:13,201 --> 01:17:15,369
No.

738
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,021
I think it's gonna rain.

739
01:17:21,121 --> 01:17:22,941
Stop!

740
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:11,341
You are nothing.

741
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,501
You're nothing!

742
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,982
This is my house!

743
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,181
You are trespassing in my house!

744
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:57,061
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

745
01:19:05,561 --> 01:19:07,843
No!

746
01:19:49,642 --> 01:19:51,003
Mummy, don't!

747
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:58,621
Don't!

748
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:42,861
Watch out for your
mum's leg, little one.

749
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:44,781
He's fine. I've had the stitches out.

750
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:46,541
What time's the party?

751
01:21:46,642 --> 01:21:47,821
Any time after three is fine.

752
01:21:47,921 --> 01:21:49,662
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

753
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:51,181
Bye.

754
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,901
Bye, Sam.

755
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:55,181
That school's a good choice.

756
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:58,901
I've been doing a lot of reading about
it so I think Sam will be happy there.

757
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:02,501
He's been out of school over two
weeks now. It's time to get back.

758
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:05,781
We needed some time to
sort a few things out.

759
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,821
Are you having a party?

760
01:22:08,921 --> 01:22:10,502
It's Sam's birthday today.

761
01:22:10,601 --> 01:22:13,701
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

762
01:22:13,802 --> 01:22:15,141
That's not true.

763
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:17,661
Yes, it is. My first
party on the day.

764
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:19,496
That's unusual.

765
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:25,462
My husband died the
day that Sam was born.

766
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:28,890
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

767
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:32,621
Sam's just like his dad was.

768
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:34,661
Always speaks his mind.

769
01:22:34,761 --> 01:22:38,821
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

770
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:43,422
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

771
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:47,924
I'll take that for you.

772
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:07,661
Good shot.

773
01:23:07,761 --> 01:23:09,861
Look, there's another one!

774
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:12,163
Where's your bowl?

775
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:18,084
Wow. You've got a lot today.

776
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:21,301
Am I ever gonna see it?

777
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:24,890
One day, when you're bigger.

778
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:34,332
You go outside, and you
don't come in until I tell you.

779
01:24:16,921 --> 01:24:20,581
It's alright. It's alright.

780
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,541
It's alright.

781
01:24:55,681 --> 01:24:57,221
How was it?

782
01:24:57,321 --> 01:24:59,922
It was pretty quiet today.

783
01:25:01,682 --> 01:25:03,406
Come here.

784
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,722
It's getting much better, Mum.

785
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:14,461
Wait!

786
01:25:14,562 --> 01:25:16,809
I have a new trick.

787
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:22,701
Life is not always as it seems.

788
01:25:22,802 --> 01:25:25,846
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

789
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:33,566
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

790
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:45,764
Abracadabra!

791
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:49,581
How did you do that?

792
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:57,842
Come here, you. Come here.

793
01:26:07,681 --> 01:26:10,361
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
