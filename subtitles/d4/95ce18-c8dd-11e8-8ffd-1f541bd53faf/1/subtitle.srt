00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,934
Sell your daughter
if you can't pay.

"DEBT"

16
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,701
Take her away.

17
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:52,143
Don't!

18
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:53,618
Go!

19
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,416
You're free now.
Go.

20
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,134
Fai Yuk-Su... Stand up.

21
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:59,532
That slap was a
present from Lincoln.

22
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,416
And this is from Shakespeare!

23
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:08,660
We're discussing famous quotations.
And what are you doing?

24
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,179
Drawing cartoons.

25
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:16,332
"Windblown Grass"? "Cloudy Skies"?
"Seeking A Failure Strategy"?

26
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,376
Can you afford to fail?

27
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,535
You think you're a genius
so you don't have to study.

28
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,942
Mozart was a genius. At six years old,
he performed in front of the emperor.

29
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,621
But you?

30
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,260
You're so slow!

31
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,903
You! Next time I catch you
doing this, I'll expel you.

32
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:48,300
Give them back!

33
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:50,175
Hey,
give them back.

34
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,742
- Give me back my drawings.
- Here you go.

35
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,778
I don't even know what you drew.
Only one fist and one foot?

36
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,578
A comic book is supposed to be
like this, crazy!

37
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,496
Wow, great.

38
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,456
Fantastic.
Really great.

39
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:15,172
Yeah? I think he's going to kill me.
I made him so angry.

40
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:19,303
No. I mean the whirlwind kick you
drew. Nothing could beat that.

41
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,813
No more bullying the weak!

42
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:24,218
Catch!

43
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,621
I've warned you before
about using the basketball court.

44
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,859
You know the school team
needs to practise,

45
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,782
but you're still using our space.
Haven't you been beaten enough?

46
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,974
You're just a bully!

47
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,617
Get off.

48
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,496
Come on.

49
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,183
If we don't leave now,
we're going to die.

50
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,577
Let's go!

51
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,295
Stop! Stop!

52
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,453
Master, come home now
or your father will scold me.

53
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:10,054
You go on ahead. Don't follow me.
Go home.

54
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:14,894
I asked Mui to make you soup.
If it gets cold it won't taste as good.

55
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:17,379
Please come home
and do your homework.

56
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,332
- Why do you still keep a maid?
- I discussed it with my dad.

57
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,533
He says it's inappropriate for
a gentleman not to have one.

58
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,654
You have her follow you all day.

59
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,819
- Don't you have a conscience?
- No, you're wrong.

60
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:34,492
Even though she's my maid,
she's more of a nag than my mother.

61
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,942
- Go and do your homework.
- Okay.

62
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,019
- Dad, I'm home from school.
- Uncle.

63
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,376
Yuk-Su. You didn't burn incense
for your late mother.

64
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,336
- I'll go and do it now.
- You're so forgetful!

65
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,898
What happened to you?
Been in a fight again?

66
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,982
You've got a black eye.
If your father...

67
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:01,339
- You can rinse now.
- Thanks, Uncle.

68
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,183
Yuk-Su, bring water
to wash his hair.

69
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,295
Won't be a minute...

70
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:09,096
Uncle Chai,
I'll do it myself.

71
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,979
What are you up to?

72
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,095
You...
Fai Yuk-Su!

73
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,815
You bad boy.
Had another fight?

74
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:20,219
- You should be studying!
- Uncle...

75
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,697
It wasn't his fault.

76
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,940
I was being bullied.
He stood up for me.

77
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,737
If you don't get in
to medical school,

78
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:30,822
your dear mother
will turn in her grave.

79
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,332
Does it hurt?

80
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,455
- It's okay.
- Let me see.

81
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,495
You call that okay?!

82
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,220
- Master, so you are here!
- Put on my blazer.

83
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,416
Are you giving it to him?
Your father will be angry with me...

84
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:52,420
Mind your own business!

85
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:57,299
Master, please come home now.
Your father will hit me if you don't.

86
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,094
Come on,
please.

87
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,340
Yuk-Su, I'm off.
See you, Uncle.

88
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,375
- Take this off first.
- Come on.

89
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:07,336
Let me wipe the hair off your clothes.
Wait for me!

90
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,212
- You two want to earn extra cash?
- Yes.

91
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:13,140
It's getting dark.
Quickly, follow me.

92
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,219
Okay.

93
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,863
Inspector Wa, today we'll be
working on your diction.

94
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,134
Repeat after me.
Listen:

95
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,461
And again...

96
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,779
- Trying to kill me?
- Inspector Wa.

97
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:56,014
Are you all right?

98
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:59,938
Little bitch. You do this every time!
No food for you.

99
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,782
- It won't happen again.
- No food for three days.

100
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:05,292
What have you done again?

101
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,501
Hey, move on,
you.

102
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,051
What are you doing?

103
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,095
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,380
Apologies.

105
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,377
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,301
Hey, Siu-Yu, you haven't poured
the Master's tea yet.

107
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:39,617
Coming.

108
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:56,898
Inspector Wa,
this is for you.

109
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:01,493
The Sandakan matter
has not been settled yet, has it?

110
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,295
What do you think?

111
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,254
It's not settled?

112
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:05,577
No.

113
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:12,214
Master,
your Ginseng tea.

114
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,135
Your tea, sir.

115
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,175
Out!

116
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:39,257
You've been keeping
that one from me.

117
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,135
You like her?

118
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,538
Tin, give her to
Mr Wong tomorrow.

119
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,895
Good evening, Mr Sandakan.
This way, please.

120
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:59,621
Inspector Wa's been
waiting for you a long time.

121
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,982
Please come in.
Merry Christmas.

122
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,455
Merry Christmas.

123
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,091
A local gift for you.

124
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:24,019
Mmm...
how fragrant.

125
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:40,733
Are you scared?
Done something wrong?

126
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:45,899
This gun is very old
but won't misfire.

127
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,903
This is especially for you.
Here's to working well together.

128
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:53,538
But if I see this bastard again,
I won't be so polite.

129
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,942
I asked for 40 girls from you
in our last deal

130
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,339
and only 20 showed up on board.

131
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:02,694
That's not possible. The paperwork
showed 40 fingerprints.

132
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,099
We even watched them embark.

133
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,541
Perhaps that bastard
stole them from me.

134
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,256
You stole them?

135
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:15,013
You come to me
because you lost some goods?

136
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:18,375
Would you come to me
if you lost your wife?

137
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,862
Scum!

138
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,698
Why are you being
so rude to my dad?

139
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,815
I don't need my hands. One kick
and I'll tear your head off.

140
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:54,698
You touch one hair on my father's
head, you'll pay with one of your legs.

141
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,301
Very good.
Very good.

142
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,532
- Men!
- Yes?

143
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:04,739
Take them outside.

144
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:18,214
Good!
Come with me.

145
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:24,818
You've got to leave. Your master's
going to give you away to Mr Wong.

146
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:26,696
Go on home.

147
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,501
Hey,
where are you going?

148
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,296
Believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

149
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:34,983
- Let go of me.
- Siu-Yu! Siu-Yu!

150
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,537
Coming,
coming...

151
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,742
Ah, Siu-Yu! Come,
come, come...

152
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,214
You don't have to work any more.
Pack your things.

153
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,335
Tomorrow we're sending you
to Mr Wong.

154
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,179
What for?

155
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,340
To enjoy the good life.

156
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:47,862
How's about a kiss?

157
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:49,652
Come on...

158
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,855
Come on!

159
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:00,618
Quickly!

160
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,616
Stop them!
They're getting away.

161
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:06,903
Hurry up so you can catch them!

162
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,697
Where are they?

163
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,462
They're there!
They're there!

164
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:15,256
It's them!

165
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:17,973
Stop! Stop!

166
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,697
Want to elope?

167
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,135
- Yuk-Su, what are you doing here?
- Huh?

168
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,379
Little punk!

169
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,134
Hey, guys...
Hey, hey...

170
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:36,983
- Headmaster, you know him?
- He's one of my students.

171
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,822
- What's going on?
- He tried to steal our maid.

172
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:43,618
- And he's one of his students.
- From now on, he's expelled.

173
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:47,458
Yuk-Su! Yuk-Su!
Why are you beating my son?

174
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,818
That's enough.
He's the headmaster's student.

175
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:54,541
Don't stop on my behalf. Our school
doesn't have students like this.

176
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:59,260
Fai Yuk-Su, as from tomorrow,
do not come back to school.

177
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,533
You've insulted our school.

178
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:04,019
Headmaster.
Give him a chance?

179
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,179
It's okay.
Siu-Yu can't have gone far.

180
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:08,499
Get her back.
And let them go.

181
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,983
- Give him a chance. Please.
- Go! Go!

182
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,776
- Headmaster!
- Go! Go!

183
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,895
Father.

184
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:28,573
Let's go!

185
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,857
Follow them!

186
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,733
Father,
I'll carry you.

187
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:50,814
- Help!
- Use strength! Use strength!

188
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:56,095
Help! Help!
Please open the gate!

189
00:17:56,344 --> 00:18:00,416
Quickly, open the gate!
Help! Help!

190
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:04,496
People are chasing us.

191
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,613
I'm going in to get them.

192
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:13,183
- You want in? We can't allow that.
- Don't stand in our way.

193
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,215
Let's rush them!

194
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,817
They ran inside,
but they won't let us pass.

195
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,095
Don't move!

196
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,899
Hey, stop, stop.

197
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:51,140
Oh, it's you,
Soh-Bo (SILL Y).

198
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:53,823
My teacher's name is Jean-Paul,
not Soh-Bo.

199
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,902
A misunderstanding.
You know how my English is.

200
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,492
A terrible misunderstanding,
but then...

201
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,898
I'm trying to apprehend
two fugitives.

202
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,979
Did you see them
enter your place?

203
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:07,062
- They definitely went in.
- I saw them go in.

204
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:11,621
No-one's been in here but us.

205
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,063
Move aside.

206
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,777
Move aside!

207
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,983
- If you don't believe me, go search.
- Damn!

208
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:31,493
If you say no-one's gone in there,
how can I not believe you?

209
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,933
Okay. If you do see them,
please notify me.

210
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:35,903
Let's go!

211
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:51,332
- It's all right now. Don't be afraid.
- Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:53,613
- Thank you for saving our lives.
- Not at all.

213
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:59,175
- Father.
- Bring medicine.

214
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,982
- Did those creeps beat you up?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,855
Help him up.

216
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:24,979
She fell in herself.
It wasn't me.

217
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,211
Hey!

218
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,379
What are you doing here?
Why haven't you gone home?

219
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:35,497
Master, my home is in Dong Guan.
Let me follow you. I'll be your maid.

220
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,295
Father.

221
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:59,778
Good deeds are not done
when you want to do them.

222
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:05,183
There is a time
and there is a place.

223
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:10,377
The poor can't fight the rich and
the rich can't fight the government.

224
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:16,501
You believe
you've helped this girl.

225
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:20,582
In fact,
your help has made it worse for her.

226
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:26,702
Master,
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

227
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:32,100
I'd better... I'd better
just go back to Master Wa.

228
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:37,334
I can't allow you to be fed to the lions
and not do anything.

229
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,615
It's too dangerous
to let you go right now.

230
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:45,180
Where does Mr. Faat live?
Take these kids away!

231
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:47,023
I don't know!

232
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,662
I'm going to smack you!
Where does Mr Faat live?

233
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,059
- You're hurting me!
- Do you know or not?

234
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,252
Let me go!

235
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,022
- Let's leave!
- Where can you go?

236
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:58,862
I have a friend
you can stay with for now.

237
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,537
"NO.1 BEEF NOODLES"

238
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:05,894
So that's what happened.

239
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,617
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I really am.

240
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,700
That's all right.

241
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,499
In today's world
people have to help each other.

242
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:17,616
Don't worry. Stay here for now.
Wait till your leg's healed.

243
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:21,782
If your son has no school to go to,
he can help out around here.

244
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,134
- Thank you so much.
- That's okay.

245
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,818
- Master, time to get up.
- Don't bother me.

246
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:31,697
- Hey!
- Don't bother me.

247
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,295
Give them back.

248
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:45,013
- What?
- Master, your father says to get up.

249
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:47,974
What did you call me?

250
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,219
Master?

251
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,903
Master?!

252
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,816
Master!

253
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:56,700
What are you doing?

254
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:59,179
Dr Sun Yat-Sen wants equality,
so no pigtails.

255
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:04,095
I don't want there to be servants
and masters in the world.

256
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,340
"Master"?!
"Master"!

257
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:09,058
Why do you believe
you're lower than anybody else?

258
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,139
I won't next time,
Mast...

259
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,978
- What do I call you?
- Yuk-Su.

260
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:18,015
Master Yuk-Su?

261
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,219
It's Yuk-Su.
Not Master Yuk-Su.

262
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,573
Do you understand?

263
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,581
- Yuk-Su?
- That's it.

264
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:29,501
- I'll get you water to wash your face.
- Okay.

265
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,383
Hey!

266
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:36,535
She loves to serve!

267
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:39,974
Honourable Sir, I've decided
you're my teacher. I'll be just like you.

268
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:44,381
You'll teach me kung fu so I can help
the weak and serve the people.

269
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:47,256
- What are you saying?
- Father!

270
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:51,423
Go and help Master Yat. Remember
to burn incense for your late mother.

271
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:52,374
Okay.

272
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:04,334
- Good morning, Master Yat.
- Morning. So, you've been expelled?

273
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,573
That's true.
No more school.

274
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:11,415
Uncle Wing told me all about it.

275
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:15,696
If you've really been expelled,
stay here and help me cook.

276
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:18,462
Start by collecting
the water from over the hill.

277
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,420
It's so heavy!

278
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:35,019
Let me do it for you.
I'm used to this kind of heavy work.

279
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:38,251
Okay. I'll let you help me.
I'm going out.

280
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,103
- Hey, where are you going?
- To J.P.'s place.

281
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:43,943
- "J" what?
- J.P.'s place. You don't know him.

282
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:47,260
That big French guy
that helped us last night.

283
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,658
- Are you sure you can?
- Why not?

284
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,251
- Because I'll get into trouble.
- Look...

285
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,979
Say nothing and no-one will know.
Get the water, then hide the bucket.

286
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:59,175
And if anybody asks you where I am,
what do you say?

287
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,977
You say I've gone
to get the water.

288
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,855
I'm gone.

289
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,136
"Ba..."?
What "Ba"?

290
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:19,260
Students, the lesson that I want to
teach you today is...

291
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:22,261
...the relationship between muscle
and strength. Now...

292
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:24,295
This is called muscle.

293
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:27,292
What's this muscle called?

294
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:28,937
- The "Mouse".
- Yeah, the "Mouse".

295
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,255
Wrong.

296
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:35,296
It's called a "bicep".
Bicep.

297
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,813
What's going on?
What's happening?

298
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:46,492
- You again?
- Yeah, Honourable French Man.

299
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:50,502
I really look up to you.
Take me as a student.

300
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:54,694
I've only 2 dollars.
Take it as a deposit.

301
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,417
That's not enough.
It won't do.

302
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:01,059
These students paid 100 dollars.
And you pay only 2 dollars?

303
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,300
It's not fair to them,
is it?

304
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,733
I'll pay my way
to make up for it.

305
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:09,697
I can wash towels.
I'll mop the floor. Anything.

306
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:11,576
Take me in.

307
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:15,264
I'll take you in
so you can work as you study.

308
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,933
- You're in. Okay?
- Thank you, Honourable Sir.

309
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,573
Oh, yes.
Take this first.

310
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,898
Now, students,
you know about the biceps.

311
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,776
Yes.

312
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:32,054
Hey, come here.

313
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:41,381
Students, these two
are quite similar in size, right?

314
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,572
Right.

315
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:47,618
But do you know their respective
muscles are quite different.

316
00:27:47,743 --> 00:27:49,859
- What's the difference, Sir?
- Look.

317
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:53,737
This here is the
abdominal muscle.

318
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:58,982
Now,
this is blubber.

319
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,734
Fat and flabby.
Soft as blubber.

320
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,616
These are fat cells.

321
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:18,662
- He's got no strength!
- That's it?

322
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:28,455
Are you okay?

323
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,380
Students...

324
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,813
This is muscle against fat.

325
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:41,140
When faced with strength,
the most obvious difference is...

326
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,502
Strength!
It's very important!

327
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:48,017
If I can pack 500lb
in one punch...

328
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,660
- Bravo!
- That's great!

329
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:54,496
Students.

330
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:59,014
If each of you can pack 100lb
and punch five times,

331
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:02,500
that's 100 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1
and once more,

332
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:05,091
- how much is that?
- 100.

333
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:08,693
Right. So my 500lb punch
can beat all of you.

334
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:12,577
One punch of yours, even five
punches, may not knock me down.

335
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:16,541
So how can we get you to do
a 500lb punch?

336
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:21,215
One or two muscles won't do it.
You have to use all your muscles.

337
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:40,982
Wow!
That's great!

338
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:50,059
The Chinese are called the sick men
of East Asia. Why?

339
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:56,292
Bad nutrition. Eating rice every day
which bloats the belly.

340
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:59,733
If you don't eat enough meat,
of course you're under-nourished.

341
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:03,459
You look at those foreigners.
They're all huge.

342
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:06,656
And the reason is,
with every meal they eat meat.

343
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:11,140
So, if you want to have good nutrition,
you must eat meat.

344
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:23,059
Also. The Chinese overcook
vegetables and lose all the vitamins.

345
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:24,935
Look what the foreigners eat.

346
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:31,142
- What is it?
- Salad?

347
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:57,782
- Yuk-Su, have you finished?
- Yeah. These are the last buckets.

348
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,943
Must have been hard for you,
working night and day.

349
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:06,023
- Hard work never killed anyone.
- You've fetched buckets all day.

350
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,214
How many do you think you did?

351
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,499
Huh?

352
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,376
How many?

353
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,336
- Maybe eight to ten.
- So that's one every hour.

354
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,019
No, no.
30 buckets.

355
00:31:20,943 --> 00:31:22,662
30 buckets?

356
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:26,174
One bucket every 20 minutes.
That was quick!

357
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,654
Hey, tank...

358
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,536
Are you having me on?

359
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,862
Ordinarily you hold
eight to ten buckets.

360
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:39,943
Now someone's here,
you hold 30 to 40?

361
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:43,180
- Are you elastic?
- There's no need to berate me.

362
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:47,741
Today I went out to help a friend.
He was being bullied.

363
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:51,220
Yesterday you saved a maid
and today you helped a friend.

364
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,733
- You're a good lad.
- That's right.

365
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,935
To fight injustice and save people
is my goal in life.

366
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:59,019
- I really admire that.
- Thanks.

367
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:03,023
- Master Yat, it's dinner time.
- Let's go and eat, then.

368
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:08,464
Yuk-Su, what does
your friend look like?

369
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:12,622
Really fat, he's got small eyes,
a snout of a nose and talks a lot.

370
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,496
Fatty Hing is really fat,
huh?

371
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:18,291
- Father.
- Where have you been?

372
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,175
I've just explained
to Master Yat.

373
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:23,261
How Fatty Hing was being bullied
and I had to help him.

374
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,260
That's why I'm so late.

375
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:29,581
- Fatty Hing. When did you get here?
- Half a day ago.

376
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:31,660
Here's your meal.

377
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,781
Just look at yourself.
If you don't start behaving,

378
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:38,542
how are you going to
face your late mother?

379
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,178
Yuk-Su,
I'm going now.

380
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:43,818
About your drawings.
I'll get them tomorrow.

381
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:46,777
Goodbye, Uncle. Goodbye, Master
Yat. Goodbye, Uncle Lofty.

382
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,416
Hey,
not so fast.

383
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:52,662
- Stay for dinner. We've got enough.
- No, thanks. I'd better go home.

384
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:56,782
- Let's eat.
- Go on, eat.

385
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,054
- Father, let's eat.
- Wait.

386
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:02,415
Didn't Uncle Chai just say hard
workers have food to eat

387
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,261
and lazy people
will have nothing?

388
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:07,615
Right? I think you're already full,
so you'd better not have any more.

389
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:09,859
You'll mess up your stomach.

390
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:14,135
Why not do some exercise instead?
You can grind some rice for me.

391
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,662
Go on.

392
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:25,421
Who wants to eat? What's the point
of eating rice anyway?

393
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:40,093
Why should I be grinding rice?
I want to be a hero!

394
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:44,261
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

395
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,295
Eat your dinner.
I'll grind the rice.

396
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:53,460
Do you really like being a slave?
You're already free.

397
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:58,415
No need to be so grouchy.

398
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:02,423
You think you've got it tough?
There are people worse off than you.

399
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:07,617
You've never had it hard. Anyway,
you have a father and a best friend.

400
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,293
It's different for me.

401
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,461
When I was young,
I was sold off as a maid.

402
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:18,974
I don't even know
if my mother's alive.

403
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:22,017
Why were you sold off?

404
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,820
I lived in Dong Guan.

405
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,620
My father was a tenant farmer.

406
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,059
The crops kept on failing.

407
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:40,459
At first, we were able
to have two meals a day.

408
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:47,617
But my father got sick and died.
Mum sold me to pay for the funeral.

409
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,776
Once sold...

410
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,938
I had to work for eight years.

411
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,139
Don't cry.

412
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,379
Let me help you wipe your tears.

413
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,014
I'll help you with the rice.

414
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:18,340
It's dawn.

415
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:35,898
"It's the first suggestion of dawn,
Darkness still prevails"

416
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:40,298
"One tankful of water,
two people"

417
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:46,937
"Tolling away,
keeping ourselves strong"

418
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:51,615
"This long road
is getting shorter"

419
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:57,784
"Brimming with water,
the jars are full"

420
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:01,977
"Heart filled with
feelings of love"

421
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:08,378
"When you walk ahead,
I'll walk where you walk"

422
00:36:08,744 --> 00:36:13,056
"Working together in harmony"

423
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:19,537
"When your heart is filled with sweetness,
so is mine"

424
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:24,054
"May the water be our witness"

425
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,776
Finished.

426
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,418
I'll get some water.
You take a rest.

427
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,104
I don't want to sleep.
I was wrong yesterday.

428
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:36,101
I'll do all my chores first.

429
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,581
"Fetching water,
romantic love still ongoing..."

430
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:41,614
Let me give you a hand...

431
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:44,338
"Facing a prisoner's fate
because of my feelings"

432
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:47,137
No, that's okay.
You'd better stay here.

433
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:50,938
Wait for me.
I want to help you.

434
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,299
Hey!

435
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:56,211
"...it turned out to be your kiss"

436
00:36:57,744 --> 00:37:02,659
"Brimming with water,
connecting together"

437
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:07,063
"Heart filled with
feelings of love"

438
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:12,498
Now, as you can't read,
I'll read it once for you.

439
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,538
"In consideration of
the loan to my father,

440
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,781
and the fact that the loan of 20 Yuan
is unable to be paid,

441
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,978
I, Cheung A-Choi, agree to be sold
to the house of Yi-Hung as a maid,

442
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:31,016
without salary or benefits of any kind,
to work for no less than 20 years."

443
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:34,500
"This agreement is binding and I have
no recourse against said agreement,

444
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:37,138
which is also a
transferable document

445
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:41,416
which allows me to be bought and
sold at a price agreed by my master."

446
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:46,179
- Daddy!
- Behave!

447
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:47,817
Get to work!
Leave!

448
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,423
Greetings,
Inspector!

449
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:50,818
- Dad!
- Get to work!

450
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:52,501
Let's go!
Let's go!

451
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,419
There's plenty more
where that came from.

452
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:59,744
You haven't found that maid yet,
have you?

453
00:37:59,864 --> 00:38:03,652
What have you been doing?
Send your men out to find her.

454
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,979
Don't worry.
She won't get away.

455
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,583
TRUE SWORD,
I BESEECH YOU...

456
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,773
- Get up.
- Just a little longer.

457
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,134
- No more sleeping!
- You little punk!

458
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,458
Don't! Don't!

459
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,900
It's eight o'clock.

460
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:24,254
- Come with me.
- You're useless.

461
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,295
I spent the night grinding rice.
I even fetched the water.

462
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:33,063
- What's wrong with sleeping a bit?
- You think you're overworked?

463
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,220
You think I'm mistreating you?

464
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:38,620
The work you did
you should have done yesterday -

465
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,655
never mind your
chores for today.

466
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,500
Wash the wok like I do.

467
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:57,420
- That's too hot.
- No, you're just too slow.

468
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,500
Do it faster.

469
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:07,215
That's better.
It's not dirty. Why clean it?

470
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,098
- Not dirty? Take a look.
- You're right.

471
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,022
- It's so dirty.
- Rub the stains harder.

472
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:21,782
If you don't,
we'll end up with black noodles.

473
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,821
Hey, you'll break up
all the noodles doing that.

474
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:43,903
- Then how should I do it?
- Noodles can't be turned. Toss them.

475
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,693
Toss! Toss!
Toss!

476
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,775
I toss!

477
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,540
- I succeeded!
- Add salt.

478
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:45,782
Add sauce...
that's it. See?

479
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:52,174
Wow! It smells great.
I'll take it out for them.

480
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:55,900
- Tell us which is better.
- Who cooked which?

481
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:59,935
I can't say.
You have to decide for yourselves.

482
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:02,897
You just try it.
He can't be better than the master.

483
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:03,854
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,302
Come on,
let's eat.

485
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:09,217
Let's taste before discussing.

486
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,494
- Come, come.
- Master Yat! Uncle Chai!

487
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:12,534
Wow!

488
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:17,053
Mmm... beef noodles.
Why didn't you wait for me?

489
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:20,894
Wow! Great stuff. Noodles.
Let me have a taste.

490
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,659
This one's fu yung noodles.

491
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:27,140
I wonder what this is.
Let me try it.

492
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,657
Well?

493
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,778
Master Yat,
you're really good!

494
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:36,737
Every time you cook something,
it's unique.

495
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:39,378
But this time it
tastes a bit weird.

496
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:42,535
But it's true.

497
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:48,175
- It does grow on you, though.
- Eat it all, then.

498
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:53,862
Fine. If I eat it all, I'll get fat.
So let's share it.

499
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:55,974
You... you...
get fat by yourself.

500
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:59,176
We'll eat Master Yat's
fu... fu... fu yung noodles.

501
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:00,498
Come,
let's eat.

502
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,615
It's obvious to you all.

503
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm not good enough yet.

504
00:42:05,463 --> 00:42:07,215
Yuk-Su.

505
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:11,932
Let me put in a fair word.
I tasted both dishes in the kitchen.

506
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:16,103
Yes, Master Yat's dish is better.
But Yuk-Su's isn't bad.

507
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,499
It tastes funny, but it's good.
Granddad, have some.

508
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:22,581
- Try some?
- Yeah, let's have a taste.

509
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:27,656
The flavour's been sealed well.
I can tell from the oil colour.

510
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:30,661
There's a man in Guangzhou City
who makes seven-colour noodles.

511
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:31,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,581
And I'm going to check him out.

513
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:36,376
Yuk-Su,
hold the fort while I'm gone.

514
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:37,619
Me?
I can't do that.

515
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:42,259
- Just stay calm.
- Yuk-Su, try your best then.

516
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:46,456
He's put all his trust in you.
You'd better thank him.

517
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,382
- Thank you, Master.
- That's all right.

518
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,540
- Time for a drink, right?
- Yes!

519
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:55,696
Let's fill the glasses.

520
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:01,220
Want a ride?

521
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:04,695
Now, do your best
to look after the business.

522
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:06,542
I understand,
Master.

523
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:10,857
Have a good trip.

524
00:43:16,504 --> 00:43:18,335
It's here!
It's here!

525
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:21,535
- It smells so good!
- It's unbeatable!

526
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:25,942
- Let's have a taste!
- It's so tasty!

527
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:34,179
Siu-Yu, I've prepared
more than 30 plates here.

528
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:37,536
Now...

529
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,655
You heat them up in here

530
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,856
and if there's not enough
you split them into two.

531
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,942
I can't.
I'll get into trouble for that.

532
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:50,782
If father hadn't got hurt
we wouldn't be here.

533
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:55,018
Frankly, I, Fai Yuk-Su,
am not meant to cook noodles.

534
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:59,023
I've got to go and learn
kung fu so I can help the weak.

535
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:01,738
That's what I really want to do.

536
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:05,492
- I know. You're a free man.
- I'm glad you understand.

537
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,182
I'm off.

538
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:20,060
Hit it higher.
Now watch me.

539
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,579
Get up.

540
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:36,423
And where have you been?
Here for a day then gone for a month.

541
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,854
Sir, even though I wasn't here,
I've been practising kung fu.

542
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:42,703
Based on what you taught me
on the first day,

543
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:47,614
I've been pushing myself. I haven't
forgotten a single thing you've said.

544
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:48,937
I'll try you out.

545
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:50,497
- Ricky!
- Yes?

546
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,023
- A demonstration.
- Okay.

547
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,293
- Come! Come!
- Let's get a good seat!

548
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:55,572
I wonder who'll win?

549
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:57,137
Go on.

550
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:04,937
- Great!
- Bravo!

551
00:45:05,624 --> 00:45:08,501
- That was great!
- Back to practise! Practise!

552
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:10,057
He's completely different!

553
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:14,302
Sir, I really remembered all you said.
I ate raw meat at every meal.

554
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:17,700
Hey, let's see how many pounds
you can hit now.

555
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,056
200lb.

556
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:25,539
That was good!

557
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,501
Don't throw wild punches!

558
00:45:31,624 --> 00:45:33,933
Not like that.
Aim well.

559
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,418
If you're too impulsive,
you waste energy.

560
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:38,295
Come on.

561
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,293
Don't duck.

562
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:44,176
Let it hit you.

563
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:48,297
You've got to be able to take it.
Watch it carefully. Go with the flow.

564
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:49,979
Hit hard!

565
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:51,536
You're stronger than it.

566
00:45:51,704 --> 00:45:52,932
Now, come on.

567
00:45:56,864 --> 00:46:00,254
"You think I'll feel pain,
you think I'll be tired"

568
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:04,138
"How to hate,
how to practise."

569
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:08,142
"How to love,
how to say goodbye"

570
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:12,097
"Using hands and
feet to be healthy"

571
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,933
"With a dream I fight reality"

572
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:19,541
"I'm already very,
very exhausted"

573
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:23,339
"Dreaming about how
to hold up the sky"

574
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:26,342
"I can only focus and go forward"

575
00:46:26,903 --> 00:46:34,299
"Strong body, so as to be forthright
and strike one more time"

576
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:41,374
"Strong heart, it's for each fight
that you need to be replenished"

577
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:48,218
"A youth, with strong body and mind
that will never change"

578
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:55,413
"Rushing ahead,
within reality you challenge yourself"

579
00:46:55,543 --> 00:47:01,937
"A youth, with strong body and mind
that will never change"

580
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:09,896
"Rushing ahead,
within reality you challenge yourself"

581
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:11,980
I can be a hero now!

582
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,731
Quickly...
quickly!

583
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,219
Sister!
Give me back my sister.

584
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,539
Be quiet!
Want to riot?

585
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:27,979
It's good that you've come here.

586
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,383
Keep quiet.

587
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:33,659
What is it?

588
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,854
Inspector Wa,
I've come to buy back my sister.

589
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,817
We sold her to them
to work as a maid, not a whore.

590
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:41,981
- I have the contract.
- Can't you read?

591
00:47:44,143 --> 00:47:47,978
"As a slave or a prostitute."
That's what it says.

592
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:52,179
I don't care.
He said she'd be a maid.

593
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:57,378
Being a whore's much better.
It's not as tough as being a maid.

594
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:59,812
He should try being a whore!

595
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:02,094
Here's the money.
I want her back.

596
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,692
I've had someone
calculate it for me.

597
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:08,976
For two years that's 27.30.
The principal and interest is all here.

598
00:48:09,104 --> 00:48:12,016
Means 2 dollars a day.

599
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:15,853
And that works out
to be 1, 460 dollars.

600
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:17,656
Do you have that much money?

601
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:19,695
Leave!

602
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:26,461
This contract is legal.
If you don't leave I'll arrest you all.

603
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:27,777
Go!

604
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:32,294
Inspector, arrest them all
for trespassing. Quickly!

605
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,938
- Give me back my sister!
- Arrest them all!

606
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:36,577
Master Wong!
Master Wong!

607
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:41,215
Master Wong, give her back.
I beg you.

608
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:45,776
Evil bastard.

609
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:50,976
Sonny!

610
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:58,776
Father?

611
00:49:21,664 --> 00:49:24,894
Whoever touches one hair on
my father's head pays with a leg.

612
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:26,581
Let's go now!

613
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,857
Let's go!

614
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,577
Go! Go!

615
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,455
Out! Go!

616
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:01,657
- What?
- Piss off.

617
00:50:02,463 --> 00:50:03,499
Let me go!

618
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:05,703
It's not her!

619
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:07,382
Piss off!

620
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,659
Waiter,
what's taking so long?

621
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:11,773
Hurry up!

622
00:50:11,903 --> 00:50:16,579
All right, all right.
Just a minute, the rest is coming.

623
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:20,539
What's going on here?

624
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:23,542
There's too many people
and we can't cook fast enough.

625
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,774
I'll go and take a look.

626
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:31,543
What's taking so long?
It's still not here.
