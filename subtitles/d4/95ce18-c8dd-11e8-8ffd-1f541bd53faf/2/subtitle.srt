1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:03,300
What are you doing?

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:05,176
Who is your boss?

3
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,817
I belong to Mr Chan.

4
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:08,423
Go to hell!

5
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,582
Where's Yuk-Su?

6
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:12,619
Huh?

7
00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:15,737
- Where is Yuk-Su?
- Oh, he's...

8
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,622
Where's he got to?

9
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:22,783
- That little punk!
- It's not ready. You must add sauce.

10
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,302
Okay.

11
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:26,941
It'll do.
Quick!

12
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:29,055
Beef noodles are here!

13
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,462
- That's disgusting! How's yours?
- It's horrible.

14
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,900
Shorty,
come here.

15
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:39,221
What? My name's Lofty.
Not Shorty.

16
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,222
- Shorty, eat it.
- Eat! Eat!

17
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:49,098
What was that for?

18
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:54,221
- What are you doing?
- Tell your boss to come out.

19
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,778
My... my... boss has gone
to Guangzhou.

20
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,293
Oh, no.
Mr Wong's men.

21
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,460
Tell Yat to come out!

22
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:03,175
Let's go.

23
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:22,933
- It's like sticky goo.
- How can they serve this stuff?

24
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,132
Let's go.

25
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:39,058
Siu-Yu. Come on out,
quickly.

26
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:54,139
Stop!

27
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:59,418
Mister, what did we do
that made you tear down the sign?

28
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:02,183
What's it to you? Get lost.
Who are you?

29
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,419
Well,
I'm the boss here.

30
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,499
The boss?

31
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:12,739
"No.1 Beef noodles"?
More like the worst.

32
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,422
Calm down,
mister.

33
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:18,694
I opened this shop
to make a living.

34
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:21,098
Smash the board
and we'll be out of business.

35
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,896
What is this?

36
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,379
- They're beef noodles.
- Beef noodles?

37
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:27,859
- Yes.
- It's manure.

38
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,859
Maybe this one's not good.
I'll go and make you some more.

39
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,940
Stay right there.

40
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,897
- I make good ones.
- You said "good", huh?

41
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:40,059
Yes.

42
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,300
So eat it all.

43
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,618
Eat it.

44
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,337
Lick it off the floor.

45
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:12,577
You don't have the right to say
you're number one.

46
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:17,612
You are a dog so
crawl like a dog.

47
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,699
Crawl.

48
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,373
- Lofty, clean this up.
- Yes.

49
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:19,820
Hey, Siu-Yu.
Doesn't that look great?

50
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,539
What happened?

51
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,416
What's the matter?

52
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:31,493
Father, I told you not to work.
What about your leg?

53
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,823
You little punk!
I'll kill you!

54
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,014
You're useless.
I'll kill you.

55
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:43,818
- Don't hit him.
- Don't try to stop me. I'll kill him.

56
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,333
- Why are you hitting me?
- How can you face your Uncle?

57
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:50,218
Uncle Chai! Uncle Chai!
Calm down. It wasn't his fault.

58
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:52,300
Will you listen to me?

59
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:58,055
- Master Yat, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be like this. Get up.

60
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,935
Your poor mother.
She'd turn in her grave.

61
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,055
He doesn't know himself.

62
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:35,096
He's unfit and weak,
yet he's always picking fights

63
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,897
and even wants to be a hero.

64
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:41,294
The poor
can't fight the rich

65
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,779
and the rich
can't fight the government.

66
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:49,059
I work my guts out
to get him into the very best school

67
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:53,256
just so he'll be able to
rise above all this

68
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:55,898
and become a good
medical student.

69
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,820
And now it's all over.

70
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:02,096
It's lucky you took him in, but he
can't even learn to cook noodles

71
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,578
and now he's brought you
all this trouble.

72
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,935
- I'm so very sorry.
- Don't be like that.

73
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:11,613
As soon as everything's cleared up
we can start again.

74
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,781
If Yuk-Su doesn't like cooking
he can always continue drawing.

75
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:17,577
Everybody's good at something,
you know.

76
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,051
He actually can draw well.

77
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:24,256
Drawing?

78
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:32,140
What good is drawing?
When I was 20,

79
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,698
I won an award at
the Salone in Paris.

80
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,254
You have a great talent.

81
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,261
What good was this talent
when my wife starved to death?

82
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,575
That was just money problems.

83
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:48,861
What's so good
about drawing well?

84
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:53,182
When I was in Beijing,
I was so poor I had to sell my quilt.

85
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:57,535
And when my wife was in labour,
I couldn't send her to the hospital.

86
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:02,259
As a result,
she died giving birth to Yuk-Su.

87
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:10,338
I vowed that day I would never
draw again for the rest of my life.

88
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:15,419
Don't, Chai.
Please don't.

89
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:19,703
That little punk -
of all the things he learns,

90
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:22,497
why does he learn the worst
from me?

91
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:27,981
Look. This is what he draws.
They're worthless. Throw them away.

92
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:32,576
It's all right.
He's still very young.

93
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:36,583
He'll change as he grows up.
Don't let it get to you.

94
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:41,300
- Try and get some rest.
- Dear mother of Yuk-Su...

95
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:43,699
I'm so sorry.

96
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,698
Yuk-Su!

97
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:21,132
Why are you burning
your drawings?

98
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,814
Siu-Yu tells me you sneak off
to practise kung fu.

99
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:28,855
Do you think you can solve
all problems with force?

100
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,656
Yes, I can.

101
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:34,696
If I'd known kung fu
they couldn't have hurt my father.

102
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,861
And those men today wouldn't have
smashed your restaurant.

103
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:39,741
That is true.

104
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,140
With a personality like yours,
if you don't learn kung fu

105
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,097
somebody's going to kill you.

106
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,060
But why do you go out to learn?

107
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,493
Don't you know
I've already been teaching you?

108
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,055
Yeah. Washing the wok
and tossing the noodles.

109
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,981
Washing and tossing
are the basics of kung fu.

110
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:02,221
" One - guts. Two - strength.
Three - kung fu." Yours is kung fu?

111
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,220
Try it if you dare.

112
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:22,698
- Easy if you've done it for years.
- What about your strength?

113
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:26,453
Can cooking noodles
give you a 500lb punch?

114
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,857
Come here.

115
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,417
Use your new 500lb punch.

116
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:41,738
Punch.

117
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:42,774
Come on.

118
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:00,903
Yuk-Su, controlled strength -
that's what you need to learn.

119
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:04,060
Chinese kung fu is being able to
have control when you want.

120
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:09,497
I put my strength into my four fingers.
Therefore the egg didn't break.

121
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,263
Still not convinced?
Let's try it again.

122
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,856
- Wow! Washing the wok!
- Tossing the wok!

123
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:37,180
Want to learn my kind of
beef noodle kung fu?

124
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,180
Yes.

125
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,737
- Serious?
- Yes.

126
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:43,618
Then remember, if you learn my kung fu,
you can only use it in defence.

127
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,256
- Yes.
- No attacking.

128
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,453
I understand.

129
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,380
There'll be time for that later.
Go and take a bath.

130
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,499
Yes, Teacher.

131
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,182
Dice the tomatoes.

132
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:06,817
Slice the onion.

133
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,174
Slice the tomatoes.
Dice the onion.

134
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,259
Catch it.
Keep up with me.

135
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,499
Slice the pepper.
Slice the onion.

136
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:16,343
Flatten the ginger.

137
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:17,897
Dice this.

138
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:20,502
Catch this tomato.

139
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:27,658
Your hands are quick
but your eyes are far too slow.

140
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:30,423
To learn kung fu
your reflexes must be fast.

141
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,499
How would you stop this?
By hand?

142
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,933
- By ducking?
- Of course! Now, remember.

143
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:40,021
Teacher. Why do we only use
our hands and not our feet as well?

144
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:42,373
- Using feet is hard.
- That's not so.

145
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:45,655
I know a man who can kick birds
right out of the sky.

146
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,096
Show me your kick.

147
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:53,373
I'll try.

148
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,699
Left foot.

149
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:58,497
You knew which one
before I even started.

150
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,422
Now,
kick again.

151
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:07,220
One...!

152
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,741
Now, before you moved your foot
your shoulder moved.

153
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:17,942
How could you move your foot without
your shoulder moving?

154
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,574
Use your foot
without casting a shadow.

155
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:40,377
Now, there's one more
type of shadowless kick.

156
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:45,497
Hold on, Teacher.
Wait. Let me draw it first.

157
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,939
I'll be quick.
I'll be quick.

158
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,778
Great.

159
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,213
Got it.

160
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,899
Hold on tight.

161
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,980
You moved your left shoulder.

162
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,694
Got hold of it?

163
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,699
That's great!
It didn't move.

164
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:15,975
It didn't move.

165
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:18,299
I need to draw it.
Be my model.

166
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,540
What?
You want to draw me?

167
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:23,940
More or less.
Now, copy the kicking pose I was in.

168
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,897
- Come on. Lift up your foot.
- I can't.

169
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:28,855
Yes, you can.

170
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,178
I'll get some paper.
Don't move.

171
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,454
- I'm falling.
- Good, good.

172
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:36,654
That's great.
This is great.

173
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,819
Wash the wok.

174
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:50,380
Wash the wok.

175
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,015
Wash them with both hands.

176
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,702
Wash, wash...

177
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:16,654
- Teacher.
- Watch it! What are you doing?

178
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,900
- The shadowless kick.
- The shadowless kick?

179
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:22,094
- Practising it all night?
- Yeah.

180
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:26,103
You're overdoing it. You're bruising
yourself even before you perfect it.

181
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:29,143
- You use this to practise with?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:33,381
But this doesn't move. When you're
fighting, your opponent will move.

183
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,895
Why are you hanging these woks up
at this hour of the morning?

184
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,857
- Washing the wok in the air.
- Think your opponent will stay still?

185
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,337
Left.

186
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:47,413
Right.

187
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,138
Left...
right...

188
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,538
Left...
right...

189
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:51,619
Left...
right...

190
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:59,542
- Don't starve me. I won't do it again.
- Go back to sleep.

191
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:03,896
Remember, while fighting you must
be agile while using your feet.

192
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:07,778
Once you lift your feet he'll kick your
other one, so you must be balanced.

193
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:11,693
- Balanced.
- Remember what I say. Balance.

194
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:14,257
Balance. My centre of balance
must be lower.

195
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,059
Look at you.
Are you trying to be an eel?

196
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,935
Yuk-Su, those eels...
I need them to make my noodles with.

197
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:39,339
- What's all this?
- You said to keep low. I'm practising.

198
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:43,377
Have you gone mad?
I want those eels dead. Cut them up.

199
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,176
- Okay.
- You've made him angry.

200
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,657
- Yuk-Su, are those eels ready?
- Yes, nearly.

201
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,338
Teacher, I've made seven-colour
noodles for your birthday.

202
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:07,101
Really?

203
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:12,212
Master, you've got to make a wish
before you blow out the candles.

204
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:16,895
Don't be daft - the wish shouldn't just
be mine. We should all share in it.

205
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:19,903
- Blow!
- Now, let's all blow together.

206
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:23,732
- One, two, three!
- Happy birthday.

207
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:27,423
- Yuk-Su.
- Fatty Hing, what a coincidence.

208
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:30,217
Turn on the lights.
Come on in.

209
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,061
Happy birthday.
No, just carry on.

210
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,654
- You're tense. Why are you here?
- Siu-Laan's in trouble. Come on.

211
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:42,903
- What's the matter?
- Siu-Laan's been sold as a prostitute.

212
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,855
How could you do that to her?

213
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:48,134
- You sold her as a whore?
- It wasn't me.

214
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:51,415
- Was it your father?
- It wasn't him either.

215
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,263
- Her mother did it.
- Why'd she do that?

216
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,135
It's all your fault.

217
00:17:56,264 --> 00:18:00,051
You told me not to keep a maid,
so I persuaded my dad.

218
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:04,017
And he agreed -
and set all the maids free.

219
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,693
But Siu-Laan's mother sold her again,
seeing as she's still young.

220
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:12,379
- What do we do?
- Isn't your kung fu good now?

221
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,462
Why don't you and Master Yat
go and save her?

222
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:20,134
- No way. My father will kill me.
- So what do we do?

223
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:25,694
Siu-Laan's in real trouble. It's your
fault. You told me not to have a maid.

224
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:29,497
One more drink...

225
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,579
Now he's getting drunk.

226
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:37,331
Master. Here's some more wine.
It's from France. Good stuff.

227
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,132
- Have another one.
- Don't mind if I do...

228
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,099
Thank you...

229
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,343
Need to sleep...

230
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,618
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

231
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,979
"NO.1 BEEF NOODLES"

232
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:11,380
That's the girl.

233
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:25,859
I supply girls for the Chinatowns in
London, Korea and San Francisco.

234
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,623
I supply them all.

235
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,813
You've come to the right man.

236
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:38,783
- Have you considered the price?
- Oh, the price is no problem.

237
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,939
We just need to see the samples.

238
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,412
Not here.

239
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:00,901
These ones aren't suitable for France.
Do you have any more?

240
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,855
Move it.

241
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:10,055
Come on.

242
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:13,622
- Go in.
- Walk!

243
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:17,338
I'm not going.
Let go of me. No!

244
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,932
- I'm not going!
- Move!

245
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,062
Master.

246
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:24,182
- Master!
- Siu-Laan!

247
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,942
Let me go!

248
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,454
Master,
please take me home!

249
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:40,498
Don't come any closer!

250
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,973
- Don't! Don't!
- Get out of here.

251
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,502
Let's go.

252
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,899
Stay back!
Stay back!

253
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,776
Stay back!
Sonny...!

254
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,939
Look at that.
He didn't have to duck.

255
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:35,334
Wow! 500lb.

256
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,215
Keep away.

257
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:04,413
Wasn't that something,
Fatty Hing?

258
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:43,133
- He even broke the door.
- Even the wall's dented.

259
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,734
The "Scorpion Tactic".

260
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:37,902
The "Windblown Grass".

261
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,662
The meat isn't working.

262
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:01,261
- Honourable Sir!
- Get away!

263
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:13,053
- "Two Dragons At Sea".
- That's 1,000lb.

264
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,373
"Seeking A Failure Strategy".

265
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:33,858
"Crouching Dragon".

266
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,497
Honourable Sir!

267
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,702
Come on!

268
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:14,658
"Heaven's Knife
Whirlwind Kick".

269
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:40,015
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, quick!

270
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:44,020
Quick, quick,
let's go!

271
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:49,015
Siu-Yu!

272
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,817
They set fire to the restaurant.
Go save your father.

273
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:54,252
- We've got to go now!
- Siu-Yu!

274
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:58,581
Quickly! Go back and save them.
Don't worry about me.

275
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:18,777
Here...

276
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,016
Take him to hospital.
Quick!

277
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:24,936
Father!

278
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:28,302
Teacher!

279
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:41,460
Fire! Fire!

280
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,135
How tragic!

281
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,381
- Father!
- Pour water!

282
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,301
- Father!
- Don't go in!

283
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:53,255
- Where's my teacher?
- He's gone to help your dad.

284
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,096
Teacher!

285
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:59,493
Teacher!
Come back out!

286
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,379
Father!

287
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,822
Teacher!

288
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:07,579
Father!

289
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:10,661
I'm going to save Siu-Yu.
Don't go in there.

290
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:31,177
Teacher...

291
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:33,854
I dragged you into this.

292
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,819
You're right.

293
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,819
Forbearance is useless.

294
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:45,061
For more than ten years
I've been concealing myself here.

295
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:48,061
Hoping to forget the underworld,
all the hate.

296
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:55,542
In the past, I was knifed and suffered
humiliation in silence.

297
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,373
I hoped that grinning and bearing it
would bring peace.

298
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,016
Teacher!

299
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:05,022
Do you know who I really am?

300
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:12,497
I'm the assassin from
the Green Dragon Triad,

301
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:15,615
called the Dragon Severer, the most
feared killer in the underworld.

302
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,499
You punk!
You dare to come back?

303
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,292
Get the weapons.

304
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,492
No need.

305
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,091
- Teacher, why did you throw it away?
- Together.

306
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:27,417
You stupid old fool,
let's see if you can beat nine of us.

307
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:46,018
Give me the stick.

308
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,497
- Quick.
- Yes.

309
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,418
Teacher, catch!

310
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,653
This is the real
three-section stick.

311
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,336
You've hit me,
Yuk-Su!

312
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:43,972
- Come bathe with me.
- No!

313
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:45,093
Don't!

314
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:48,215
- Don't? Then you'll have to starve!
- Let me go!

315
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:51,617
Help!

316
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,297
Catch!

317
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:54,776
Help!

318
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,496
Help!

319
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:11,413
Let me go.

320
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:13,332
Siu-Yu!

321
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:17,777
Sonny!

322
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,893
- Sonny.
- Teacher!

323
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:47,899
Sonny!

324
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:50,254
- Free the maids first.
- Okay.

325
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,774
You stupid old man.
Have you forgotten your humiliation?

326
00:33:10,983 --> 00:33:14,943
Strange. How does he know
which foot I use before I use it?

327
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,176
I see.
He's watching my shoulders.

328
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:24,816
Okay, I won't move.
Let's see what he does.

329
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,175
"Southern shadowless kick".

330
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:49,093
Watch.

331
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:50,338
Watch.

332
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,613
Watch, watch!

333
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:52,573
Watch!

334
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:59,899
Even if you can predict my moves,
I can still kick you to death, old man.

335
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,103
Don't just lie there!
Get up.

336
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:02,059
Fatty.

337
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,459
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

338
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:07,576
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Quickly, let's go!

339
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,295
Quick! Quick!

340
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,778
- Siu-Yu, I have to go. Fatty!
- What?

341
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,372
Take Siu-Yu home.
I must help my Teacher.

342
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:17,093
- Be careful.
- Go now.

343
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:42,819
Wow! Teacher,
you're the best.

344
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:48,419
Watch out,
"Crouching Dragon"!

345
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:14,134
Teacher!

346
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:43,698
Teacher!

347
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,453
How are you?

348
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:48,939
- Father?
- Sonny. Slaughter them!

349
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:54,176
You hit my father.
I'm going to take your life.

350
00:37:18,743 --> 00:37:19,732
Sonny!

351
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,973
You hit my Teacher,
I'll hit your father.

352
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:52,254
Watch his shoulders.

353
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,813
Right foot.
Left foot.

354
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,614
Watch it!
Right foot.

355
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:11,301
- Watch carefully.
- I did, but he was too quick.

356
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:23,460
Do the "Shadowless Kick".

357
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:29,174
You want me?
Come and get me.

358
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,097
How can you do it on a table?

359
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,015
Grab his foot.
Wash the Wok.

360
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,658
- Teacher, I did it.
- Watch out.

361
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,022
Wash, wash.

362
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:55,818
Yuk-Su!

363
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,421
Wash.

364
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,381
The "Scorpion Tactic".

365
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:34,652
That hurts!

366
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,981
Yuk-Su,
what are you doing?

367
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:50,821
The "Eel Tactic",
Teacher.

368
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,412
The boy's mad. I've fought
everywhere and never seen this.

369
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:19,381
100 eels going up the beach.
I'll flatten you! I'll flatten you!

370
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:20,572
I'll flatten you!

371
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:42,221
"Heaven's Knife
Whirlwind Kick"!

372
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,098
Watch.

373
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:55,658
Toss the wok!

374
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,821
Wash the wok,
Yuk-Su!

375
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:29,299
Stand firm,
extend all limbs!

376
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:39,413
"Southern Shadowless Kick".

377
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:09,093
I did it, Teacher!
I beat him!

378
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:19,023
"To be or not to be"
is from William Shakespeare.

379
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:24,218
This is an important speech in Hamlet
when the prince takes his revenge.

380
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:30,820
Hamlet was alone in the castle,
and his feelings...

381
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,094
Well,
you could say...

382
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,136
Get up.

383
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:41,935
That slap came from Lincoln.

384
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:43,941
This one's from Shakespeare.

385
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:46,818
Drawing comics in
the classroom...!

386
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,972
Fai Yuk-Su used
to draw in class.

387
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:53,982
You compare yourself to him?
He is a genius. He's got an MBE.

388
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:56,095
Think you can get one?
