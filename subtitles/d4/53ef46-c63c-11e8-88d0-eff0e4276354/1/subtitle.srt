1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,592
[Onlookers shouting]

2
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,778
Ohh.

3
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:52,568
You see what happened there?

4
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,998
I'm pretty sure you hit me.

5
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,029
No. I give you left, left.

6
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:58,420
You think I'll give another
left, and I gave you a right.

7
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,581
I'm just telling you...

8
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,513
that's what boxing's
all about, OK?

9
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,990
You show your opponent
one thing,

10
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,369
and you do
something else.

11
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:10,773
That's how Ali took
the title from Foreman.

12
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:13,332
He beat him with a rope-a-dope.
Don't you remember?

13
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,026
I don't remember what day
of the week it is.

14
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:20,267
That's right. Everyone thought
Ali's arms had run out,

15
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,073
that he's on empty, but he's
just setting Foreman up.

16
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,957
He's letting him
burn himself out.

17
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,381
And then in the eighth round,
he comes.

18
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,040
Poor George
has got nothing left.

19
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,190
I always liked
Bruce Lee movies.

20
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:46,210
Now you're learning.

21
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,810
Don't look at my hands.
Look at my shoulder.

22
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,678
That's where the punch
is coming from.

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,619
See?

24
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,207
You're still
looking at my hands.

25
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,589
Now come on,
let's try it again.

26
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,202
Come on, focus!
Come on! Shoulders, shoulders!

27
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:13,034
- Here.
- Nah. You keep it.

28
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,079
- Come on, you won.
- Yeah, but I always win.

29
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:18,186
I mean, I feel
so guilty about it.

30
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,898
Shut up and take it.

31
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,684
You know why you didn't
beat me today, Hale?

32
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:30,529
HALE: You've been boxing
for 20 years...

33
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:32,543
and you're better at it
than I am?

34
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,680
No. You don't have
the will to win.

35
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,608
Well, your insight
is shattering.

36
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,757
You had me today.

37
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:44,442
You could have shut me down,
but you blinked.

38
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,114
Yeah, well, we were
only sparring, buddy.

39
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,670
Thinking like that
is exactly why you lost.

40
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,527
- Now take this.
- It's yours.

41
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,633
No, no, no, take it.

42
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,750
If you didn't give it
everything you've got,

43
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:00,762
then I don't want it.
Go ahead.

44
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,914
You don't understand.
It really is yours.

45
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,524
I took it out of your wallet
while you were in the shower.

46
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,214
- General.
- General.

47
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:29,602
Major, were you recently
promoted past me?

48
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:30,479
No, sir.

49
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:33,100
Then why are you smoking
in my briefing room?

50
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:36,194
Sorry about that, sir.
That will never happen again.

51
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,259
Sit.

52
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,333
You take off in the Stealth
at 0-dark-30.

53
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:48,119
Fly a simulated,
low-level border penetration.

54
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,271
Nap of the earth
all the way.

55
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:54,203
- Scare cows, wake the farmers.
- Not tonight, buddy.

56
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,847
We're flying the B3
with two live nukes.

57
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,910
GENERAL: Palmdale's
concerned about...

58
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:00,509
low-level gamma
and x-ray diffusion...

59
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:01,949
screwing up the peripherals.

60
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:06,018
They want to send up a couple,
see if anything glows.

61
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,757
- 61s?
- Big ones. 83s.

62
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,362
Whoo! Crowd pleasers.

63
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,990
DEAKINS: How's your head?
HALE: All right. I'll be fine.

64
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:39,544
DEAKINS: I'm sorry about that.

65
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,277
HALE: Don't worry.
I'll get you back.

66
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,302
Ah, now you're dreaming.

67
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:45,107
After you, major.

68
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:11,157
HALE: These exercises
are fantastic.

69
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,924
When we go to war
against Utah,

70
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,046
we are really going
to kick ass.

71
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,571
Ground control,
ready for rollout.

72
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,610
Park ranger.

73
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,498
I'd like to speak to you
about this campfire.

74
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,781
WOMAN: Should I go?
MAN: No, Wanda. You stay put.

75
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:16,574
MAN: Yeah, I know.
No wood fires in the park.

76
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,651
Wanda has a cold,
and I'm trying to keep her warm.

77
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,567
Sir, have you seen
any other hikers...

78
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,886
or campers
in this area?

79
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:26,588
Not this time of year.
What's the fine for this?

80
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,767
RANGER: Pretty steep.

81
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,292
Secured.

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,075
MAN: Jesus Christ.
Drag him out of there.

83
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,736
Be smelling that all night.

84
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:14,638
HALE: Climb heading 287,
flight level 200.

85
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:17,150
DEAKINS: That's 287, 200.

86
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,967
HALE: I don't think
that Aurora Project...

87
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,729
is going to happen for me.
Spoke to your buddy Taylor.

88
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,779
He doesn't feel like I have
enough fighter time to qualify.

89
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,181
And what did you
say to him?

90
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,254
Thank you very much,
sir. Good-bye.

91
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,177
DEAKINS: You'll never change,
will you?

92
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,189
And that, my friend,
will be your downfall.

93
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:37,472
- Know what your problem is?
- Yeah. I'm always right.

94
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,700
- You think you're always right.
- That's deep.

95
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,494
You should have made
colonel by now,

96
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:46,109
but you're too busy pushing
at everybody all the time.

97
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,751
DEAKINS: That's an awesome
responsibility, isn't it?

98
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,606
DEAKINS: McMurren control,
this is Go-Seven.

99
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,655
Colonel, you boys
in Utah still awake?

100
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:03,224
Copy, Major Deakins.
We're ready and waiting.

101
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,001
Be advised,
we're going to catch...

102
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,743
your sorry little butts
this morning and bite down hard.

103
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,566
You may pass that
along to Captain Hale...

104
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,149
with my compliments.

105
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,646
DEAKINS: Wilkins
is giving us attitude.

106
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,247
You want to take
a turn tonight?

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,378
HALE: I'll fly in one ear
and out the other.

108
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,787
He won't even know
we were there.

109
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,593
DEAKINS: Hale says that
if anyone can catch us, you can.

110
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,349
And everyone get a fix.

111
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,479
They're about to
turn out the lights.

112
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,351
- Ready, captain?
- On your command, major.

113
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,564
Go to war.

114
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,921
HALE: Initiating stealth mode.

115
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,537
DEAKINS: River valley approach.
Here we go.

116
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,155
MAN: Colonel, they've gone
to stealth mode.

117
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:05,086
WILKINS: We lost them on radar.
Anybody still holding?

118
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,935
MAN: Got capture
on their heat signature, sir.

119
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:08,683
- Good.
- They may be running cold,

120
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,614
but the air above
ten-five is colder.

121
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,363
Good man, Frenchy.
I like that.

122
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:14,452
DEAKINS: Descend
to 400 feet AGL,

123
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,704
altimeter setting 3001.

124
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:20,546
HALE: Air speed
.7 Mach 3001, 400 feet.

125
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,148
Nap of the earth.
Here we go.

126
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,234
MAN ON RADIO: Terry, you been
through the Needles entrance?

127
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,542
TERRY: No, why?
MAN: Mrs. Parker just called.

128
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:48,176
Oh, God. What is it this time?
Another UFO?

129
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,928
Or did Elvis drop by for dinner?

130
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,792
MAN: She didn't mention him
but said a bunch of trucks...

131
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,702
went through the Needles
entrance an hour ago,

132
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,951
and she thought
they looked suspicious.

133
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:01,845
Clyde, what exactly does
a suspicious truck look like?

134
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,640
CLYDE: I don't know,
and I have no idea.

135
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,060
Me neither.

136
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,949
CLYDE: The thing is, she said
one of the trucks was ours.

137
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,014
You're the only one out tonight,
so if it wasn't you...

138
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,478
She was probably
just hallucinating.

139
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,206
Don't worry.
I'll check it out.

140
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,090
MAN: Lost them.
WILKINS: Damn.

141
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,174
Come on, keep hunting.
Keep hunting.

142
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:37,114
DEAKINS: We're below their eyes.
Proceed to primary target.

143
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,772
HALE: Descending to 200 feet.

144
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:42,306
DEAKINS: Ridge coming up
in 6 seconds.

145
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,920
HALE: I got it.

146
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,926
Whoo! Very nicely done.

147
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,834
- Excellent.
- Switching to autopilot.

148
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,776
Almost
as good as me.

149
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,763
I left a few trees behind.
I'll try to do better next time.

150
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,545
You really love
this shit, don't you?

151
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,143
Where else can you fly
a $2 billion plane...

152
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:08,564
800 miles an hour
100 feet off the ground?

153
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,123
That is a fact.
That is a fact.

154
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,794
You're in for life, huh?

155
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,103
As long as they'll have me.
Aren't you?

156
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,799
Nah, nah.
I don't think so.

157
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:21,687
I mean, come on.

158
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:26,671
You said it yourself,
I should be colonel by now.

159
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:29,301
Instead, idiots like Boone
become general.

160
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,195
Boone is not
such a bad guy.

161
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,114
If he had a thought
go through his head,

162
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,057
it would be the quickest trip
in North America.

163
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,923
Oh, nah.

164
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,249
Flying doesn't mean
what it used to mean to me.

165
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,462
Not the flying.
Carrying the nukes. I know you.

166
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,012
You love having the power of God
at your fingertips.

167
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,774
You get off on it.

168
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,408
Look out your window.
There's something wrong...

169
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,807
with the terrain

00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:57,689
All clear!

347
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:30,737
- Where is your truck?
- Just around the bend.

348
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:34,076
- How did you find me?
- Saw your chute.

349
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:38,574
Don't step on that!
There. On that black stuff.

350
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:41,058
It's cryptogammic soil.
Very fragile.

351
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,358
One footprint takes
centuries to repair.

352
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:47,122
Come on. Jump. Yeah.

353
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,029
Thought it was a mine
or something.

354
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,299
Endangered dirt.
That's a new one.

355
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:54,680
[Buzzing]

356
00:30:57,116 --> 00:31:01,018
Colonel Wilkins,
this is Airman Kelly, sir!

357
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:03,553
- Go.
- Chief Rhodes is dead!

358
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,916
They're all dead!

359
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:08,122
What the hell happened?
What the hell happened?!

360
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,187
[Buzz]

361
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:15,508
It's the nuke!
It's open! It's wide open!

362
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,165
Kelly, come in!
What happened?

363
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:24,898
Oh, God! What am I going to do?

364
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,917
Whoo!

365
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:35,162
Recall search and rescue.
Get me Washington.

366
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:37,796
I want N.E.S.T.
On this right now.

367
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,150
- You missed your calling, boy.
- Yeah, Deak. I even bought it.

368
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,011
MAN: Make sure
you get Hale! Go!

369
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,760
PRITCHETT:
I'd like to remind you...

370
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:47,692
there's two attack helicopters
headed this way.

371
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:50,902
Not anymore.
They've just been recalled.

372
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:52,269
MAN: I'll check the perimeter.

373
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:54,039
That's where they're headed.
They're going over.

374
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,491
Get to work.

375
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,817
You see, Mr. Pritchett...

376
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,461
they believe they've got
an exposed core...

377
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,149
And that changes
things remarkably...

378
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:10,675
Because you can't send
people out...

379
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,266
to an active radiation area.
That wouldn't be right.

380
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:16,167
First, you have to
take a picture from a satellite.

381
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,705
That takes an hour and a half
to change orbit.

382
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,365
Then they send in a N.E.S.T.

383
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:23,362
That's a Nuclear
Emergency Search Team.

384
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:26,863
Closest one is
about 2 hours from here.

385
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:30,595
By the time they find us,
we'll be gone. So relax.

386
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:40,855
HALE: Can your radio
get a signal to McMurren?

387
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:42,435
I'll have Clyde
patch us through.

388
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:46,243
We can get your people in here.
Then I can go feed my dog.

389
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,778
Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

390
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:16,125
Hello? Clyde, this is Terry.
Do you read me?

391
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,282
Why the hell are they
shooting at us?

392
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,209
HALE: We don't have time
to discuss it right now.

393
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,627
Come on.

394
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:02,993
Let's have some fun.

395
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,666
Aah!

396
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:21,869
- You OK?
- Yeah.

397
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:22,837
Give me your gun.

398
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,556
Come on.

399
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:47,907
Come on.

400
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:56,368
- You have any more bullets?
- Yeah.

401
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:01,844
We need to get out
of this canyon.

402
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,724
We can get out
up that way.

403
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:08,259
Now, if I could get
that bastard to hold still.

404
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,571
- I have an idea.
- Wait. I didn't mean...

405
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:26,298
Oh, shit.

406
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,719
Don't shoot!

407
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:34,871
Where is he?

408
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:36,446
I don't know.

409
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,138
No.

410
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,939
Go!

411
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,077
PRITCHETT: Holy shit!

412
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,828
Novacek must have hit
a canyon wall.

413
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,972
- You think?
- Maybe.

414
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:35,109
Maybe?

415
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:38,679
You said you'd planned
this thing carefully.

416
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:41,220
How are we going to move
those things now?

417
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,582
DEAKINS: Use the trucks.

418
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,707
The trucks!
Now, you listen.

419
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:50,192
I've spent a lot of money
underwriting this,

420
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:53,937
and frankly, you're beginning
to shake my confidence!

421
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:03,480
Well... yeah.
Well, I, uh...

422
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:06,179
I do appreciate the money
that you and your associates...

423
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,229
have invested
in this operation, but, uh...

424
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,109
it is an operation.
It's a military operation,

425
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,885
and you don't know dick
about that.

426
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:16,140
I have been in the military
for 20 years.

427
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:19,017
I planned and flew
over 100 missions in the Gulf.

428
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:21,676
I put these boys together
because they are motivated...

429
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,552
and they are
highly trained, like me.

430
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:26,269
This is what I do,
and this is battle,

431
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:29,491
and battle is a highly
fluid situation.

432
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:32,190
You plan on your contingencies,
and I have.

433
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,909
You keep your initiative,
and I will.

434
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,101
But what you don't do
is share command.

435
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,604
It's never a good idea.

436
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,021
It's still my money.

437
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:44,672
And if we succeed,

438
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,587
you and your friends
will get a ton of it.

439
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,939
If we're successful?

440
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,247
Look, Mr. Pritchett,

441
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:52,355
I will deliver the weapons
to the destination,

442
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,236
but I can't depend
and I can't guarantee...

443
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,614
that those assholes
in Washington...

444
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:59,214
won't do something stupid
like not pay.

445
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,116
What if they don't?

446
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,706
Well, if they don't...

447
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,553
The Southwest will be
a quiet neighborhood

448
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:08,836
for about 10,000 years.

449
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,151
[Telephone rings]

450
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:18,094
Wilkins.

451
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:21,283
Fax me their last transmission.
How much radiation is tracking?

452
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,778
- Fax that to Mr. Prentice.
- Yes, sir.

453
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,572
So far, we're not
picking up any.

454
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,330
That's kind
of strange, isn't it?

455
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,552
I mean, with an exposed core?

456
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:34,483
The breach may not be
as bad as we thought.

457
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,859
Colonel... what if this
wasn't an accident?

458
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,803
What are you saying, Giles?

459
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,743
GILES: In his final transmission
before the crash,

460
00:38:57,695 --> 00:39:00,129
Major Deakins said
Captain Hale lost it.

461
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:02,223
We all assume that
to mean pilot error...

462
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,576
or equipment failure,
but what if he meant...

463
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,954
Hale intentionally
lost the plane?

464
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,156
But why would he do that?

465
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,624
Two nuclear weapons
would be worth a lot of money.

466
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:17,330
To who, son? There are easier
ways to buy nuclear weapons.

467
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,179
Go to one of the old
Soviet republics,

468
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,031
they'll fix you up with a couple
for the price of a BMW.

469
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:26,940
Sir... I meant, how much
would they be worth to us?

470
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:28,802
How much would we pay
to get them back?

471
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:30,160
Hold on.

472
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:36,443
These nukes have codes that
prevent people from using them.

473
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:37,810
Of course.

474
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:39,751
And no one knows
these codes, right,

475
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,670
except for the President
and you guys?

476
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,249
Access to the codes
requires the highest security.

477
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,014
Not even the pilots
have these codes, right?

478
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,168
MAN: Where is
that N.E.S.T. Team now?

479
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:51,083
They just took off, sir.

480
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,392
The E.T.A. In Utah
is 96 minutes.

481
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:01,710
- Correct 10, left.
- 10-4.

482
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:15,353
- It's OK.
- It's not OK!

483
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,976
I want to know
what's going on right now!

484
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:30,952
We were carrying nuclear weapons
on our plane last night.

485
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:36,462
My former commander
is trying to steal them.

486
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:41,980
- Oh, my God.
- That's why I need your help.

487
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:46,444
Without the helicopter,
he won't be able to move them.

488
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:50,008
Deak will have a backup plan.
He'll be prepared for that.

489
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,875
Trucks. He's got trucks.

490
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:58,721
Last night Clyde radioed me...

491
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:01,826
that someone came through
the Needles gate with trucks.

492
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,494
He won't take them towards town.
What else is around here?

493
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,946
The river.

494
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:20,202
[Coughing]

495
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:21,685
Do you mind?

496
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,095
No, I don't mind at all.

497
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:27,604
Care for one?

498
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:50,420
- The one in front has the nukes.
- How do you know?

499
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,766
There's only a driver.
They're keeping the weight down.

500
00:41:53,308 --> 00:41:56,141
- Give me your gun again.
- What are you going to do?

501
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:00,054
I'll think of something.

502
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:02,963
Wait. We know where they are.

503
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,369
Let's get to a phone
and call for help.

504
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:06,314
If they make it to the river,
I'll lose them again.

505
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:07,927
You get to the phone, OK?

506
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,780
- Then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

507
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:13,331
You're going to need help.

508
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:15,704
I don't have time
to argue with you, OK?

509
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,767
The nuclear weapons are
my responsibility, not yours.

510
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,018
You're a park ranger.
I'm a military officer.

511
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,324
Just go to the phone.

512
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:39,247
This is a bad idea.

513
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:48,630
Hi.

514
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:50,158
Hi.

515
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:53,885
Hale! Well, goddamn!

516
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:12,682
Run him down.

517
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,648
Get him!

518
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,367
Get him!

519
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:31,270
Fuck!

520
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,194
Don't panic.
Bulletproof glass.

521
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,661
You can get out now.

522
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:44,058
Looks like we got ourselves
a standoff.

523
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,080
- Aah!
- No... we... don't!

524
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,930
Go! Go!

525
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:02,735
OK... you can come.

526
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,302
Stay down!

527
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:17,046
Would you mind not shooting
at the thermonuclear weapons?

528
00:44:25,886 --> 00:44:28,047
Where's St. Jude's
hospital from here?

529
00:44:28,606 --> 00:44:30,301
Salt Lake City, I think.

530
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,896
- Shit!
- What?

531
00:44:41,852 --> 00:44:43,217
We're losing gas.

532
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:45,269
They must have hit the tank.

533
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:47,575
We need someplace
to hide these things.

534
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,618
I know a place.

535
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:57,122
Uh!

536
00:45:07,255 --> 00:45:09,246
What the fuck
are you up to, Hale?

537
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:19,963
Don't even.

538
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:26,544
Stop!

539
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,707
Aw, fuck!

540
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,039
You learn that
in survival school?

541
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:46,441
New Jersey.
Trenton, New Jersey.

542
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:18,587
What is this place?

543
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:21,284
It used to be a copper mine.

544
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,417
They shut it down
a couple years ago.

545
00:46:25,672 --> 00:46:27,731
Why would they have a new lock?

546
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:35,224
All right.

547
00:46:37,893 --> 00:46:40,885
Good move, Hale.
I didn't see it coming...

548
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:45,524
But you're going to pay for it.
Saddle up, boys.

549
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:22,913
This place has been prepped.
Deak's been here.

550
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,838
What? You think
he's coming back?

551
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:30,112
That would be my guess.
May not have a lot of time.

552
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:32,531
What are we going to do?

553
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:41,588
We'll just take away
his reason for being here.

554
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:44,448
Want to help me
unload these things?

555
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:53,041
Where do you think
they're going?

556
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:55,676
Same place we were...
the only thing on this road.

557
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:08,073
My God.

558
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,281
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

559
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,477
When you fly
with nuclear weapons,

560
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:20,417
you're trained
to retrieve if possible,

561
00:48:20,368 --> 00:48:23,735
disable if necessary,
and destroy if essential.

562
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:25,190
And what are we doing?

563
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:29,252
I'm going to disable it.

564
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:33,065
You have to arm
these things with a code.

565
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:36,169
If you enter the wrong code
3 times, the nuke goes dead.

566
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:38,705
All the circuitry
shuts down and shorts out.

567
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:41,757
Pretty soon
these things will be...

568
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:43,643
nothing more
than paperweights.

569
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:45,526
[Beeping]

570
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:52,003
Hale, pick up.

571
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:54,240
Pick up!

572
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:58,153
Come on, buddy.
Pick up the phone.

573
00:48:58,058 --> 00:49:00,652
Buddy, huh?
Son of a bitch.

574
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:03,521
You tried to kill me.
The friendship is over.

575
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:05,458
That doesn't mean
I don't like you.

576
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:07,045
Hell, I'm impressed.

577
00:49:07,017 --> 00:49:10,350
I figured you'd have packed up
and walked off by now.

578
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,910
You figured wrong.
Now I got the nukes.

579
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,638
Guess what, Deak.
I'm going to deactivate them.

580
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,049
[Beeping]

581
00:49:17,032 --> 00:49:18,090
You hear that?

582
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:19,611
That's me punching
the wrong codes.

583
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,252
Pretty soon these things
will be absolutely useless.

584
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:24,150
Might as well turn around
and drive away.

585
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:27,162
Outstanding, Hale.
That's the spirit.

586
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,204
Damn. I'm totally screwed now.

587
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,590
[Beeping continues]

588
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:33,033
Unless I thought of that
ahead of time.

589
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,344
What?

590
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:41,811
You're kidding.

591
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:47,735
Didn't work, did it?
I used uncoded circuit boards.

592
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,851
You just activated
a nuclear warhead, my friend.

593
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:54,875
Setting off a nuke in this mine
has been my plan from day one.

594
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,307
Otherwise, some D.C. Civilian...

595
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,722
might say
I haven't got the guts.

596
00:50:00,927 --> 00:50:02,292
Fuck!

597
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:06,315
He's insane.

598
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,228
I considered bringing you in.
You know why I didn't?

599
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:13,875
- Because I would have said no?
- Nah. I'd have just killed you.

600
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:16,554
I was afraid you'd say yes...

601
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,137
because you don't have the balls
to go through with this.

602
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:20,500
We both know that.

603
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,635
How deep is this mine?

604
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:28,324
Uh... about 2,000 feet.

605
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:31,427
That's plenty.

606
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,816
I'm going to be there
in a few minutes.

607
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:35,720
Get out of there
as soon as you can.

608
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:37,663
It's your last move, buddy.

609
00:50:37,623 --> 00:50:40,023
I can think of another move.

610
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:42,792
I'll keep these together.
If one goes off,

611
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,645
the other gets buried
under a billion tons of rock.

612
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:48,082
How does that sound?

613
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:50,217
You wouldn't
do something like that.

614
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:52,861
You sure about that... buddy?

615
00:50:53,652 --> 00:50:56,086
Shit! Fuck!
He's going to do it.

616
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,077
Let's get him.

617
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:59,771
We've got to be gone
before he gets here.

618
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:00,687
[Grunting]

619
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,697
I can't do this.

620
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,618
Listen, you told me
this is a copper mine, right?

621
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,155
- Right?
- Right.

622
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:18,395
The blast will fuse this place
into one big solid copper pot.

623
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:20,690
- But they're coming!
- That's right.

624
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:23,751
If I don't get these to a safe
level before they get here,

625
00:51:23,662 --> 00:51:25,630
God knows where he'll use them.

626
00:51:36,524 --> 00:51:38,515
Just keep an eye
on the timer, OK?

627
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:54,714
All right.

628
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:32,219
[Faint rumbling]

629
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:40,471
What is that noise?

630
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:45,857
Water. There's an underground
river beneath this place.

631
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:47,750
Let's get these things unloaded.

632
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:13,003
[Elevator running]

633
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:16,798
I understand, sir.

634
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,921
I'll advise N.E.S.T.
Of the situation.

635
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:22,068
As soon as the ground is clean,
I'll send in a dozen gunships.

636
00:53:21,975 --> 00:53:23,943
We'll secure the whole area.

637
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:25,385
Yes, sir.

638
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:30,898
- Giles Prentice, sir.
- Wilkins.

639
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:33,363
- Good to meet you finally.
- Likewise, sir.

640
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:35,792
That was the chairman,
Mr. Prentice.

641
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:39,100
According to an N.S.A.
Radio intercept, you were right,

642
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:42,557
but it's Deakins
stealing the nukes, not Hale.

643
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:50,922
[Beeping]

644
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,547
TERRY: Now what?

645
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:03,714
We get out of here
before he shows up.

646
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,640
How many times
do I have to say it?

647
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:26,359
Please don't shoot
the nuclear weapons.

648
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:33,278
[Beeping continues]

649
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:10,854
Kelly, we found the nuke.

650
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:12,913
We're at the end of tunnel "A."

651
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:15,357
Put the cold one on the
elevator, and we'll be along.

652
00:55:23,072 --> 00:55:24,801
A service tunnel.
Come on.

653
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,567
Make sure Hale
doesn't get back to the bomb.

654
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:32,494
And, Johnson,
the clock is ticking.

655
00:55:57,881 --> 00:56:00,850
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the elevator.

656
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:03,662
These service tunnels
run between the main shafts.

657
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:06,203
Now... if we take
the next right...

658
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,191
Aah!

659
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,307
Hey, Hale.
Nice move with the nukes.

660
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,917
Shows initiative, determination.
Proud of you!

661
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:30,138
But I think I gave us
too much time.

662
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:32,533
30 whole minutes...
I don't know.

663
00:56:32,466 --> 00:56:35,230
Shows a lack of total
commitment, don't you think?

664
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,019
So I took it down to 13.

665
00:56:41,104 --> 00:56:42,503
I'll be right back.

666
00:57:33,094 --> 00:57:34,493
[Gunfire]

667
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:37,891
Bitch!

668
00:57:58,177 --> 00:58:00,668
- All set.
- We'll be right along.

669
00:58:54,774 --> 00:58:56,469
Are you OK?

670
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:15,058
DEAKINS: Well, I got to go.

671
00:59:14,995 --> 00:59:17,361
You two have a nice time
down here.

672
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:22,458
And don't forget to say hi
to Johnson for me...

673
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:24,183
when you see him.

674
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,636
HALE: 20 bucks says
you're going to see him first.

675
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:29,855
- Really?
- Yeah.

676
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:32,834
You're going to ransom
Salt Lake City, aren't you?

677
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:34,480
Why do you say that?

678
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:35,937
St. Jude's hospital.

679
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:38,319
You'll hide the warheads
in radiology...

680
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:40,949
so they don't show up
on satellite scans, right?

681
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,845
Huh. Well, I'm impressed.

682
00:59:43,437 --> 00:59:46,929
Thank you.
So, how much you ask for?

683
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:49,296
Lots. I got a broker
in Stockholm...

684
00:59:49,228 --> 00:59:51,924
that's going to buy me
5% of Volvo.

685
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:54,820
For the rest of my years,
I'll live off the dividends,

686
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,756
happy in the knowledge
that I'm helping to make...

687
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:01,166
the safest automobiles
in the world.

688
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:04,159
HALE: So that's what this
is all about? Money?

689
01:00:04,072 --> 01:00:06,666
- Yeah.
- Bullshit.

690
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,727
DEAKINS: You tell me why.
Go ahead.

691
01:00:10,312 --> 01:00:11,973
You tell me why.

692
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:14,605
Because you've been passed over
for promotion so many times,

693
01:00:14,535 --> 01:00:16,765
you want to show the bastards
you're right.

694
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,645
Maybe it's because
everybody's cashing out,

695
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:21,150
so why the hell not you?

696
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:24,755
Maybe your mother dropped you on
your head when you were a baby.

697
01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:26,078
Who the hell cares?

698
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,713
There's no difference
between you...

699
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:29,744
and a guy who
shoots up a schoolyard.

700
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,931
You both got a head
full of bad wiring.

701
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:35,464
- What was that?
- You're fucked in the head!

702
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:38,591
Ha!

703
01:00:39,745 --> 01:00:41,303
I pissed him off.

704
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:53,868
Uh, uh... it's this way.

705
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:07,689
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell's the other one?

706
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,707
Shut up.

707
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,615
Help us. Come on.

708
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:34,593
Aah...

709
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:37,076
PRITCHETT: What
a Mongolian clusterfuck.

710
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:39,483
Get the goddamn thing in.
Let's get out of here.

711
01:01:42,134 --> 01:01:44,102
HALE: That was the only way out.

712
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:47,816
Oh, man.

713
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:51,201
That's it, then, isn't it?

714
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,884
You have any family?

715
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,911
No. Just me and Fred.

716
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,988
Fred. Uh, who's Fred?
Your boyfriend?

717
01:02:20,878 --> 01:02:22,277
No. My dog.

718
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,358
The river.

719
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,672
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

720
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:33,981
They hit it digging a tunnel.

721
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:35,929
That's why they shut down
the mine.

722
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:38,084
Come on.

723
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,085
Hang on.
Four minutes to detonation.

724
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:03,545
You stupid bastard!
We'll all be killed!

725
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:04,895
We'll be fine, Mr. Pritchett.

726
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:08,464
Please keep your voice down.
I'm trying to concentrate.

727
01:03:12,803 --> 01:03:14,168
This should be it.

728
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,068
That seam doesn't go anywhere.

729
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,504
Oh...

730
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:50,642
One o'clock. On the road.

731
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:11,186
MAN: Attention.
We are federal agents.

732
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:13,595
Stop your vehicle immediately.

733
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:16,155
Oh, God! Oh, God!

734
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:19,647
How does that gunship
fit into your grand strategy?

735
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:21,601
You don't know
what you're doing!

736
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:24,584
This is out of control!
I must have been...

737
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:26,474
[Gagging]

738
01:04:27,828 --> 01:04:29,921
Hush. Hush.

739
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:31,741
MAN: Stop your vehicle.

740
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:34,224
I repeat,
stop your vehicle immediately.

741
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,087
[Both take deep breath]

742
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:45,900
We'll get in front of him.

743
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:55,184
Do not move,
or you will be fired upon.

744
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,932
Ah-ah!

745
01:04:57,903 --> 01:04:59,461
We are federal agents.

746
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:02,999
Throw down your weapons
and keep your hands in sight.

747
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:26,942
I just realized something.

748
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:29,151
I never actually
killed anyone before.

749
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:33,032
I mean... I dropped
bombs on Baghdad,

750
01:05:32,904 --> 01:05:35,464
but never face-to-face.

751
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:38,870
I don't know
what the big deal is.

752
01:05:38,821 --> 01:05:39,981
I really don't.

753
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:46,156
Turn your electronic equipment
off now.

754
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:47,484
Throw down your weapons.

755
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:04,398
[Rumbling]

756
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:27,319
[All talking at once]

757
01:06:29,404 --> 01:06:32,430
- We're losing power!
- Oh, my God!

758
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,613
Control, people. Control.

759
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,590
We've gone red!
Trip the relays!

760
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:48,950
Aah...

761
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:00,099
I said, goddamn,
what a rush!

762
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:04,725
Whoo!

763
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,317
Son of a bitch!

764
01:07:06,294 --> 01:07:08,387
Shock wave took down
the damn chopper.

765
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,740
That's E.M. P...
electromagnetic pulse.

766
01:07:10,677 --> 01:07:12,645
Nuclear blast
sends it out for miles.

767
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:14,359
Everything electronic
shuts down,

768
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:16,554
including choppers
and radios.

769
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:19,559
Hell, we just shut down
McMurren's field communications.

770
01:07:19,475 --> 01:07:22,273
That will put a dent
in their response time, huh?

771
01:07:22,194 --> 01:07:25,357
- Deak, you the man!
- I'm the man!

772
01:07:25,265 --> 01:07:27,961
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

773
01:07:27,889 --> 01:07:29,652
We're fine. It was underground.

774
01:07:29,616 --> 01:07:31,345
Colonel Wilkins
to General Creely.

775
01:07:31,312 --> 01:07:32,939
How do you know?

776
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:34,903
If it had been
a surface detonation,

777
01:07:34,863 --> 01:07:37,058
we'd have felt a different kind
of ground tremor.

778
01:07:37,008 --> 01:07:39,135
We'd also be burned,
blind, and dying.

779
01:07:43,054 --> 01:07:44,248
We're 10 minutes behind.

780
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:47,401
Mr. Pritchett, would you mind
stepping outside?

781
01:07:58,923 --> 01:08:00,720
It went off underground,
thank God.

782
01:08:00,682 --> 01:08:01,979
What do we do now?

783
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:06,385
First, we nail a huge
goddamn lid on this thing.

784
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,512
And with all due respect
to your boy Giles...

785
01:08:08,457 --> 01:08:12,325
and his belief that honesty
is the best policy,

786
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,862
from now until
the end of the world,

787
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:18,626
what happened in Utah today
was an earthquake.

788
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,744
Hey, it's OK.

789
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:56,588
My God.
We set off a nuclear bomb.

790
01:08:56,543 --> 01:08:58,067
The walls shielded the blast.

791
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,982
None of the radiation
leaked out.

792
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,926
- We're all right.
- Look at my hands.

793
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:05,015
- Why are they shaking like that?
- Because the water was freezing.

794
01:09:04,926 --> 01:09:07,724
- That's not normal.
- No, it's OK.

795
01:09:07,646 --> 01:09:11,138
We're just cold.
Just need to get warm.

796
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:12,938
OK? All right?

797
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:19,856
Hey, look.
See the butterflies there?

798
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,036
If there was radiation,
they wouldn't survive.

799
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:24,675
Now, would they? No.

800
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:29,486
All right?

801
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,127
I guess not.

802
01:09:34,456 --> 01:09:37,425
It says so
in the detonation manual,

803
01:09:37,336 --> 01:09:40,396
that if you see butterflies
after detonation,

804
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:43,109
you're going to be fine. OK?

805
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:47,819
It doesn't say that.

806
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:50,913
I promise you, though,
we're fine.

807
01:09:56,564 --> 01:09:59,226
How far downriver
does this path go?

808
01:09:59,156 --> 01:10:00,953
Three or four miles.

809
01:10:00,915 --> 01:10:03,907
We should get to Deakins
before he gets out of here.

810
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:19,532
Wait.

811
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,478
Looks like there's
just two of them.

812
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:31,519
There's more coming.

but he's dead, so let's go.

- Steal it.

- They're coming.

Well, your friends
in Washington...

820
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:31,600

the package now.

821
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:36,205
Yep. I'm sure we got their full
and complete attention.

At 1401, I will make a call.

If you have complied,
I will stop the timer.

know where the device is headed.

If Deakins had a plane waiting,
it could be anywhere.

- I do.

This is Colonel Jamison.
They've found Captain Hale.

They found the raft
on the other side of the lake.

- What about her?

847
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:34,829
What about her?
She's an innocent victim.

848
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:36,202
I got her involved.

You're going to hit that truck
with everything you've got.

I don't want her
becoming a casualty.

Maybe giving her up
is OK with you,

852

but we're military officers.

to save that woman's life...

to follow orders...

Do you understand
what orders are, captain?

859
01:15:57,837 --> 01:16:00,931
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Good.

860
01:16:06,764 --> 01:16:08,459
Because I'm about to break them.

861
01:16:12,394 --> 01:16:15,659
- Any argument, Mr. Prentice?
- No, sir.

862
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:20,281
Just for the record,
I'm not entirely a civilian.

863
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:24,661
I was actually a lieutenant
in the R.O.T.C. At Yale.

Good for you, lieutenant.

865
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:35,862
- Is the radio still down?
- Afraid so.

866
01:16:35,814 --> 01:16:38,180
Your chopper will be
refueled in two minutes.

867
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:40,812
I wish I were going with you.

868
01:16:40,774 --> 01:16:43,538
Captain, what exactly
are you looking for?

869
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,224
- Tracks.
- As in railroad tracks?

870
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:48,639
Yeah. Deak knows you're covering
every inch of asphalt.

871
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:51,104
I'll bet 20 bucks
that nuke isn't on a truck.

872
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:54,570
- It's on a train.
- Let me see the map.

873
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,195
Salt Lake is northwest of here.

874
01:16:56,162 --> 01:16:57,857
These tracks curve east
before Salt Lake.

875
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,190
Why would he do that?

876
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't think he's going
to Salt Lake.

877
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,896
But that's where
the closest hospital is.

878
01:17:04,865 --> 01:17:06,594
You found the radiology tag.

879
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:08,789
That's what's bothering me.
I think he planted it...

880
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:11,864
to make the person that found it
think that's where he's heading.

881
01:17:13,054 --> 01:17:15,579
- He's doing a rope-a-dope.
- He's doing a what?

882
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:20,286
Rope-a-dope. It's a boxing term.
Ali and Foreman in Zaire.

883
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:22,285
I know what the rope-a-dope is.
What's your point?

884
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,729
My point is that everything he
shows us says he's heading west.

885
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:27,221
He's actually heading east.

886
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:30,014
Denver.

887
01:17:32,187 --> 01:17:35,179
You said you had Salt Lake
sealed up pretty tight.

888
01:17:35,098 --> 01:17:37,658
What's it going to hurt
if we check out Denver?

889
01:17:55,735 --> 01:17:58,863
DEAKINS: Shepherd!
Any trouble with the train crew?

890
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,742
SHEPHERD: Not a bit.
They went like lambs.

891
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:03,821
Good for them. Let's get
that satellite dish wired in.

892
01:18:03,733 --> 01:18:05,792
- Already done.
- Excellent.

893
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,876
With this remote, you can shut
the bomb down face-to-face...

894
01:18:08,788 --> 01:18:11,120
or dial it in over the link.

895
01:18:11,059 --> 01:18:12,890
All right.
Let's close this deal.

896
01:18:12,851 --> 01:18:14,819
I want to be airborne
in five minutes...

897
01:18:14,771 --> 01:18:16,466
en route to the mountains.

898
01:18:16,435 --> 01:18:19,131
Contact Washington. Tell them
the bomb's on its way to Denver.

899
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:20,389
Then contact Geneva.

900
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:23,032
When the money's in place,
I'll shut down that puppy.

901
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:26,178
Smile, boys.
We're about to retire.

902
01:18:26,129 --> 01:18:28,222
Let's get this bird unwrapped.

903
01:18:58,953 --> 01:18:59,977
Uhh!

904
01:19:01,802 --> 01:19:03,736
We haven't met.
I'm Max.

905
01:19:09,256 --> 01:19:10,587
Uhh!

906
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:15,627
You probably thought
I was a computer nerd.

907
01:19:15,558 --> 01:19:17,890
Ha ha ha! Wrong.

908
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,661
I was a Navy S.E.A.L., lady.

909
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:23,114
You should see what I can do
with just my thumb.

910
01:20:15,323 --> 01:20:18,781
You just saved me $3 million.
I owe you one.

911
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,480
Shoot yourself.
We'll call it square.

912
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:22,205
Whoa. Attitude.

913
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:28,022
Now, where's
my little buddy Hale?

914
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:30,127
He left you alone, didn't he?

915
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:33,882
Oh, that's his speed...
100% pussy.

916
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,643
He's got more guts
than you think.

917
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,138
But would he have enough guts
to eat a bullet...

918
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,698
before he'd help someone
vaporize a whole city?

919
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:47,996
I think he'd fold, but not you.

920
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:50,259
I think you've got
more guts than he does.

921
01:20:50,196 --> 01:20:52,892
I think you'd eat a bullet.

922
01:20:58,003 --> 01:20:59,265
Let's find out.

923
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:03,561
Now, press four.

924
01:21:04,433 --> 01:21:05,525
Ooh.

925
01:21:10,384 --> 01:21:12,614
Ahh, I said push four.

926
01:21:16,143 --> 01:21:17,610
Go ahead.

927
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:19,017
Push four.

928
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:26,311
Ahh.

929
01:21:27,502 --> 01:21:28,526
Four.

930
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:31,829
Eight.

931
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,048
Seven.

932
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,026
Go ahead.

933
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:39,986
Please.

934
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,241
Seven.

935
01:21:45,641 --> 01:21:47,199
Starting at ground zero...

936
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:48,974
and moving out
in concentric circles,

937
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:50,996
we have, in terms
of immediate effect,

938
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:55,013
100% fatalities to 30 miles,
90% at 40 miles,

939
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:58,186
dropping roughly 10%
for every 10 miles after that.

940
01:21:58,759 --> 01:21:59,783
Two.

941
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:03,403
One.

942
01:22:06,598 --> 01:22:07,860
Enter.

943
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:11,453
Enter.

944
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:18,294
We estimate...
250,000 dead on impact...

945
01:22:18,116 --> 01:22:20,812
and another quarter-million
projected within the year.

946
01:22:25,569 --> 01:22:26,558
Enter.

947
01:22:27,714 --> 01:22:30,410
Come on. Just push "enter,"
and it's done.

948
01:22:33,472 --> 01:22:35,531
Which is it going to be, hmm?

949
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:40,680
Ahh. Hmm.

950
01:22:42,047 --> 01:22:45,448
To tell the truth, I thought
you were going to fold.

951
01:22:46,398 --> 01:22:48,229
Well, I'm dead either way.

952
01:22:49,149 --> 01:22:51,344
So do it yourself, asshole.

953
01:22:54,108 --> 01:22:55,439

Bring it in.

958
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:19,200
Give me your hand.

959
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:33,433
OK... you can come.

960

- That was a first for me, too.

We're never going
to get clear in time.

We need to shut down the nuke.
You hear me?

984

- You need to disarm it.
- Find Hale.

can't make it to the city.

and uncouple the car.
