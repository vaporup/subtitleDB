1
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:08,845
The enemy is very cunning.

2
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,713
Where are Prince Aya
and Princess Kaurwaki?

3
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:29,937
Burn this village, burn everything...

4
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,674
either they'll come out or burn alive.

5
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:36,667
Where are Prince Aya
and Princess Kaurwaki?

6
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:56,297
No. Stop.

7
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:59,767
Stop, we are here.

8
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:03,760
Please let them be, I beg you.

9
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,413
Kaurwaki.

10
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:45,802
Good that I found you.
That woman, she said...

11
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,909
Where are Kaurwaki and Aya?

12
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,156
Bheema?

13
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:59,149
Where is Kaurwaki?

14
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,432
What happened, Bheema?

15
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:08,425
Where is Kaurwaki?

16
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:14,064
Bheema, where is Kaurwaki?

17
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:21,138
Bheema... I ask you,
Where is Kaurwaki?

18
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:41,211
Here's your 20th tactic.

19
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:00,230
What about the 19th one?

20
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,935
Speak up, friend. Your turn now.
No running off today? You've lost?

21
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:12,242
Get up.

22
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:16,579
You're not even worth a thrashing.

23
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:26,690
What's this? Lost your mind?

24
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:31,105
Let go of my hand. Let go.

25
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,574
Who are you people?

26
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:37,567
Let me go.

27
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:46,176
Wait.

28
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:58,154
- But Prince Asoka, he tried to...
- Spare him.

29
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:05,295
'Prince' Asoka?

30
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,804
- You'll stay here.
- Pawan is waiting for me.

31
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,785
His kind never return.

32
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:21,778
He will, Bheema. His horse is here.

33
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:33,056
How is the wound now, friend...
Prince?

34
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:37,727
Prince, my problem is that my fist
moves faster than my mind.

35
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:40,808
Why haven't you left?

36
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,710
How could I?

37
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,703
You saved my life.
It's my duty to guard you for life.

38
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:52,275
From now, in war and victory,
Virat will stand by you.

39
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:57,847
I want death not victory.

40
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:05,789
Was she beautiful, Prince?

41
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:13,374
Very.

42
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:17,367
- Are you going to Pawan?
- Yes.

43
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,781
I will come too.

44
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:23,451
You will not.
You will go to Kalinga with Bheema.

45
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,121
If I don't go, you don't either.
Should I call Bheema?

46
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:30,391
Call him.

47
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,359
Come on.

48
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:36,297
Lets take Pawan's horse with us too.

49
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:40,290
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

50
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:52,268
Asoka's winning war after war.
He seems undaunted by death.

51
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,474
Each victory is a step closer
to the throne.

52
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:02,178
You must stop him at Ujjaini itself.

53
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:44,787
Friend.

54
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:27,297
Do you know any Pawan? A soldier
in the Magadha Army, rides a horse.

55
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:32,535
No.

56
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,362
Let's go. It's raining.

57
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:52,355
Come.

58
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:02,465
No herb or medicine is helping him.

59
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:09,339
How does one save the life of a man
who has no desire to live?

60
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:17,480
Kaur... waki, Kaur... waki.

61
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:26,756
'Kaurwaki'?

62
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,872
- Prime Minister, where is Asoka?
- I don't know.

63
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:35,376
You don't?
Or are you hiding something?

64
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:39,046
Why all this loyalty to Asoka?

65
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:43,039
My loyalty is to the throne of Magadha.

66
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:51,925
Prince Asoka is getting better, isn't he?

67
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:55,918
Physical wounds will heal.
But wounds of the heart...

68
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,023
Haven't you seen how he calls out
her name even in his sleep?

69
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,861
Kaurwaki, Kaurwaki, Kaurwaki.

70
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,375
Are you crying?

71
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:12,368
You see, my heart is rather tender.

72
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:16,517
- Kaurwaki was very lovely?
- Yes.

73
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:20,510
But you are too. You too.
And you, most of all.

74
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:31,321
What kind of love is this
that lives on even after death?

75
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:38,328
When you left you did not look
back even once.

76
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:55,055
A bright glow

77
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:58,459
pervades

78
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,495
and fills

79
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:05,366
your eyes

80
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:08,135
Your eyes warn...

81
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:12,128
"Don't touch me"

82
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:29,078
Your dreams too...

83
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,396
are reflected

84
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:39,389
in your eyes

85
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:02,423
I've searched and searched for you...

86
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:05,592
In the sweep of the skies above

87
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:09,585
hoping to find you encased in a cloud

88
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:19,239
I have looked and looked for you

89
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,509
in every nook and corner

90
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,502
hoping to spy you walking
on a river bank

91
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:28,108
I held on to time

92
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:31,311
To ask where you are

93
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:34,781
I asked the river

94
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:38,774
and the vast ocean

95
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:45,548
I walked the crest of waves

96
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:52,255
feeling your caress

97
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:49,745
Stop. What are you doing?

98
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:54,695
I won't let you kill this harmless bird.

99
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,196
Move away.

100
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:59,700
Why?
It deserves to live as much as I do.

101
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,693
- Move!
- Release the arrow.

102
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:29,663
Devi...

103
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:33,656
Where were you, Devi?
The ceremony awaits you.

104
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,672
Come, dear, come here.

105
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:42,665
She's exquisite.

106
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:48,704
They make a lovely couple.

107
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,391
I met Prince Asoka today...

108
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:01,294
She's so shy.
She's quite spirited though.

109
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:02,896
He's become so vicious.

110
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,465
Everyoneâ€™s scared of him but not me.

111
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,735
Why whisper? Tell us too.
What do you think of our son?

112
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:12,406
Tell me, dear. Are you happy?

113
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:16,399
Congratulations, she has agreed.

114
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:23,339
- Asoka's in Ujjaini, badly wounded.
- Take advantage of this, Sugatra.

115
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,843
How? He is guarded on all sides.
It's impossible to break through.

116
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:33,215
Difficult but not impossible.

117
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,870
Here, take this medicine.

118
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,374
With this your fever will lessen
and you'll sleep well.

119
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:49,710
It's Devi's wedding today.
She won't be here.

120
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,703
Today, you will listen to me instead.
Drink it?

121
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:58,808
A little more?

122
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,031
I forgot to apply the herbal paste
on Prince Asoka's wounds.

123
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:15,024
Grandmother, I'll be back soon.

124
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,243
Make something for me as well.

125
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:24,745
Halt.

126
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:28,738
- What are you taking inside?
- Medicine.

127
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:32,975
Go in.

128
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,012
Pass me some water, please.

129
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:47,957
Who's there? Wait.
What are you feeding him?

130
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,062
Let go.

131
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:15,251
Friend?

132
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,534
Prince Asoka? Here?

133
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,593
How did this happen?

134
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,295
Come on let's go.

135
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:52,288
This wedding cannot be.

136
00:20:57,003 --> 00:21:00,841
Where are you going?
Please don't go.

137
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:03,643
It's no fault of this child.

138
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:07,636
You've no right
to ruin her life like this.

139
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:12,508
I will not let you leave.

140
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,113
I request you to please wait.

141
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:22,918
If the Prince's request is a command,
we will not leave.

142
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:35,965
Poor Devi.
Who will marry her now?

143
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:08,524
You won't push me again,
will you?

144
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:13,495
My warrior.

145
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:28,177
Did she love you
as much as you love her?

146
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:34,650
I know that only Kaurwaki
lives in your heart.

147
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,723
I cannot take her place.

148
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:45,238
Please forgive me, Devi.

149
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:49,231
Why? There's so much love
in your heart. Maybe my destiny...

150
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:59,274
No. It's not love, only pain.

151
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:04,179
Love wounds in a way
that does not let you live or die.

152
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,823
If I had seen her just one last time.

153
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:21,741
Kaurwaki is right here with you,
in your heart.

154
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:25,734
But where was I
when she needed me?

155
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,747
I promised her...

156
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:31,151
that while I was there
she would come to no harm.

157
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:35,144
Where was I, Devi?

158
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:39,648
Where was I when she was dying?

159
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:44,620
Where, when she took Pawan's name
in her parting breath?

160
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:20,166
The intoxication
of our night together

161
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:24,159
Has not left me

162
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:37,806
The sensuousness of your body
is still entwined in my arms

163
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:43,345
I opened my eyes
but that didn't disturb my dream

164
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:47,827
Yes. I recall

165
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:50,730
Yes. I do

166
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,723
The dream which your lips gifted
me stays with each breath I take

167
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:32,605
Even in your absence

168
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:35,575
The thought of you excites me

169
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:39,568
When I turn over in my sleep
my dream just takes another hue

170
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,249
When the thought of you
enters my mind

171
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:47,242
those moments bubble
under a sheet of water

172
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,724
My body is on fire

173
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:54,394
Yes. I recall

174
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:58,387
Yes. I do...

175
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,878
The seasons that bind
you to me are countless

176
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:01,060
They contain promise
of several lifetimes

177
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,730
My sorrows are trivial

178
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,723
I wish for a long night
and a longer day

179
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:13,061
I wish for a life endless
enough to contain our togetherness

180
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,767
Yes, I recall
Yes, I do

181
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:24,339
The dream your lips have gifted
me lingers with each breath I take.

182
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:09,796
I am looking for Pawan,
a soldier in the Magadha Army.

183
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:12,465
Pawan? We don't know.

184
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:16,458
Ask her, she knows everything.

185
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:24,466
I too waited for a long time
for him but he never came back.

186
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:30,116
What kind of people are these?

187
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:31,884
Come on, let's go.

188
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:35,877
As per your wish, your highness.
We have served food to all.

189
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:43,496
Eat well, such a feast is rare.

190
00:29:43,496 --> 00:29:47,489
Mother, look. She is Devi, the girl
that Prince Asoka has married.

191
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:57,766
Please serve to those there
and those too.

192
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:03,405
Have you heard? Prince Asoka
is returning to Magadha with Devi.

193
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:12,492
The stars predict tension
in their marriage.

194
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:15,161
You and your stars. They're married
so what tension could there be?

195
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,163
Here, eat sweetmeats.

196
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:21,156
- Why are you distributing sweets?
- His wife gave birth to a son.

197
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:25,560
But you have not been
home for more than a year, right?

198
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:29,609
- We were his emissaries in love.
- But...

199
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:33,602
No buts... give your sweets and go.

200
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:42,644
Long live Prince Asoka.

201
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:54,934
You're here to see
Prince Asoka as well?

202
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:58,927
No, I am looking for Pawan.

203
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:14,042
Look who's coming.

204
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:24,920
Let's go from here. Come Aya.

205
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:30,225
- I will not go.
- Enough of this madness.

206
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:34,496
- You have looked for him enough.
- I will not leave without Pawan.

207
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,503
Do as you please.
Look for your Pawan.

208
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:46,274
When you're done, return to Kalinga.
Prince Aya. Let's go.

209
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,889
I don't want to go.

210
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,882
Bheema, let go.

211
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:33,255
He acted as he thought appropriate.
Give him my blessings.

212
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:41,741
Your Majesty, at least meet him once.

213
00:32:41,741 --> 00:32:45,734
There is no place for a Buddhist girl
in this family.

214
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:52,274
Tell Asoka to return to Ujjaini.

215
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:16,665
General. We feared that even you...

216
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,250
General, I promise you...

217
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,243
Whoever conspired to kill Prince Aya...

218
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:32,191
will be severely punished.

219
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:36,184
No need of that. Prince Aya
and Princess Kaurwaki are alive.

220
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,999
Impossible.

221
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:43,992
Aya...

222
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:52,345
This is not possible.

223
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:55,781
You have lost, Prime Minister.
Your conspiracy misfired.

224
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:59,774
A lie. I have served Kalinga all my life.

225
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:04,156
I am innocent.

226
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:08,149
Forgive me, Minister.
They've come to know.

227
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:12,988
Take him away.

228
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,401
Such a traitor should be sentenced
to death.

229
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:19,394
- Take him away.
- I am innocent.

230
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:43,229
Didn't I promise you that
we will be together in Kalinga?

231
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:47,222
Yes, only Pawan is not with us.

232
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:51,103
How much longer will you wait for him?

233
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:54,440
Till his return.

234
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,110
If he doesn't?

235
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,103
That could be.
But I'll still wait for him.

236
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:11,179
You knew I would not spare your life.

237
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,896
Even then, you joined hands
with Susima?

238
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:20,889
What's your life worth now?
Answer me?

239
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:32,311
What is it?

240
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:33,913
I must tell you something.

241
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:36,716
Go on.

242
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:40,709
Calm down first.

243
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:53,455
What is it?

244
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:58,270
What is it?

245
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,263
What is it?

246
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,473
A son? My son?

247
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:18,958
I will teach him everything.

248
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,951
Everything.

249
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:26,365
I will teach him to fight
with the sword.

250
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:30,358
I will teach him
to fight like a warrior.

251
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:32,872
My son.

252
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,974
The first heir to the Mauyan empire.

253
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:38,967
The Emperor of Magadha.

254
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:42,948
I will take him in my arms
and put him on the throne.

255
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:46,952
What if it is a daughter?

256
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:50,945
No. It will be a son.

257
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,852
Go and tell Susima, it will be a son,
the emperor of Magadha.

258
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:32,554
Wasn't it your dream
that I sit on the throne?

259
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:36,925
I give you my word
I will strive to be an able King.

260
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:42,997
You will be proud of your Susima.

261
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:46,412
Devi is expecting.

262
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:50,405
Susima, the word is out
that an heir is to be born.

263
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,311
- Asoka's son will occupy the throne.
- The people will never accept him.

264
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:01,026
- Am I right, pundit-ji?
- That's right.

265
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:05,019
A son born of a Buddhist mother
cannot claim the throne.

266
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:08,934
The people have no choice, Susima.

267
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:12,927
And you? You're incapable
of producing an heir.

268
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,333
It's destiny.

269
00:38:20,312 --> 00:38:24,305
You tell me, Pundit-ji.
What fate awaits Asoka's child?

270
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:30,511
Think before you answer, pundit-ji.
What fate awaits Asoka's child?

271
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:37,518
Asoka's son will not live.

272
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:44,025
Destiny. It's all destiny.

273
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:23,631
Who is there?

274
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:42,417
There is someone here. Soldier.

275
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:24,770
- Everybody leave.
- Friend?

276
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,572
I said, everyone leave.

277
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,173
Leave.

278
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:32,166
Come.

279
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:38,606
Speak to me, Mother.

280
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:46,414
Please, Mother. Talk to me.

281
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,557
I did all that you asked me to.
Please, Mother, talk to me once.

282
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,673
Speak to me just once,
for just one moment.

283
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:19,614
If something happens to you,
all hell will break loose.

284
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:23,785
I will destroy everything.
Everything.

285
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,223
Vitasoka, tell Mother to talk to me.

286
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,803
Please, speak to me.

287
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:20,908
- Please don't.
- Don't stop me today.

288
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,522
Somebody has to stop.

289
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:27,515
- Anger destroys everything.
- Then let it.

290
00:42:29,595 --> 00:42:33,588
I will never let you touch my child
with a killer's hands.

291
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:13,961
So, you've come to kill your brother?

292
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:21,980
Kill me.

293
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,649
Pick up the sword, Susima.

294
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:27,642
What about your mother's death?
Take your revenge, Asoka.

295
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,291
Why hesitate? Go ahead, kill me.

296
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,693
Pick up the sword, Susima.

297
00:43:34,693 --> 00:43:38,686
Your mother was like my own.
I'd love your son as my own.

298
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:45,259
Only if you were not Asoka.
But you are Asoka. It's destiny.

299
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:53,845
Pick up the sword, Susima.

300
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:57,838
To help you defeat me?

301
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,343
I won't allow you that pleasure.

302
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:06,358
Let history note
that Asoka did not win the throne...

303
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,351
he had to kill to get it.

304
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:13,599
- Pick up the sword, Susima.
- No.

305
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,592
I was not a murderer, Asoka.
You left me with no choice.

306
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:22,897
Moment to moment I lived in fear
of your snatching the throne from me.

307
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:29,337
To sit on the throne
you must kill your own brother.

308
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:34,353
You will have to become 'Susima'.

309
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:38,346
Kill me, Asoka. Kill me.
You need courage to sit on the throne...

310
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,953
and also to kill your brother.

311
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:50,258
Kill me, Asoka.

312
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:07,942
I knew that you are incapable
of killing your siblings.

313
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:13,859
I know you cannot.

314
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:17,852
That's why the throne is mine,
not your's.

315
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:33,968
Destiny...

316
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:45,880
What should I do with the brothers?

317
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:03,130
Kill them all.

318
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:24,485
I have killed all my brothers, Susima.

319
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:28,823
Now can I sit on the throne?

320
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:44,772
Long live King Asoka.

321
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:55,916
What's the matter?
Why are you all so quiet?

322
00:46:56,928 --> 00:47:00,932
There's nothing left to say.

323
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:03,835
Asoka killed all his brothers.
And no one said a word.

324
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:07,806
Who can say anything?
Even King Bindusara is no more.

325
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:09,074
Entire Magadha is terror-struck.

326
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:10,509
Strange.

327
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:12,010
Keep quiet, idiot.

328
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,014
Know what people are saying?
An evil man now rules over Magadha.

329
00:47:16,014 --> 00:47:20,007
'Evil' Asoka.

330
00:47:23,755 --> 00:47:27,748
You will not go anywhere, Devi.
You know I will not let you go.

331
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,530
- I am leaving.
- What was I to do?

332
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,966
They killed Mother.
I should forgive them?

333
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:36,768
Yes.

334
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,938
I don't have such a big heart.

335
00:47:39,938 --> 00:47:43,931
I know. That's why I am leaving.

336
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:48,969
You are not leaving.

337
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:55,509
I am going.

338
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:02,260
You should know.
Where is Sugatra hiding?

339
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,897
He won't say anything.
He does not know.

340
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:08,099
Then his life is meaningless.

341
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:12,092
Friend, please stop. Enough.

342
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:14,940
Nothing will stop me now, Virat.

343
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,933
I will be the greatest emperor on earth.

344
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,103
Greater than King Bindusara,
stronger than Chandragupta Mauya.

345
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,220
The greatest, ever.

346
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,213
Susima said, "To rule an empire,
to be a great Emperor...

347
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:40,955
one needs to kill."

348
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:19,326
Please rest, Prince Sugatra.
Give the senate time to think about it.

349
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:25,232
My death is certain if Kalinga
does not grant me asylum.

350
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:29,870
I plead with the senate of Kalinga
to protect my life.

351
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:36,610
Kalinga has given asylum to Sugatra.

352
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:41,326
Why? Had they not heard my order?

353
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:45,319
They say Kalinga owes nothing
to a man who killed his brothers.

354
00:49:57,676 --> 00:49:59,911
My relationship with Kalinga
is a strange one.

355
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:03,114
Till today no one has attacked Kalinga.

356
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,283
Kalinga is a democracy.

357
00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:08,053
Your grandfather dreamt
of a united India.

358
00:50:08,053 --> 00:50:10,255
Make that dream come true.

359
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:13,291
Attack Kalinga.

360
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:17,284
Kalinga.

361
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:21,333
We will always win.

362
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:25,326
Pawan's with the Magadha Army.
Will he too fight us?

363
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:30,397
- Pawan will never fight us.
- That's true.

364
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,673
Order me, Your Majesty. I'll make
them stare into the eyes of death.

365
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:43,021
Fear will render them useless.
They will forget patriotism.

366
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:47,014
What are you saying?
Friend, this is against the rules of war.

367
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:53,721
War has only one rule, Virat.
Victory.

368
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:03,030
We'll burn their houses,
destroy their fields.

369
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:14,908
I told your father. This village,
these homes, these people...

370
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:20,180
all belong to Emperor Asoka.
Which means all belong to me.

371
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:24,652
You too are mine.

372
00:51:25,363 --> 00:51:29,356
Your father is very brave.

373
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:44,204
Such cruelty? Is he human
or a monster? Who is this Asoka?

374
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:50,044
- Why kill so many innocent people?
- He'll do anything to win the war.

375
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:56,083
- He has not spared his own brothers.
- Then he must die.

376
00:51:58,196 --> 00:52:02,189
- I can take you to Asoka.
- Let's go.

377
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:08,696
Kalinga has attacked!

378
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:50,364
Look, there he is.

379
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,087
Sugatra?

380
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:07,091
Come, come, Sugatra.

381
00:54:07,091 --> 00:54:11,084
You've missed your brothers so much
that you came to meet them?

382
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:18,358
You want to fight me?
One more time?

383
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:24,342
You won't face me?

384
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:28,335
All right then,
strike from behind.

385
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:32,639
Come Sugatra. Attack me!

386
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:36,910
Come, attack me.

387
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:44,184
You can kill me...
but you can never defeat Kalinga.

388
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:48,488
The Magadha flag will
tower over blood-stained Kalinga.

389
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:59,399
Give my greetings to Susima,
my loving brother.

390
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:44,344
What will become of us, now.
How will we fight this war?

391
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:52,286
This is not mere soil.
It is our ancestral heritage.

392
00:55:53,998 --> 00:55:57,368
Nobody can take it from us.

393
00:55:57,368 --> 00:56:01,172
Should we lose,
what will we tell our children?

394
00:56:01,172 --> 00:56:04,475
Why should we lose?
Why should we not fight?

395
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:08,468
We will fight... together!

396
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:12,539
All my sons were killed in the war.
Had I one more, he would fight too.

397
00:56:13,184 --> 00:56:16,321
She is my daughter.
Now she will fight.

398
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:20,314
- Every man in Kalinga will fight.
- Every woman in Kalinga will fight.

399
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,652
Yes, we will all fight!

400
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:19,239
You don't know him.
He will do anything to defeat Kalinga.

401
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,686
At any cost he wants victory.

402
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:23,488
Only victory.

403
00:57:23,488 --> 00:57:27,481
My wish is that
when my child opens his eyes...

404
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:32,697
he should see only love not death.

405
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:36,690
The first words he hears
should be of love, not shrieks of pain.

406
00:57:42,774 --> 00:57:46,767
Everything will be destroyed.
Everything.

407
00:57:58,723 --> 00:58:02,593
- Where to, friend?
- A war awaits me. Have you forgotten?

408
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:05,329
Before that you have
to fight another war.

409
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:09,322
Really? Who is this new enemy?

410
00:58:10,134 --> 00:58:14,127
The one who stands in front of you.

411
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,671
No. You are a friend, my only friend.

412
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:31,144
Then listen to your friend and stop.
Enough!

413
00:58:31,322 --> 00:58:33,858
When will you stop killing
innocent people?

414
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:36,160
How much longer will you fight?

415
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,862
Till I win.

416
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:40,364
Till I win it all.

417
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:42,867
Then today you will not win over me.

418
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:46,860
One moment...

419
00:58:48,706 --> 00:58:52,699
- You will kill your own friend?
- I will go to any length to stop you.

420
00:59:00,618 --> 00:59:04,611
Remember, friend, the 19th tactic?

421
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:57,197
- Enough, Virat!
- No! Never.

422
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:24,758
You're alive...
because you are a friend

423
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,563
You are nobody's friend.

424
01:00:41,252 --> 01:00:43,588
You are your own enemy.

425
01:00:43,588 --> 01:00:45,756
That's why you are called
'Evil' Asoka!

426
01:00:45,756 --> 01:00:49,749
'Evil' Asoka!

427
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:29,589
Today we'll have a feast
in Kalinga.

428
01:01:30,635 --> 01:01:33,604
But Emperor Asoka has
not come yet.

429
01:01:33,604 --> 01:01:37,597
You don't need
elephants to crush ants.

430
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:42,035
Charge!

431
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:33,320
Come on, move back!

432
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,593
Follow them.

433
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:44,798
Cowards! Running away
from the battle field?

434
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,073
Pawan!

435
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,455
- We have lost the war.
- We cannot lose.

436
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:08,448
I will go and fight.
We cannot lose!

437
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:13,086
Please don't go, Prince.
Please stop.

438
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,986
What happened, Vitasoka?

439
01:09:35,986 --> 01:09:39,979
You wanted to be a poet.
Then why this guise?

440
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:47,053
I know what you want to say.
The tormentor Asoka! Evil Asoka!

441
01:09:51,168 --> 01:09:55,161
Is that what you want to tell me?
I have heard it all before.

442
01:09:57,141 --> 01:10:01,134
I have come to tell you that
you have become a father.

443
01:10:07,985 --> 01:10:11,121
My son!

444
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,114
Mahendra is your son and
Sanghamitra is your daughter.

445
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:22,266
Where is Devi, Vitasoka?

446
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:26,136
I am their father, Vitasoka.

447
01:10:26,136 --> 01:10:30,129
You are only an Emperor.
Emperor Asoka.

448
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:35,012
Donning another garb does not
change the truth, Vitasoka.

449
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:39,005
War is the truth. Wars happen.
In war, you either win or die.

450
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:45,545
And I have won, Vitasoka!
I have won.

451
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,594
Yes, you have. You have won
the tears of widows...

452
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:54,587
the cries of orphans
and enflamed bodies.

453
01:10:55,532 --> 01:10:59,525
You have won it all.

454
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:06,499
Vitasoka, I have won.

455
01:11:07,444 --> 01:11:11,437
I have won, Vitasoka.

456
01:11:29,867 --> 01:11:32,603
We've never collected so much wealth
in any other war, as this.

457
01:11:32,603 --> 01:11:36,173
We've never killed so many people
in any other war, as this.

458
01:11:36,173 --> 01:11:40,166
The bigger the victory,
the more the wealth!

459
01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:44,337
You have stumbled on a fortune,
such a beautiful and strong horse.

460
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:48,552
They say it belongs to 'Kaurwaki',
the one who inspired...

461
01:11:48,552 --> 01:11:51,521
the farmers and women to fight
against Magadha's army.

462
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:55,514
Who cares?
The horse will fetch a handsome price.

463
01:12:09,606 --> 01:12:13,599
Kaurwaki...

464
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,523
Water...

465
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:18,321
You have not won...

466
01:16:18,321 --> 01:16:21,591
I'll never let you win.

467
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:23,493
Kaurwaki.

468
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:27,486
I am alive! You have to fight me.

469
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:35,338
Throw down your sword Kaurwaki,
the war is over.

470
01:16:35,338 --> 01:16:39,331
The war is not over.
You have to kill me too.

471
01:16:42,512 --> 01:16:46,505
How can I kill you?
I am your Pawan.

472
01:16:50,654 --> 01:16:54,647
You are not my Pawan.
You are Asoka... Asoka!

473
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:11,730
Forgive me.

474
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:23,842
Why did you not come?

475
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:32,451
I waited so long...

476
01:17:36,499 --> 01:17:40,492
Where did I not look for you?
I searched everywhere.

477
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:58,944
Pawan...

478
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:02,025
Aya!

479
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:06,018
Where were you?

480
01:18:06,429 --> 01:18:09,566
Asoka took away all my land.

481
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:13,559
No one can take your land from you.
It is your's.

482
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:16,473
I have come back.

483
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:18,875
You will not go again?

484
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:22,712
No, never again

485
01:18:22,712 --> 01:18:24,881
Promise me?

486
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:28,874
I promise.

487
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:52,531
See? I did not even cry.

488
01:18:55,745 --> 01:18:59,738
Pawan? Did the prince return?

489
01:19:03,953 --> 01:19:07,457
Yes... he did.

490
01:19:07,457 --> 01:19:11,450
With horses and elephants?

491
01:19:13,596 --> 01:19:16,599
With hundreds of horses
and elephants.

492
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:20,592
Then?

493
01:19:21,738 --> 01:19:25,731
He took the princess
on his horse and rode away.

494
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:29,835
Then?

495
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:37,543
They lived together.

496
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:41,458
Happily?

497
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:45,451
Yes, very happily.

498
01:19:46,463 --> 01:19:50,456
Pawan, it's getting dark.

499
01:19:53,536 --> 01:19:56,906
The sun, moon and stars
are fading.

500
01:19:56,906 --> 01:20:00,899
No, Aya...

501
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:04,080
nothing will happen.

502
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,073
Nothing will happen to you.

503
01:20:11,855 --> 01:20:15,848
The sun, the moon, the stars...
are all yours.

504
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:23,522
Pawan...

505
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:12,604
I have become the greatest emperor.

506
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:16,775
The mightiest ruler.

507
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:21,090
I have won it all.

508
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:25,083
I have also destroyed it all.

509
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:31,924
What did I win?

510
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:44,603
What can Emperors win?
Only wealth, land and kingdoms.

511
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:49,118
My destiny transcends
an Emperor's.

512
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:52,255
My destiny will be that
of a traveler's...

513
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:56,059
who completes his journey.

514
01:21:56,059 --> 01:21:59,596
And today I start my journey.

515
01:21:59,596 --> 01:22:03,589
A journey of love, peace
and nonviolence.
