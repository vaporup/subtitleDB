1
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:26,768
I won't talk to you.
You will also leave me.

2
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,948
Grandfather too is leaving.

3
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,941
When you grow wings,
you too will fly away.

4
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,489
Emperor Chandragupta Mauya
has embraced Jainism...

5
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,626
for which he is abdicating,
giving up his throne...

6
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,619
his kingdom and his people.

7
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,662
Grandfather, Asoka has taken
your sword. He says it is his.

8
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,936
You are leaving me,
but the sword is mine.

9
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,174
Asoka, my son, this
is not just a sword.

10
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,721
It's a demon.

11
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,714
When drawn, it hungers blood.
It doesn't see friend or foe.

12
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,755
It sees only blood. Just blood.

13
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,193
Before it can do more harm,
let us get rid of it.

14
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,656
"This is not just a sword.
It's a demon.

15
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,649
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood. Just blood."

16
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,096
The Takshila army is mightier
than ours.

17
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,700
Half our army has not reached.

18
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,869
General Shivrath, hasn't reached...

19
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,039
or my brother Susima
has not let it reach?

20
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,032
We will not lose. For even if
wars are fought on battlefields...

21
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,680
they are won by the mind.

22
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,673
Takshila army, keep moving.

23
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,725
Prince, Takshila army is advancing.

24
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,718
Stop them, General,
by force or by deceit.

25
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:14,189
Their army has been halved.
Now they want to surrender.

26
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:21,196
The enemy deserves a chance.
Don't you agree, General?

27
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,617
Takshila's flags are down.
We want to surrender, Prince.

28
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,754
Our army has laid down their weapons.

29
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,747
Takshila kneels before Magadha.

30
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,106
Surrender to me.

31
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,008
The weapon is with me.

32
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,744
That is no weapon.

33
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,737
This is a weapon.

34
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,011
The head that won't bow to us
will be cut off.

35
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,535
What are you taking with you?

36
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,203
Nothing.

37
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,006
All that and you say it's nothing?

38
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,999
Give us some of it.

39
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,781
Should I?

40
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,249
That's too much.

41
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,086
- Want more?
- No, we'll share it.

42
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,088
You better smarten up.

43
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:20,081
Prince Asoka is arriving,
victorious from Takshila.

44
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,553
- The stars never lie.
- Damn your stars.

45
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,736
Susima's mother is King Bindusara's
favored queen.

46
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,306
With her around no one will
dare eye the throne.

47
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,909
And what of Asoka's mother,
Queen Dharma?

48
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,879
She is less of a Queen
and more of a slave.

49
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,872
Only Prince Susima
can claim the throne.

50
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,099
Where is Susima?

51
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,804
General Shivrath.
The great General Shivrath.

52
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,644
It is you who suggested that
Asoka be sent to Takshila.

53
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:00,081
You said he would lose, didn't you?

54
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,253
"Send him with half the army
and he won't return alive."

55
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,001
You said so, right?

56
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,994
Then what is this?

57
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:20,135
What do we do with you now?
You have failed.

58
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,352
What is the fate of a defeated soldier?

59
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,345
Let me be sentenced to death.

60
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,350
Defeat hasn't crushed the warrior's
ego. He still holds his head high.

61
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,000
I want him to lower his head.

62
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,993
These arms and medals
belong to Magadha's proud army.

63
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,899
Do you think you deserve all this?

64
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,013
No.

65
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:58,006
Take them off.

66
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,347
Strip him naked.

67
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:17,158
Here, brother.
The General is now ready for war.

68
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,408
He has lowered his head.

69
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,401
Now you can kill him.

70
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,512
You don't know Asoka. I have tried
to kill him all of eleven times.

71
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,193
Don't worry.
Asoka will die for sure.

72
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:45,186
You know your job well.

73
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,268
I advise you to attack him while
he is bathing in the river...

74
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,204
when he is most vulnerable...

75
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,197
emerging out of the water, then...

76
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,172
All I want is to know who sent you.

77
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,440
Long live King Susima.

78
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,357
You missed. Again.

79
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,128
See, there isn't a scratch on me.

80
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,576
- I want you to leave Magadha.
- Why should I?

81
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,179
The coming six moonless nights
are not auspicious for you.

82
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,582
My good or bad luck rests
with my sword.

83
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,718
Is that your wish? I run away?
I'm no coward.

84
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,088
- I'm not afraid of anyone, Mother.
- But I'm afraid.

85
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,081
How can you know a mother's pain?
9 months I nurtured you in my womb.

86
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,598
I am your son, Mother.
I will understand your pain.

87
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,268
Even if I have to carry you around
for nine months.

88
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,261
Let me know your pain, Mother.

89
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,547
You are right, Mother.
Nine moments maybe...

90
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,151
but for nine months, you're too heavy.

91
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,353
Don't change the subject,
will you leave or not?

92
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,689
I heard you. I promise, Mother.

93
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,682
- Asoka.
- I promise, Mother.

94
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,153
I promise, pundit-ji.

95
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,430
How are you?
We've not met since your return.

96
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,206
I heard that someone tried to kill you.

97
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,345
Someone did try to kill me, yet again.

98
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,750
Who would want that, Asoka?

99
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,265
A fool that misses each time.

100
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,258
Beware, Asoka.
One shouldn't underestimate the enemy.

101
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,164
He who faces me with a sword
is my enemy.

102
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,145
Not someone who lunges from behind.

103
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,138
Either way, the one who survives
ascends the throne.

104
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,487
No, Susima.
The throne belongs to the one...

105
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,480
who has the courage to sit on it.

106
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,197
That's a childhood trait of yours.
What I want, what I like...

107
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,190
is your desire too.

108
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,306
You even took Grandfather's sword.

109
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,299
Get off the throne, Asoka.

110
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,470
Make me do so, Sugatra.

111
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,282
Not like this, Sugatra.

112
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,353
If you must have the throne
then fight for it.

113
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,234
In front of everyone.

114
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,227
Meet me tomorrow morning
and I'll fight you, before everyone.

115
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:01,469
Tomorrow morning...

116
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,475
in front of everyone.

117
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,848
Sleep well, Asoka.
Tonight is your last night.

118
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,202
You are finished.

119
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,736
I will fight him.

120
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,729
Go ahead... fight him.

121
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,546
He dared to sit on the throne today.

122
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,682
Tomorrow, he may raise the sword
on me.

123
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,619
Your Majesty, it is my belief that
we analyze the situation...

124
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,612
Prime Minister, my belief is
that you stay silent.

125
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,383
- It's you who has encouraged him.
- Why blame the Prime Minister?

126
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,298
Asoka is under Dharma's control.

127
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,291
Stop him, Dharma.
If something should happen tomorrow...

128
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,362
the blame will be entirely yours.

129
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,350
What's happening here?

130
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,686
- Mother is taking a vow of silence.
- That will not happen here.

131
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,679
Everyone, leave.

132
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,888
What childishness is this?
A vow of silence, for life?

133
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,869
You won't talk to me ever again.

134
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,739
Why, Mother?

135
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,574
She won't speak to anyone.

136
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,567
Mother says why speak
when her own child turns a deaf ear?

137
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,477
Mother wants you to leave Magadha
and strive to live an ordinary life...

138
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,816
Give her your word that no one will
come to know you're Prince Asoka.

139
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,324
I must go? Leave?

140
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,361
So that others can laugh at me
for running away scared?

141
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,434
You don't want your son to sit on the
throne? But I wanted it for you.

142
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,590
Here. I give in. Now speak to me.

143
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,805
Vitasoka, tell Mother to greet
an ordinary man.

144
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,798
Mother's like you, brother.
She won't speak till you leave.

145
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,013
All right, I'll go.

146
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:52,006
Even if you ask, I won't return.

147
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,577
Speak to me.

148
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,689
Brother won't be here.
He has gone, leaving Magadha.

149
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,761
Gone? So he's scared.

150
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,532
The brave Prince has fled
to save his life.

151
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,816
Idiot. Change your tune.

152
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,718
What's the matter with you?

153
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,587
Nothing.

154
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,580
Friends like us have nothing to hide.

155
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,985
Last night, when I went home,
my wife was not there.

156
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,732
Where did she go?

157
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,869
When I asked her in the morning...

158
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,938
she said she was
with her friend, Kamini.

159
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,608
Silly. She must have been with Kamini.

160
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,610
You idiot, I was with Kamini.

161
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,445
No, I was with Kamini.

162
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,846
I was there too.
You must have gone after me.

163
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,839
Strange. My wife's name
is also Kamini.

164
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,679
- That dark one?
- Yes.

165
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,891
Have you heard? Prince Asoka
has gone leaving Magadha.

166
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,939
He must have gotten scared
of Prince Susima.

167
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,908
When Jupiter enters
its twelfth position...

168
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,111
every great man must go into exile.
- Really?

169
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,480
Like Rama, Pandavas, Princes.

170
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,473
Strange.

171
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,974
You're not from here. Who are you?

172
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,777
An ordinary traveler.

173
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,770
The sun remains the sun
even behind clouds.

174
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,853
Your destiny indicates
that you are in no way ordinary.

175
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,846
What lies in my destiny then?
That I am a prince?

176
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,695
One day I will be enthroned?
Be an emperor?

177
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,688
Even emperors are ordinary.
Your destiny transcends the throne.

178
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,659
Whose destiny can surpass
that of an emperor's?

179
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,466
A traveler's... when his journey
has been completed.

180
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:20,047
Eat, child. In Kalinga no one
goes to sleep hungry. You eat too.

181
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,593
Here, Pawan. It's good food.
Pawan, eat this. It's tasty.

182
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,764
Why should you eat? You too
miss Mother's hand feeding you.

183
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:43,070
No fuss. I'm an ordinary man.
You an ordinary horse.

184
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:47,174
No royal palace
or sumptuous dishes for us.

185
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,757
Now, it's the ground to sleep on...

186
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,627
the open sky above...

187
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,620
and pretty princesses
who now exist only in our dreams.

188
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,901
Go, you searching wind, go away

189
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:57,177
Go seek out my beloved

190
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,248
One good enough for me

191
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:11,102
It cannot be...

192
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,095
If there is...

193
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,902
Then maybe we can be together

194
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,282
Go... go...

195
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,906
The sky is a poet's page

196
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,777
And I its poem

197
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,114
Someone like me...

198
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,084
Is rare in this world

199
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,721
Touch me not...

200
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,714
That's a dare...

201
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:47,221
It would start raging fire

202
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,868
Go... go...

203
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,779
I didn't see a thing.

204
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,381
I was just listening.

205
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:14,374
You swim...
I mean you sing very well.

206
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,879
What's your name?

207
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,984
- I don't talk to strangers.
- Stranger?

208
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,033
Do you not feel
that we have met before?

209
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:33,037
In some other place, in another time...

210
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,030
somewhere?

211
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,146
Who are you?

212
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,830
Pawan (the Wind). And you?

213
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,065
Why are you following me?

214
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,969
Your voice drew me.

215
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,962
I am warrior blood. You risk death.

216
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,502
I am dead.

217
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,415
My warrior.

218
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,302
Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse
like you. Wait here.

219
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,295
Look, another one in search
of the same thing.

220
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,143
You won't find...
Nobody will.

221
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,478
- Who?
- Not who, 'What'.

222
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:51,471
100 shining, clinking gold coins.

223
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,443
Reward for finding Prince Aya
and Princess Kaurwaki.

224
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,971
You're very pretty.

225
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,505
And you're the prettiest, Meghna.

226
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,498
- Meghna? My name's Urvashi.
- Doesn't matter, you're all pretty.

227
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,036
Who is there? Will someone dare
to take up my challenge?

228
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:30,277
Friend, you seem new here.
How about you?

229
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,158
Come, show us your mettle.

230
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:38,151
Go... go.

231
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:43,590
Brave youngsters these days
parade around with twigs.

232
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:49,029
- Give it back.
- Sit. Win it back.

233
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,073
- What's your name?
- Pawan (the Wind).

234
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,155
A horse's name.

235
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,148
His father must be 'Badal' (cloud).

236
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,332
Look behind...
There's no one.

237
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,325
- You won by cheating.
- Either way, I won.

238
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,639
- You must fight me again.
- Let go.

239
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,208
I will not.

240
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,411
No way out.
You'll have to fight.

241
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,048
Where were you last night?
I've been waiting for ages.

242
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:34,041
Who are all these people?
Come home now, I'll show you.

243
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,989
You are the first to defeat Virat.

244
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,358
Come with me.

245
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,995
- You've not been drinking, have you?
- No.

246
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,988
You take over the bullock cart.
It's dangerous to drink and ride.

247
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,095
He's right, let's go.

248
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,201
Woke up, finally? Will you just
sit around? Or will you work?

249
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,073
- What work?
- You must work if you want to stay.

250
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,222
If not, you should leave.

251
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,215
I can do any kind of work.

252
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,204
This work I cannot do.

253
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:30,197
Greetings. I'm new to this.
You could face some discomfort.

254
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,235
Even so, please don't move.
And please don't kick.

255
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,258
Your eyes too are beautiful.

256
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,094
You? Why are you following me?

257
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,096
I am following you?

258
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,089
Yesterday I was in the forest and
you emerged from the waterfalls.

259
00:33:56,234 --> 00:34:00,238
Now you're here on the pretext
of getting milk.

260
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,641
And what were you doing in my dream
last night?

261
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,412
At least tell me your name.

262
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,405
- Give me the milk.
- Look, over there.

263
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,579
Hey, Warrior.

264
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,557
Stop. Princess Kaurwaki.

265
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,564
Yes, we found her.
The 100 gold coins are ours.

266
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,513
100 gold coins for her?

267
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:46,184
- Back off. She is ours.
- Know how to swim?

268
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,188
Yes, of course.

269
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,181
And you?
That's good.

270
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,468
Lets go.

271
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,461
You crazy? If you can't swim then
why jump into the water?

272
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,409
What's wrong? Seems all of Kalinga
is after you...

273
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:27,347
Princess Kaurwaki.

274
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,285
You're among them. For you,
all I mean is 100 gold coins.

275
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,199
I couldn't put a price on you.

276
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,192
The earth doesn't have
enough gold for that.

277
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,498
Stay with Aya. He is alone.
Stop. Who sent you?

278
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,520
Drink up.

279
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,513
When I'm king,
there will be food for all.

280
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,518
Don't tell anyone.

281
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,425
- Who is this? Is he dead?
- It's just an injury. Go back inside.

282
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,497
- How did he get hurt?
- Bheema hit him. Go inside.

283
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,601
Did he come to kill me?

284
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,552
Aya, go inside.

285
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,222
Why did you bring him here?
You know it's dangerous.

286
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,692
- Why did you hit him?
- Aya, go inside.

287
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,685
- First tell me, why you hit him.
- Aya, go inside.

288
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,602
Why did you bring him here?

289
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,595
He could be anyone,
a murderer, an assassin...

290
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,510
- He saved my life, Bheema.
- Don't you know why?

291
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,503
He's after the same thing:
100 gold coins.

292
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,740
You may take your life lightly
but Aya is my responsibility.

293
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,456
- Aya is my brother, General.
- Let's go then.

294
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,227
- I can't leave him in this condition.
- You'll have to.

295
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,220
- We are leaving from here.
- General, are you ordering me?

296
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,692
No. I'm just trying
to make you understand.

297
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:23,597
The rest is up to you.

298
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,284
Forgive me, Prince.
Please have your meal now.

299
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,853
Here, I'm Prince?
Inside you scold me?

300
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:39,657
- Scold me then after eating.
- I don't wish to eat.

301
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,494
- I want to go home
- Yes, Prince. We leave tomorrow.

302
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:47,487
- Not tomorrow, today.
- I said tomorrow.

303
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,301
It's always tomorrow.

304
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,504
When I am king everything
will be settled today.

305
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:57,497
No tomorrows.

306
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,343
Kaurwaki...

307
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,941
Kaurwaki, give it to me.

308
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,934
Mother, look at Kaurwaki.

309
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,480
Mother.

310
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,429
It's all right.
It was only a nightmare.

311
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,422
- I want to go home.
- Yes. We will go.

312
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,841
Where is Prince Aya?

313
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,834
I assure the senate that
Prince Aya will soon be with us...

314
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,739
to take the royal place
of his late father.

315
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,776
I have announced a 100 gold coin
reward to anyone who finds him.

316
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,815
It's not just a matter
of finding Prince Aya.

317
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,895
The King's assassins roam free.

318
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,531
What's happening in Kalinga?
Answer me.

319
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,568
There is a conspiracy brewing
in Kalinga.

320
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,561
The person involved is here
in this senate amongst us.

321
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,375
- Who is he?
- You.

322
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,544
- Or you. It may even be you.
- Me?

323
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,714
It could be anyone.

324
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,585
Suspecting each other is futile.

325
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:51,578
It's your responsibility to find
the culprit, Prime Minister.

326
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,949
We trust you.

327
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,734
Kaurwaki...

328
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,229
Kaurwaki...

329
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,222
Now Kaurwaki? Last night
another name was on your lips.

330
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,702
Is that so?

331
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:42,695
And what were you doing
so close to me last night?

332
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,933
Don't go. It still hurts...

333
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:51,504
If you leave, the pain will get worse.

334
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,253
- My Warrior, listen.
- I don't want to hear.

335
00:40:56,253 --> 00:41:00,246
- But I want to say it.
- Fine. Say it.

336
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,061
- Can I come close and say it?
- What are you doing?

337
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,698
- Nothing?
- I saw him tying to tell you something.

338
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:11,691
- He was telling me a story.
- I want to hear it too.

339
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,673
- But I don't know any stories.
- I order you. Tell me a story.

340
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,666
Prince, don't get angry.
I will tell you a story.

341
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,012
- Once, there was a prince.
- Like me?

342
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:26,005
A little older. He left his kingdom
and roamed the jungle.

343
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,844
- Like us? Then what?
- One day he heard something...

344
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,648
Someone was singing.
The voice drew him to a waterfall.

345
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,829
He saw a princess, bathing...

346
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,665
Her lovely body, head to toe,
glistening with water drops.

347
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,134
And the prince fell in love.

348
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,737
- At first sight.
- I knew it. Then?

349
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:50,730
Said the prince to the princess,
"You sing beautifully!"

350
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,843
The princess got angry,
picked up her sword.

351
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,980
Why? The prince didn't do anything.

352
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,973
- He watched her bathe, you see.
- So? I too bathe in the open.

353
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:05,055
You're different.
The Princess had no clothes on her.

354
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:09,048
- Aya, supper's ready. Come eat.
- But I want to hear the story.

355
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:14,732
First eat. Then the story.

356
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,768
- How are you now?
- I'm fine.

357
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,871
I must find the rascal
who hit me from behind.

358
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,174
This rascal. He hits everybody.

359
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:28,167
- We should leave now.
- By the way, where are you headed?

360
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,848
Kalinga.

361
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,816
That's where I am going too.

362
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,809
We won't trouble you. Let's go.

363
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,688
Tell me the story.

364
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,893
Rascal.

365
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,908
What is this?

366
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,679
Left your work without warning?

367
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,672
Work when you please. Leave
when you please. This won't do.

368
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,579
She went away.
She didn't even look back.

369
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,783
Is it done?

370
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,690
Come, get ready.
Come, get ready.

371
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,841
Let's catch the evening boat.
Let's get on it. Come, let's go.

372
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,710
There will be an anchor, somewhere...

373
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,703
Somewhere there's a shore...
Let's go. Let's go.

374
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,925
Prepare yourself, then let's leave

375
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,918
Whether we swim or we sink...
We have to get across

376
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,274
The evening will be so pleasant

377
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,943
The words will be mine.
But the thought yours

378
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,936
The talk will be innocent...
sweet, diluted with honey

379
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,351
What is this surge of love?
Do I drown to experience it?

380
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,344
Can't you tell what it is?
Where could it lead?

381
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,915
The heart will burn,
the eyes will fill

382
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:40,646
You fight very well.

383
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,885
Here, straighten this.

384
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,439
- I'll be leaving too.
- Wait.

385
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:59,432
- The fight is not over.
- I warn you.

386
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,479
I have learnt the art of battle
from the great texts.

387
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,415
I know 18 tactics of fighting.

388
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,318
I do too.

389
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,311
- All 18?
- All 18 of them. Come, fight.

390
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,216
Tell me, friend.
Do you know the 19th tactic?

391
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,031
Which is this 19th tactic?

392
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,966
The 19th tactic?

393
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:26,959
In the 19th tactic the warrior
fights his foe blindfolded.

394
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,440
Like this.

395
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,342
Pawan, Pawan.

396
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,144
Quiet, everyone.

397
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,137
What's new in that?
Even I know this tactic.

398
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,518
Prepare yourself.

399
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,087
- Have you got the blindfold on?
- Yes.

400
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,080
- You can't see anything?
- Not a thing.

401
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,429
You hit first.

402
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,965
Try again.

403
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:57,334
Keep at it.

404
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:01,327
Friend, remember... the '19th' tactic.

405
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:09,268
Quiet.

406
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,516
Will he be back?

407
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,385
Who, Pawan?

408
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,155
Yes, Pawan. I want to hear the story.

409
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,991
Here you go, prince. Eat some fruit.

410
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,727
Bheema, know any stories?

411
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,296
No.

412
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:30,289
No for everything.

413
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:44,437
Tell us, who are you?
What are you doing here?

414
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,444
Princess, hide.

415
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,164
Were you looking for me?

416
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,157
When you left you did not look back
even once.

417
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:44,230
Take care of Aya.

418
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,447
Don't leave them, Bheema.

419
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:06,385
He will kill everyone.

420
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,514
Well, what's this?
The sun pendant.

421
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,507
It is our Prince Aya, isn't it?

422
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,823
Look, our Prince got scared.

423
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,816
Don't be afraid, Prince.
We won't do anything to hurt you.

424
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,694
You fight well.
Where did you learn?

425
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,731
I'm a soldier in the Magadha army.

426
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,313
You, soldier of Magadha army?

427
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:40,306
And I'm the General of Kalinga.
That makes us enemies.

428
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,312
Enemies.

429
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:50,560
How long?
How much longer will it take?

430
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,564
Do I have to wait for eternity
to ascend the throne?

431
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,401
Find Prince Aya and kill him.

432
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:02,394
As proof, hand me the sun pendant
he wears around his neck.

433
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,565
Go.

434
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,299
Why a sword in such beautiful hands?

435
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:33,292
I want to be as skilled as you
in wielding the sword.

436
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,429
- To fight the evil ones.
- Who are they?

437
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:41,077
The ones who killed my parents.

438
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:45,070
I'm with you, Kaurwaki.
I will always be close to you.

439
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:50,075
I don't want to depend on others.

440
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,813
Then, hold the sword like this.

441
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:03,656
Let it be a part of your body.
Let it connect to your soul.

442
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:12,731
No fear, no hesitation...
No sense of life or death.

443
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,603
Focus only on your target.

444
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,605
Not like this.

445
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,388
Eye to eye...

446
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:02,381
Never shift your eyes
from your enemy.

447
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,520
I just touched my warrior
and she took offense.

448
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,423
Just imagine, she pushed me.

449
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,826
You men. You could not have said
or heard anything.

450
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,929
- Probably grabbed the girl's hand.
- I did. So?

451
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,922
You need to be gentle with girls.
Some love, some flowers...

452
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,803
say some words of love.

453
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:50,807
Say what? Love speaks for itself.

454
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:54,544
- Are you afraid of expressing love?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

455
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,981
Nonsense. Tell me, how does one
go about this love talk?

456
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,818
Here. Hold these flowers. Take it all.

457
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:05,811
Go tell her...
I love you... you alone.

458
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:11,550
I can't think of anything but you.

459
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:15,432
After meeting you
my world has changed.

460
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,966
I have changed.

461
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,570
I can't understand anything.
If I keep silent, I'll go mad.

462
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,539
All that? I can't do it.

463
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,532
Hold this? You have to say it.

464
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,446
- I'm In love with you
- Right.

465
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,847
- Only you.
- Perfect.

466
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,751
Keep at it and
I'll get some more flowers.

467
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,987
Ever since I have met you,
everything’s changed.

468
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:41,980
I have changed,
you seem changed.

469
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,452
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you...

470
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,731
You.

471
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,835
Your love story brings tears
to my eyes.

472
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,670
Now your tears will flow.

473
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,006
My friend, not today.
Somebody is waiting.

474
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,175
They'll have to wait a lifetime.

475
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,811
- Virat, my friend...
- Nothing will work today.

476
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,804
No blindfold, no 19th tactic.
Today nothing will work.

477
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,985
What if I say
there's someone behind you?

478
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,521
I won't look back.

479
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,824
- There's someone behind you.
- I know there's no one.

480
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,559
Virat, somebody is there.

481
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,552
You're cheating again.
Telling me lies?

482
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,269
I'm leaving, my friend.

483
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,739
So? You promised you'll be
with me forever.

484
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,309
After that day, I see you today.

485
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:37,302
I won't speak to him ever,
didn't even tell me before he left.

486
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,952
Are you crying?

487
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,945
First, you fight with Pawan.
Then you sit here and cry?

488
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,325
Why should I cry?

489
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:53,318
- What have I to do with him?
- Look, Pawan's horse.

490
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:19,678
You glass doll...

491
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,872
Sealed in your lips
is the lilt of love

492
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,840
But you won't speak

493
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,609
Or utter it

494
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,377
It lingers on your eyelashes

495
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:45,370
And lurks on lowered eyes

496
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,895
Come, listen.

497
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,698
Sweeter than sugar

498
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,334
are your veiled eyelids

499
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,870
You don't open your eyes

500
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,863
or reveal what they say

501
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,649
If you wish to cross the hills
I'll move mountains for you

502
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,052
If you seek shelter in the clouds
I'll ward off the monsoon rains

503
01:00:56,052 --> 01:01:00,045
A bird in the sky will guide
you to the hill where the sun rises

504
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,739
Please introduce yourself, beautiful
Your smile is sweetness

505
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,989
You are a foreigner, will forget
me easily. Give me your promise

506
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,982
So I can wear it like a jewel

507
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:18,850
The prime minister of Magadha
has sent a message.

508
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,531
Please continue with the story.

509
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,299
The story... where were we?

510
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,935
The Princess's clothes...

511
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,928
She wore them, walked away,
and the prince followed her

512
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:31,941
Why?

513
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,076
Lovely princess,
alone in a dark forest...

514
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,213
What of wild animals?

515
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:41,206
Any wild animal seeing a
lovely princess would follow.

516
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,253
Then what happened?

517
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,622
The princess turned around
and said, "I am a princess...

518
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,859
If you follow me you
will get a tight slap".

519
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,962
The prince left then?

520
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:56,098
No, he was shameless.

521
01:03:56,098 --> 01:04:00,091
Is this your story or mine?
You tell it then.

522
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,572
No, you tell it.

523
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:05,975
Why would our prince who braved
death bother over a slap?

524
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:09,968
He kept following the princess.
Suddenly, three monsters appeared.

525
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,985
Where was the prince from?

526
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:19,978
The prince had no kingdom.
It was stolen from him.

527
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,325
Just like us.

528
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:26,318
Someone stole our land as well.

529
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,967
Someone stole our Kalinga.

530
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:34,960
So what?

531
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,998
The sun is yours, the moon too.
All the stars up there are yours.

532
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:45,147
No one can take that away from you.

533
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,649
- Really?
- Yes.

534
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:50,553
What's more, no man can
take your land away from you.

535
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,546
I'm there with you.
I'll get your land back for you.

536
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,207
Hey, warrior.

537
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,177
I... listen to me.

538
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:19,170
I have not told anyone this before.
Kaurwaki... listen.

539
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,308
Please listen.

540
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,724
Tell me.

541
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:32,595
Kaurwaki, I love you, only you.

542
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,588
I can't think of anything
or anyone but you.

543
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,335
Ever since I have met
you everything has changed.

544
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,170
I have changed.

545
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,939
I don't know what to do.

546
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,932
If I didn't tell you,
I would lose my mind.

547
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,950
I love you, only you.

548
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:12,023
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you.

549
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:18,229
Ever since I have met you
everything has changed.

550
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,046
I have changed.

551
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,115
I'm glad you told me.

552
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,108
If you didn't,
I would lose my mind.

553
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,479
That's exactly what I said.

554
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,984
But you should say it like this.

555
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,307
Where were you?

556
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,275
With Pawan.

557
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:56,045
What were you doing?

558
01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:00,038
Is this the way to behave?
That too with an ordinary soldier?

559
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,342
Bheema, don't forget who
it is you are talking to.

560
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,758
That's why I am speaking out.

561
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,060
It is not right for you
to associate with Pawan.

562
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,053
Careful, Bheema. I love Pawan.

563
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,701
You love Pawan?

564
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,271
Who is Pawan?
Where does he come from?

565
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:26,264
He says four nice words
to you and you think it's love?

566
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,803
How do you see it?
You think I don't know what love is?

567
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,420
You don't.

568
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,413
You don't know the difference
between love and a commoner's lust.

569
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,729
Don't forget
that you are just a General...

570
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,397
and I'm a princess.

571
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,233
You are my servant.
A slave to my royal family.

572
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:55,226
Yes, I'm a servant.
But who are you?

573
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:59,330
You think you are a princess?
The family you are so proud of...

574
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,416
What did you say?

575
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,586
What about my family?
Tell me, Bheema.

576
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:14,579
You were found by a fisherman.
Your origin is unknown.

577
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:19,584
No one knows your lineage...

578
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:29,127
The king adopted you.

579
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:36,534
Who am I then?

580
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:40,905
Nobody knows.

581
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:15,173
My warrior, why are you here alone?

582
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:23,948
I know what you are thinking.

583
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,365
Me, a princess. He, a mere soldier.

584
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:33,358
Arriving with his heart,
horse and sword.

585
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:40,932
Warrior. What happened?
What's wrong?

586
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:47,438
I am no warrior, Pawan.

587
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:53,278
Those who I thought
were my parents...

588
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,993
I am not of their blood.

589
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,986
They found me, Pawan.
They raised me as an orphan.

590
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:09,260
I have no identity, Pawan.

591
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,013
What difference is there...

592
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:22,006
between the blood of a warrior
and that of an ordinary man?

593
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:30,014
Nothing's changed. I love you.

594
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,897
Who do you love? Who am I?

595
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,890
You are my warrior, my princess.

596
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:49,901
Come with me.

597
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,969
Look. Look at the flame.

598
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:58,736
Are you going to push me away again?

599
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:05,777
Not so quick.
Tell me, what's my wedding gift?

600
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,793
I've given you my heart. What more?

601
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:14,563
Your horse.

602
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,633
He's yours.

603
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:21,626
- Your sword.
- That too.

604
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,341
Your clothes.

605
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:29,334
Not in front of the horse.

606
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,604
What are you doing?
My Warrior... no... no...

607
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:59,664
I'll be right back.

608
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,717
Stand upright, don't bow.

609
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,586
Greetings, Prince Asoka.

610
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:14,579
Embrace me.

611
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,092
Why are you here?

612
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,085
Your mother wants to meet you.

613
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,799
Tell Mother I will not return.

614
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:27,792
She is very ill.

615
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:39,203
You may go.

616
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,732
What's the matter?

617
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:00,725
Mother's unwell.

618
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:10,701
You should go to her then.

619
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,451
What about you and Aya?

620
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,887
We'll be fine.
We'll stay here till you get back.

621
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:22,880
Please go.

622
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,788
You're leaving again?
I won't let you go.

623
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:36,227
Prince Aya, a matter of two days.
I'll return soon.

624
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:41,766
- You did not even finish the story.
- Where were we?

625
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,740
Yes... the three monsters died.

626
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:53,589
The prince killed them all.

627
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:56,892
The Princess's anger turned to love.

628
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:00,662
The prince asked for
her hand in marriage.

629
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,197
She said yes, right?

630
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,732
Instantly.

631
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,202
Then?

632
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,804
Then the prince left.

633
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,572
Where to?

634
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:14,565
To his mother who was ill.

635
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,580
This is a sad story.

636
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,573
No way. The prince will return with
hundreds of horses and elephants...

637
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,691
...to take his princess away.

638
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,684
Tell the prince to return soon.
His princess will be waiting.

639
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,526
The prince will come back
with hundreds of horses and elephants.

640
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:49,767
You take care of Kaurwaki.

641
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,294
Greetings, Prince.

642
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:43,287
- Where is Mother?
- Come inside.

643
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,673
You lie to me and then want
God's forgiveness?

644
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,977
Had I not lied how would I see my son?

645
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:58,280
Seen me? Now I must leave.
Someone is waiting for me.

646
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,215
Who?

647
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,985
Someone.

648
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,755
As lovely as a lotus,
a heavenly creature.

649
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:10,748
She is so beautiful.
Anyone who sees her...

650
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:13,295
Will become a poet?

651
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,230
No... a lover.

652
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,799
You forget the white hair.

653
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,792
White hair?

654
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:25,930
She is someone else but
you'll always be my first love.

655
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,413
Mere words. Who is she?

656
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:35,406
- Kaurwaki.
- Kaurwaki? What of her family?

657
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:39,777
All here. You, Vitasoka, me.
We are her family.

658
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,762
- Mother, I have married her.
- Married?

659
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,031
- Why didn't you bring her?
- Not like this.

660
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,400
When I do, Magadha will welcome her
ceremoniously.

661
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,393
The streets will be lit with lamps,
decorated with flowers.

662
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,331
- Then I will tell her who I am.
- You've not told her yet?

663
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:04,402
I told a lovely white-haired lady
that I won't tell anyone.

664
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,450
Silly.

665
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,443
Take the blessings of the King.

666
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,826
Praise the lord.

667
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:21,819
General, the rumor all over Kalinga
is that Prince Aya has been killed.

668
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,826
The senate has decided to place
someone else on the throne.

669
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,141
I know that's why it's important
that I go to Kalinga.

670
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:37,134
It's unsafe for Aya to go there now.

671
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,706
Princess, give me your anklet...

672
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,756
Aya, your necklace.

673
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,025
No one should know
they are hiding here.

674
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:54,018
Don't worry, General.
I will guard them with my life.

675
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:59,957
He's served the royal family for years.
You'll be safe here.

676
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,839
Don't go anywhere until my return.

677
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:07,832
Yes... now I have to listen
to the General's orders.

678
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,840
Greetings, Susima.

679
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:22,480
Greetings.

680
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:24,960
Where were you all these days?

681
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,096
Just wandering around.

682
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:31,032
Tomorrow morning,
in front of everyone.

683
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:35,025
I was just scaring you.
I don't want to fight.

684
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:38,940
Susima, I don't want
the throne or the crown.

685
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,933
I don't want anything.

686
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:46,181
Have you ever loved someone?

687
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:50,174
- Love?
- No? You should.

688
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:09,960
Brother, he is trying to trick us again.

689
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:14,031
So, you've returned?
You remembered Magadha?

690
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:21,005
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I wanted to...

691
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,476
A rebellion is threatened in Ujjaini.
Go there.

692
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:33,050
Any problem?

693
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:38,189
No, Your Majesty.

694
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:55,439
- Are you missing Pawan?
- Yes.

695
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,610
He said that should I think of him
I should call his name out loud.

696
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,257
Then, he'll appear.

697
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:06,250
Should I call him?

698
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:12,056
You call out as well.

699
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:23,567
Prince...

700
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,489
- I must go.
- His highness has ordered...

701
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:38,482
Don't worry. You go to Ujjaini.
I will meet you there.

702
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:55,065
Despite the talk,
I was sure you were all safe.

703
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,313
Who would want to kill Prince Aya?

704
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,649
At first I suspected you.

705
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,951
And I suspected you.

706
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,944
At times like this friends
suspect one another.

707
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:11,282
Bring Prince Aya here at the earliest.
I cannot contain the senate any longer.

708
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,962
You are right.

709
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,664
Don't go alone, General.

710
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:19,657
- I need no one.
- You do.
