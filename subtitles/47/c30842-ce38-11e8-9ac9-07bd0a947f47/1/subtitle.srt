1
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,680
W-O...

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
R...

3
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,520
K!

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,520
Work.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,360
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Work!

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,400
My mommy is a doctor.

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,720
My daddy is a truck driver.
- My mom's a teacher.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,400
And your dad?
- Mmm. My dad-

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,000
He's... a liar.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,720
A- A liar? Oh, I'm sure
you don't mean a liar.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,440
Well, he wears a suit and goes
to court and talks to the judge.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,760
Oh! I see.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,040
You mean he's a lawyer.

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go?

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,160
Just another victory for the
wrongly accused. - Yeah, right.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,040
Mr. Reede, great job.
Do you want your coat back?

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,480
No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,960
Do you have a moment? - I'm late.
It's my day to be with my son.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
A couple of reporters want
to talk about your big win.

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah? How's my hair?

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Fabulous.
You look great.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,280
What time is it? - I am sure your
dad just got held up in court again.

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
Dad!
- Maximilian!

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,760
Hey, how ya doin', creep?

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Good.

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Me too, except my arm
has been botherin' me.

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,440
Oh, no, Dad!
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,280
It's becoming a claw!

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,640
Nothing can stop the claw!

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,560
Run, boy, run!
Save yourself!

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
Do the claw to Mom!
Do the claw to Mom!

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Uh-oh. You found
the claw's only weakness.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Subzero temperatures!

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,040
So, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,520
Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,720
The gauge is broken.
Rough neighborhood too.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Good thing I was wearin'
neutral gang colors.

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,400
I might have had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,600
<i><b>My mind and my money
and my money and my mind</b></i>

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
They would never hurt you,
Fletcher. You're their lawyer.

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
That was below the belt.
Keep the gloves up.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Mom, Dad's taking me
to see wrestling!

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,360
Oh, Fletcher!
- Oh, Audrey!

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Why do you have to take him
to see that stuff? It's very violent.

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,720
The boy must grow
to be a warrior.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Who better to guide him
than Rick Rude...

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
and Randy Macho-man Savage
in the cage of death?

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
Oh, good!

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,800
Jerry, how's it goin'?
- Hey, gipper!

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,080
You look like you grow
by the minute!

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,880
Fletcher, pleasure to see you.
Hi, honey!

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
Hi.

54
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Wow. That was a nice image.
Deleted.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,720
I have some more boxes for you.
- Oh, you're an angel.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,440
Boxes? - Remember, I told you a few
weeks ago, Jerry's moving to Boston.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,840
Oh, right! The job, the thing.
What do you do again?

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,200
Hospital administrator.
- Right, right!

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Well, the boxes
are in my car.

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Oh, those can wait.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,960
I made this young man
a promise, didn't I?

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,960
Got time to throw a few?
- Sure!

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
Come on, then!

64
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,840
I forgot the boyfriend was moving.
- Jerry!

65
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,920
His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm sorry. I hated him less
than your other boyfriends.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,040
It wasn't serious, was it?
- Semiserious, yes.

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
You guys aren't-
You know-

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,000
I have been
dating him for seven months.

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,680
What do you think?
- Really? Ooh!

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,640
I was hoping after being married
to me you'd have no strength left.

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Remember, when we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as you were.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,960
Ouch! And the ref
takes a point away.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,200
Out!
- Max is gonna miss him.

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,160
I'll be here.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
Ready? Yeah! Play ball.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Max, come on. We've gotta go.

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Dad, are we really going to wrestling?
- Absolutely, Max Factor.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,240
We just have to stop by
the office for one minute.

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,240
Excuse me, sir. Any spare change?

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out.

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I can't do it.

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,080
Fred, it's your duty to present
the strongest case possible.

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,960
The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,960
Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

86
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,640
That's what he gets paid for.
You get paid to win.

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,920
If you insist
that I take it to trial,

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,560
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically.

89
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,720
But Miranda, I won't lie.

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

91
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Twenty-first floor.
Men's wear.

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,320
Hi, Mr. Reede!
- Whoa!

93
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,320
Hey. Did you do something
to your hair?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
It's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,760
No! That's the thing nowadays, right?

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,120
He said it would accent my facial
features. - That's what it does!

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,840
It completely accents
your facial features.

98
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
We're just gonna go
to my office-

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,400
Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey, Pete.

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,800
You losin' a little weight?
- I don't know. Maybe.

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,280
Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,680
Hey, Mr. Reede.
- Hey... man.

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
It's, uh, Randy.
- Yeah, I know.

104
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,720
Takin' lunch orders.
Anything?

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,760
No, thanks.

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm ready to pop.

107
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,280
I mean, I'm full.
- Okay. Great.

108
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
Max!
- Hi, Greta.

109
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,520
Hey, what's new? - It's my birthday
tomorrow, and we're having a party.

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Wow! I am sure your daddy
has got you something wonderful.

111
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet! Listen, kiddo.

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,480
Why don't you play in my office
for a minute. Sue somebody for
everything they've got.

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,640
Maybe you can send a fax
to one of your girlfriends. Hey, sorry.

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Damn it!
I completely forgot.

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
Oh, what a surprise.

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
You are a saint.
I should buy you a gift.

117
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,960
You did. - I always do
the classy thing. Any calls?

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,920
The Drawlings' clerk needs your filing.
- Tell him it's in the mail.

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,720
Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley
phoned to confirm your meeting tomorrow.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Strep throat. Some kind of virus.
What's goin' around?

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,800
Asian flu?
- Good one.

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,400
And your mother called.
- I'm on vacation.

123
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,800
It's your fifth week.
- Snowed in. Phones are down.

124
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,200
Break mother's heart.
Done. That's it.

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,120
Except Miranda's looking for you.

126
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,560
How much ass do I have to kiss
to make partner?

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Tell her I broke my leg and I had to be
shot. - Tell her yourself.

128
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,040
And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,160
I'll get right on it.
- Miranda! Hey, I didn't see you.

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,560
You look beautiful today.

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,080
Here! I bought you a gift.

132
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,840
Oh, thanks. I heard about
your victory. Congratulations.

133
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,320
You're making quite an impression
on the partnership committee.

134
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,760
That's right!
You folks are meetin' soon.

135
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,040
I've been so busy,
I haven't even thought about it.

136
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Anyway. I have a client
in my office.

137
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Better not keep him waiting.
- Actually, something rather
important's just come up.

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,880
Um, you're not busy tonight, are you?

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
We're not going, are we?

140
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,920
Audrey. You know how there are
moments you know are critical?

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,920
Mm-hmm.
- And choices that have to be made...

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,280
upon which all one's
future happiness will depend?

143
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
This is one of those moments.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
What are you
trying to say?

145
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,840
Will you marry me?

146
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,200
You're moving. - I know, but
l want you and Max to come with me.

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,320
Audrey, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

148
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,200
You know I'm not prone to wild
flights of romantic fancy.

149
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,480
But the thought of you and I
together just makes sense.

150
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,280
Now I'm ready. I think
you're ready. I love Max.

151
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,560
You love Max.
It's right. It fits.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,080
So what do you say?

153
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey, creepy.
Happy birthday.

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,920
How old are you now,
22 or 23?

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm five, Dad.
- Okay.

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,880
Return the beer keg.

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Cancel the dancing girls.

158
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,880
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

159
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,400
I feel completely unprepared
for this.

160
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
You see, I bought you a present,
but last night...

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,400
I accidentally swallowed it.

162
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,080
Dad, it's in your belly!
- Scalpel.

163
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,000
I hope it's not
partially digested!

164
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
Ooh! Look out!

165
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,080
Cool! What is it?
- Cool!

166
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,680
It's- lt's a surprise.

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
All right, it's a pony.
Just open it!

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm gonna help,
'cause I can't stand it!

169
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Baseball stuff!
- Baseball stuff!

170
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Cool! Can we play?

171
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll be Nomo. You can be
Jose Canseco. Can we play?

172
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,640
Absolutely.
- Yeah!

173
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,440
Right after your party
tonight, we'll do it.

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
You and me.

175
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,280
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

176
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,720
Hi!

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Hey! Happy birthday.

178
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,440
Thanks, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Max!

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,000
One, two, three, four, five.
And one for good luck!

180
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,000
He struck the child.
Did you see that?

181
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Look at what Dad got me!
- Whoa! Great!

182
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,400
Hey, I have my glove
in the car.

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,720
Maybe we can stop at the park
on the way home and play catch.

184
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,160
Then tonight we can rub oil in it
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

185
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
It'll be great.
Hey, great gift, Dad!

186
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,040
Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift
could bring those two together.

187
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
My plan to phase myself out
is almost complete.

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,360
Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Come on, Mom.
I want to go play!

190
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,680
And actually it's kind of important,
so maybe we could talk tonight?

191
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Tonight?
- Yes.

192
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,760
Max's birthday party.
- Oh! Yeah.

193
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,200
Sure. Of course.
We'll talk then. Great!

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Maximus! I'm outta here.
- Bye, Dad.

195
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,760
Jerry, enjoy my wife.

196
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Well, this is good.

197
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,840
This is really smart.

198
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Thank you.
- Only-

199
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Well, it's not true.
Does that present a problem?

200
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
Mrs. Cole,
the only problem here...

201
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,280
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support,

202
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,440
of raising his children-
they are his?

203
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,560
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.
One for sure.

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you...

205
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,600
a fair share of the assets based
on one act of indiscretion. - Seven.

206
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Pardon me?
- Seven single acts of indiscretion.

207
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
Seven acts of indiscretion,

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,920
only one of which he has
any evidence of...

209
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,400
and all of which he himself
is responsible for.

210
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
He is?
- Mrs. Cole.

211
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
You're the victim here.
The wife of a cold, distant workaholic.

212
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,960
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man!

213
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,920
Seven.
- Yeah, whatever!

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
You're not trying to deny him
what is rightfully his.

215
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,480
All you're insisting on is what
is rightfully yours. - Yeah.

216
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,440
And maybe a...
fraction more.

217
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
I think you're
bending over backwards.

218
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,640
Yeah. I did offer to
give him joint custody of the kids.

219
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
He is, after all,
a wonderful father.

220
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,840
And how does he repay you?

221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
By dragging you through
a painful litigation process!

222
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,680
No, no, no, no!
This can't happen!

223
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,320
With all due respect, this isn't
about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

224
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,280
This is about all women.

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,640
Where would Tina Turner be right
now if she'd rolled over and said,

226
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,840
<i><b>Hit me again, lke,
and put some stank on it?</b></i>

227
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,960
Rollin' on the river,
that's where she'd be.

228
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,920
But she's beyond Thunderdome,
because she decided to send a message.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,680
Wake up, sisters!
There's no-o-o-o-o-o...

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
such thing as a weaker sex!

231
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,680
You know what?

232
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,240
You're right, Mr. Reede. I am
tired of getting kicked around!

233
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,800
Good for you!

234
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,840
Thank you.
I am so grateful...

235
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,720
to have an attorney
I can trust.

236
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,040
Oh, you are good.

237
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,680
You are very, very good.

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,560
The Cole case is worth
a truckload of money to this firm.

239
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,760
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,400
In fact, how would you
like to make...

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,840
a partner right now, hmm?

242
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh, I don't know.
I should-

243
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
<i><b>Happy, happy, happy
happy, happy, happy</b></i>

244
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,640
<i><b>Happy
I'm so happy today</b></i>

245
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,960
<i><b>I live in the U. S. A.
- So honey?</b></i>

246
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Have you, uh,
thought about-

247
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, what we talked about?
- Uh, yeah. I can't go.

248
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,920
What? Wh-Why not?

249
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,360
Because of Max.
- But he'll love it there.

250
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm gonna take him
to Fenway Park.

251
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,360
There's hiking
and camping-

252
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, really,
it's... Fletcher.

253
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,840
Fletcher?
Come on, honey.

254
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,080
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

255
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,640
I know, but when he does
come over, Max is so happy.

256
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,080
It's like they have their
own little world together.

257
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,880
The gipper and I have that too!
- I know, but it's different.

258
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,480
How?
- Well-

259
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,360
He does the claw.

260
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,240
The what?
- The claw.

261
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,240
You know, it's like this-

262
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,440
I don't-

263
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,120
Run for you life.
It's the claw! The claw!

264
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
I can't really do it that good.
That's not the point.

265
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,240
The point is...

266
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,680
if they're 3, 000 miles apart,
they're never gonna see each other.

267
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,600
Fletcher's never gonna
come to Boston.

268
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,080
Hello.

269
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,040
Audrey?
- Fletcher! Where are you?

270
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,360
We're waiting. Max won't cut the cake
until you get here.

271
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,240
Um- Oh, man!

272
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Actually, something
has come up. I've-

273
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,880
I've got this problem
on a new case.

274
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,800
What happened?
- Nothing!

275
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,040
I stubbed my toe
on the desk!

276
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,800
I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

277
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
The boss is, uh,
really ridin' me.

278
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,680
Fletcher, it's his birthday!

279
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,600
I know, l know.

280
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll
pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?

281
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,240
You're gonna pick him up?
- Yes!

282
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,080
All right, hold on a minute.
You can say happy birthday.

283
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,440
No! Gotta go! Good-bye.

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Hello.

285
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,760
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

286
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,760
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Max</b></i>

287
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,920
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

288
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, birthday boy.
Make a wish.

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,200
Come on, Max.
It can be anything you want.

290
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Anything in the whole world.

291
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,920
Max.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
Your father is sorry.
He had to work.

293
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,640
He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

294
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,880
I know, but he promises that
he is gonna see you tomorrow.

295
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,800
Okay? He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

296
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
So come on.
Make a wish.

297
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,080
<i><b>I wish that for only one day...</b></i>

298
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,960
<i><b>Dad couldn't tell a lie.</b></i>

299
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,120
Mmm. That was incredible.

300
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,360
Was it good for you?

301
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,480
I've had better.

302
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

303
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,160
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

304
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,320
<i><b>l've had better.</b></i>

305
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,240
Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,400
New in the building?
- Yeah, I just moved in Monday.

307
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,560
Oh! You like it so far?
- Everybody's been real nice.

308
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,120
Well, that's because
you have big jugs.

309
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,680
I mean, your boobs
are huge.

310
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,240
I mean, l wanna
squeeze 'em.

311
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
Mama.

312
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Any change, mister?
- Absolutely.

313
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Could you spare some?
- Yes, I could.

314
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,240
Will ya? How come?
- Mm-mm.

315
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,720
Because I believe
you will buy booze with it!

316
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,440
I just wanna get to the office
without being confronted by
the decay of Western society!

317
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,680
Plus, I'm cheap!

318
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,600
Jerk off!

319
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,200
You look like you're
having a rough morning.

320
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,920
Ding, ding, ding!
What do we have for her, Johnny?

321
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Fletcher.
- Dana.

322
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,760
All right, Samantha. How much
will it take to put an end to all this?

323
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,760
Fifty percent of your estate.
- Fifty percent?

324
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,080
With a pre-nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?

325
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,360
Our case is simply this.

326
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,760
Very funny, Fletcher!

327
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,480
You wanna play hardball?
I'm game.

328
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,200
<i><b>You wanna play hardball? I'm game.</b></i>

329
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,840
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

330
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,040
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens.

331
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,040
Honorable?

332
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,440
Good morning.
Call case number BD-09395.

333
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,240
Samantha Cole vs. Richard Cole.

334
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
How are we doing this morning,
Counsel? - Fine. Thank you.

335
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,200
And you, Mr. Reede? - I'm a little upset
about a bad sexual episode last night.

336
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

337
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
In the meantime, what do you say
we get down to business?

338
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,040
First, Mr. Reede, I see-
- I would like a continuance!

339
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,120
This case has been delayed
several times, Mr. Reede.

340
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,320
I realize that, Your Honor, but l would
really, really like a continuance.

341
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,920
I'll have to hear
good cause, Counsel.

342
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
What's the problem?

343
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,800
I can't lie!

344
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,440
Commendable, Mr. Reede, but I'm waiting
to hear good cause. Do you have one or not?

345
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
Not.
- Motion for continuance denied.

346
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,360
Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

347
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,160
I don't think so, Your Honor.
My client has already offered
Mrs Cole 2.4 million dollars.

348
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
But Mr. Reede has made it clear
he has no desire... - Settle!

349
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,160
Settle, settle, settle, settle!
- I don't want to settle.

350
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,320
Mr. Reede. You convinced me
yesterday, I'm the victim!

351
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm starved for affection.
I'm driven into the arms of another man.

352
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Seven!
- Yeah, whatever.

353
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,360
With the story you came up with,
I don't think we can lose.

354
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,600
I want to proceed.
- Mrs. Cole, you don't understand.

355
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,000
Mr. Reede.
Do we have a settlement?

356
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,960
No!

357
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,760
No, Your Honor.
- There's no settlement.

358
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,680
Trial to commence 1:30 sharp.

359
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,680
It was me!

360
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,440
Hi, Mr. Reede!
Like the new dress?

361
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,040
Whatever takes the focus
off your head.

362
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,920
What's up, Fletcher? - Your
cholesterol, fatty! Dead man walkin'.

363
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,120
Hey, Fletcher. - Hey! You're
not important enough to remember.

364
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,000
What's it gonna be, Mr. Reede?
- A pockmark, eventually!

365
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,360
Don't ask!
For God's sakes, don't ask.

366
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,080
All right.
You can beat this.

367
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,920
It's all a matter
of willpower!

368
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,320
A test. Something small.

369
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,360
Red. Red. All right?
Now focus.

370
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,800
The color of this pen
is r-r-r-

371
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,880
The color of this pen...

372
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,760
is re-e-e-e-e-

373
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Re-e-e-e-

374
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,880
The color of the pen
that I hold in my hand...

375
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,760
is r-r-r-r-

376
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,680
r-r-royal blue!

377
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,920
One lie, and I can't say it!

378
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,880
I'll write it.

379
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,280
Write it! Write it,
or I'll break it off!

380
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,360
Agh! No!
Come on! Stop it.

381
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,920
Boss? What happened?

382
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,560
The pen is blue.
The pen is blue!

383
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,160
The goddamn pen is blue!

384
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Mr. Reede, are you all right?

385
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,040
I gotta go home.
- Home? Was the case settled?

386
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,720
No! I have to be
in court at 1:30!

387
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,520
Then how are you going to go home?
- I don't know. I don't know.

388
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Okay. Uh, Mr. Reede,
Reuben and Dunn called.

389
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
They need to know where the
Darby settlement offer stands.

390
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,200
I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

391
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
Dick with them.
Got it.

392
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
And your mother called. Are you
still on vacation? - No.

393
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
Then you're here?
- Yes.

394
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,240
Thank you for clearing
that up, sir.

395
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,480
And your ex-wife called.
She wants to know when you're
coming to pick up your son.

396
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,680
Oh, I'm such a shit!

397
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,760
Hello.
- Audrey?

398
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,560
Fletcher, hi. Are you still picking
Max up from school today?

399
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Here's the thing.
I really can't!

400
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,400
I had a case l was certain would settle,
and it didn't, and I have to go to court.

401
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,840
Right. - It's true! I really
want to see Max today!

402
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,760
I really do.

403
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,520
Uh-huh, but things just keep coming up
at the last minute.

404
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,520
Yes, but this time it's different.
- I see. How is that?

405
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,360
Now I'm telling the truth.
- And last night you weren't.
Well, what were you doing?

406
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,280
Having sex!

407
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,320
Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

408
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,440
No! That's the thing. I don't even
like her, but she's a partner.

409
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,000
I thought l could help my career
by makin' her squeal.

410
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
What's wrong with me?

411
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm-

412
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,160
ls Dad still picking me up?
- No, Max, he's not.

413
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm sorry, but l'm gonna
pick you up, okay?

414
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,120
I'll work it out.

415
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,080
I guess my wish
didn't come true.

416
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,840
What wish? - I wished that for just
one day Dad couldn't tell a lie.

417
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,680
Max?

418
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,000
I have something important
to talk to you about, okay?

419
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,520
Hello? - Audrey! Let me explain.
Something has happened to me.

421
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,360
Well, something else is about to happen
to you. Max and I are moving to Boston.

422
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,560
What?
- Jerry has asked me to marry him,

423
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,160
and Max and I are going
this weekend to look at houses.

424
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,040
I thought it was semiserious!

425
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,760
It's just been given
a violent shove into serious.

426
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
You can't move to Boston;
I'll never see Max!

427
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,600
You'll have the same relationship
you have with him now, won't you?

428
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
Where are you?
- I'm going home.

429
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,560
When you get there, just stay there.
I'm comin' over. We have to talk.

430
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
Fletcher!
- I'll be right there.

431
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,960
Hey, Mr. Reede-

432
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Fletcher.
- Holy hell!

433
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,080
You can run,
but you can't hide.

434
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,800
What's your problem, schmuck?

435
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,080
I'm an inconsiderate prick!

436
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,040
Oh, shit!

437
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,560
Shit!

438
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,040
You know why I pulled you over? - Depends
on how long you were following me!

439
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,360
Why don't we take it from the top?
- Here goes.

440
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
I sped, l followed too closely,
I ran a stop sign,

441
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,280
I almost hit a Chevy, l sped
some more, I failed to yield,

442
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,200
I changed lanes without
signaling while speeding!

443
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,560
Is that all?
- No.

444
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,320
I have unpaid parking tickets.

445
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,200
Be gentle.

446
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,680
Audrey! Wait!

447
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,040
Wait, Audrey. Ooh!
Hold on. Wait!

448
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,240
Wait. I just had an insight
into myself. I'm crazy.

449
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,720
<i><b>You call and say,
Wait, I'll be right over,</b></i>

450
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,280
and here's the crazy part-
I actually wait.

451
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,200
I can explain this.
- I have missed a department meeting.

452
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Did you come in a cab?
- Yes!

453
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Where's your car?

454
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,600
Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

455
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,800
I can. $1,654.11.
- How do you sleep at night?

456
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,200
I'm takin' this.

457
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,880
You scratched my car!

458
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,160
Where?
- Right there!

459
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,520
Oh, there.
That was already there.

460
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,520
Why, you!

461
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,440
You liar!

462
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,680
- You know what I'm gonna
do about this? -What?

463
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,360
Nothing! Because if I take you to court,
it'll drain eight hours out of my life,

464
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,920
and you won't show up, and if I got
the judgement, you'd just stiff me anyway!

465
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So I'm gonna piss and moan
like an impotent jerk...

466
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,360
and then bend over and
take it up the tailpipe!

467
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,400
You been here before,
haven't ya?

468
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,080
Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

469
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,200
but if you'll excuse me,
I have a class.

470
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,120
Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

471
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,520
No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

472
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,720
Wait. I want to talk about this!
- What do you want to say?

473
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,560
Is this guy right for you?
He is so... not me!

474
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,480
That's one of his best qualities.
- But he's kind of a magoo.

475
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm sorry. - You're wrong.
Sometimes maybe he is a little-

476
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Magoo!
- Yes. But since we've been going out-

477
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,360
My God, I'm not having this conversation
with you. - Audrey, you can't go.

478
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,760
This is not fair.
- Fair?

479
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,480
Okay, let's define fair. Last night
a five-year-old boy was crushed...

480
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,040
because his father lied to him
about coming to his birthday party.

481
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,960
Fair?
- Last night-

482
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,840
Was none of my business. None
of my business. - Thank you.

483
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,200
Two years ago, it was my business.
But I don't have to care anymore.

484
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,840
That's the magic of divorce.
But it matters to Max!

485
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,000
Everything you do matters,
and everything you don't do.

486
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,920
All right.
Now let me tell you something.

487
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm a bad father!

488
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,720
I mean-

489
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm a bad father.

490
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,000
You're not a bad father...
when you show up.

491
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,720
What if I come right after court
and play ball?

492
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Then you and I can talk before
you make any rash decisions!

493
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,120
No, we are leaving tonight.

494
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,800
Please, Audrey.
Give me one more chance.

495
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm throwin' myself
on the mercy of the court.

496
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,200
I lost you, but please
don't make me lose Max too.

497
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,160
Give me a chance to be
the father I started out to be.

498
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,920
You're really coming?
- This is ironclad.

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
This is the mother of all promises.
What time?

500
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,880
Okay, 6:00.

501
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,880
Ten to six.
- All right.

502
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,240
All right. But if I tell
Max that you're coming,

503
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,440
and you don't show up and I have
to see that look on his face-

504
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
that heartbreaking look-

505
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,720
we're going to Boston.

506
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,160
If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

507
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,360
I will lovingly wrap your
nicknacks with bubble paper.

508
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
I hope so.

509
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,160
Do you know what your son was doing
at 8:15 last night?

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,640
He was making a birthday wish
that for just one day...

511
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,560
his father couldn't tell a lie.

512
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,560
Oh, my God!
That's it!

513
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,120
<i><b>l do not like them, Sam I Am.</b></i>

514
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,760
<i><b>l do not like green eggs and ham.</b></i>

515
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,360
<i><b>Would you like them here or there?</b></i>

516
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,120
<i><b>I would not like them-
- Excuse me.</b></i>

517
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,400
Hi. I'm Max's bad father-
Er, I'm his father.

518
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,640
Dad! - Could I borrow him
for just one second?

519
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,120
Monster Max!
- You came to play catch?

520
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,800
I'd like to, but I can't.
I gotta talk to you.

521
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,000
Your mommy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

522
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Really? You mean you have to tell
the truth? - Yes.

523
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,120
No matter what?
- No matter what!

524
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,280
Is wrestling real? - In the Olympics,
yes. On channel 23, no.

525
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,200
Will sitting too close to the TV set make
me go blind? - Not in a million years.

526
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,200
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

527
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,160
Uh-uh. In fact some people
make a good living that way.

528
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,880
Now listen, Max.
You've gotta do something for me.

529
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,480
I need you to take back that wish.

530
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,000
So you can lie?
- Yes.

531
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,560
But not to you.
You see, Max,

532
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,720
sometimes grownups need to lie.

533
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
It's hard to explain,
but if-

534
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,120
Look, here's a good example.
When your mommy was pregnant with you,

535
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,880
she gained 40 pounds;
there was nothing she wouldn't eat.

536
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,360
And Daddy was scared.
But when she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

537
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,680
l'd say, "Honey, you look great.
You're glowing. "

538
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,400
lf I had told Mommy she looked like
a cow, it would have hurt her feelings.

539
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,040
Understand? - My teacher tells me
real beauty's on the inside.

540
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,360
That's just something
ugly people say.

541
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,120
Max, no one can survive in the adult
world if they have to stick to the truth.

542
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,000
I could lose my case, l could lose
my promotion, I could even lose my job.

543
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,920
Now, I need your help, Max.

544
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,240
Okay.

545
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,360
Okay. Do whatever
you did last night,

546
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,560
only this time,
make it an "unwish."

547
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,440
I did it.

548
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,680
Excellent!

549
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,240
Now, I just need
a little test.

550
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,600
- Did it work?
- Not like l'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

551
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,680
Only-
- What? Only what?

552
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,040
Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

553
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,480
This time when I unwished it,
I only did it 'cause you told me to.

554
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,560
All right.
Do it again.

555
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,480
And this time, mean it.

556
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,920
But I can't!
- Why not?

557
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,160
'Cause I don't want you to lie.
- I explained this.

558
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
I have to lie.
Everybody lies.

559
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,800
Mommy lies.
Even the wonderful Jerry lies.

560
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,760
But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

561
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,480
Max, recess is over.

562
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,680
Come on in!

563
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,280
Mom says we're moving to Boston.

564
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,600
That isn't for sure yet.

565
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,240
She promised we'd talk
about it tonight.

566
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
I am comin'!

567
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,360
You believe me,
don't you, Max?

568
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,160
I'll see you later, buddy.

569
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,120
Fletcher. How's it hangin'? - Short,
shriveled and always to the left.

570
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,480
Boss, it's Skull.
He knocked over another A.T.M.

571
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,040
This time at knife-point.
He needs your legal advice.

572
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,560
Stop breakin' the law, asshole!

573
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000
Boss, are you all right?

574
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
My son hates me.

575
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,160
Max loves you.
I've seen you together. You're his hero.

576
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,440
Oh, yeah?

577
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,840
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish...

578
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,080
that I wouldn't be able
to lie for one whole day.

579
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Kids.
- It came true.

580
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,120
What?
- Max's wish!

581
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,520
It came true.

582
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,000
Boss, maybe you should
just take a few days off.

583
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,240
Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that
I kept tellin' the truth all morning?

584
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,160
Well, yeah. But-

585
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,520
What are you saying?
That you are incapable of lying?

586
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,600
That's right!
I am incapable of lying!

587
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,880
Just for today?
- Apparently. 'Til 8:15 tonight.

588
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,920
It's one of those
24-hour curses.

589
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,840
Those are goin' around.

590
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,160
You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course not.

591
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,720
How ironic!

592
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,600
Okay. Ask me something
you think I would normally lie about.

593
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,320
All right. Remember a couple
of months ago when I wanted a raise?

594
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,440
I don't want to do this. - And
the company wouldn't give me one...

595
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,720
and I asked if you would give it
to me out of your own pocket...

596
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,840
And you said the company would not allow
it, because it would create jealousy...

597
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,960
among the other secretaries.

598
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,760
Was that true, or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?

599
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,080
Greta, please!

600
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,400
Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm
scheduled in your court in half an hour.

601
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,080
Judge Stevens, I badly, badly
need a continuance. Ill?

602
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,920
Am I ill? That is
the perfect question for you to ask.

603
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,840
Please lie for me!
- I remember when you bought me this...

604
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,920
antique frame from Tiffany's-
Tiffany's?

605
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,360
Garage sale. Six-fifty,
marked down from ten.

606
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,080
I'll give you the raise!

607
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,000
Here's your raise.

608
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,840
Hi, Judge Stevens!
I know l haven't given you an answer.

609
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,800
But illness could mean so many things.

610
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,120
Can you hold?
Hello? Mom!

611
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,680
Hi! I wasn't really
on vacation.

612
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,920
Because I didn't want
to talk to you!

613
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,680
Because you insist on talking about Dad's
bowel movements- size, color, frequency!

614
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,400
I'll call you later!
Hello?

615
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,080
Oh, damn it!
I cut him off.

616
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,840
I cut off the judge!

617
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,920
Greta! Don't leave!

618
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm on my knees
in a 900$ dollars suit!

619
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,200
Mr. Reede. Several years ago,
a friend had a burglar on her roof.

620
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,960
He fell through the skylight, landed on
a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

621
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,320
The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

622
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,520
Because of guys like you, he won!

623
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,840
My friend had to pay the burglar $6,000.
Is that justice?

624
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,120
No. I'd have got him ten.

625
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,760
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.
- No, wait!

626
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,680
I didn't understand!
Ask me again!

627
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,000
Have a nice day in court.
- Greta!

628
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,680
Hi.
- God in heaven!

629
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,040
It's nice to see you too,
Fletcher. Are you busy?

630
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,760
Extremely.
- Good. Would you follow me, please?

631
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,120
Did you know that the partnership
committee is headed by Mr. Allan himself?

632
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,320
You used to work
directly for Mr. Allan.

633
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,760
Yeah.
- Tell me. What do you think of him?

634
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,680
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious bastard!

635
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,360
A belligerent old fart! A steaming pile
of cow dung! Figuratively speaking.

636
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,400
Really? How delightful.
This way.

637
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,720
Pardon me for interrupting.
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

638
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,760
Oh, yes! Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

639
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,720
I'll be observing you
in court this afternoon.

640
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,560
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

641
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,360
Well, Fletcher has just been telling me
how much he thinks of you.

642
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,640
Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?
Well, what do you think of him?

643
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,200
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard.

644
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,240
A belligerent old fart.
A worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

645
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
Figuratively speaking.

646
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,680
That's the funniest damn thing
I've ever heard!

647
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,480
You're a real card, Reede!

648
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,840
I love a good roast!

649
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,200
Do Simmons!

650
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,320
Simmons is old!

651
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,880
He should have been out years ago, but
he can't stay home 'cause he hates his wife!

652
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,040
You've met her
at the Christmas parties.

653
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,320
She's the one that gets plastered
and calls him a retard.

654
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,400
And you, Tom. You're the biggest
brownnose I've ever seen!

655
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,120
You've got your head so far up
Mr. Allan's ass, I can't tell
where you end and he begins!

656
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,280
Priceless!

657
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,040
You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

658
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,520
You couldn't get a porn star
off. Your hairpiece looks like
something that was killed.

659
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,160
I don't know whether to comb it
or scrape it off and bury it in lime!

660
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,480
Loser! Idiot!
Wimp! Degenerate!

661
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,320
Slut!

662
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,160
I like your style, Reede!
That's what this stuffy company needs!

663
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,440
A little irreverence!
- Good! I'll see you later, dick-head!

664
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,920
Dick-head!
Priceless!

665
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,960
Keep your eye on that boy.

666
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,520
Dick-head!

667
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,280
Third District Court is now in session.

668
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,600
The honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens presiding.

669
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,080
Afternoon, Counselors.
Are we ready to begin?

670
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
No, sir!
We are not ready to begin...

671
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,000
because my client
has not arrived!

672
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,920
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

673
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,920
<i><b>Here she comes
to wreck the day</b></i>

674
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,720
Mr. Reede!
- Sorry, Your Honor.

675
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,840
Go, go, go. Lupe,
you keep those kids quiet.

676
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,920
I'm not even close to kidding.
- Sí, seòora.

677
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,280
Sorry.
Billy threw up in the car.

678
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,760
You brought your kids
to your divorce?

679
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,920
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working.

680
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,000
I feel sorry for them already.

681
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,400
Miss Appleton, you may begin.

682
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,000
From March 6 through June 12...

683
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,240
I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.

684
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,880
During that period,
I noted that Mr. Cole...

685
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,960
Ieft each day
between 7:40 and 7:50.

686
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,480
Thereafter Mrs. Cole
would frequently have...

687
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,440
a male visitor arrive and stay
from one to four hours.

688
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,960
I was able to take several photographs
of the male visitor.

689
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,480
I see.

690
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,480
Do you know what Mrs. Cole
and her male visitor did...

691
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,480
during these frequent... visits?

692
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,800
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn,

693
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,320
but I was able to make
a recording of one such session.

694
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,800
Your Honor,
as you are aware,

695
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,200
under the terms
of the prenuptial agreement,

696
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,920
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

697
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,720
With your permission, we'd like to play
the following tape recording.

698
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,640
<i><b>Here comes big daddy!</b></i>

699
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,800
<i><b>Oh, God! Do it to me!</b></i>

700
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,480
<i><b>Do it to me! Harder! Harder!</b></i>

701
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,840
Oh, come on!

702
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,240
Your Honor, how can it be proved
that the male voice on that tape
is not Mr. Cole himself?

703
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,280
<i><b>You are such a better lover
than my husband!</b></i>

704
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,720
Your Honor, I object!
- And why is that, Mr. Reede?

705
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,600
It's devastating to my case!
- Overruled.

706
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Good call!

707
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,080
<i><b>I gotta go. I haven't cleaned your pool.
- Your witness.</b></i>

708
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,000
All right.

709
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,040
Well, Mr. Reede,
you may proceed.

710
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,160
How?

711
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,800
Your Honor, would the court be willing
to grant me a short bathroom break?

712
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,600
Can't it wait?
- Yes, it can.

713
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,920
But I've heard that if you hold it,
it can damage the prostate gland,

714
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,440
making it very difficult
to get an erection!

715
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,200
Is that true?
- It has to be.

716
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,080
Well, in that case, I better
take a little break myself.

717
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,320
But you get back here immediately
so we can finish this.

718
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,360
How am I going
to get out of this?

719
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,960
Think. Think.

720
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,800
Think!

721
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,520
What the hell
are you doing?

722
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,360
I'm kicking my ass!
Do you mind?

723
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,000
I found him like this
in the bathroom, Your Honor.

724
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,960
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

725
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,840
Who did this?
- A madman, Your Honor!

726
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,000
A desperate fool at the end
of his pitiful rope!

727
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,120
What did he look like?

728
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,320
About 6'2", 180 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

729
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,800
Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

730
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,240
Yes, sir.

731
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,760
Order! Order!

732
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,440
Under the circumstances, I have
no choice but to recess this case...

733
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,400
until 9:00 a. m.
tomorrow morning.

734
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,560
Unless, of course, you feel
you can still proceed.

735
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,440
Can you?

736
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,120
Yes, I can.

737
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,000
I admire your courage, Mr. Reede.

738
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,640
We'll take a short recess
so that you can compose yourself,

739
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,760
and then we'll get started.

740
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,080
Here you go.

741
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,880
Hello?

742
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,440
Dad?
- Max? How's it goin'?

743
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,960
Great. You know Paul and Emanuel
from across the street?

744
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,600
Yeah. Uh-huh. - Well, they never
want to play baseball with me.

745
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,920
But I told them I'm playing
tonight with my dad.

746
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,160
So now they want to play.
Is that okay?

747
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,080
Sure. The more the merrier.

748
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Coolest! Do you wanna be
Jose Canseco?

749
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,800
Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna hit
that famous Nomo slider?

750
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,120
Mr. Reede.
- I gotta go now, Max.

751
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,920
I'll see you
in a couple hours. Okay? Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

752
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,280
He's really coming!
I'm gonna go change.

753
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,320
Okay, go ahead!
- Yeah!

754
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
Mr. Reede!

755
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,080
Mr. Reede! Mr. -

756
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,360
This is my lawyer.
He's a little unorthodox.

757
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,000
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth Falk,
the man from the tape.

758
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,560
How could I forget?
- Hey, how you doin'?

759
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,640
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell! Thank you.

760
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,560
You? - Shouldn't we be going
over our testimony right now?

761
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,400
Basically, the plan is,
I walk you through the tape.

762
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,560
Step-by-step,
I ask you questions.

763
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,360
And we give the explanation
you came up with. - Exactly.

764
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,480
All we gotta do is lie.
That sounds simple enough.

765
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,520
Doesn't it!

766
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,360
Then I'll finish up
with dramatic questions.

767
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,840
Something like: Mr. Falk, isn't it true
that you and Mrs. Cole...

768
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,720
have never made...

769
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,760
Ugh! Oh, God!
I can't do it.

770
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,760
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

771
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,320
You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

772
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,400
Respondent calls...

773
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,360
Kenneth Falk.

774
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,080
Raise your right hand.

775
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,000
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

776
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,640
I do! I mean-

777
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,040
I do.

778
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,040
Mr. Falk.

779
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,120
Do you know my client,
Samantha Cole?

780
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,120
Yes.

781
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,880
Isn't it true that your relationship
with my client is entirely platonic?

782
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,880
I object, Your Honor!

783
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,280
To yourself?

784
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,400
Yeah.

785
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,240
But I would like to...
rephrase the question.

786
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,800
Mr. Falk, would I be accurate...

787
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,400
if I described your relationship
with Mrs. Cole as totally professional?

788
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,480
I object, Your Honor,
and I move to strike!

789
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,040
Mr. Reede, I don't know
what you're on,

790
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,480
but you better get
to the point and quick.

791
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,720
Thank you, sir.

792
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,880
Is your relationship
with my client entirely platonic?

793
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,560
Not! Is not your relationship
with my client:

794
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,760
<i><b>Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!</b></i>

795
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,880
Did you ever not make lo-

796
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,840
Did you-
- Mr. Reede!

797
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,880
You had sex with her every time you met,
didn't you? Didn't you! Liar!

798
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,000
He's badgering the witness.
- It's his witness.

799
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,480
You slammed her! You dunked her donuts!
You gave her dog a "snaussage"!

800
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,840
You stuffed her
like a Thanksgiving turkey!

801
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,960
All right, it's true, okay! I humped
her brains out! There! Now you happy?

802
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,240
No further questions.

803
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,040
No questions.

804
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,920
You may step down.

805
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,400
Do I dare ask you
to call your next witness?

806
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,360
I have no further witnesses,
Your Honor.

807
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,200
What are you doing?
Call me!

808
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,400
You do not understand.
I can't lie.

809
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,280
I can't do anything dishonest
until 8:15 tonight!

810
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,320
Listen, you bastard!
I want my money!

811
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,600
I am not going to end up
a 31-year-old divorcee on welfare...

812
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,120
because my scumbag attorney
had a sudden attack of conscience!

813
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,600
Thirty-one?

814
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,560
If Mr. Reede has
no further witnesses,

815
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,960
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of-

816
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,840
Your Honor!

817
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,840
I call Samantha Cole
to the stand.

818
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,680
Order.

819
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,520
Order! Order!

820
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,880
Knock it off!
- Sit down!

821
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,160
Mr. Reede, it is out of
sheer morbid curiosity...

822
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,840
I'm allowing this...
freak show to continue.

823
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,960
Mrs. Cole...
if you dare.

824
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,280
Mrs. Cole...

825
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,680
is this a copy
of your driver's license?

826
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,480
Yes. - It says here
you're a blonde. Are you?

827
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,320
If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

828
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,960
Brunette. - We can play the tape
again. Maybe it's on there.

829
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm a brunette!

830
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,200
Thank you.
Now let's see.

831
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,200
<i><b>Weight: 105.
Yeah! In your bra.</b></i>

832
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,120
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

833
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,040
Bastard!
- Hag!

834
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,920
Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

835
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,600
One-eighteen.

836
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,520
All right, fine, fine.
I'm 127.

837
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,560
Uh-huh. And it says here
you were born in 1964,

838
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,840
but that's not true
either, is it?

839
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,760
Is it!
- No.

840
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,560
Will you tell me what it says here on your
birth certificate under "date of birth"?

841
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,080
Your Honor, what does this
have to do with anything?

842
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,960
Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

843
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,160
<i><b>1965.</b></i>

844
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,560
Now let me get this straight.

845
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,160
That would mean that you lied
about your age to make yourself older.

846
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,400
But why would any woman
want to do that?

847
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,920
I changed it
so I could get married.

848
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,360
And the truth
shall set you free!

849
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,040
My client lied about her age!

850
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,360
She was only 17 when she got married,
which makes her a minor,

851
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,720
and in the great
state of California,

852
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,000
no minor can enter
into any legal contract...

853
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,200
without parental consent,
including-

854
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,120
Prenuptial agreements.

855
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,040
Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

856
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,680
The fact that my client has been ridden
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

857
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,640
Standard Community Property applies, and she
is entitled to half of the marital assets,

858
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,120
or $11.395 million!

859
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,320
Jordan fades back. Swoosh!
And that's the game!

860
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,400
Nothing further, Your Honor.

861
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,040
Order. Order. Order!

862
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,320
In light of this new evidence,

863
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,840
the court must rule
in favor of Mrs. Cole.

864
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,800
Yes! - She is hereby awarded
half the marital assets.

865
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,680
The son of a bitch pulled it off!

866
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,920
I didn't know! - It doesn't
matter. The contract's void.

867
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,880
Order. Order.

868
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,320
I understand both parties
have agreed to joint custody.

869
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,880
Is that correct?
- Yes.

870
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,360
Yes.
- No.

871
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,280
I'm contesting custody.

872
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,760
What?
- If I get sole custody,

873
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,280
that's another ten grand
in child support payments.

874
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,640
You just won $11 million!

875
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,440
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

876
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,800
Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.

877
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,080
But you-
you said he was a good father.

878
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,560
So?

879
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,040
Well, Mr. Reede, do we have
an agreement on custody or not?

880
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,440
No.

881
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,280
I see.

882
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,080
In that case, there will be a custody
hearing on the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

883
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,360
Court is adjourned.

884
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,800
Come on, let's go.
- Daddy!

885
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,680
You stop that whining, or I'll
give you something to whine about!

886
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,320
I wanna go with Daddy!

887
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,120
Come here, kids. Come on.
It's all right. Don't you worry.

888
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,200
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

889
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,240
It's okay. It's okay.

890
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,200
Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

891
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,080
Let go of Daddy! Let go of him!
Let go of Daddy!

892
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,400
We're leaving now! Lupe, come on!
- Sí, seòora.

893
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,520
Don't you have some checks to write?
You haven't paid for them yet.

894
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,840
I love children.

895
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,720
They give you so much leverage
in a case like this.

896
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,960
You did an incredible job, partner.

897
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,240
Look at him.

898
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,680
He's stunned.
He can't believe it.

899
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,320
Your Honor, may I please
approach the bench?

900
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,640
We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

901
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,040
Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

902
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,480
Mr. Reede, I am tired
and very cranky.

903
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,160
I know, but this is
just... wrong, isn't it?

904
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,240
I manipulated the system.

905
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,080
Just because you bought it doesn't mean
I'm right. It's a technicality!

906
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,160
Young man, having my judgement
mocked in my own court...

907
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,480
is not something
I'm prepared to tolerate!

908
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,680
Well, tell that to the kids when they're
adopted... by the Manson family!

909
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,640
One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,
and I'll hold you in contempt!

910
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,520
I hold myself in contempt!

911
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,720
Why should you be any different?

912
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,720
Bailiff, take him away!

913
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,560
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

914
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,720
Oh, no, don't do this!
I have a date to play ball with my son!

915
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,320
I can't be late!
It's my last chance!

916
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,640
I'm Jose Canseco!

917
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,960
I'm Jose Canseco!

918
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,680
Phone call!
Phone call!

919
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,560
I get a phone call!
I get a phone call!

920
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,680
I get a phone call!

921
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,120
Hello?

922
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,720
Audrey, it's me.
Don't hang up!

923
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,280
I can't talk right now.
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

924
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,320
What? - I'm taking Max someplace
where you can't do this anymore.

925
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,560
Audrey, wait! The most amazing
thing has happened to me.

926
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,200
I'm a changed man! Just come to
the courthouse with $1,000 and bail me out.

927
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,120
Hello? Hello?

928
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,280
Time's up, pal. - No, just one
more call. Just one more call.

929
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,400
Okay, let's go.

930
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,880
Ready?
- Yeah.

931
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,760
Will you get the door, please?
- Okay.

932
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,000
Thank you.

933
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,400
Mr. Reede, you made bail.

934
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,440
Greta! Oh, thank God!

935
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,960
Am I too late?
Have you been sexually molested yet?

936
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,400
Because I could circle the block.

937
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,720
How did you know I was here?

938
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,960
One of the other secretaries
called me at home,

939
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,360
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

940
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,600
Yeah, I think I'm fired.
Isn't that great?

941
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,880
I'll start my own firm.
Do you need a job?

942
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,360
I don't think
you can afford me.

943
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh, man, I gotta get my car.
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

944
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,640
I could lose Max forever.
I can't let that happen. I love him!

945
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,200
You know, this truth stuff
is pretty cool.

946
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,120
I love my son!
I love my son!

947
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,720
I love my son!
I love my son!

948
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,320
Hey, need some change?
Take everything!

949
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,080
But it's not gonna make you happy.

950
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,480
I love my son!

951
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,720
I love my son!

952
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,440
I love my son!

953
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,720
Hey, there you are!

954
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,440
Hi.
- Just in time.

955
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,400
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my entire life.

956
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,600
O-Oh! Well, m-me, m-mine-

957
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,920
Well, ours... also.

958
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,320
Hey, gipper. I have something
for you, young man.

959
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,000
Ooh, watch yourself.
It's the claw!

960
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,560
Ooh, the claw's comin' at ya.

961
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,400
Ooh, you're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

962
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,480
Jerry. Jerry.
- Huh?

963
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,720
It's okay.
You don't have to-

964
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,160
Tower Air flight 1511
to Boston is now boarding.

965
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,080
Ooh, that's us.
- Yeah.

966
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,680
Ready to go?
- Yes. You ready?

967
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,800
Okay.
- Great.

968
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,600
Jim Rubing, please report
to Airport Security.

969
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,680
Excuse me!

970
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,560
What gate is flight 1511 leaving from?
It's an emergency!

971
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,800
Gate number 123,
but you'll never make it.
Flight's already boarding.

972
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,520
It takes more than a half hour
to get through security.

973
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,360
If you want to go to Boston,
there's another flight leaving
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

974
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,600
Flight number one-twenty-

975
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,440
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard flight 1511...

976
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,640
from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

977
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,320
We'll be departing shortly, and if you
need help stowing your carry-on items-

978
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,200
Honey, can I help you?
- I'm fine.

979
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,080
Are you sure?
- Jerry, I can open the bag!

980
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,680
Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

981
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,760
Yes. Anything
with alcohol, please.

982
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,160
Audrey.

983
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,840
If you'll focus on the screen,
we'll be running a safety video.

984
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,960
How about that drink?

985
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,400
Max! Max!

986
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,840
Max!

987
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,120
Wait!

988
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,360
That oughta do it.

989
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,680
Thanks! It's running great!

990
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,720
Max!

991
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,680
Hey! Max!

992
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,200
Max! I'm coming!

993
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,200
Max!

994
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,600
Max! Max, where are you?

995
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,680
I love you.

996
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,360
Thank you.

997
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,240
That wasn't exactly
the answer I was looking for.

998
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,160
Thank you very much?

999
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,480
I'm sorry. It's just-
- Too fast?

1000
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,840
It was too fast, wasn't it?
- No, i-it's-

1001
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,160
Chemistry?
Whatever it is, we can work on it.

1002
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,560
No, no, no. It's just that-
- Oh, my God, it's Fletcher!

1003
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,280
No, no, this has nothing to do with
Fletcher. - No, honey, it's Fletcher.

1004
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,440
What?
- Dad?

1005
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,440
I made it!
I'm late, but I made it!

1006
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,160
What is he doing?

1007
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,760
He came to see us off. Wave.

1008
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,560
I won't let you go!

1009
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,800
Oh, shit!

1010
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,280
Control one-nine, this is
Tower 1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff.

1011
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,840
What was that?
- Looked like a shoe.

1012
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,040
Pull over!

1013
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,560
Pull this thing over!

1014
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,520
Control one-nine, some idiot
has hijacked a flight of stairs.
We're gonna stop this plane.

1015
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,040
One-nine Control. We copy.

1016
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,480
No-o-o-o-o!

1017
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,160
You people are all doing
a wonderful job!

1018
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,240
That's far enough, folks.

1019
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,960
He's my husband-
was my husband.

1020
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,920
All right, go ahead.
- Okay.

1021
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,080
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay?

1022
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,520
Audrey! Great news!
- Fletcher!

1023
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,720
Both my legs are broken,
so they can't take me right to jail.

1024
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,600
Fletcher, what were you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

1025
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,360
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

1026
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,680
Dad?
- Creep.

1027
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,200
He was getting kind of upset.
- Are you all right?

1028
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,280
Yeah. I'm hurtin' here, though.

1029
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,840
I'm a dope, Max.

1030
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,240
All this time
you've been here...

1031
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,000
and I could see you anytime,
but I didn't.

1032
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,440
Then your mom told me you were moving
to Boston, and I started thinking.

1033
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,000
I could be sitting around
sometime and...

1034
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:02,520
want to look at you
and hold you and play with you,

1035
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,680
and I won't be able to.

1036
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,080
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

1037
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,120
I love you more than anything else
in the world, Max,

1038
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,400
and you know it's true.

1039
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,400
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true. Not today.

1040
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,160
I love you, and I'll
never hurt you again.

1041
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,680
He's telling the truth, Mom.
He's not allowed to lie.

1042
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,440
I made a wish, and anything Dad
says today has to be the truth.

1043
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,360
Max.

1044
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,760
It's 8:45.

1045
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,040
You made the wish at 8:15.

1046
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,840
I've been able to lie
for the last half hour.

1047
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,000
So you weren't-
- No, it was the truth!

1048
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,400
I just wanted
to be honest with you.

1049
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,800
I always want
to be honest with you.

1050
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,040
Mom, do we have to go to Boston?

1051
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,080
No, Max, you don't have to go.

1052
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,640
I, on the other hand,
do have to.

1053
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,440
A hospital to run.

1054
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,480
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

1055
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,680
Thank you.

1056
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,200
Looks like he's
got his father back.

1057
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:46,000
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Maximus</b></i>

1058
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:52,240
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

1059
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,280
Okay, Max, make a wish.

1060
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,800
Ahhh, wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

1061
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,760
Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are
the odds of that happening again?

1062
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,040
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1063
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,120
Okay, Max, go ahead.

1064
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,040
Mom? Dad?

1065
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,040
Max!

1066
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,640
Did you wish for your mom and I
to get back together again?

1067
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,040
No, I wished for Rollerblades.

1068
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,120
Do you want to cut the cake...

1069
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,040
Dad?

1070
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,200
I'd love to.

1071
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,000
But I have
this horrible pain in my arm.

1072
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh, no, it's the claw!

1073
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,800
No one can stop the claw!

1074
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,000
No one can stop it!

1075
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,240
Nothing can stop the claw!

1076
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,000
If I was a boxer, l would bounce
those things like Sugar Ray Leonard.

1077
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,920
I'm sorry.

1078
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,320
Brought your kids
to your divorce?

1079
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,280
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working!

1080
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,760
I feel sorry for them already.

1081
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,840
For this you will pay
a terrible price.

1082
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,760
Well, it's working!
I feel sorry for them already.

1083
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,120
Mrs. Cole...

1084
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,760
a goose.

1085
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,200
Including-

1086
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,120
Prenuptial agreements.

1087
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,360
<i><b>Prenuptial agreements</b></i>

1088
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,000
No! I'd have got him ten.

1089
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,240
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

1090
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,680
No! Wait!
I didn't know she had-

1091
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,400
Oh, shit.

1092
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,240
<i><b>Now let's see.
Weight: 105?</b></i>

1093
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,280
Yeah! In your bra.

1094
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,520
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

1095
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,600
Overactor!
- Jezebel!

1096
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,520
He put me up to it.

1097
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:39,400
Yeah, sure he did.

1098
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,360
Oh, no.
They're onto me.
