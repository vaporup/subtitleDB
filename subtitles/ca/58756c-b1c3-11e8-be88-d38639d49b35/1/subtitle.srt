1
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,260
Rule number one, know your products.

2
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:54,305
Okay, whether it's a PC or a piece of paper;
know how it works.

3
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,852
Number two, know your customers.

4
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,313
Learn everything you can about them.

5
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:05,608
Listen to what they want
and what they don't want.

6
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,030
Rule number three, go the extra yard, okay?

7
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:15,201
If you don't have the answer; find it.
it's that simple.

8
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,913
Okay, let's go get those numbers up.

9
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,000
- Hi, Nick.
- Hey, Gary.

10
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,253
- Solid presentation there.
- Thank you.

11
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:28,172
Same one you gave last month, right?

12
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,800
How'd it go in Houston?

13
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,302
Great. It went great.

14
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:35,054
- How's the wife?
- She's fine, thank you.

15
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,515
- Kids?
- Kids?

16
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,310
I don't have kids.

17
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,313
Oh, right. Yeah. You don't have kids.

18
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,613
So listen, Nick.

19
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,449
The company has decided to make a change.

20
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,659
My numbers are as solid
as they've ever been.

21
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:58,953
- it's not about numbers anymore.
- I've done everything the company

22
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,288
has asked me to do.

23
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,041
I promised that my drinking would be
under control, and it is.

24
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,751
Not in Denver, apparently.

25
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,806
I made this office into a major player
My record reflects that.

26
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,892
You want to talk about your record, Nick?

27
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,104
1998, one month paid leave
for alcohol counseling.

28
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:29,317
2000, another 30 days.
2001, accused of assault.

29
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,569
It was a softball game.
The guy was blocking the plate.

30
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,488
2003, DUI.

31
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,823
2005, destruction of corporate can

32
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,368
I've given 16 years of my life
to this company.

33
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,205
And the company has rewarded you
very well for your loyalty.

34
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,418
Mr. Goodson and the rest of the higher-ups
wanted you to have this

35
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,796
as a token of their appreciation.

36
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,799
You can keep the corporate car
until the end of the month.

37
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,176
You can keep your health benefits, too,
which is good.

38
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,512
Your files are all corporate property,
of course,

39
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:02,308
but you can take three file boxes with you
containing your personal items.

40
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,268
That should just about cover it.

41
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,033
And one of those cherry Slurpees, too.

42
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,287
- This guy. I don't know.
- I got it. I got it.

43
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,124
Hey, bro, I'll give you 10 bucks
for that twack right there.

44
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,959
Aren't you a little young
to be drinking beers?

45
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,545
Aren't you a little old to be drinking
that Slurpee there, gray balls?

46
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,839
Is that what they teach you in school,
little shit?

47
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,049
What?

48
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,423
Hi. Are you in there?

49
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:08,304
If you are, can this happen another day?

50
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:47,426
Hi, it's Nick. I’m back.

51
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,803
I got your letter

52
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,430
I really want to talk to you, okay?

53
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,100
I 'll just be getting some
of the stuff off the lawn

54
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,770
and getting it out of here
if that's all right with you.

55
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,231
When you're ready, we can talk.

56
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,402
And you probably already heard,

57
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,905
I lost my job today. So...

58
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,868
Okay, bye.

59
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,761
Oh, great.

60
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,438
Hey, Elliot. You're home early.

61
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,274
Well, benefit of being the boss, I guess.

62
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:50,322
You know, having all that stuff on your lawn
is gonna destroy your root system.

63
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,826
Yeah, I'm sorry about the mess.

64
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,371
- I'll have it cleaned up by tomorrow.
- Great.

65
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:03,252
Listen, Nick. You know me,
I try to keep out of people's way.

66
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,338
But if I'm honest,
I saw this coming a mile away.

67
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,215
Thanks for warning me.

68
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,884
No problem.

69
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,443
Come on.

70
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,088
I like your bumper stickers.

71
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,926
Right, I probably should have taken them off
before I hit Texas, right?

72
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,762
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

73
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,349
I'm Nick. My wife Catherine
and I live across the street.

74
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,935
Samantha.

75
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,354
You can just put that in there
with the others.

76
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,521
Okay.

77
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,443
So are you getting rid of your old stuff?

78
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,238
Yeah. Just a little spring cleaning.

79
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:24,036
- You a photographer?
- Yeah. Photography teacher.

80
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,747
- Really? Where do you teach?
- New York.

81
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:31,961
My husband...
Well, we are relocating for work.

82
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,879
I lived in Newark for two years.

83
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,881
Westchester County.

84
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,633
Well, welcome to Arizona.

85
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,051
Thank you.

86
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:45,683
Hey, could I ask you a favor?
Would you mind watching my stuff?

87
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,436
- I just need to run to the store real quick.
- Sure, yeah.

88
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,941
You know, no, I can't.
I have to go meet my new doctor.

89
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,193
Sure. Sure, I understand.

90
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,238
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

91
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,490
Yeah, likewise. I'll see you around.

92
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,700
Yeah.

93
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,965
Can I help you?

94
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,219
Do you live around here?

95
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,972
My mom takes care of the lady
down the street.

96
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,558
Why aren't you at work?

97
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,977
I got the day off.

98
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,479
Why'd you get the day off?

99
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,190
Personal stuff.

100
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,234
With your wife?

101
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,612
Why do you say that?

102
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,781
I saw her yesterday.

103
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,492
Some dudes came over, too.

104
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:47,703
What dudes?

105
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,082
Like a locksmith guy, an alarm guy,

106
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,336
and, like, some movers.

107
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,173
She say anything?

108
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,050
She was screaming a lot.

109
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,135
And crying.

110
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,765
What's your name?

111
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,768
Kenny Loftus.

112
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,729
Listen, Kenny, are you hungry?

113
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,735
If you stay here and watch my stuff,
I'll go buy us some food, huh?

114
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,779
How's that sound?

115
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,614
Here's 5 bucks. Okay?

116
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,950
You just can't leave.
And don't touch anything.

117
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,789
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, the liquor store.

118
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,918
- What about the mini-mart?
- Yeah, I can go to the mini-mart.

119
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,337
If I go to the mini-mart,
will you stay here and watch my stuff?

120
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,010
I'd like some beef jerky and a Diet Coke.

121
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,470
Okay.

122
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,474
Oh, shit.

123
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,229
- What are you looking for?
- My car keys.

124
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:59,483
- You want to borrow my bike?
- No, I'll find them.

125
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,178
Sorry, dude, it didn't go through.

126
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,097
Can you just swipe it again, please?

127
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,142
It didn't go through, Mr. Halsey.

128
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,309
- Really?
- Nope.

129
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,478
Something's probably wrong
with the machine.

130
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,189
- Can you just call it in?
- I can't call it in, man.

131
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,360
- How much is it?
- $37.50.

132
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,033
Hey, honey, it's Nick.

133
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:54,913
I just tried to buy some things
with the credit cards and they didn't work.

134
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:59,585
Look, I'm gonna need them
to pay someone to move stuff off the lawn.

135
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:05,215
So if you can just call me back
and we can possibly work this out,

136
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,386
I'd really appreciate it. Okay?
Thank you. Bye.

137
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,348
Mr. Halsey, I checked the ATM
it's working fine.

138
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,102
Okay. Well, that doesn't make any sense.
There's $45,000 in that account.

139
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,812
The money's still there.

140
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,356
But apparently someone
put a stop on that account.

141
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,941
But that's my account.

142
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,526
Technically, it's a joint account

143
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,321
and either you or your wife
can put a stop on it.

144
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,364
Who authorized that?

145
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:34,953
You did. Your signature is right here, sir.

146
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,206
Next to your wife's.

147
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,171
Your service
has been temporarily suspended.

148
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,715
For an emergency, dial 9-1-1.

149
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,949
Can I help you?

150
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,534
Yeah, this is my car.

151
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,787
This car belongs to Office Expo Inc.

152
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,081
Really?
Well, that's my stuff right back there.

153
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,291
If it's inside the car,
it belongs to the company now.

154
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,460
So you're gonna have to
take it up with them.

155
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,296
Hey. Hey, look.

156
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,591
I don't want any problems, okay?
I just want my stuff.

157
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,556
Excuse me. Hey. Hey, hey!

158
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,849
This is my car.

159
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,561
Those are my golf clubs.
Those are my golf clubs.

160
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,829
Why didn't you try to stop him?

161
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,914
He said it was his car.

162
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,751
Did you get my jerky?

163
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,545
Yeah.

164
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,634
Where'd you get that?

165
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,012
- That?
- Yeah.

166
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,098
- In the pile.
- I told you not to touch anything.

167
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,058
Why?

168
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,604
'Cause some of it, like this,

169
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,731
is worth a lot of money.

170
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,025
You know what this is?

171
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,028
A baseball?

172
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:35,532
A baseball signed by the entire
'78 world champion Yankees.

173
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,369
Reggie Jackson?

174
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,663
Thurman Munson?

175
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,540
Ron Guidry?

176
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,880
Never mind.

177
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,551
We have a good team at my school.

178
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,511
Yeah? Do you play?

179
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,766
I tried out last year, but I didn't make it.

180
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,768
Well, there's always next year.

181
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,606
Look, I've got work I've got to do here. So...

182
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,197
Isn't your mom worried about you?

183
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,533
She'll be gone till Miss Cooper dies.

184
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,285
She just leaves you alone?

185
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,164
My sister comes around at night.

186
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:28,460
Kenny, I'm gonna try the direct approach
with you, okay?

187
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,463
I need you to leave. Now.

188
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,846
I found your keys.

189
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:27,204
571 Xray. Yeah, we're out here.
Code 4 for now.

190
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,873
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

191
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,374
Can I see some identification, please?

192
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,668
I left it in my car.

193
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,545
And where's your car?

194
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,549
It's gone.
Even though, technically, it wasn't mine.

195
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,135
You want to tell me
what you're doing out here?

196
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,806
Yeah, I would.
I'm just organizing some of my things.

197
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:46,973
Why? Is there a problem?

198
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,726
Yeah, we've gotten some complaints
about someone living on their lawn.

199
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,938
Really? Who complained?

200
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,606
I can't tell you that, sir.

201
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:01,571
Well, this is my lawn. And this is my house.

202
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,616
And I'm pretty sure
I can do whatever I want on my property.

203
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,993
How much have you had to drink?

204
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,622
In my opinion, not enough.

205
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,333
You know there's a law against having
open containers in public, right?

206
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,878
There's a law that says I can't drink
a fucking beer on my front lawn?

207
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,380
Sir, you're gonna have to come with me.

208
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,299
I can't leave my stuff.

209
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,593
Your things will be fine. Let's go.
Turn around.

210
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,221
571 Xray. Yeah, why don't you...

211
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,181
Hey, stop talking into that thing.

212
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,350
- Stand by.
- Just listen to me.

213
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,519
Call Detective Frank Garcia, okay?

214
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,354
You want me to call Detective Garcia?

215
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,524
Yeah, call him. Call him. He'll fix all of this.

216
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,985
He wasn't violent, right?

217
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,362
No, man, he's just been drinking.
He asked me to call you.

218
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,614
Thanks, man. I got it from here.

219
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:51,746
I came as soon as I could.
I had a double homicide.

220
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,957
Thanks, Frank.

221
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,418
Did you talk to her?

222
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,463
No, I think it's worth
giving her a little time on this one.

223
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,009
She changed all the locks, you know?

224
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,219
Garage code.

225
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,930
How do you change the garage code?

226
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,768
You haven't tried to break in yet.
I'm impressed.

227
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,062
Last time I broke in, you arrested me.

228
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,731
That's right.

229
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,733
You know that the moment
that you even thought

230
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,735
about having a drink
you should have just called me.

231
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,696
Well, let's see.

232
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,574
Yesterday, what happened?

233
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:31,369
I got fired from my job and my wife left me.

234
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,414
So somehow calling you slipped my mind.

235
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
I got it. I got it.

236
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:44,466
You know, they say that the dining room
is the least utilized room in the house.

237
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,217
I think it's the front lawn.

238
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,638
It's starting to look good, don't you think?

239
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,350
I don't care how it looks.
You can't stay here. it's illegal.

240
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,396
I paid for this house, for her fish,
for this lawn.

241
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,981
This is my house.

242
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,525
- What's your point?
- My point?

243
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:09,950
This is my corner. Okay?
I'm not leaving my stuff.

244
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,502
All right. I'll call dispatch
and make sure nobody comes by tonight.

245
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,713
But slow down on the beer, yeah?
Get some rest.

246
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,800
We'll figure this out tomorrow.

247
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,475
She's coming up on a year.

248
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,478
I know, Nick. We still go to meetings.

249
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,649
- Hey, Frank.
- Yeah?

250
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,111
You're a good sponsor, you know?

251
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,156
Actually, Nick, I'm not.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

252
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,844
It's a great rug.

253
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,597
Yeah, it was my mom's.

254
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,641
I got you some coffee and cigarettes.

255
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,768
I quit smoking.

256
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,231
Thanks.

257
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,193
You need any help moving today?

258
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,529
No, I'm good.

259
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,949
Really? Not planning to leave
anytime soon?

260
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,535
Well, since I don't have any money
or car or phone,

261
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:01,371
I was just thinking about just staying here.

262
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,501
Do you honestly think
that this is how you're gonna get her back?

263
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,628
I'm just living day to day.

264
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,963
Right. Right.

265
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,465
How many days you think
it's gonna take to get your shit together?

266
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,134
You're gonna make me leave?

267
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,971
I'm not gonna tell you what to do
because we both know that doesn't work.

268
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,473
But if it takes you sitting here

269
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,310
and making an idiot out of yourself
to get cleaned up, then so be it.

270
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,564
The city of Arcadia

271
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,986
allows a property owner to hold a yard sale
for no more than five consecutive days.

272
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,571
This buys you three days.

273
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,828
I don't want to sell my stuff.

274
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,039
Sell your crap, don't sell your crap.
I don't care.

275
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,958
But after this, you move on.

276
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,588
I got you some pens
and some paper to make signs.

277
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,507
I got to make signs?

278
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,178
- That was a joke.
- Don't make an ass out of me, Nick.

279
00:27:58,261 --> 00:27:59,512
No, it was a funny joke.

280
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,347
You have three days
to get your shit together.

281
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,558
If not, I'm gonna have to
haul your ass off to jail.

282
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,117
Right. Mount Rushmore.

283
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,537
Grand Canyon.

284
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:25,997
That's nice.

285
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,137
- Hey, Kenny.
- Hey.

286
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,101
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- It's cool, man.

287
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,520
How's your penmanship?

288
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,647
Pretty good.

289
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,651
I was thinking,
seeing as you're not doing anything

290
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,195
but riding your bike all day,

291
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,571
you might want to come work for me.

292
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,865
What Kind of work?

293
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,202
Make some signs.
Maybe sell a couple of things.

294
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,706
What are you offering?

295
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,210
Discussing salary and responsibility
upfront, smart, very smart.

296
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,671
I'm thinking 4 bucks an hour, okay?

297
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,801
If I have to leave, you stay here,
watch my stuff, act tough.

298
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,597
I'll feed you, give you bathroom and
cigarette breaks as required by state law.

299
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,558
I don't smoke.

300
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,312
Good. Great. So do we got a deal?

301
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,899
Arizona minimum wage is $7.25.

302
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,818
Okay, $7.25 it is.

303
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,071
What? It's a good deal.

304
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,242
I want to learn to play baseball.

305
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:28,911
You want me to teach you
how to play baseball?

306
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,373
Yeah, I don't know.

307
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,751
I see all your trophies and stuff on the lawn.

308
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,545
Yeah, I know. That's from high school.

309
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,006
Why do you want to learn to play baseball?

310
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,051
My mom says I need the exercise.

311
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,096
Okay, I could see that.

312
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,931
And my dad played.

313
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,643
Okay.

314
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,937
Now we got a deal?

315
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,025
- Deal.
- Okay.

316
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,113
Start making some signs.
This is the sign area right here.

317
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:07,200
No, I haven't met the neighbors yet.

318
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,746
Yes, there's grass.

319
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,373
What about these clothes?

320
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,791
Keep.

321
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:19,462
Put them in that top, left-hand drawer.

322
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,177
What about these?

323
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,809
Yeah, those.

324
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,977
Think I want to hold onto those.

325
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:38,064
They're actually pretty valuable.
You'd be surprised.

326
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,941
You can put 'em in that same drawer.

327
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,985
I'll know that they're there in case I want to

328
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,322
look at 'em.

329
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:50,118
So when are you coming?

330
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,165
Well...

331
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:01,254
Okay. Okay, Well, when will you know?

332
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,514
- Can I help you?
- How much?

333
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:16,936
I'm sorry, the shoes are not for sale.
They shouldn't be over there, actually.

334
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,445
How much for the chair?

335
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,073
You know, it's not for sale, either.

336
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:39,917
How much for this?

337
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,546
- You want to buy that?
- How much is it?

338
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,049
50 CENTS.

339
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,802
I'll give you 25 cents.

340
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,804
Yeah, I just can't do that.

341
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:58,436
Hold on, hold on.
Let's keep it at 50 and let's see.

342
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,815
I'll throw in some floss.

343
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,404
Great. Have a good one.

344
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:14,785
Rule number eight,
always give 'em a little something extra.

345
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,288
There's your take.

346
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,418
- Can we work on baseball now?
- I'm beat.

347
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:27,924
Why don't you go hang some more signs
or something and we'll call it a day?

348
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,264
I don't know why I'm hanging signs
if you're not gonna sell anything.

349
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,101
I sold some mouthwash.

350
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,021
Okay.

351
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,525
- Thank you.
- Sure.

352
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,987
- Where do you want this?
- I guess, just...

353
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,990
You can just leave it over there somewhere.

354
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,579
So is this your first time for a yard sale?

355
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,585
Yeah. Yeah, it is, actually.

356
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,423
Watch out for the pros on Saturday.

357
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,842
They’ll try to beat you up on price.

358
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,137
Do you go to a lot of them?

359
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,182
Yeah, they're good for finding old cameras.

360
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,353
Once you get rid of all that stuff,
you're gonna feel great.

361
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,523
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

362
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:30,403
Hey. I was gonna order Chinese food.

363
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,489
It's not New York, but...

364
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,077
You know, I have a lot of stuff to do
before my husband gets here.

365
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,038
Right. No, I understand.

366
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:44,166
- But thank you for the offer.
- Sure.

367
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,044
Could I use your phone?

368
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:49,880
To order?

369
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:06,939
Hey.

370
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,995
- Hey.
- Hi.

371
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,955
I saw you got your food

372
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,958
and I thought you could use
something to eat with.

373
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,628
- Here.
- Well, thank you.

374
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,171
You're welcome.

375
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:34,258
Can I... Do you want...
Can I make you a plate?

376
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,637
- Yeah, sure.
- Why not?

377
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,555
- Right. Thank you.
- Great.

378
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,681
No.

379
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,019
- Do you mind if I look through?
- Go ahead.

380
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,106
God, these are incredible.

381
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,525
Yeah.

382
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,986
Wish I still had mine.

383
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:57,114
Can't believe you still listen to vinyl.

384
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,242
I don't. They were my father's.

385
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,995
- He was a DJ.
- Yeah?

386
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,959
The Late Night Mix with Glen Halsey
on KZOV.

387
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,587
- Wow.
- Please, sit here if you want.

388
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,839
No, no, I'll use this. This is fine, don't worry.

389
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,800
There you go.

390
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,677
Yeah, he played

391
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,597
jazz, country, rock, Tejano,
all kinds of crazy stuff.

392
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,850
He sounds like an interesting guy.

393
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,104
Yeah, no. He was more of a drunk

394
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,315
who occasionally did interesting things.

395
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,529
So you're a teacher, huh?

396
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,617
I guess I should say I'm a photographer,

397
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,954
but teaching takes up most of my time.

398
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,082
Have you ever had any shows of your work?

399
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,627
Yeah, I've sold some pieces.

400
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,255
Not enough to get rich, but...

401
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,552
Actually, I sold one to my husband.
That's how we met.

402
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,095
Okay.

403
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,767
- So what do you do for work?
- Well,

404
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:13,274
as of yesterday, I was
regional vice president

405
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,820
at a very large corporation.

406
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:21,574
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

407
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,784
Look, I made good money.
I bought this house.

408
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,494
We've been to Europe,

409
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,164
the Caribbean, Japan twice.

410
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,834
- Wow.
- Yeah. So...

411
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,757
Does he have a name yet?

412
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,675
Yeah.

413
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,845
Yeah, my husband wants to call him Jack.

414
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,558
That's his name, my husband.

415
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,314
I think it's a little ridiculous
naming a child after yourself.

416
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,692
- Do you have kids?
- No.

417
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,361
No, we don't.

418
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:02,907
We have fish.

419
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,328
The gold one here...

420
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,455
- Asagi.
- Asagi.

421
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,248
Yeah.

422
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:16,670
She had the breeders shipped over
in those special containers from Japan.

423
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,215
A grand each.

424
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:22,176
This used to be our swimming pool.

425
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,056
But it's not anymore. You know?

426
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,309
So what's the music for?

427
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,896
She'd read that it improves breeding.

428
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,776
You know, it's okay. You can...

429
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,654
You can ask me.

430
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,405
Ask you what?

431
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,450
About all that out front.

432
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:51,372
I mean, you just moved here
and you have to look at it.

433
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:54,750
Look, I'm sure whatever it is,
you can work it out.

434
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,589
I was sober for six months.

435
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:05,219
I had a couple of slipups,
you know, here and there.

436
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:08,264
Nothing major. But I was trying, you know?

437
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,770
And, well, I was on a business trip

438
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:20,985
and we completed this very big deal.

439
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:26,824
So I took everyone out to celebrate.

440
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:34,665
There was this new girl, Sharon,
from the Denver office.

441
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,001
So she got champagne for everyone.

442
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,795
I figured,

443
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,259
"I'll have a glass, right?" You know?

444
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,970
Just to toast.

445
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,850
We must have gone through
six or seven bottles.

446
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,978
And then it was just us,

447
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,524
in her room, you know,

448
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,987
keeping the party going.

449
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,907
So what happened?

450
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,201
In the morning, she was gone.

451
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,208
And then there were lawyers,

452
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,341
and investigations and interviews.

453
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,429
And, you know...

454
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,269
Did you do it?

455
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:41,023
Whatever they said you did?

456
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,785
I don't know. I don't know.

457
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,630
I should go.

458
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,300
Here, let me take your plate.

459
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,135
Let me walk you home.

460
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:13,472
It's fine. I can walk across the street.

461
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,642
Wait. Wait. Hold on.

462
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:22,106
Don't forget this. Fortune cookie.

463
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,399
Thanks.

464
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,819
Good night.

465
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,831
Hey.

466
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,418
Hey.

467
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,008
I like it. I like it.

468
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,554
Are you listening to me? Pour some wine.

469
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,891
- Come on, pour it.
- Come on, bring it.

470
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,976
- That's it.
- Put it in! Put it in!

471
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,520
- Put it in!
- Bark for me.

472
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:45,439
Come on, bark.

473
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,567
Yeah. Yeah, bark. Bark for me.

474
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,571
Oh, I like that. You're a dog, aren't you?

475
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:56,325
You're a great big dog. Nice puppy.

476
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,079
Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!
I want some more wine.

477
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:03,916
Keep barking, baby. Keep barking.

478
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,918
You're a nice puppy.

479
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,347
Yes, Nick?

480
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:18,824
I'm interested in that rotisserie over here.

481
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,994
- The rotisserie?
- Yeah, the rotisserie.

482
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,328
One second.

483
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,416
Nick.

484
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,919
Hey, that guy wants to buy the rotisserie
5 bucks.

485
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,589
What am I gonna cook with?

486
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,508
You got the Foreman.

487
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,851
Okay, tell him I'll sell it,
but that I'll only take $10, all right?

488
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:49,688
He's not gonna do it.

489
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:54,401
Well, tell him why he should buy it, right?
Focus on the benefits.

490
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,322
Go ahead.
If you have to take $7, that's okay.

491
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,116
He won't accept the $5.

492
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,410
But I'll let you know
the rotisserie is brand new.

493
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:06,955
He's only used it twice.
You can cook anything with it.

494
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,082
He wants $10, but I'll take $7.

495
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,126
- $7 is good.
- Thank you.

496
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:17,966
Good sale.

497
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,136
You got the gift.

498
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:25,098
Kenny, take a seat.

499
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:32,940
Look, you've been busting ass.
I just want you to know I appreciate it.

500
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:36,568
All right? You know what?
This company needs a shake-up.

501
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:40,614
We need a little less "me"
and a little more "we."

502
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,699
Like this, not like this.

503
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,869
Don't do that. Do that.

504
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,749
Are you sure you're left-handed?

505
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,334
Yeah, I'm sure.

506
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:58,090
- Why don't you want to play football?
- My mom won't let me.

507
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,717
That's a shame, Kenny,
'cause you're a born left tackle.

508
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,596
Big, fast, smart.

509
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,308
How about soccer?

510
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,062
Black people don't play soccer.

511
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:15,440
Whole continents of black people
play soccer.

512
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:17,526
Pelé. You heard of him?

513
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:22,197
Yeah, try not to be afraid of the ball.

514
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:25,200
You know what? Why don't you practice
a little bit on your own?

515
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:29,788
- How do I do that?
- Just throw it up in the air and catch it.

516
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:49,433
I found this. Used to be my mom's.

518
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,893
- Wow.
- I don't Know if it still works.

519
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,603
Let me see.

520
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,023
Oh, God, it's beautiful.

521
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:58,442
- Is there film in it?
- I don't know.

522
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,943
Smile.

523
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,613
- Yup.
- Yeah.

524
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:06,241
- Wow.
- Keep it.

525
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:14,458
- No, I couldn't take it. That's sweet, but...
- No, please.

526
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:19,004
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, I want you to have it.

527
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,841
- Can I pay you for it?
- No. No. No. No, my gift to you.

528
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,718
Unless you want to play first base.

529
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,889
But I figured probably not.

530
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:32,893
Thank you.

531
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,773
Okay, that's good.

532
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:43,362
- See? Wasn't that helpful?
- I guess.

533
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,364
Let's do some grounders.

534
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:48,033
- What's a grounder?
- I'll show you. Throw it to me.

535
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:50,452
Ready? Hands on your knees.

536
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:55,374
When the ball comes, glove on the ground,
watch it into your glove. All right?

537
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,293
There you go.

538
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:00,962
How's Miss Cooper doing?

539
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:03,632
My mom says she's gonna die soon.

540
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,510
But I guess she's not suffering.

541
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,054
I'm glad she's not suffering.

542
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,681
She's definitely got a nice pool.

543
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:16,686
Hey, what does it mean when it says,
"Make it easy to buy"?

544
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:21,316
Well, it can mean a number of things,
getting rid of extra paperwork,

545
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,904
displaying things in a way
that are appealing to people,

546
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,156
explaining how products work.

547
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,326
- You actually interested in that stuff?
- Yeah.

548
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,538
If you read all that,
you'll know more than me.

549
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,209
- What?
- Nothing.

550
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,169
No, go ahead.

551
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:44,381
Are we friends?

552
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:48,218
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

553
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:53,140
Remember when I told you
I tried out for the baseball team?

554
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,349
Yeah.

555
00:48:56,726 --> 00:49:00,105
I lied. I don't play sports.

556
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,190
Why not?

557
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:07,696
- They make you change in the locker room.
- So?

558
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,282
The other kids make jokes.

559
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,659
What kind of jokes?

560
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,369
They say,

561
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:18,832
"You're so fat
you got shocks on your toilet seat."

562
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,502
"You're so fat if your arm broke,
gravy would be coming out."

563
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,132
That's mean.

564
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,426
You heard this one?

565
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:34,389
Your mama's so fat
she heard it was chilly out,

566
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,850
she ran inside and got a bowl.

567
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,481
Your mama's so fat
she has to shower at a car wash.

568
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:46,651
Your mama's so fat she has 101% body fat.

569
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,614
You mama's so fat
you have to roll her in flour

570
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,240
then dive for the wet spot.

571
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,327
Do you know what that means?

572
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,287
No.

573
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,998
Yeah, maybe don't tell that one.

574
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,212
Kenny, look, you can't worry
about what other people think about you.

575
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:06,588
You just got to fight back.

576
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,132
Is that what you're doing?

577
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:11,801
- What?
- Are you fighting back?

578
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,847
Yeah, I'm fighting.

579
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,724
Who are you fighting?

580
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,775
Hi, Lynette. It's Nick.

581
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,946
Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

582
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:33,949
Hey, Gary.

583
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,745
I know. I know it was stupid. Yeah.

584
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:43,291
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, I am an asshole.

585
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,463
Yeah, Gary, I know. I know
it was fucking stupid to leave the knife.

586
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:53,635
Yeah. Hey, Gary. Gary.

587
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,720
Listen, why don't I come in?

588
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:58,640
Why don't I come in
and we'll sit down and we'll talk about this?

589
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,517
What? Gary?

590
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,311
Gary!

591
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,219
Hey, Kenny.

592
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,181
Let's put this in the for sale pile.

593
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,309
What about these books?

594
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,082
Is that you?

595
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,834
Yeah.

596
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,586
You look happy.

597
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,005
I was, I guess.

598
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:56,716
What happened?

599
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:59,844
What do you mean, what happened?

600
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,429
Life happened.

601
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,599
Work happened. Marriage happened.

602
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:13,233
Hi, this is Nicholas Halsey.

603
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:16,277
I went to high school
with your daughter Delilah.

604
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,531
Thank you, ma'am. Yes. You, too.

605
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,788
Listen, I'm on the high school
reunion committee.

606
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,166
We're trying to get in touch with Delilah.

607
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,293
Just wondering if you'd have an address

608
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:36,005
or a phone number where I could
send her some information.

609
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:36,775
Just a minute. Can I help you?

610
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,904
- Delilah?
- Yeah.

611
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,364
It's Nick.

612
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,367
Nick Halsey.

613
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:50,288
Nicholas. Wow.

614
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:53,124
- God, hey.
- Hi.

615
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,626
What are you doing here?

616
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:58,421
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by.

617
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:01,508
How'd you find me?

618
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,594
I called your old number
and your mom gave me your address.

619
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,596
- Okay.
- Yeah.

620
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:10,058
- What a nice surprise.
- Yeah.

621
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:16,231
I'm just getting some dinner
ready for my kids.

622
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,107
Of course. I'm sorry.

623
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:21,569
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to stop by and say hello.

624
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:28,493
You know what?
I'm gonna give the kids dinner outside.

625
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,371
And if you just wait,
I'm gonna bring the food out

626
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,581
and you and I are gonna catch up, okay?

627
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:35,667
- Great.
- Sound good?

628
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,669
- Yeah.
- Okay. it's gonna be great.

629
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:41,297
All right. Hey, you guys. Dinner outside.

630
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:45,885
No, I actually went out to LA
to study acting.

631
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:50,014
Yeah, I got a couple of decent jobs.
I got to do a IV commercial with Brad Pitt.

632
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:52,851
- Really?
- It was fun.

633
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,102
- Yeah.
- It was for Japan,

634
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:57,355
so nobody here got to see it of course.

635
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:01,192
It was cool.
We were in the desert at an old gas station.

636
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:04,529
And there were tumbleweeds going by
and we're drinking beers,

637
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:07,115
which, of course,
is why you could never see it in the US.

638
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:11,202
- Sure.
- And these Japanese tourists pull up

639
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:15,373
and they have one of those star maps
and they're asking directions.

640
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:19,794
I mean, this sounds dumb
but I got to say, "Y'all look lost."

641
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:23,590
And then Brad kind of smiles at them,
you know.

642
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:27,844
And he takes the star map
and he points to his own house.

643
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,679
I see.

644
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:31,306
So, it was cool.

645
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,558
He was a real sweetheart.

646
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:37,061
What an experience.

647
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:41,524
Then I had Lizzy and my husband left.

648
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:44,152
So we came back here.

649
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:50,700
And it's a good place for kids to grow up.
You know, it's safe.

650
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:54,996
So what about you?

651
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:01,502
- Are you married, or...
- Yes. Yes, I am.

652
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,673
- And you have kids?
- No. We're...

653
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,470
We're waiting for the right time, you know.

654
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,221
There isn't one, trust me.

655
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:18,728
Yeah, how do you handle all this?

656
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:20,605
All What?

657
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:22,398
The responsibility.

658
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:25,860
You know, raising them by yourself,
supporting them.

659
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,740
I don't really have a choice, right?

660
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:36,412
My dad always said to me,
"Good without the bad ain't no good at all."

661
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:40,208
So we just make it work, right, missy?

662
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,088
You're a natural.

663
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:49,008
Hi.

664
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,890
- Wow, it was great to see you.
- Yeah. You, too.

665
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,570
Is there something else
you wanted to say to me?

666
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:14,742
I'm sorry.

667
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:21,499
But when we were in high school,

668
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,293
you wrote this.

669
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,715
Oh, my gosh. Look at us.

670
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,178
"You're a diamond in the rough."

671
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:36,347
That was 20 years ago.

672
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,849
I know.

673
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,102
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

674
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,979
It's stupid.

675
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:48,818
Hey. No, I mean, we weren't really friends.

676
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:52,363
Exactly. It's stupid. I'm so sorry.

677
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:56,325
It was really great to see you.

678
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:04,250
Hey, you remember those crazy parties
at Brian Sever's house?

679
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:08,671
Yeah. Well, I showed up
with bright pink hair once

680
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:10,173
'cause I was going through a phase.

681
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:14,594
And the guys were super drunk,
especially Brian.

682
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:20,808
And he decided he was gonna try to
dunk my hair in the pool to get the pink out.

683
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,020
And everybody just thought
that was super funny.

684
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:26,647
I was really embarrassed and scared.

685
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:30,485
And you came over and tried to stop him.

686
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:35,323
And he wouldn't, so you punched him
and knocked him into the pool.

687
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:41,162
Then you gave me a ride home
while your girlfriend hung out at the party.

688
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:45,500
Don't you remember that?

689
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,169
No.

690
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:52,131
Well, I do.

691
00:59:56,469 --> 01:00:01,015
You have a good heart, Nicholas.
That doesn't change.

692
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,942
So when you get yourself together,

693
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:15,363
you should call me
and we'll go have some coffee.

694
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,240
Sure.

695
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:24,455
Nicholas, are you gonna be all right?

696
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:26,791
Yeah. Yeah.

697
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,379
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

698
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:32,964
- How you doing?
- Good.

699
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:34,132
- That's all?
- That's it.

700
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,259
- $6.50, man.
- Yeah, I don't have $6.50.

701
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,010
Can I just get this?

702
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:39,804
I can't do credit on this, man.
You know that.

703
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,097
- Really?
- Yeah.

704
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,807
- On a six-pack?
- You're here all the time.

705
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,518
I know, I've been coming here all the time.
So can you just spot me?

706
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,187
Not at all, man.
I'll lose my job. I can't do that.

707
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:50,356
- Can you just give me one beer?
- No, not even one

708
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,859
- 'cause it's a whole case right here.
- You being serious right now?

709
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:55,611
- I'm being serious right now.
- Really? For real?

710
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,613
Can't you just tell?

711
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,533
I should fucking call the cops
on your ass for that.

712
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,994
You better leave. Yeah, run.

713
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,465
Hey, I don't mean to bother you,
but can I get a beer from you?

714
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:18,926
Can I get one of your beers?

715
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:28,996
I just need a drink.

716
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,627
These are Valium.

717
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,255
They'll help.

718
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,450
You feeling any better?

719
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:09,704
Thanks.

720
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,928
You know, you need some help.

721
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,433
I've tried help.

722
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,395
Yeah, well, maybe it wasn't the right kind.

723
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:39,233
You know, there's new medications,
new therapies.

724
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,986
I don't need medication.

725
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:45,823
Well, you can't live like this.

726
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,870
Why not?

727
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,415
'Cause it's not normal.

728
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,418
Normal?

729
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,089
What's normal?

730
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,260
That guy Stanley what's-his-name,
down in the blue house,

731
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,181
his wife blew her brains out last month

732
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:13,184
'cause her daughter
didn't make cheerleading.

733
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,313
Kenny practically lives by himself,
you know?

734
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:20,941
Elliot and Kitty,
I can't even tell you what they do.

735
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:27,656
I'm no different than any of you.
I just don't hide in my house, okay?

736
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,868
- What does that mean?
- What?

737
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:34,080
"Any of you."

738
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:39,335
Nothing. Nothing. I'm just saying...

739
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:42,922
No, you said "any of you."

740
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,425
Never mind.

741
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:51,305
No, go on. I'm a big girl. Say it.

742
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,349
I don't want to do this right now.

743
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:54,809
Say it.

744
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,733
What's his name?

745
01:05:03,192 --> 01:05:06,612
- Who?
- Your husband. John? Jeff?

746
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:08,197
- Jack.
- Jack.

747
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:14,245
He started out in a regional office, right?

748
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:15,955
Yeah.

749
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:20,000
He impressed some people
who moved him up to the big leagues.

750
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,253
- How many years?
- Two.

751
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,171
Two years? Yeah.

752
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:27,341
Now he's back at the regionals.

753
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:33,347
You're sacrificing your promising career
as a photographer for him.

754
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,015
So?

755
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,686
I figured you out in five minutes.

756
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:41,856
He drinks.

757
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,902
They transferred him out here
'cause he fucked something up.

758
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,614
You probably thought
it was a good idea to come out here.

759
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:54,285
Might even save your marriage.

760
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,537
For better or for worse, right?

761
01:05:58,164 --> 01:05:59,331
Right.

762
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,084
I just want to know one thing.

763
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,920
What kind of man lets his wife,

764
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:09,300
his pregnant wife,
move alone across the country?

765
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:13,053
And what kind of woman
stays with a man like that?

766
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,851
What kind of woman?
What, so it's my fault?

767
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:25,107
You must be really good at your job,
you know, just reading people so easily,

768
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:28,235
figuring out what bullshit to sell 'em.

769
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,572
- Hey.
- God, what?

770
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:38,162
You need to put up some curtains.

771
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:41,749
Why? So I don't have some drunk
staring at me all day?

772
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:46,587
No, so you don't have to look at your future.

773
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:50,257
Jeez.

774
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,889
Fuck you! Fuck you!

775
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:20,931
"Light up your life. Stop living in the dark."

776
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,690
- Hey.
- Hey.

777
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:34,069
- How long have you been here?
- A couple of hours.

778
01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:39,408
Where did the tables come from?

779
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,993
- The tables?
- Yeah.

780
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,162
Your neighbor Elliot.

781
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:45,789
You got price tags on everything.

782
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,501
How'd you do that?

783
01:08:50,044 --> 01:08:53,839
Market research.
I'm making it easy for the customer.

784
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:59,470
- Nice work, Kenny.
- Thanks.

785
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:03,390
Really nice work.

786
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:26,163
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey. Good. Good.

787
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:29,500
Just thought I'd stop by a little,
check up on you.

788
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,584
Thanks.

789
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:34,088
So you're letting some of this stuff go, huh?

790
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:39,843
Yeah. I'm gonna sell it,
you know, everything I can.

791
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,931
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thanks.

792
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,351
Yeah, Catherine, we can...

793
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:49,603
I can work this out.

794
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,315
This is a good first step. It is.

795
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,361
Why don't you stop by the station
when you're done?

796
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:01,281
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

797
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:06,453
- Thanks for stopping by.
- No problem.

798
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:24,930
Excuse me. How much for the chair?

799
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,141
- The chair?
- Yeah.

800
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:31,812
- $2 and I'll throw in the macramé.
- All right.

801
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:34,398
Thank you.

802
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:36,275
That actually works.

803
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:37,901
Same taste in tapes, man.

804
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:43,741
That's right, throw it on the grill there.

805
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:46,034
You ever fish the lower Salt?

806
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:47,619
No.

807
01:10:47,703 --> 01:10:51,206
At sunset with the water like glass,
it's religious.

808
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,250
Sounds nice.

809
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:57,588
I'm sorry, I've never fished the lower Salt.
I've never even gone fishing before.

810
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,673
I've never been fishing in all my life.

811
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,009
- That looks really good on him.
- Yeah, isn't it cute?

812
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,428
Really cute. Old school.

813
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:07,181
- I'm not sure.
- Your girlfriend is.

814
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,101
All I know is I bought this for $125.

815
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,479
I'm not gonna do $125.

816
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,147
- I'm not asking you to.
- Okay.

817
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,524
- I'm asking $25.
- I'll do $15.

818
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,818
- What about $22?
- $20.

819
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:23,363
- $217
- Okay.

820
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:27,242
- How much is this?
- $10.

821
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,662
Hey, that should be $15.
I got engaged in that suit.

822
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,457
I saw you checking out the blender.

823
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,542
I could do both for $25.

824
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,008
All right, deal.

825
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:47,805
Rule number one, always have power
so people can test appliances.

826
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,640
That's a good rule.

827
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,647
Hey, just wanted you to know
everything's going pretty good.

828
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:01,151
And I'm selling it, all my stuff.

829
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:06,114
All my crap. And it feels pretty good.

830
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:10,327
I'm getting rid of everything, Catherine.

831
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:14,248
Anyway, call me when you're ready.

832
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,709
On Kitty's phone, I guess.

833
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,422
I miss you. Bye.

834
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:26,635
Made in China, even though
it's supposed to be Japanese, so...

835
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,846
You know What? I'll give it to you for $25.

836
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:32,224
And I'll throw in this wolf and polar bear.

837
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:34,768
Okay, let's show 'em, ladies.

838
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:41,525
Hustlers. You're all hustlers.
You hustled me.

839
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:44,528
All right, another hand like that
and I'll be buying the table from you.

840
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,530
Who's deal? Sherry, your deal?

841
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:49,283
- All right.
- Right here. Here we go.

842
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:50,617
Yeah, you don't have to shuffle.

843
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,996
So, yeah, you can cook anything on it.

844
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,665
You can cook hot dogs.
You can cook bacon.

845
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,041
You can cook burritos.

846
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,210
- Who's in first?
- I'm in for $10.

847
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:02,296
- $10'?
- I'm in for $15.

848
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:05,924
- $15'?
- I'm in for $15 as well.

849
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:07,926
Okay, that's already too rich for my blood.

850
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,220
- I don't have that kind of money.
- You want to borrow a chip?

851
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:13,724
You know what?
I'm all in, plus the cat ashtray.

852
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:16,393
Okay?

853
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,853
- Yours sticks.
- Yeah.

854
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,147
- That's good luck.
- The high-level players can do this.

855
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,816
- How we looking?
- Take a look.

856
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:25,068
Okay, good.

857
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:27,070
I can't hardly even find this stuff anymore.

858
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,489
- How much for these?
- I'm sorry. They're not for sale.

859
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:32,075
Come on, man. What do you want for 'em?

860
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,078
- No, no, I really can't.
- Seriously?

861
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,457
I think you'll be happy with either.

862
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,667
- What do you think, green or blue?
- Go with blue.

863
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,922
All right, thank you very much.

864
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:46,465
How's that mouthwash treating you?

865
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:49,384
How much for the chair?

866
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:52,512
Can I ask why you want it?

867
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:54,348
I need a new chair.

868
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,600
What happened to the old one?

869
01:13:57,225 --> 01:14:01,980
I got a new color IV over at a sale in Gilbert.
I need a new chair.

870
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,026
You know what? Why don't you take it?

871
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,030
I want you to have it.

872
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,750
Yeah.

873
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:52,447
Samantha?

874
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:56,576
Please, I know you're in there.

875
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:21,643
Nice house.

876
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:29,109
I just wanted to apologize for last night.

877
01:15:31,153 --> 01:15:34,781
No, look, really, it's fine.
I shouldn't have pushed.

878
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,868
I don't know you.
I don't know your husband.

879
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:41,329
Yeah, well, I called him last night.

880
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,542
I told him I was going to leave him.

881
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,046
He said he was coming tomorrow.

882
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,883
So you're right.

883
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:55,552
Maybe you don't know people
so well after all.

884
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,223
Are you gonna go back to New York?

885
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:04,811
I don't know.

886
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:09,191
Well,

887
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:14,946
I don't think it's right
to make a decision like that

888
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:19,659
without having authentic Mexican food.

889
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:23,622
Have you had an authentic Mexican meal
in Arizona?

890
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:25,624
No.

891
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:32,255
Well, Kenny and I, we're gonna go celebrate.
He's buying.

892
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,549
So...

893
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:39,096
Sounds nice.

894
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,680
Great. Good.

895
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:44,601
'Cause we need a ride anyway.

896
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,312
Of course.

897
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:58,365
- Lively.
- He likes it.

898
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,119
Maybe. Or really doesn't like it.

899
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,831
- Are you ready for him?
- Yes.

900
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,041
No.

901
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,879
I can't figure out what color to paint
the baby's room.

902
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:18,385
I don't know why,
but somehow it seems really important.

903
01:17:19,094 --> 01:17:23,223
It is important.
Every color has a specific effect on people.

904
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:26,810
What are you thinking?
Come on, it's what I do for a living.

905
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:30,105
You pick colors for a living?

906
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,941
No, I pick colors to make people buy things.

907
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:39,322
- I like yellow.
- That makes people anxious.

908
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:43,368
- Yeah.
- That's not good.

909
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,245
How about blue?

910
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:50,750
- Blue is soothing. Color of communication.
- That's good.

911
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:54,254
Yeah. Green is good, also.

912
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,967
Well, then I guess it's blue.

913
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:02,762
Or green.

914
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:09,102
Here's to blue or green.

915
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:12,230
To blue or green.

916
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,284
Nick.

917
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:26,286
Wow.

918
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:29,122
What brings you downtown?

919
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:33,210
Dinner with friends. You?

920
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:37,631
Drinks with the boys from the office.

921
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:39,341
How's everything at work?

922
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:43,470
Things are good. They're good.
Nothing new, really.

923
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,222
We filled your position.

924
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:49,017
Yeah, some kid
straight out of business school.

925
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,147
He's good. He's not as good as you,
but he's young and he's cheap.

926
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:55,941
Right.

927
01:18:56,024 --> 01:18:58,235
Pretty good ballplayer, too,
from what I understand.

928
01:18:58,318 --> 01:19:01,071
Think he even played in the Minors.

929
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:05,492
They got rid of that Sharon girl.

930
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:07,410
Really?

931
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:10,914
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it turns out she threatened to sue

932
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,166
two other guys at her last job at Kittredge.

933
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,293
Total bullshit.

934
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:19,464
Wow, kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

935
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:24,135
If you hadn't stabbed my Mustang,
probably could've gotten your job back.

936
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:29,182
Sued for wrongful termination, even.

937
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:34,187
Yeah. Well, I'll see you around, man.

938
01:19:48,118 --> 01:19:50,704
It's the kind of thing you kind of feel like
you want to touch,

939
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:53,039
but you're not really sure.

940
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:55,000
Think you forgot that.

941
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:03,174
Hey, can you drop me off somewhere?

942
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,094
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks.

943
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:07,846
Where are you going?

944
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:11,224
That's none of your business
where I'm going.

945
01:20:11,308 --> 01:20:12,892
I'm a grown man.

946
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:25,405
I'll buzz you in.

947
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,327
- Glad you had the time.
- Yeah, I know.

948
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,164
- Just ate at that place over on 60th.
- Yeah?

949
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:36,583
And the sale?

950
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,169
- Great.
- Good. So listen,

951
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,004
- I've got to check up on a statement.
- Okay.

952
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,840
- You good? Want anything to drink?
- No, I'm good. Yeah.

953
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,677
- I'm glad you're here.
- Good to be here. Thanks.

954
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:19,000
Frank? Frank, it's Catherine.

955
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,004
I’m back at your place.

956
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:25,465
Call me back if you can hear me.

957
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,759
Frank? Frank, are you...

958
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:49,531
Can I stay at your house tonight?

959
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,493
Why don't I just get you a hotel room?

960
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:58,665
No, I think it would be better
if I stayed with you.

961
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,877
Well, you know you can't do that.

962
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:11,845
She didn't have anywhere to go.

963
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,347
She could have stayed with her sister.

964
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:18,476
She wanted a drink, so she came to me, bud.

965
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:24,107
She came to me. I'm sorry.

966
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,900
We always joked about this, you know?

967
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:28,445
- Yeah? What?
- Yeah, the 13th step.

968
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:30,780
- Come on, man.
- First you teach them the 12 steps.

969
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:32,907
Then you get them into bed for the 13th.

970
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,535
It wasn't like that, bud.

971
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:38,955
She came to me for help.

972
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:44,544
- Look, I'm sorry. I...
- Shut up, Frank!

973
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:50,800
Look, let's go get some coffee and talk.

974
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:03,730
She deserves better, you piece of shit.
She deserves better.

975
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:05,815
Okay. Okay. No. No. No.

976
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:10,153
- I got it.
- You all right? Stay there.

977
01:23:19,621 --> 01:23:21,289
Do you know the success rate for a marriage

978
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:24,501
when one person gets sober
and the other one doesn't'?

979
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:29,214
Is it higher than the suicide rate for cops?

980
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:31,508
It's almost zero.

981
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:37,347
I know this because I go to the meetings.
I do the work.

982
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,016
You know, she came to me
about six months ago.

983
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:42,352
I told her to leave you.

984
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:46,064
But she wanted to give you another chance,
said she still loved you.

985
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:48,816
But then you go out and you get drunk

986
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,027
and you have sex with another woman.

987
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:55,323
I mean, it would be perfect
if it wasn't so damn sad.

988
01:23:58,243 --> 01:24:00,245
Can I ask you a question?

989
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,081
How long since you guys slept together?

990
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,419
How long since you asked
her if she was happy?

991
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:10,255
You know what? Stop the car.

992
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:13,925
- Let me just take you home.
- No, just pull over.

993
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:29,816
Catherine wants a divorce.

994
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,988
And she wants the house, too.

995
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,745
I was gonna tell you tonight.

996
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:46,249
Here are the papers.

997
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:51,671
The keys to the house are inside.
There's some spending money in there.

998
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,514
She wants to keep it amicable.

999
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:04,934
So just sign the papers
and you'll get your share.

1000
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:14,819
I want you to know that Cate and I,
we haven't given up on you.

1001
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,531
If you want a new sponsor,
I could recommend somebody.

1002
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,165
Frank...

1003
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,216
Tell my wife I'm sorry.

1004
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,523
- Hey.
- Hey.

1005
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:40,149
So how are you doing?

1006
01:28:41,818 --> 01:28:42,902
Fine.

1007
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:45,822
Here.

1008
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:50,576
- What's this?
- The money we made.

1009
01:28:53,704 --> 01:28:56,707
I plugged the record player in
in case you wanted to listen to music.

1010
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:01,420
Nice job, Kenny.

1011
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:07,134
There's your take.

1012
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:12,098
- This is too much.
- Take it.

1013
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,017
I was skimming your profits for beer money.

1014
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:20,439
Rule number 17,
never go into business with a friend.

1015
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:24,527
Thanks.

1016
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:30,157
So I guess I'll see you around.

1017
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,287
Yeah.

1018
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:39,959
Maybe we can catch a game sometime.

1019
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,465
Been a pleasure working with you.

1020
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,306
You, too.
