1
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,832
Quick question:
is it good in there?

2
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,431
Get in line.

3
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,114
Three good reasons: Good mood,
we look amazing...

4
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,580
Just a quick question! I know her!

5
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,220
We're true Berliners!

6
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,432
I was just talking.

7
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,019
Wait, I'll get us in, dude!
- Guys, it's over! Out you go.

8
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,730
Clear the way!

9
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,858
It's cool. It's cool.
- You won't get in without money.

10
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,069
I put on my dancing shoes specially!
- Take him with you.

11
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,323
Brother, Fuss wants to dance!
- Off you go!

12
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,788
One day the club'll be ours.

13
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,417
Yeah, say what you like.

14
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,835
Whatever...

15
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,963
One day this club will be ours!
Understand?

16
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,385
We'll buy your club!

17
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,597
Watch out, man!

18
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,791
Now it's your car?

19
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,838
Man, let me have a chat!

20
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,727
That's Boxer...
- Just a quick story...

21
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,100
Fuck. We left the keys
in the club, dude.

22
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,135
Fuck me, it's really open!

23
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,849
Hey. guys. wait...

24
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,608
Hands off the car!

25
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,735
Fuck off!

26
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,654
Are you fucking mental?

27
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,907
Are you fucking insane?

28
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,700
Yeah, man, calm down!

29
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,910
Get the fuck away!

30
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,955
Shut the fuck up!
- No, you fuck off, man!

31
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,424
Do you want to come
to my birthday party...

32
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,760
and then we can...

33
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,890
Fuss, don't push it!
- It's just 'cos it's my birthday party...

34
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,457
As if you knew the English!

35
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,669
East Berlin! East Berlin! East Berlin!
- Shut the fuck up!

36
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,017
Quit talking about my sister, Fuss!

37
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,933
How do you say 'Spétkauf'?

38
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,520
What's up?
You wanna add something?

39
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,356
Let's get some 'Molle'.

40
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,078
Happy?

41
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
Happy? Are you happy?

42
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,044
...or really happy?
Or a little bit happy?

43
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,546
A little bit happy?

44
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,347
He)'. guys.

45
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,418
Give me some cash!

46
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,003
Give me some cash. Cash!

47
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,047
Blinker, hey!

48
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,131
I need cash.

49
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,509
We have no money.
What do you want me to pay?

50
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,097
Give me some money.
- Wait, wait.

51
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,059
Fuss, got some paper in your pocket?

52
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
Fuss is in a different world.

53
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,441
Wait here a moment.

54
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,818
Don't start any shit.
I'll get some beer.

55
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,377
Man, you scared me!

56
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,087
Cut it out, man!

57
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,922
Let me talk to her, retard!

58
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,132
Do you need any help?

59
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,637
Go away. Let me...

60
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,393
Yo, Farouk, dude!

61
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,186
Guys!

62
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,192
Boys!
- Hey! She stole it all.

63
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,202
Stop pretending!

64
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,172
So you stole again?
- Yeah. Coming from you!

65
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,176
Hey, Victoria! Come here!

66
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,846
Come here, dude. Do you know
how to drink schnapps?

67
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,536
Stop that bisexual shit, man!

68
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
What kind of faggot are you?

69
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,390
Cheers!
- Cheers!

70
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,477
'Zum Wohle' is better than 'Prost'!
Speak proper German with her!

71
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,900
Hey, cut that shit out!

72
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,736
I dropped the soap, Boxer!

73
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,990
I dropped the soap!

74
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,533
Oh, shit!

75
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,410
Stop that crap!

76
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,062
Hey, guys. Chill a sec.

77
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
Time for his little show.

78
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,961
You can't do that!

79
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,714
At last you've got
someone to impress!

80
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,091
Now you've got someone!

81
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,594
For your old school shit!

82
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,055
Pistols? Got pistols on you?

83
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,141
What's going on?
What? What?

84
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,934
Quick question...

85
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,103
Get lost.
- Boxer, back off.

86
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,439
Boxefl
- Piss off!

87
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,900
Fuck off, you pussies!

88
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,990
Stop it, Boxer!

89
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,617
Stop this shit!

90
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,370
Back off. Everything's OK.

91
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,665
Boxer, what's wrong with you?

92
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,334
Please, man, it's a party!

93
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,379
It's his birthday. Cut it out.

94
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,214
Boxer, please!

95
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,975
Man, you're always causing trouble!

96
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
Chill out, hey.

97
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,189
Relax. It's the cops.

98
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,775
Good evening!

99
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,196
Let's smoke a joint.
To peace! Peace!

100
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,415
Those sons of bitches!

101
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,417
Let's smoke one here!

102
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,170
They're coming back.
They're coming back. Shit.

103
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,423
We're on a zebra crossing. We're fine.

104
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,435
It's actually legal,
but let's go anyway.

105
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,353
Let's get out of here.

106
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,440
Let's hit the roof, boys.
Let's hit the roof!

107
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,428
No ego trips, man.
- I'm not...

108
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,829
You've messed up my cigarette.

109
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,834
Hey, guys. Don't break anything!

110
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,797
I'm going ahead. See you later!
- Where to? Where to?

111
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,424
Looking good, Sonne!

112
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,886
I'm out of here!
I'm never coming back!

113
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,723
See that? Escort party,
dude, escort party!

114
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,435
See that? Escort party,
dude, escort party!

115
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,063
Guys! Blinker! Come on!

116
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,869
She's screaming, man!

117
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,808
Fuss, where are you?
- I'm coming!

118
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
Talk louder, why don't you?

119
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,315
I'm not a faggot, man!

120
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,120
That's true?
- Quit laughing.

121
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,253
It was the news. There was an interview.
- Blinker was in the news, too.

122
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,011
Don't talk so loud!

123
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,263
I'm just saying...

124
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,853
Blinker used to steal
these pizza mopeds...

125
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,073
Definitely.

126
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,718
Shut the fuck up!

127
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,296
Who cares?

128
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,532
I don't wanna get her hooked!
- Oh, you're so righteous.

129
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,248
Quit laughing, moron.
- I'm not laughing...

130
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:03,093
Bro, I wasn't laughing about you.
It was something else.

131
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,318
Sonne, dude, please.
- What?

132
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,823
I am quiet.
You shut the fuck up!

133
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,518
You gonna take her home?

134
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,237
I'll see you.
- Where?

135
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,324
I'll just take her home.
- You're coming back?

136
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,034
No ego trips, dude.
- It's not an ego trip, retard!

137
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,178
Goodbye, wankers!

138
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,638
We'll wait for you!
- Yeah, wait!

139
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,183
Such a Casanova!

140
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,995
Are you nuts? This is a pavement!

141
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,873
Relax. You know what time it is?

142
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,799
Bye. It was fun.

143
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,374
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

144
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,133
Hey, chin up...

145
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,106
Yo, my man.

146
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,318
I'm here, in the cafe.

147
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,909
Why did he call?

148
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,497
I'm in the cafe, dude!

149
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,000
Man! At the...

150
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,920
At the organic cafe.
What does he want?

151
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,673
Yeah, what do you want?

152
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,175
Hello?

153
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,722
What's up?

154
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,268
He called.
- Yeah, you said!

155
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,063
Can't I just talk in peace?
- Let's go!

156
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,899
What's going on?
Do we have to meet him?

157
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,111
Of course we have to!
- Yes, but why now?

158
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,005
So let's go!
- OK!

159
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,008
OK, retard!
- Where are we going?

160
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,137
Boxer, where?
- We're going now.

161
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,475
We're coming, Boxer!
We're coming with you!

162
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,538
Just leave me alone...

163
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,591
Dude! What are you doing?

164
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,635
Get on with it!

165
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,221
I'll get in and shift across.

166
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,435
Front seat?
OK!

167
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,744
Victoria. I'm sorry!

168
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,245
Victoria. I'm sorry!

169
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,206
Hey! Wait outside.

170
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,462
Don't puke here, you retard!

171
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,798
Everything's cool.

172
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:06,345
Water, please.
- I've got water!

173
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,683
Have a drink.
Sit up.

174
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,824
Calm down, Fuss. Breathe deep.

175
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,535
Dude, like this.

176
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,329
Relax, everything's cool.

177
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,623
Wake up, man!

178
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,420
Get your shit together.
We've got ten minutes.

179
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,131
He'll make it!

180
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,555
Man! Just fuck it!

181
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,641
Call him and tell him it's off! Fuck it!

182
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,352
We can't!
- We don't have to do it tonight!

183
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,563
He wants four of us!
- But not tonight!

184
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,690
I gave him my word!

185
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,192
Boys! Relax!
- Don't let me down!

186
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,736
Don't let me down!
Get up, man!

187
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,866
Boxer, three's enough!
He just wants us in and out...

188
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,451
He doesn't want any stress!

189
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,788
Fuss isn't going to be any help.

190
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,791
Just call him and postpone it!

191
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,879
We can't postpone!
I owe him!

192
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,172
You know what I mean!

193
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:31,597
Let's just go, the three of us,
bang bang, and out!

194
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,682
Right, Boxer?

195
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,602
Three? Three guys! One driver!

196
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,812
What don't you get?

197
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,739
Ask her to come along.
I don't care.

198
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,658
Quick job, then back to the cafe.

199
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,287
Ask her!
- Are you crazy? We just met!

200
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,580
Just do it!

201
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,875
Don't touch me, retard!
I hate that!

202
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,544
Boxer, don't touch me!

203
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,755
Ask her!
- I will. Shut the fuck up!

204
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,675
Come on, Fuss, let's go.
- What happened?

205
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,428
Get out!
- Just fuck off!

206
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,094
Man, fuck you! Wait.

207
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,555
Piss off!
I'm asking her now!

208
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,933
Then let's go!

209
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,574
We've got five minutes.
Five fucking minutes.

210
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,486
I was talking to a girl, you wanker.

211
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,613
Are you stupid?
I was asking her!

212
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:39,367
And don't talk to me like a retard!
I hate that!

213
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,161
She's doing it!
- Just calm down.

214
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,081
You need to calm down!
- You both need to calm down.

215
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,302
Let her drive!

216
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,224
Let her drive. You don't have
a license, you stupid wanker!

217
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,040
He's such a moron.

218
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,889
How do you say 'gerade aus'?

219
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,274
Now be nice to her, please!

220
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,909
Fuss, brother?

221
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,663
Can you all be quiet a moment?

222
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,383
Quit laughing, man!

223
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,233
Dude, she got it!
Just tell her she's safe, OK?

224
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,739
Shut the fuck up.
I took care of that, wanker.

225
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,034
Yeah, man, Boxer,
he really did.

226
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,542
We'll just talk there, right?

227
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,337
So what are we doing?
- No plan, dude!

228
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,008
He wants to see we're ready.
- Exactly. It's a test!

229
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,135
Thanks for your wisdom, Blinker!

230
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,638
Calm the fuck down!

231
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,276
Afterwards we're bringing
her straight back.

232
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,490
I don't want...
I don't want to talk about it.

233
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,952
Sonne, of course we'll bring her back!

234
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,122
I don't want to talk about it.

235
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:51,101
I'm fucked.
No: I'm good!

236
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:58,233
We're meeting a real gangster.
That's interesting!

237
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,986
Shut! The fuck! Up!

238
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:05,031
Got it, Boxer.
Everything's cool.

239
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,826
Give me another, please.

240
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,495
Stop frightening the girl, retard!

241
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,205
We're not frightening her.

242
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,629
Where are we going?

243
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,092
Where are you going, man?
With this shitty stolen car?

244
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,719
Boxer, where are we going?

245
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,640
Stop calling it a fucking stolen car.
It'll scare her.

246
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,019
She doesn't understand,
so shut the fuck up.

247
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,650
Sonne?
- What?

248
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,489
You're not afraid, are you?
- I'm not afraid.

249
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:00,420
Sonne, we'll make it.
Give me five.

250
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,925
Victoria, everything OK?

251
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,573
OK, give me a light, please.

252
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,533
Here, hang on.

253
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,278
Shit.

254
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,076
Shit!

255
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,205
Do we wait inside?

256
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,960
Are you fucking serious?

257
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,213
Get out.

258
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,101
I'll be in touch.

259
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,123
These are your boys?
- Yes.

260
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,875
Who's the bitch?

261
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,878
Are you guys fucking her?
- The bitch is our driver.

262
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,172
You don't say.
Get out.

263
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,473
You're the driver?
Done this before?

264
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,436
What the fuck?
She doesn't speak German?

265
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,488
Your problem.

266
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,698
Let's get your tools.

267
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,715
Hand them round.
- Are they loaded?

268
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,676
Yes. You wanna throw candy?

269
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,262
Come with me.

270
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,099
The bitch, too.

271
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:27,043
This is the floor plan for a private bank,
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

272
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:31,422
There's 50,000 Euro in a small safe
for a customer, Mr Weigert.

273
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,426
He'll collect the money at 7 a.m.
to buy a vintage car.

274
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,470
You'll be there already.

275
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,181
Ten grand's for me.
The rest is for you.

276
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,355
Right now?

277
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,775
Yes. You got something better to do?

278
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,281
Well...

279
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,290
You don't have to.
I can't force you.

280
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,628
Then we won't.
We won't do it.

281
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:15,008
Boxer, back in jail you
enjoyed my protection.

282
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:19,053
You owe me. Ten grand.
And I want that money.

283
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,973
I'll get the money.

284
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:28,313
You had no money for cigarettes
and now you'll find ten grand?

285
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,484
Give me a week, OK?

286
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,654
One week? OK.

287
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,365
While you're getting the money,

288
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,618
I'll keep the bitch.

289
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,958
We'll do it.
We'll do it!

290
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,545
Hey, we'll do it, OK?

291
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,048
We'll do it, man!

292
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,931
OK. Are you sure?
- Yes.

293
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,434
Yes.
- Good.

294
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:11,064
So, this is the entrance.
ATM, two security doors.

295
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,857
Here's the counter.

296
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,445
Six desks for the account managers.
Over here is the main target.

297
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,908
Mrs Neumann sits here.
She's the bank manager.

298
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,746
She has the alarm codes
and the combination for the small safe.

299
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,874
Mr Weigert will collect the money at 7 a.m.

300
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,836
Mrs Neumann and two clerks
will be in the bank then.

301
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,215
The second clerk arrives
between 6:30 and 6:45.

302
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,719
That's your target. She'll bring you
through the second security door.

303
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:47,392
Alright? There's gloves and masks.
Show me what you've got.

304
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,313
You stay here.

305
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,651
She stays with me.
- Yes.

306
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,701
I hate you.

307
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,413
Gimme that shit!

308
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,424
Take some gloves.
- Got 'em.

309
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,969
We don't have much time.
- Yes!

310
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,637
OK, boss.

311
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,310
Shit!

312
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,983
Should we start in the car?

313
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,361
Whatever.
- Let's start inside.

314
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,951
Wait, the gloves!

315
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,287
Go!

316
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,999
Wait, wait!
- Open the door!

317
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,293
Open the door!
- Do it yourself!

318
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,170
The lock, dude!

319
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,630
Come on, come on!

320
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,805
Let's go!
Everybody on the ground!

321
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,058
Shut the fuck up!
- No one make a move!

322
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,353
Down on the ground!

323
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,148
Shut the fuck up!

324
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,942
I said, down on the ground!

325
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,362
Give me the fucking money!
Shut up, stay down!

326
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,323
Give me the fucking money! Go!

327
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,744
Give me the cash!
Go! Go! Go!

328
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,623
OK. stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

329
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,210
Good.
Who's the pressure guy?

330
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,753
Who's putting on the pressure?

331
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,880
Who's calling the shots?

332
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,590
He calls the shots.

333
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,636
Don't all shout at once.
Mrs Neuman needs clear instructions.

334
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,597
When you enter...
- The door thing won't happen again.

335
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,557
First leave the car...

336
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,434
then go. Don't run!

337
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,354
When you enter, two shots
to make things clear.

338
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,939
What's the bank's name?

339
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,398
Limburg.

340
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,692
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

341
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,861
Bitch!
Zimmerstrasse 26!

342
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,158
Good.

343
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,829
Remember that.

344
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,472
Tilidin, cocaine.

345
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,934
Take some.
It makes you confident and aggressive.

346
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,479
If you're busted, you'll do less time.
- You first.

347
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,107
Bitch, you too.

348
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:46,112
Forget the silent alarm.
You'll be out in two minutes.

349
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,698
A bit more, Boxer.

350
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,664
Give me a bit more...
A little more.

351
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,041
More, more. Another bit.

352
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,544
Time to go.

353
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,462
Give me some!

354
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:18,311
Afterwards go home and stay put.
I'll be in touch. Have fun.

355
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,522
Go!

356
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,634
What is this shit?

357
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,349
What is this shit?

358
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,643
Boxer?

359
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,398
Boxer, what the fuck is this shit, man?

360
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:02,832
Boxer. Man, I can't breathe!

361
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,585
My heart!
I can't breathe!

362
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,844
My heart! Stop the car!

363
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,738
I'm not joking!
I'm not joking!

364
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,280
I'm not joking!
Open the fucking door.

365
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,782
I'm not joking!
Open the fucking door.

366
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,000
Boxer, Boxer, I can't.

367
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,128
Help. My heart.

368
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,088
Calm the fuck down!

369
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,722
Get up. man! Get up!

370
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,392
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

371
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,062
Get up!

372
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,437
I don't want to die.

373
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,958
Give me the fucking cigarette.

374
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,590
I'll do it alone.

375
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,419
Guys, for once:
everyone together.

376
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,172
Come here.
Blinker, come here!

377
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,507
Blinker, come here, man!

378
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,803
No, let's go, let's go!

379
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,306
Relax, for once.

380
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,323
But we're taking her back first!

381
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,913
Get up, man.

382
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,418
OK, man. I'm coming.

383
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,453
I'll take Mrs Neumann.

384
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,959
I'll take Mrs Neumann...

385
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,088
You keep the others covered.

386
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,174
We're doing this.
We're going to make it, OK?

387
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:09,179
Nice and easy. In and out. Two minutes.

388
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,433
OK?
- Yes, man!

389
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,852
OK, brother!
- Yeah?

390
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,517
Blinker, everything alright?
- What?

391
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,403
I already told her.

392
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,244
Blinker, you're OK?
- Yes.

393
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:04,670
Hey. Blinker.
- I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm...

394
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,554
Is that her?

395
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,598
Hey! Wait!

396
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,479
Hey, that's her!

397
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,316
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

398
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:41,039
Down on the ground!
I said, get down on the ground!

399
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:05,541
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on!

400
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,431
Man, just drive!

401
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,267
Drive! Drive! Drive!

402
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,645
Why don't you go?
Go! Go! Go!

403
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:52,671
Throw your jacket out!
Throw your fucking jacket away!

404
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,048
Throw it out!
Throw it out!

405
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,718
Throw everything out!
Throw everything out!

406
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:23,243
Relax, please!

407
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,542
Calm down! Calm down!

408
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,886
Sister, you go back.
- Hey, calm down!

409
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,430
Just think! Where are we going?

410
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:48,352
We've got to get off the streets!

411
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:07,537
Let's get out of here!
- Hide! Get down!

412
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,195
Boxer, you whore.

413
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:28,410
50,000 Euros!

414
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,622
A pharmacy bag.

415
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,388
That was some sick shit.
Show me: how much we got?

416
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:59,983
Hey, guys!
I just want to say I love you.

417
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:04,279
Boys, let's get going.
Grab your fucking guns!

418
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,869
Guys! Sonne! Sonne!

419
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,039
Grab all the shit.
Just take everything.

420
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,459
Grab the gun and don't leave a trace.

421
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,961
Wipe them off!

422
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,985
Let's go party, man!

423
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,074
Let's go party!

424
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,660
Wait, wait!
- Alright, man.

425
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,712
Throw away this shit.

426
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,801
My jacket!
- Throw it away, dude.

427
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,095
Hey, man!
- Fuck it.

428
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,377
A bit of pocket money?

429
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,008
Give me some pocket money.

430
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:51,219
Let me see!

431
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:57,809
Evening.

432
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,452
Get going!

433
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,084
Six Euros!

434
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:27,923
It's us again!
Here's one hundred. And two hundred.

435
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:32,928
Good evening!
- Remember? You wouldn't let us in!

436
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:39,267
Here you are.
Take it, take it, take it, brother.

437
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:47,233
Give me a whisky, dude!
Just give me whisky, please.

438
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,946
Give me everything you've got.
- Give me two whiskies.

439
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:04,908
I told you, the club belongs to me!

440
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:08,203
I told you, the club belongs to me!

441
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,851
It's over now.

442
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,478
What do you mean, it's over?

443
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:38,650
Of course it's over. That's why we're partying.

444
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,319
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

445
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,029
Our day is over!

446
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,159
Come on, get on with it!
This isn't your kind of place.

447
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:51,037
What's up with you?
- Come on! Off you go!

448
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:56,125
We're dressed and ready to go!

449
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,962
Dressed and ready to go!

450
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,090
<i>Let's gm!</i>

451
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,265
Get out!

452
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:14,769
Let her down, man.

453
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,987
The place is ours!
- We go, we go, we go!

454
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:45,591
Hey, man, don't push it!

455
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,693
Hang on a second.

456
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,820
Did you see that?
Give me a kiss.

457
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:32,055
Let's check what Fuss is doing,
you stupid morons!

458
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:44,025
I totally forgot about him!

459
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,778
I competely forgot him!

460
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,241
Hey, Blinker, you retard!

461
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:54,494
Man! Blinker! Man!

462
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,430
Just run slowly!
- OK, OK, OK.

463
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:18,393
Fuck your shoes.
- Don't panic. Act normal!

464
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,285
Blinker, hey!

465
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:37,537
Blinker! Come on!

466
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,664
I'm coming. I'm coming.

467
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,417
Stay calm! Stay calm!

468
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,214
We'll make it!

469
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:50,383
Pull your fucking trousers up, man!

470
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:53,928
Where did they come from?

471
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,730
We fucked up!
Really fucked up!

472
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,383
Cops.
I swear on my mother's grave!

473
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:35,928
Cops!
- Wait! Stop shouting!

474
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,520
Wait! Shit!

475
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,273
Wait!

476
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,402
Go! Go, man!
Move your fucking ass!

477
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,994
Don't run!

01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:23,935
Fuck you!

482
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,063
Police! Freeze! Stop!
Throw your guns down!

483
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,231
Fuck off!

484
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,568
Stay where you are!

485
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:36,072
Drop your weapons!

486
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:41,285
Stay where you are!
Drop the gun!

487
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:42,370
Freeze!

488
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,000
Fuck you, you wanker!

489
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:50,795
Put your weapons down
and come out now!

490
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,798
You bastards!

491
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:03,558
Come out!
You don't stand a chance.

492
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:05,726
Come out with your hands up!

493
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:09,730
Stop!

494
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,274
Stay where you are!

495
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,734
Leave the money!

496
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:16,070
Come on!
- Drop the gun!

497
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:19,115
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot!

498
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,913
Boxer, come here!

499
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:28,207
Come on!

500
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:36,090
Where? Where?

501
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,508
There's no way out!

502
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,677
Where, man? Where?

503
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:46,601
He") me!

504
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:48,603
Fuck off!

505
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,355
Fuck off!

506
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,483
Throw your guns away!

507
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:02,366
Put down your guns!
Come out with your hands up!

508
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,620
Take the money!
- You're coming with us!

509
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:09,332
You're coming with us!
You're coming with us!

510
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,584
Just get the fuck out of here!

511
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:05,262
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

512
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:07,181
Where do you live?
- Upstairs. Upstairs!

513
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:10,309
Where do you live!
- Upstairs, one floor up!

514
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:12,103
Let us in!

515
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:15,481
Move your ass! Go, go, go!
- OK, OK!

516
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,236
Hurry UP!

517
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:23,823
On the floor!
Shut the fuck up! In the living room!

518
01:43:26,826 --> 01:43:28,160
You too!

519
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:33,916
Shut the fuck up!
Stay on the ground!

520
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,794
Stay on the ground!
Don't look at me!

521
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,296
Don't look at me!
OK?

522
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:42,675
Shut the fuck up!
Shut...

523
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,400
Why'd you let me
into your shitty flat with a baby, man?

524
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:00,943
I don't know...

525
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:05,990
Are you stupid?
You can't let me in when there's a baby here!

526
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,248
How stupid are you?

527
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,959
How stupid are you, man?

528
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,840
Shut the fuck up.

529
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:27,470
Shut the fuck up.

530
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,602
Well, we're finished.

531
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:23,901
Attention, residents! This is the police!

532
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:28,489
Please stay in your homes.
Keep your doors closed.

533
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:32,701
Don't let anyone in!

534
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:37,331
We will inform you once
the situation is under control.

535
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:43,838
Attention, residents! This is the police!
Secure your doors and windows.

536
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:17,913
No! -

537
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:29,341
Not my baby!

538
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:30,110
Listen up!
Give us the baby!

539
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:33,572
Give us...!
- No, no! Please, Sonne! No!

540
01:47:55,928 --> 01:47:57,763
Yeah, come on!
- I've got it!

541
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:02,935
Where's the money?

542
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,190
Everything's OK.

543
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:17,324
Hey, it's OK.
Lie down! Lie down!

544
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:18,575
Everything's OK.
No, no!

545
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,249
Shut the fuck up!
Shut your fucking mouth!

546
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:58,115
Police!

547
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,951
Stay where you are!
Hands up.

548
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,746
Take a step down.

549
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,540
Stop, stop.

550
01:49:06,749 --> 01:49:11,503
Sparrowhawk to HQ?
I've got two individuals in the hall.

551
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:14,590
Two youths...

552
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:19,762
No. HQ, I need a
situation report now!

553
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:25,642
I've got two individuals, mid twenties.
- We live here.

554
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:29,021
They have a baby.
- We live here.

555
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,524
Give me a description!

556
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:36,570
They've got colourful clothing and a baby.

557
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:41,158
Come down here, please.
- We live here.

558
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:45,204
What happened?
What happened?

559
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:50,876
Secure upstairs.
- What happened?

560
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,796
Stay here.
You'll be picked up.

561
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:57,424
My colleagues will pick you up.
Just stay here.

562
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,629
They told us to get out fast!

563
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:37,548
Move around the corner.

564
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:38,924
Yes.

565
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,572
Shit!

566
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,189
Morning.
- Good morning.

567
01:51:35,731 --> 01:51:37,274
Good morning.

568
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,359
Greetings, sir.
- Hello!

569
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:42,988
Straight on for now.
- OK.

570
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,117
Just straight on...

571
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,454
and then left...

572
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,923
Your first fare?
- No, my last.

573
01:52:01,006 --> 01:52:02,591
Yeah?
- Left here?

574
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,927
Yes, just go left.

575
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,804
You got it.

576
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:26,740
Can you just take us...?

577
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,827
Just take us to a hotel.

578
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,290
What kind? Fifty or five hundred Euro?
- Doesn't matter.

579
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,584
Round here?
- Yeah.

580
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:38,835
OK.

581
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:43,382
Then let's try the Westin.

582
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,593
It's just round the corner.

583
01:52:47,552 --> 01:52:49,471
Sweet.

584
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:38,770
Give me the money.

585
01:54:02,544 --> 01:54:05,505
I'll give you a hundred.

586
01:54:05,756 --> 01:54:08,133
I can't change that.

587
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:11,636
Ah, no problem!

588
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:15,515
Why, thank you!
- We just came from the slot machines.

589
01:54:17,726 --> 01:54:19,603
Very generous!

590
01:54:25,067 --> 01:54:29,321
So, here we are.
- Perfect.

591
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:34,618
OK. Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

592
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:36,661
Yes.
- Bye.

593
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:38,080
Bye.

594
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,059
Bye.
- Bye.

595
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:43,773
...the police identified the getaway car,
which led to the first thief's arrest.

596
02:02:43,982 --> 02:02:49,195
There was a shootout between police and
the thieves here in Kochstrasse...

597
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:54,158
One of the thieves died at the scene,
another one on the way to the hospital...

598
02:02:54,534 --> 02:03:01,541
Two suspects, a man and a woman in
their twenties, are still at large. Police...

599
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:50,548
Come here!
