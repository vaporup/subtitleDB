1
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,387
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,639
"What is going on inside their head?"

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,354
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

4
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,898
And there she was...

5
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,444
Hello.

6
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,568
Riley.

7
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:56,493
Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

8
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,555
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

9
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,566
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

10
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,414
Er, for 33 seconds?

11
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,371
I'm sadness.

12
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:51,166
Hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

13
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,634
Can I just... if you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,133
And that was just the beginning.

15
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,098
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

16
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,023
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

17
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,941
Sharp turn! No! Look out! No!

18
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,309
That's fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

19
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,818
Easy, easy. We're good. We're good.

20
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,569
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

21
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,702
And we're back!

22
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,038
Here we go. All right, open.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,680
- This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

24
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,715
What is it?

25
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,038
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

26
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,126
Hold on. What is that?

27
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,209
This is disgust.

28
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,805
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

29
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,221
Physically and socially.

30
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,299
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

31
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,434
Hold on, guys.

32
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,758
It's broccoli!

33
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,973
Yucky!

34
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,481
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

35
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,479
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

36
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,860
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

37
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,069
That's anger.

38
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,239
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,069
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

40
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,625
Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

41
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,920
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

42
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,086
Airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

43
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,379
Airplane.

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,676
And you've met sadness.
She... well, she...

45
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,061
I'm not actually sure what she does.

46
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,567
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

47
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,690
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

48
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,738
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

49
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,951
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

50
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,583
But the really important ones
are over here.

51
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:54,963
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called core memories.

52
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,174
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

53
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,554
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

54
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,224
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

55
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,943
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

56
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,781
And each core memory

57
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,741
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

58
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,070
Like hockey island.

59
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,076
Goofball island is my personal favorite.

60
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,214
Come back here, you little monkey!

61
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,791
You're silly.

62
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,166
Yep, goofball is the best.

63
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,093
Friendship island is pretty good too.

64
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,343
I love honesty island.
And that's the truth!

65
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,057
And of course,
family island is amazing.

66
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,689
The point is, the islands of personality
are what make Riley... Riley!

67
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,230
Look out, mermaid!

68
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,607
Lava!

69
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,949
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong!

70
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,413
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

71
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,668
Brain freeze!

72
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,468
Yeah!

73
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,557
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, dad.

74
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,268
And... We're out!

75
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,107
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

76
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,363
Nice job, everybody!

77
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,126
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

78
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,170
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

79
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,389
And that's it. We love our girl.

80
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,685
She's got great friends
and a great house.

81
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,597
Things couldn't be better.

82
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,438
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

83
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,900
Sold

84
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,195
what...

85
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,081
Okay, not what I had in mind.

86
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,727
Inside out

87
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,847
hey, look! The golden gate bridge!
Isn't that great?

88
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,266
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

89
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,196
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

90
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,362
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

91
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,112
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

92
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,614
Yeah...

93
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,237
- Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
- For Pete's sake! Move it!

94
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,454
These are my kind of people.

95
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,286
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

96
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,422
Step on it, daddy!

97
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,138
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

98
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,707
We've already been in it forever.

99
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,502
Which, actually, was really lucky,

100
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,207
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

101
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,505
what our new house
is going to look like!

102
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,011
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

103
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,803
- That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

104
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,347
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

105
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,681
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

106
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,057
That's the one! It comes with a dragon.

107
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,152
Now we're getting close, I can feel it.

108
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,935
Here it is, here's our new house. And...

109
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,453
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

110
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,961
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

111
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,923
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

112
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,132
Can you die from moving?

113
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,511
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

114
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
A dead mouse!

115
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,430
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

116
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,468
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

117
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,682
Get off of me!

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,427
Hey. All through the drive,

119
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,483
dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

120
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,559
Let's go check it out!

121
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,693
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

122
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,809
Yes, yes, yes.

123
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,984
No, no, no, no, no.

124
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,483
I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

125
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,573
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,900
Riley can't live here.

127
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,075
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

128
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,452
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

129
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,157
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

130
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,828
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

131
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,158
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

132
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,203
Where did you read that?

133
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,618
It doesn't matter.
I read it and it's great.

134
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,044
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

135
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,505
- The hockey lamp goes there.
- Put the chair there.

136
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,844
- The trophy collection goes there.
- Stars! I like that!

137
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,512
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving Van!

138
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,299
All right. Goodbye.

139
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,263
Well, guess what? The moving Van
won't be here until Thursday.

140
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,756
You're kidding.

141
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,308
The Van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

142
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,100
That figures. The Van is lost.

143
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,646
You said it would be here yesterday!

144
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,267
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

145
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,555
Mom and dad are stressed out!

146
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,608
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

147
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,691
I've got a great idea!

148
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,238
Did you even read the contract?

149
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,782
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

150
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,986
Hey!

151
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,124
No, you're not!

152
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,202
She's lining up for the shot!

153
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,374
Coming behind you.

154
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,752
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

155
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,040
Come on, grandma!

156
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,125
"Grandma"?

157
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,012
She put her hair up, we're in for it!

158
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,552
Hey, put me down!

159
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,101
Sorry. Hold on. Hold on.

160
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,429
Hello?

161
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,557
Wait. Wh...

162
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,731
You're kidding.

163
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,363
All right. Stall for me.
I'll be right there.

164
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,861
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

165
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,571
- I got to go.
- It's okay. We get it.

166
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,074
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

167
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,873
See you, sweetie.

168
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,243
Dad just left us.

169
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:05,213
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

170
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,378
Joy? What are you doing?

171
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,127
Just give me one second.

172
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,632
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

173
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,553
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

174
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,675
Maybe we could try that?

175
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,143
Pizza sounds delicious.

176
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,853
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

177
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,602
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

178
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,266
That's it. I'm done.

179
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,364
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

180
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,782
First the Hawaiians and now you!

181
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,034
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

182
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,326
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

183
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,700
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

184
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,788
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

185
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,963
That was disgusting.

186
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,502
Good. Family is running.

187
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,796
Dad's got a steel stomach.

188
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,917
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

189
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,685
Spitting out the car window!

190
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,128
Definitely not when dad was singing.

191
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,218
Wearing a seat belt!

192
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,513
What about the time with the dinosaur?

193
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,797
- That's the one.
- Definitely!

194
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,348
Say cheese!

195
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,933
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

196
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,556
- Now hold still.
- The car!

197
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,814
Stop! No, no, no!

198
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,022
Nice one, Joy.

199
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,778
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

200
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,163
Wait. What? What happened?

201
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,368
She did something to the memory.

202
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,383
What did you do?

203
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,629
I just touched it.

204
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,548
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

205
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,009
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

206
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,047
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, sadness.

207
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,512
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

208
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:46,102
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

209
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,478
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

210
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,401
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

211
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,652
- Okay.
- All right. Get ready.

212
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,362
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

213
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,005
Wait, what? What happened?

214
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,673
- A core memory!
- No!

215
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,003
Sadness, what are you doing?

216
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,416
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

217
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,889
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

218
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,394
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa.

219
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,521
Sadness, you nearly
touched a core memory.

220
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,985
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

221
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,107
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

222
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,025
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

223
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,282
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

224
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,986
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

225
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,287
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

226
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,251
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

227
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,922
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

228
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,172
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

229
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,257
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

230
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,506
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

231
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,558
Yeah, that's not...

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,270
What about that time with Meg

233
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,480
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

234
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,904
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

235
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,202
It was awful.

236
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,949
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

237
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,471
What are your favorite things to do?

238
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,487
My favorite?

239
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
Well, I like it when we're outside.

240
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,410
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

241
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,456
Like that time we buried dad
in the sand up to his neck.

242
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,042
I was thinking more like rain.

243
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,424
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

244
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,336
We can stomp around in puddles.

245
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,716
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

246
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,604
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

247
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,692
And we get all cold, shivery,

248
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,650
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

249
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,821
Hey, hey. Hey, easy.

250
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,610
Why are you crying?

251
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,160
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

252
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,947
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

253
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,658
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

254
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,707
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

255
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,253
I've read most of them.

256
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,046
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

257
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,219
"Long term memory retrieval,
volume 47"?

258
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,589
- No.
- A real page-Turner!

259
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,507
"Long term memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

260
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,176
See? Fun already! You lucky dog.

261
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,897
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

262
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,623
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

263
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,330
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

264
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,660
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night!

265
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,037
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

266
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,293
We've got to land this, okay?

267
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,669
Did you hear dad?
He sounded really upset.

268
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,933
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

269
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,512
There are no bears in San Francisco.

270
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,725
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

271
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,055
I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

272
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,391
I don't want to hear about your nerves.

273
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,477
I'll tell you what it is.

274
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,442
This move has been a bust.

275
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,692
That's what I've been telling you guys!

276
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,402
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

277
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,243
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

278
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,238
I can't believe
mom and dad moved us here!

279
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,530
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

280
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,954
But we've been through worse!

281
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,834
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

282
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,621
Riley should be happy about.

283
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,544
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

284
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,672
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

285
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,421
And all of our stuff is in the missing Van!

286
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,251
Come on. It could be worse.

287
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,166
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

288
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,305
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

289
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,096
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

290
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,390
Let us handle this.

291
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,893
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

292
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,726
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

293
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,481
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

294
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,114
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

295
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,070
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

296
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,110
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

297
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,235
Hi, honey.

298
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,371
The mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot-toot!

299
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,372
Still no moving Van.

300
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,964
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

301
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,078
Toot-toot-toot!

302
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,174
Where's dad?

303
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,381
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

304
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,962
I rest my case!

305
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,715
Your dad's a little stressed,

306
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,629
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

307
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,347
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

308
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,310
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

309
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,312
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

310
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,105
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

311
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,985
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

312
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,486
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

313
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,243
We can do that for him. Right?

314
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,158
Well.

315
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,081
Yeah, sure.

316
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,326
What did we do to deserve you?

317
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,132
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

318
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,840
Well, you can't argue with mom.
Happy it is.

319
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,176
Team happy! Sounds great!

320
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,352
Totally behind you, Joy.

321
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,681
Looks like we're going into rem.

322
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,686
I got dream duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

323
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,648
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, team happy!

324
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,325
All right, what's on tonight,
dream production?

325
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,026
Well, this is it. The new place.

326
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,621
Come live with me, Riley.

327
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,416
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

328
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,042
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

329
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,916
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

330
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,968
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

331
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,272
We are not going to
end the day like this.

332
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,648
Don't you worry.

333
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,729
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

334
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,605
I promise.

335
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,711
Hello! Did I wake you?

336
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,831
Do you have to play that?

337
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,127
Well, I have to practice.

338
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,800
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

339
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,510
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

340
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,892
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

341
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,009
Here it is! Fear.

342
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,635
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

343
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,891
on the first day at a new school.

344
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,274
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

345
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,690
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

346
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,611
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

347
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,778
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

348
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,897
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

349
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,865
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long."

350
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,606
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

351
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,096
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

352
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,375
Train of thought! Right on schedule.

353
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,331
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

354
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,536
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

355
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,627
It might come in handy.

356
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,959
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

357
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,585
Which it probably will be.

358
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,343
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

359
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,505
- Really?
- Follow me.

360
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,061
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

361
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,192
This is the circle of sadness.

362
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,649
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

363
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,570
So you want me to just stand here?

364
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,862
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

365
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:25,407
Just make sure that
all the sadness stays in the circle!

366
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,753
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

367
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,999
- No.
- Atta girl.

368
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,249
All right, everyone, fresh start.

369
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,382
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

370
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,629
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

371
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,051
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

372
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,681
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

373
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,047
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

374
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,755
Very cute!

375
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,426
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

376
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,394
Mom and dad? With us in public?

377
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,852
- No thank you.
- I'm on it!

378
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,392
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

379
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,838
Have a good day at school, monkey.

380
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,360
Have a great day, sweetheart!

381
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,074
- That's crazy. It really is.
- That was so funny.

382
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,333
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

383
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,040
Are you sure we want to do this?

384
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,828
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

385
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:16,877
Did you see her? Hello?

386
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,083
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

387
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,169
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

388
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,878
Is she wearing eye shadow?

389
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,926
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

390
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,550
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

391
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,927
We want them to like us.

392
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,355
Yeah. Wait, what?

393
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,353
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

394
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,905
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

395
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,318
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

396
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,780
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

397
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,111
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

398
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,078
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

399
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,407
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

400
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,583
Don't worry. I got this.

401
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:54,713
Okay.

402
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,330
My name is Riley andersen.

403
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,587
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

404
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,219
And how about Minnesota?

405
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,700
Can you tell us something about it?

406
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,800
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

407
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,933
She's hilarious!

408
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,102
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

409
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,604
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

410
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,897
I'm on a great team.
We're called the prairie dogs.

411
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,942
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

412
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,525
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

413
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,453
It's kind of a family tradition.

414
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,200
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

415
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,958
Or we did, till I moved away.

416
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,077
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

417
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,375
Hey, sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

418
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,131
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

419
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,761
Get back in your circle.

420
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,440
- What's going on? Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

421
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,514
We used to play tag and stuff.

422
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,115
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

423
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,680
- Did you see that look?
- No.

424
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,765
They're judging us!

425
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,351
Somebody help me!
Grab that... everybody put...

426
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,436
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

427
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,030
No! We're crying! At school!

428
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,532
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

429
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,372
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

430
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,615
It's a core memory!

431
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,366
But it's blue.

432
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,712
No! Wait! Stop it! No! No!

433
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:31,798
Joy, no.

434
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,308
- That's a core memory!
- Hey!

435
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,179
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

436
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,984
The core memories!

437
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,242
No, no, no, no!

438
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,717
Thank you, Riley.

439
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,257
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

440
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,803
but we're happy to have you here.

441
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,967
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

442
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,096
and turn to chapter seven.

443
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,193
Can I say that curse word now?

444
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,343
No! One, two, three. Okay.

445
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,302
I got them. Where are we?

446
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,303
Long term memory? Wait...

447
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,193
Goofball island?

448
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,150
Riley's islands of personality.
They're all down!

449
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,905
This is bad.

450
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,455
We... we can fix this!

451
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,317
We just have to get back
to headquarters,

452
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:17,026
plug the core memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

453
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:22,504
Riley has no core memories.
No personality islands and no...

454
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,544
What? What is it?

455
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,625
You.

456
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,798
You're not in headquarters.

457
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,207
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

458
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,722
We got to get you back up there.

459
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,764
I'm coming, Riley.

460
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,200
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for Greens.

461
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,859
Like compost. And eggshells.

462
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,696
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

463
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,742
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

464
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,197
What do you expect?
All the islands are down.

465
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,366
Joy would know what to do.

466
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,536
That's it.

467
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,422
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

468
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:11,882
Great idea. Anger, fear, disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

469
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,973
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

470
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:17,259
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

471
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:21,315
And get this: Try-outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

472
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,850
- Hockey?
- What do we do?

473
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,392
Guys, this is...

474
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,725
You pretend to be Joy.

475
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,651
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

476
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,904
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

477
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,775
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

478
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,072
- Because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

479
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,530
Did you guys pick up on that?

480
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,536
- Something's wrong.
- Totally.

481
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,788
Should we ask her?

482
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,671
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

483
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,999
So, how was the first day of school?

484
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,255
She's probing us.

485
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,754
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

486
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,508
What? Okay.

487
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,552
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

488
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,353
Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

489
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,559
Something is definitely going on.

490
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,978
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

491
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,689
We're going to find out
what's happening.

492
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,019
But we'll need support.

493
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,104
Signal the husband.

494
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,284
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across... And nice!

495
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,031
She's looking at us.

496
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,202
- What did she say?
- What?

497
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,747
Sorry, sir. No one was listening.

498
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,168
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

499
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,079
What? What is it, woman? What?

500
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,286
He's making that stupid face again.

501
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,248
I could strangle him right now.

502
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,457
Signal him again.

503
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,891
So, Riley, how was school?

504
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,850
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

505
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,930
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

506
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,105
Move! I'll be Joy.

507
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,984
School was great, all right?

508
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,152
Riley. Is everything okay?

509
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,226
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

510
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,938
What is her deal?

511
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,646
All right, make a show of force.

512
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,238
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

513
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,243
No, not the foot!

514
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,585
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

515
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,200
I'll show you attitude, old man.

516
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,577
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

517
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,714
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

518
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,501
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

519
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,425
Take it to defcon two.

520
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,464
You heard that, gentlemen.
Defcon two.

521
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:21,474
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

522
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,351
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

523
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,970
Yeah, well... well...

524
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,305
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

525
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,272
Keys to safety position.

526
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,689
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

527
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,993
Just shut up!

528
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,609
Fire!

529
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,487
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

530
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,624
The foot is down! The foot is down!

531
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:56,625
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

532
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,709
Well, that was a disaster.

533
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,598
Come fly with me, gatinha.

534
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,736
We're going to walk out there? On that?

535
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,569
It's the quickest way back.

536
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,744
But it's right over the memory dump.

537
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,081
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

538
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:30,198
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

539
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:34,626
- Okay.
- It's not that high. It's totally fine...

540
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,930
Hey.

541
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,904
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

542
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,768
Do you want to talk about it?

543
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,110
Come on, where's my happy girl?

544
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:03,652
Monkey.

545
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,617
He's trying to start up goofball.

546
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,275
Come on!

547
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,256
Go back! Run, run, run!

548
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,408
What...

549
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,510
I get it. You need some alone time.

550
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:14,766
We'll talk later.

551
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,062
We have a Major problem.

552
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,151
Joy, where are you?

553
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,902
We lost goofball island.

554
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:30,697
That means she can lose friendship
and hockey and honesty and family.

555
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,373
You can fix this, right, Joy?

556
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:34,411
I...

557
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,045
I don't know.

558
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,171
But we have to try. Okay, come on.

559
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,543
Riley's gone to sleep.

560
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:46,668
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

561
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,876
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

562
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,048
We'll be back to headquarters
before she wakes up.

563
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,677
We'll just go across friendship island.

564
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,478
We'll never make it.

565
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,810
- No!
- No, no, no!

566
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,275
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

567
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,154
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

568
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,731
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

569
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,357
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

570
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,784
Wait, Joy, you could get lost in there!

571
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,415
Think positive!

572
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,041
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

573
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,372
That's long term memory.

574
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,964
An endless Warren
of corridors and shelves.

575
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,542
I read about it in the manuals.

576
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,586
The manuals? The manuals!

577
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,471
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

578
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,679
So you know the way
back to headquarters!

579
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
I guess.

580
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:35,929
You are my map!

581
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,642
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

582
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:43,437
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

583
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,533
Just give me a few... Hours.

584
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,239
Which way? Left?

585
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,398
Right.

586
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,448
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

587
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:55,662
Okay.

588
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,873
This actually feels kind of nice.

589
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:01,294
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to headquarters before morning.

590
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,964
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

591
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,264
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

592
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,800
Yeah, just another right.

593
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:18,389
And... A left and then another...
Left and...

594
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,854
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

595
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,695
Because we seem to be
walking away from headquarters.

596
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,364
Riley's awake.

597
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,568
Don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

598
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,157
Sorry, I won't. Starting now.

599
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,502
I can't take much more of this.

600
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,120
Forget them!

601
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,674
- Mind workers!
- But, Joy, we're almost...

602
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,667
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

603
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,194
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

604
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,931
- I need to find friendship island.
- Look at this.

605
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,470
Four years of piano lessons.

606
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,761
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

607
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,716
You know what? Save chopsticks
and heart and soul, get rid of the rest.

608
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,928
- Are you...
- U.S. presidents. What do you think?

609
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,188
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

610
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,480
- Forget 'em!
- Hey! You can't throw those away!

611
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,882
Those are perfectly good memories.

612
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,190
The names of
every "cutie pie Princess" doll?

613
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,356
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, honeypants...

614
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,696
Forget 'em!

615
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:20,702
Hey! Bring those back!

616
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,965
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

617
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,639
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

618
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,077
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

619
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,538
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

620
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:32,376
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

621
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,553
- Tripledent gum.
- Will make you smile

622
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,954
the song from the gum commercial?

623
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,430
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to headquarters for no reason.

624
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,893
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

625
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,733
Like a million times!

626
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,888
Let's watch it again!

627
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,525
Tripledent gum

628
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,561
yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

629
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:49,766
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

630
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:50,857
Yeah!

631
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,400
Okay, here we go!

632
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,661
Tripledent gum

633
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,409
what the... this again?

634
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,082
Wait! Do you know
how to get to friendship island?

635
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,411
Tripledent gum

636
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,706
do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

637
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,499
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

638
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,585
We won the first game.

639
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,920
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

640
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,884
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

641
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,435
She did not just say that.

642
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,300
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

643
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:21,973
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

644
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,096
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

645
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,482
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

646
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:27,941
It's like mind reading!

647
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,310
You like to read minds, Meg?

648
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,267
I got something for you to read,
right here!

649
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,675
Let's just be calm for one second!

650
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,108
- I heard they have parrots...
- I've got to go.

651
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,574
- What?
- I got to go!

652
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:42,157
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... oh, no!

653
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,755
Friendship island! What?

654
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,340
Not friendship.

655
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:10,809
Riley loved that one. And now it's gone.

656
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:14,485
Goodbye, friendship. Hello, loneliness.

657
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,825
We'll just have to go the long way.

658
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:26,037
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

659
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,326
I'm ready.

660
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:31,884
There's got to be a better way.

661
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,500
Look at you!

662
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:39,471
I will take you, but not you.

663
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,549
Who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

664
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,759
Hello!

665
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,056
Wait! Hey! Wait!

666
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,023
Wait! Stop!

667
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:58,817
Excuse me.

668
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,360
I was looking for... diversion!

669
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,318
- What?
- So long, sucker!

670
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,042
I hurt all over.

671
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,909
Wait. I know you.

672
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:12,536
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

673
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,045
No, no, no. I do.

674
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,845
Bing bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

675
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,379
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

676
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,973
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

677
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,551
You would know. We're trying
to get back to headquarters.

678
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,755
Headquarters?
You guys are from headquarters?

679
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,928
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is sadness.

680
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,727
You're Joy? The Joy?

681
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,399
What the heck are you doing out here?

682
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,557
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, sadness?

683
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:38,566
Without you, Riley won't ever be happy.

684
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,071
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

685
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:43,112
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

686
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,237
Thank you!

687
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:45,912
It is so great to see you again.

688
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,242
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

689
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:51,286
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

690
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,252
I went to all of your concerts.

691
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,751
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

692
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,382
Watching you play tag was such a treat.

693
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,749
Two-time world champ.

694
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,415
And remember your rockets?

695
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,755
Of course! It runs on song power!

696
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,261
That's right! Your theme song!

697
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,762
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

698
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,102
Bing bong bing bong

699
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:07,497
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

700
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:09,315
- Bing bong, bing bong.
- Bing bong, bing bong

701
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,728
what exactly are you supposed to be?

702
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,477
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

703
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:19,272
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

704
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,358
Dolphin?

705
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,281
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

706
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,275
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

707
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,946
That's all people
talked about back then.

708
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,576
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

709
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:36,042
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

710
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,585
So I, you know...

711
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,626
Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

712
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,795
Tell you what.
When I get back up to headquarters,

713
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,844
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

714
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,258
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

715
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,849
This is the greatest day of my life!

716
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,771
Are you okay?

717
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,281
- Hey, what's going on?
- I cry candy.

718
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,437
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

719
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,111
- Here, use this.
- Thanks!

720
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,196
Hold on, wait a second.

721
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,794
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

722
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,497
Here. What? It's imaginary.

723
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,585
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to headquarters.

724
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,422
Walk? We're not walking.

725
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,587
We're taking the train of thought!

726
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,047
The train, of course!

727
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:32,677
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

728
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,433
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

729
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,887
but there is a station
in imagination land.

730
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:39,688
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

731
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,900
I am so glad we ran into you!

732
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,195
The station is right through here.
After you.

733
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,648
- Joy.
- What?

734
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,866
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

735
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:52,407
Bing bong says
it's the quickest way to headquarters.

736
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,703
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

737
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:58,325
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

738
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:02,174
D-a-n-g-e-r. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

739
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:08,126
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

740
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,388
Let's go around. This way.

741
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,219
Almost there!

742
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,637
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

743
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,735
But Riley needs to be happy.

744
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:20,558
I'm not missing that train.
Bing bong knows what he's doing.

745
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:22,485
He's part dolphin. They're very smart.

746
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,235
Well, I guess.

747
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,205
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

748
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:46,417
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

749
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,759
Loneliness.

750
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,431
Looks like there's something in there.

751
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,928
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

752
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,510
What did I tell you?
You'll be at headquarters in no time.

753
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,179
Say, would you look at that?

754
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,942
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, they turned it on.

755
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,900
Never seen this before.

756
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,614
My face! My beautiful face!

757
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:11,784
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

758
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:15,954
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective fragmentation!

759
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:17,115
All right. Do not panic.

760
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,623
What is important
is that we all stay together.

761
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,673
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

762
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:24,751
Run!

763
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,009
I can't feel my legs!

764
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:29,844
There they are.

765
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:31,134
Come here, me!

766
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:36,852
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

767
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:38,471
We'll get stuck here forever!

768
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,306
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

769
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,981
I told you, it's a shortcut!

770
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,610
The train!

771
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:52,069
Oh, no. We're two-dimensional!
That's stage three!

772
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,164
We're getting nowhere!

773
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:56,277
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

774
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:00,662
We can't fit.

775
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,576
Oh, no, we're nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

776
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,417
We're not going to make it!

777
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:11,877
Wait! We're two-dimensional.
Fall on your face!

778
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,647
Stop! Stop!

779
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:29,068
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

780
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,070
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

781
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:34,233
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

782
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:35,363
How long until the next train?

783
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:39,243
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

784
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:42,407
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to headquarters.

785
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,456
If we hurry, we can catch it.

786
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,830
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

787
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,292
Yeah!

788
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,168
Is there really another station?

789
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:52,384
Through there.

790
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:57,092
Welcome to imagination land!

791
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,426
- Imagination land?
- Sure!

792
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,894
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

793
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:04,733
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French fry forest!

794
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:07,059
- Delicious.
- No way!

795
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:09,734
Check it out! Trophy town!

796
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,895
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

797
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,613
I won first place!

798
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:18,446
- Me too!
- Participation award.

799
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:21,953
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's cloud town!

800
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:24,036
That is my favorite!

801
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,460
It's so soft!

802
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,250
Let me try.

803
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,133
Hey! What's the big idea?

804
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,920
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

805
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:35,418
Oh, no! Lava!

806
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,836
Imagination land is the best!

807
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:42,814
Is it all going to be so interactive?

808
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,180
Hey, look! The house of cards!

809
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:47,598
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

810
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:49,147
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

811
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,940
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

812
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,443
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

813
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:56,452
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

814
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:58,609
I love imagination land.

815
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:01,448
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

816
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,293
Who the heck is that?

817
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:06,711
Imaginary boyfriend.

818
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,619
I would die for Riley.

819
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,588
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

820
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,800
Anyway, this way.
Through preschool world!

821
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:17,051
- We're nearly to the train!
- Riley, here we come!

822
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,813
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

823
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,180
These kids look pretty good,

824
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,926
considering they're from San Francisco.

825
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:28,306
Okay, andersen, you're up!

826
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:31,402
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

827
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,650
Luck isn't going to help us now.

828
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,482
If she tries to use hockey island,
it's going down.

829
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,897
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

830
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:40,777
One of these has got to work
in place of the core memory.

831
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,243
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

832
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,539
We did it, gang! It's working!

833
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:59,838
Line change! Line change!
Change it up!

834
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:06,022
No! No!

835
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:13,229
It's like we don't learn anything.

836
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:15,364
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

837
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,859
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

838
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:21,859
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

839
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:23,116
Find your happy place.

840
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,915
What's her problem?

841
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,254
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

842
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:39,878
- You're not going to finish try-outs?
- What's the point?

843
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:42,224
Hey. It'll be all right.
Let's just go back...

844
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,351
Stop saying everything will be all right!

845
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:47,854
Nice hustle, ladies!

846
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,230
Hockey?

847
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:04,913
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

848
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,239
- Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
- Hey!

849
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:09,165
Bing bong,
we have to get to that station.

850
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:11,415
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham cracker castle.

851
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:14,625
Hey. That's weird. Graham cracker
castle used to be right here.

852
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:17,039
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

853
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:19,586
I would have sworn
sparkle pony mountain was right here.

854
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,422
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

855
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:23,467
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess dream world!

856
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:28,927
Oh, no!
The stuffed animal hall of fame!

857
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:31,516
My rocket!

858
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:34,435
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

859
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,020
It still has some song power left!

860
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:38,606
Who's your friend who likes to play?

861
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:48,827
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

862
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,270
Riley and I are going to the moon!

863
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,289
Riley can't be done with me.

864
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:08,047
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

865
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,057
We just need to
get back to headquarters.

866
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:11,469
Which way to the train station?

867
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:14,016
I had a whole trip planned for us.

868
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:19,983
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

869
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,820
Hey, bing bong! Look at this!

870
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:27,031
Here's a fun game!

871
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:31,204
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

872
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:34,495
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

873
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:37,915
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

874
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,420
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

875
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:45,836
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

876
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:49,185
- Sorry.
- It's all I had left of Riley.

877
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,890
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

878
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,142
They were wonderful.

879
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:57,983
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

880
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,100
Sadness...

881
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:01,818
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

882
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:06,533
She did. We were best friends.

883
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,912
Yeah. It's sad.

884
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,710
I'm okay now.

885
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:27,012
Come on. The train station is this way.

886
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:35,064
How did you do that?

887
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,061
I don't know. He was sad.

888
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,393
So I listened to what...

889
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:40,897
Hey! There's the train!

890
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:54,832
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

891
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:59,582
Oh, no! These facts and opinions
look so similar.

892
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:02,245
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

893
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:09,262
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an f.

894
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,340
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

895
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:13,508
Like what, genius?

896
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,426
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

897
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:19,605
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

898
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,940
Emotions can't quit, genius!

899
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,860
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

900
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:34,989
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

901
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,497
- What is it?
- Nothing.

902
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,883
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

903
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,551
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

904
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,720
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

905
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
- Ta-da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

906
00:50:51,884 --> 00:50:53,804
You're saying we run away?

907
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:55,296
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

908
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:57,966
I'd call it the happy core
memory development program.

909
00:50:58,057 --> 00:50:59,347
You can't be serious.

910
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:00,853
Hey! Our life was perfect

911
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:04,815
until mom and dad decided
to move to San Fran stinktown.

912
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:07,195
I mean, it's just so drastic!

913
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:09,495
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

914
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:12,197
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

915
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,320
- Tripledent gum.
- Will make you smile

916
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,658
did I ask for the gum commercial?

917
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,580
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

918
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:22,162
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

919
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:24,608
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

920
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,344
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

921
00:51:26,377 --> 00:51:29,297
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

922
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:31,718
are just around the corner.

923
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,348
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

924
00:51:45,396 --> 00:51:47,766
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

925
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,687
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

926
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,944
Yeah, the train of thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

927
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,408
- We can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up?

928
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:57,278
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

929
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:00,742
How about we wake her up?

930
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:03,368
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

931
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:05,044
Dream productions

932
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:10,464
this place is huge!

933
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,966
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

934
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,639
I can fly? I love that one!

935
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:20,387
Rainbow unicorn! She's right there!

936
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:26,402
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

937
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:29,269
No, no, sadness,
don't bother miss unicorn, okay?

938
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:32,277
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

939
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:35,739
I loved you in
fairy dream adventure part 7.

940
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,411
Okay, bye. I love you!

941
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,660
Do not enter when light flashing

942
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:40,451
wonder what that means.

943
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:41,705
Well, let's go in.

944
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:46,675
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

945
00:52:46,749 --> 00:52:48,579
We've got a lot to work with here.

946
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,628
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

947
00:52:51,712 --> 00:52:52,762
and quit hockey.

948
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,007
The writers have
put together a killer script!

949
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,261
Just because Joy
and sadness are gone,

950
00:52:57,301 --> 00:52:58,891
I have to do stupid dream duty.

951
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:02,645
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

952
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:05,603
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

953
00:53:05,643 --> 00:53:06,643
We could scare her.

954
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:08,977
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

955
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:10,113
- But, Joy...
- Sadness,

956
00:53:10,147 --> 00:53:12,647
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

957
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:16,203
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

958
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:17,569
We'll excite her awake!

959
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:19,703
That's never happened before.

960
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:21,372
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

961
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,450
I don't think that'll work.

962
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,163
- Bing bong?
- Yeah?

963
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:27,295
- Don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

964
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,753
Add the reality distortion filter.

965
00:53:32,795 --> 00:53:35,665
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

966
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:37,376
Riley is the camera!

967
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:40,716
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

968
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:44,972
Hello, class.

969
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:48,476
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

970
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:50,311
Man, she is one bad actress.

971
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,194
Which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

972
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:57,355
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

973
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,535
Would you like to stand up

974
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,284
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

975
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:04,198
And cue Riley.

976
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:05,955
My name is Riley andersen.

977
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:08,835
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

978
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,460
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

979
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,711
- That's disgusting.
- Gross!

980
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:17,335
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

981
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:20,258
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

982
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:22,343
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

983
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:23,506
Called it!

984
00:54:23,554 --> 00:54:24,554
Ready?

985
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:27,847
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

986
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,444
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

987
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:32,856
Bark! Bark! Bark!

988
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,019
Who is that?

989
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:35,732
What's going on?

990
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:39,653
Asleep asleep - awake

991
00:54:42,073 --> 00:54:43,663
you're on! Go!

992
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:47,411
Let's party! Let's dance!

993
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,157
Hey, a party.

994
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:51,786
Bark, bark, bark!

995
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:53,794
Joy, this isn't working.

996
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,270
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

997
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:06,813
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

998
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:11,138
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

999
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:13,766
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1000
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:15,275
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing bong?

1001
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:17,936
- Bing bong, bing bong!
- Sadness, stop! It was working!

1002
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,488
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1003
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,952
But look, it's working!

1004
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,757
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1005
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:29,541
Stop right there!

1006
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:32,661
Pan away! Pan away!

1007
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,249
Pick a plotline!

1008
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:41,007
- Careful!
- Hold still!

1009
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,420
You can't do this!

1010
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:44,586
I know people in headquarters!

1011
00:55:47,513 --> 00:55:49,723
Cut that out! Please!

1012
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:53,935
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1013
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:55,768
No, no. No, no!

1014
00:55:56,397 --> 00:55:57,937
There go the core memories!

1015
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:00,322
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1016
00:56:01,444 --> 00:56:02,744
Come on.

1017
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,780
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

1018
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:10,786
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1019
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:14,963
My hat feels loose.

1020
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:16,539
How do we get in?

1021
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:19,086
- Let me see.
- You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1022
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:20,212
Yeah, it's my hat.

1023
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:22,336
You sure?
I don't know, look in the label.

1024
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:25,471
- Yeah, it says, "my hat."
- Wait, it says, "my hat"?

1025
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,300
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1026
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:28,855
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1027
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,350
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1028
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,981
- Hey! You!
- You caught us!

1029
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,233
Get back in there! No escaping!

1030
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:50,332
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1031
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:53,906
It's broccoli.

1032
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:58,289
The stairs to the basement!

1033
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:02,547
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1034
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,347
Okay, come on.

1035
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,270
- Would you walk quieter?
- I'm trying.

1036
00:57:16,686 --> 00:57:17,686
What is going...

1037
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,810
Candy wrappers?

1038
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:34,124
- Bing bong!
- Joy?

1039
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:35,203
- There you are.
- Shhh!

1040
00:57:42,628 --> 00:57:43,628
It's jangles.

1041
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:46,092
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1042
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,604
Do you have the core memories?

1043
00:57:59,687 --> 00:58:03,267
Yeah. All he cared about was the candy!

1044
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,593
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

1045
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:27,839
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1046
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:29,094
But how?

1047
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:33,183
Oh, no!

1048
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,699
Hey, sadness. Did you hear \about
the pa-pa-party they were having?

1049
00:58:55,785 --> 00:59:00,415
Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn't it a birthday party?

1050
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:02,956
Did you say birthday?

1051
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,543
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1052
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:06,798
And games and balloons...

1053
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,339
A birthday?

1054
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:10,342
Okay. Follow us!

1055
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:14,094
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1056
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:15,596
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1057
00:59:15,638 --> 00:59:17,098
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1058
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:18,499
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1059
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:40,005
Who's the birthday girl?

1060
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:46,838
Come on, let's go!

1061
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:55,887
We made it!

1062
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,350
Guess who's on their way
to headquarters!

1063
00:59:58,431 --> 00:59:59,471
We are!

1064
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:09,017
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1065
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,568
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1066
01:00:11,652 --> 01:00:15,032
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw bing bong!

1067
01:00:15,072 --> 01:00:18,372
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1068
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:21,159
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1069
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:22,874
Time to take action.

1070
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:24,575
Stupid mom and dad.

1071
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:26,825
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1072
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:28,166
Who's with me?

1073
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,418
No no no no no.

1074
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:34,131
Yeah. Let's do it.

1075
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:48,275
She took it. There's no turning back.

1076
01:00:48,356 --> 01:00:50,976
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1077
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,067
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1078
01:00:53,152 --> 01:00:54,242
and rent an elephant?

1079
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,570
Hey. That sounds nice.

1080
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:57,073
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1081
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:01,293
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1082
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:03,369
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1083
01:01:03,412 --> 01:01:05,752
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1084
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,460
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1085
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:12,002
Tripledent gum - no!

1086
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:15,298
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and dad got us into this mess.

1087
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:17,091
They can pay to get us out.

1088
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:24,216
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1089
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:27,477
Look, there's inductive reasoning.
There's déjà vu.

1090
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:30,312
There's language processing.
There's déjà vu.

1091
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:32,978
There's critical thinking.
There's déjà vu.

1092
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:34,737
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1093
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:40,784
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1094
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,407
You're not so bad.

1095
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:43,661
Really?

1096
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:45,255
Nice work.

1097
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,873
I can't wait to get the old Riley back.

1098
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:51,748
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1099
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:53,094
Is this Riley?

1100
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:55,919
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1101
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:57,425
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1102
01:01:57,466 --> 01:02:00,216
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1103
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:04,313
The hockey team showed up
and mom and dad were there cheering.

1104
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,060
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1105
01:02:07,977 --> 01:02:09,437
I love this one.

1106
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:11,859
I love that one, too.

1107
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:14,399
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1108
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:18,243
Yeah. It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1109
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:22,621
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1110
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:26,833
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1111
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:31,417
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1112
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:32,581
Okay.

1113
01:02:35,129 --> 01:02:36,459
But I just don't understand.

1114
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:40,845
Why did our moving Van
even go to Texas?

1115
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:47,348
Multiple customers?

1116
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,780
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1117
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:10,409
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

1118
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:17,166
Honesty island?

1119
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:27,143
Look out!

1120
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,730
Come on!

1121
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:39,147
Hold on!

1122
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:43,325
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1123
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:56,456
That was our way home.

1124
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,588
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1125
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:02,932
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1126
01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:04,179
What?

1127
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:07,601
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1128
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:10,773
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1129
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,480
Look. We have no core memories.

1130
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,060
You want Riley to be happy?

1131
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:16,733
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1132
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:20,981
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1133
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:23,898
Family island. Let's go!

1134
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:41,126
Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous!

1135
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:43,344
We won't make it in time.

1136
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:48,104
But that's our only way back!

1137
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:02,155
A recall tube!

1138
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,910
We can get recalled!

1139
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:11,662
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1140
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:13,334
See you after school, monkey.

1141
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:14,965
We love you!

1142
01:05:19,335 --> 01:05:20,335
Go! Run, run! Go!

1143
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:34,024
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1144
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:36,389
You're hurting Riley!

1145
01:05:36,477 --> 01:05:38,267
No, no, no! I did it again!

1146
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:42,483
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1147
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:51,079
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1148
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:52,868
Joy?

1149
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:07,929
Joy!

1150
01:06:12,388 --> 01:06:13,808
Joy!

1151
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,420
Joy?

1152
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:55,602
Joy!

1153
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:04,689
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1154
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:12,745
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1155
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,122
We're forgotten.

1156
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:25,043
We used to play tag and stuff.

1157
01:07:29,131 --> 01:07:31,181
But everything's different now.

1158
01:07:33,344 --> 01:07:35,144
Since we moved.

1159
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:11,722
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1160
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,480
I could listen to her stories all day.

1161
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:40,622
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1162
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:45,171
And now...

1163
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:45,886
It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1164
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:49,445
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1165
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:51,859
She wanted to quit.

1166
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:11,249
Sadness.

1167
01:10:12,336 --> 01:10:15,756
Mom and dad... the team...

1168
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:20,469
They came to help because of sadness.

1169
01:10:26,684 --> 01:10:28,354
We have to get back up there.

1170
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,362
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1171
01:10:32,231 --> 01:10:34,231
We might as well be on another planet.

1172
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:41,993
Another planet.

1173
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:47,504
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1174
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,668
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1175
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:56,551
His rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1176
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:03,184
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1177
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:06,351
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1178
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:08,062
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1179
01:11:21,864 --> 01:11:23,034
Hop in.

1180
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:29,706
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1181
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:31,919
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1182
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:34,839
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1183
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:37,883
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1184
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,884
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1185
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:42,546
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1186
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:50,813
Come on!

1187
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:53,063
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1188
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:55,395
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1189
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:57,401
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1190
01:11:57,483 --> 01:11:58,983
who's your friend who likes to play?

1191
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:14,082
Come on, Joy. One more time.

1192
01:12:14,917 --> 01:12:16,457
I got a feeling about this one.

1193
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,918
Bing bong, bing bong
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"

1194
01:12:19,005 --> 01:12:20,385
Bing bong, bing bong

1195
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,133
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1196
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:24,546
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1197
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:27,434
louder! Joy, sing louder!

1198
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:29,752
To sing this song to say
who's your friend who likes to...

1199
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:33,019
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1200
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:35,022
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1201
01:12:35,104 --> 01:12:37,444
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1202
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:38,613
bing bong

1203
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:40,071
we're gonna make it!

1204
01:12:48,117 --> 01:12:50,787
Bing bong! We did it!

1205
01:12:50,828 --> 01:12:54,498
We... bing bong? Bing bong!

1206
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,175
You made it!

1207
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:00,804
Go! Go save Riley!

1208
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:07,475
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1209
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:23,355
I'll try, bing bong.

1210
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:27,912
I promise.

1211
01:13:41,254 --> 01:13:42,714
We're home!

1212
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:46,182
Riley? Riley!

1213
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:51,973
I'll call her cell.

1214
01:13:56,018 --> 01:13:57,898
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1215
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,189
Yep, let's cross the street.

1216
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:05,436
It's mom. She's onto us!

1217
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:06,818
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1218
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:08,363
Riley needs to get core memories.

1219
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:09,986
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1220
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,542
Sadness!

1221
01:14:25,047 --> 01:14:27,127
Sadness! Sadness?

1222
01:14:27,216 --> 01:14:29,636
Come on, sadness. Where are you?

1223
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,219
Okay. If I were sadness,
where would I be?

1224
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:37,561
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1225
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:40,942
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1226
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:57,957
Oh, no! It's mom again! What do we do?

1227
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:07,381
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1228
01:15:07,423 --> 01:15:08,923
Let's get this idea out of her head.

1229
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,046
Sadness?

1230
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:15,762
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1231
01:15:16,557 --> 01:15:17,557
Wait! Sadness!

1232
01:15:18,142 --> 01:15:22,152
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1233
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,230
Come back!

1234
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:32,159
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1235
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,280
Was he with anyone?

1236
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:34,736
Yes! And there she is!

1237
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:36,204
Hey! Come back here!

1238
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:38,445
Forget it, Jake. It's cloud town.

1239
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,751
What? Sadness!

1240
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,170
I only make everything worse!

1241
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:49,475
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1242
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,192
- It's stuck!
- Great.

1243
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,519
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1244
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:05,234
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1245
01:16:14,323 --> 01:16:15,823
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1246
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,577
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1247
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,700
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1248
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:21,827
Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1249
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:22,333
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1250
01:16:22,498 --> 01:16:23,538
No, I didn't! Don't touch that!

1251
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:24,906
Let me do it! Get out of here!

1252
01:16:29,505 --> 01:16:32,925
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1253
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:35,513
What have we done?

1254
01:16:36,345 --> 01:16:39,425
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1255
01:16:39,515 --> 01:16:41,885
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1256
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:43,636
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1257
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:49,363
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1258
01:16:49,442 --> 01:16:51,992
I would die for Riley!

1259
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,290
That's it! I fold!

1260
01:17:40,326 --> 01:17:44,456
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1261
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:50,129
I am positive this is crazy!

1262
01:17:54,048 --> 01:17:56,928
- Now!
- For Riley!

1263
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:06,437
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1264
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:09,773
I wish Joy was here!

1265
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:18,358
It's Joy!

1266
01:18:19,282 --> 01:18:20,492
Stand back!

1267
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:22,531
That worked.

1268
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:24,338
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1269
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:27,871
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1270
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:28,867
What?

1271
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,708
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1272
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,633
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1273
01:18:33,671 --> 01:18:37,971
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1274
01:18:47,643 --> 01:18:48,943
Thank goodness you're back!

1275
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:50,938
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1276
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,860
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1277
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:04,409
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1278
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:06,163
Sadness, it's up to you.

1279
01:19:06,245 --> 01:19:08,495
- Me?
- Sadness?

1280
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:09,751
I can't, Joy.

1281
01:19:09,832 --> 01:19:12,422
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1282
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:25,507
Okay.

1283
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,790
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1284
01:20:00,424 --> 01:20:02,094
All right. Thank you. We will.

1285
01:20:02,176 --> 01:20:03,716
Her teacher
hasn't even seen Riley all day.

1286
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:04,725
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

1287
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:07,174
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

1288
01:20:08,015 --> 01:20:09,805
Riley, there you are! Thank goodness!

1289
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:12,272
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1290
01:20:12,353 --> 01:20:14,403
Honey! What happened?
Are you all right?

1291
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,230
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1292
01:20:16,315 --> 01:20:17,395
we talked to your teacher.

1293
01:21:44,278 --> 01:21:47,448
I know you don't want me to but...

1294
01:21:48,824 --> 01:21:50,164
I miss home.

1295
01:21:52,036 --> 01:21:53,656
I miss Minnesota.

1296
01:21:57,083 --> 01:22:00,293
You need me to be happy, but...

1297
01:22:02,046 --> 01:22:06,426
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1298
01:22:08,594 --> 01:22:10,354
I want to go home.

1299
01:22:12,431 --> 01:22:14,221
Please don't be mad.

1300
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:19,944
- Sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1301
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:25,034
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1302
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:29,317
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1303
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:32,663
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1304
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:36,326
Spring lake,
where you learned to skate.

1305
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:39,711
Come here.

1306
01:24:00,957 --> 01:24:02,617
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1307
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,168
Friendship island has expanded.

1308
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:06,842
Glad they finally opened
that friendly argument section.

1309
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:09,131
I like tragic vampire romance island.

1310
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:11,845
Fashion island? Everyone shut up.

1311
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:14,176
Boy band island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1312
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:17,972
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1313
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:19,555
All right. Here you go.

1314
01:24:19,642 --> 01:24:22,232
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1315
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:25,766
Cool! Upgrade!

1316
01:24:25,815 --> 01:24:27,865
Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1317
01:24:29,318 --> 01:24:30,738
Hey, guys? What's pub-er-Ty?

1318
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,030
I don't know. It's probably not important.

1319
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:36,784
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1320
01:24:36,826 --> 01:24:38,986
This new console is the...

1321
01:24:40,037 --> 01:24:41,577
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1322
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:42,784
They're getting to the rink.

1323
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:46,337
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1324
01:24:46,419 --> 01:24:48,089
- I know, dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1325
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,921
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1326
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:54,007
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go foghorns!

1327
01:24:54,051 --> 01:24:58,561
- Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
- Okay! I got to go!

1328
01:24:58,639 --> 01:24:59,889
They love us.

1329
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:01,564
Yeah, mom and dad are pretty cool.

1330
01:25:01,642 --> 01:25:04,102
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1331
01:25:06,355 --> 01:25:07,935
She loved the face painting!

1332
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:09,184
Told you it was a great idea!

1333
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:13,526
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1334
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:19,536
Just in case.

1335
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:20,994
Oh!

1336
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:23,622
Sorry.

1337
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:30,714
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1338
01:25:33,382 --> 01:25:36,222
Okay. Bye.

1339
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:39,348
Remember, just hustle.

1340
01:25:40,264 --> 01:25:43,024
- Go, Riley!
- You got this!

1341
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:47,191
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1342
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,400
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1343
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:51,982
All right, anger, take it!

1344
01:25:52,026 --> 01:25:53,186
Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1345
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:54,236
On our left. On our left!

1346
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,070
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1347
01:25:56,155 --> 01:25:58,235
Mom and dad are watching us fail.

1348
01:25:58,324 --> 01:25:59,744
Not for long!

1349
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:03,118
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1350
01:26:03,204 --> 01:26:05,164
But we still love our girl.

1351
01:26:05,248 --> 01:26:07,828
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1352
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:09,337
Things couldn't be better.

1353
01:26:09,418 --> 01:26:13,708
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1354
01:26:34,277 --> 01:26:37,567
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1355
01:26:37,613 --> 01:26:39,623
Anyone? Jordan?

1356
01:26:42,326 --> 01:26:43,616
How much more of this?

1357
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:47,291
Five months, two weeks and four days
until Summer vacation.

1358
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:51,003
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1359
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:54,045
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1360
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,430
Have a nice day.

1361
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:01,679
What are we mad about?

1362
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:03,642
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1363
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:06,391
- What's Troy mad about?
- I don't know.

1364
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:08,523
I know. Totally.

1365
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:12,018
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1366
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:13,936
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1367
01:27:13,983 --> 01:27:16,193
Being cool is so exhausting.

1368
01:27:16,777 --> 01:27:21,817
Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello?

1369
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:27,366
Six years of drama school for this?

1370
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:28,875
Move it, will you?

1371
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,424
What are you doing? Come on!

1372
01:27:33,503 --> 01:27:35,173
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1373
01:27:35,213 --> 01:27:37,513
We just need to go to our happy place.

1374
01:27:37,548 --> 01:27:38,668
Tripledent gum

1375
01:27:38,716 --> 01:27:40,336
no! Not this again!

1376
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:46,638
I smell food.

1377
01:27:47,808 --> 01:27:49,018
The man has food.

1378
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,810
Get the food.
