1
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,700
Long ago,
during the Ching-dynasty...

2
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,300
Shaolin-monks wanted
to overthrow the evil regime.

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,300
But the emperor
mounted his own charge.

4
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,300
They must die.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,300
Many monks fled, with the emperor's
soldiers close on their heels.

6
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,200
That is where we join the story.

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Burning Paradise

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
- Uncle, are you hurt?
- My ankle...

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,000
- Does it hurt?
- No.

10
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
The soldiers are coming.
We must leave.

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me help you.

12
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,800
Egotistical beast.

13
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,400
- Go, save yourself.
- I don't run like an animal.

14
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Then we must fight.

15
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,900
Maybe another time, uncle.

16
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,300
Tell that to them.

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Fong, you forgot to mount.

18
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
Boy, what is your name?

19
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,700
Fong Sai Yuk of the Shaolin-temple.
And you, old goat?

20
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,000
I've been looking for you.
You cannot escape.

21
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,700
Where are you going?

22
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
Crimson?

23
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
You're finished.

24
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Fong, run for your life.

25
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,100
So you want to run away?

26
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,900
Don't leave me alone,
I want to fight.

27
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Next time I'll let you know in time.

28
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't let them go.

29
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,500
We'll hide there, quickly.

30
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Are you alright?

31
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,100
That damn animal
will be the death of me.

32
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,300
- Rotten beast.
- It's only an animal.

33
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,200
You're just too heavy.

34
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,600
That's because I do nothing
but eat and sleep.

35
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,000
Shut up,
you're a disgrace to all monks.

36
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,600
Show your old uncle some respect.

37
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,100
Damn it's windy.

38
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Empty, like it was just
waiting for us.

39
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Rather cosy.

40
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Uncle, you must pay better attention.

41
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Who is it?

42
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,900
We are hiding from the soldiers.

43
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,500
We leave as soon as I'm well again.

44
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,600
Uncle, let me massage your foot.

45
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,000
Miss, monks don't lie.
Don't be afraid.

46
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,100
Nice body.

47
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,600
- Nice legs.
- How can you tell with those pants?

48
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,500
I learned that from you.

49
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
And you're supposed to be a monk?

50
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,300
How dare you make fun of me.
You're a sinner.

51
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Sit still, uncle. Don't move.

52
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Comfortable?

53
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,500
The soldiers.

54
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Don't panic, I'll protect you.

55
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't be a hero just yet,
wait to see what they're up to.

56
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,500
Hide, uncle.

57
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Quick, there they come.

58
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,100
- Go away, it's safer.
- I have to hide too.

59
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,900
Miss, it's not done
to stand so close.

60
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,300
- Show some respect.
- Piss off.

61
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,700
- Watch your tongue.
- Fuck off.

62
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,300
Stop yapping and hide, fast.

63
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Don't lean on me, I can't stand it.

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,900
Search the cabin.

65
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This hovel is falling apart.

66
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
Nothing, let's go.

67
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Dear god.

68
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,300
Don't panic.
Don't think, just stay calm.

69
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,500
- Anything?
- There's nobody here.

70
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,100
They're leaving.

71
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Who touched me?

72
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
Not me, I'm a Shaolin-student.

73
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,000
And Chi Nun is a respected
Shaolin-monk.

74
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,300
- We'd never do such a thing.
- I'll bet.

75
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,500
- We didn't do anything.
- You can't prove we did.

76
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,900
No proof? How about this then?

77
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,400
My hands are smaller.

78
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,700
- So it was me?
- You're admitting it.

79
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
You're both the same.

80
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,300
It was just an accident.

81
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,100
You're a good person,
please don't make a fuss about it.

82
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,800
Forgive us,
we'll be forever grateful.

83
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,100
- Fong, we must go. Come on.
- Very smart, uncle.

84
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,500
Watch out.

85
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,500
- Did you do it?
- Blame it on me.

86
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,500
- I mean this.
- My hand is not that small.

87
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,800
Say it was you, otherwise it was her.

88
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,100
Leave it, we have to go.

89
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,700
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, why?

90
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,300
- You still owe me something.
- You're right.

91
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,500
You must pray for my dead mother.

92
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,600
- I will. What's your name?
- Tou Tou.

93
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,200
- I'm Fong.
- Chi Mun.

94
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,300
- So you said.
- You might have forgotten.

95
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,200
Come, I will help you.

96
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,900
Some student.

97
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,500
Tou Tou, why are you here?

98
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,200
I escaped from a brothel.
I'm on my way home.

99
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,500
- A brothel?
- I'm a whore.

100
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,900
Famine struck in my village.

101
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,100
I was sold to a brothel, for food.

102
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,400
Now everybody is dead.
I don't want to be a whore.

103
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,300
So that's why you were so offended.

104
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,500
Uncle.

105
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,200
- Don't act so nervous.
- Aren't you nervous?

106
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,400
Don't be so secretive.

107
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
- Some kung-fu master you are.
- Just unlucky.

108
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,500
We don't stand a chance.

109
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Every battle has winners and losers.

110
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,900
Shaolin is finished.

111
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,900
Fong, we must find a place
where we can live in peace.

112
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,300
Do you want to be a coward?
That's worse than an animal.

113
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm testing you,
but you take it seriously.

114
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,300
In the Shaolin-temple
I fought in the Wooden Lane.

115
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,200
- I passed the fite test.
- You're bluffing.

116
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
You don't believe me? Look.

117
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,200
- A dragon left, a tiger right.
- Let me see.

118
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,500
Are you trying to burn me?

119
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,100
You afraid of fire?
What about the fire test?

120
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,000
I was prepared then, now I'm not.

121
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm a Shaolin-student,
I must save my master.

122
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
- Shaolin-honour must be restored.
- Finished?

123
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,800
At this rate my mother
will never make it to heaven.

124
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,300
- Alright, go get wood.
- Okay.

125
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
I'll come along.

126
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,600
There's a wooden frame.
That way.

127
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
- Being a whore must be difficult.
- What about being a Shaolin-student?

128
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,700
Of course, look at my rough skin.

129
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,100
I have that too.

130
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,700
Who was your first customer?
An old man or a young man?

131
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,300
He was around 50.

132
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,800
The old bastard.

133
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,700
How can you do it
if you don't know them?

134
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,100
- I close my eyes.
- Are you afraid?

135
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
- Of course.
- And afterwards?

136
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,700
- I scream.
- Because you feel like it?

137
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,900
Aren't you Shaolin-elite?
Why do you want to know this?

138
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah, why bother about it.
I should worry about my country.

139
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,100
All I want is to go home.

140
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,100
- I'll visit you if I have the time.
- Okay.

141
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,700
Give me your address later.

142
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,500
- Is everything okay?
- Fine.

143
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,800
We're surrounded.

144
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Quickly, we have to get out of here.

145
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,800
Fire.

146
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,900
Where is uncle?

147
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,100
Fong, this way.

148
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,000
Uncle...

149
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,100
Look at all those soldiers. What now?

150
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Ready...

151
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Fong...

152
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,700
Uncle, hang on.

153
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Uncle...

154
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,400
The soldiers are coming.

155
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Stop.

156
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Fong, you will die,
unless you can fly.

157
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
Look after my uncle.

158
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,300
Come on then.

159
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
Show me what you've got.

160
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,400
Run, it's no use fighting.

161
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,000
Who comes close, dies.

162
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,800
Fong, if you want her to live,
surrender yourself.

163
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,700
- Will you let her go?
- I promise.

164
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
What do we do with the monk?

165
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
Take him away.

166
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Crimson, let him live
or I will kill you.

167
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,200
Let my uncle live.

168
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,600
May god bless you.

169
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,100
No, uncle...

170
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,700
Thanks.

171
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,600
- Stop pushing me.
- Be still.

172
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,900
RED LOTUS TEMPLE

173
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
Stop working.

174
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Everybody in line.

175
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Kneel.

176
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Lord Kung, Chi Nun is dead.
I have a gift for you.

177
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
Go on.

178
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,100
Prisoners of the Red Lotus,
you're lucky to be alive.

179
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,900
Kung-fu and praying are forbidden.
There are no Shaolin-students here.

180
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,100
Only prisoners of Ching.

181
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,100
Shut up, bitch. A Shaolin
never renounces his master.

182
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,500
What a beautiful voice.
Do you know any other tricks?

183
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,700
I'm ready.

184
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,900
Good, the Shaolin has got guts.
Bring him out.

185
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,600
Yes, Lord Kung.

186
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,900
Brother...

187
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,900
- Any more Shaolin-students?
- All of us, so what?

188
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,700
You've got nerve.

189
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,200
If you can appear before me,
you can be what you want.

190
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,500
Release him.

191
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,800
Fong, watch out.

192
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Watch out, brother.

193
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,100
Get down.

194
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,300
Fong, look out.

195
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Take my hand.

196
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,600
Brother...

197
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,900
Brother, hang on to my hand.

198
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,300
Don't let go.

199
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,700
Brother...

200
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,900
Brother...

201
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Brother...

202
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,800
This temple has many pitfalls.

203
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,200
You must obey me,
even if you are invincible.

204
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,100
In the end, you will all die.

205
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,900
Then I want you to die with me.

206
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,800
Good kung-fu.

207
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,700
- But you will die young.
- We'll see.

208
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,100
The Grip of the Fantastic Tiger.

209
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,400
How dare you be so insolent.

210
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,400
Brother.

211
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Fong, I'm no longer your brother.
I'm a foreman, you're a prisoner.

212
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,800
Traitor.

213
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,000
If you want to live, turn back now.

214
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,100
You've become their dog.

215
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm through with you.
The killer has to die.

216
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,400
Come on.

217
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,300
Show me your Crane, come on.

218
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,300
Not bad. Very educational,
the Shaolin Tiger and Crane.

219
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,100
Go on.

220
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,400
- You're scared.
- Come on.

221
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Do you repent?

222
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,300
Fong...

223
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,600
Everybody on your knees.

224
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Any more Shaolin-students?
I thought so.

225
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,200
Good work, master Hong.
Luk shall be your reward.

226
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Thank you, lord Kung.

227
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Gather everybody who can work, the
rest goes into the Cave of the Dead.

228
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,500
Fong...

229
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,500
It's me, master Chi Nun.
Don't you recognize me?

230
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,900
Are you scared?

231
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,900
- What do you think?
- Of course you are.

232
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,000
Master, you must hang on.
I've come to rescue you.

233
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,600
Long time no see.

234
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,800
Have you come only to talk nonsense?
That's kind of you.

235
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Cleaner.

236
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,600
A little kindness, please.
You're hurting me.

237
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,500
Are you afraid of me?

238
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,700
Why? Death is the worst
that can happen.

239
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Women shouldn't talk about death.

240
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,200
Is everything to your liking?

241
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,600
Such a big bath tub,
what a waste of water.

242
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:45,900
It's water from a well. You'll find
no cleaner water anywhere.

243
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,200
That itches.
I just took a bath.

244
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I always give a woman
a welcoming present.

245
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,400
What would you like?

246
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,700
Anything you want.
Just don't ask me to let you go.

247
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,600
I don't want to go.
I ask for Fong's freedom.

248
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,200
- What's your bond with him?
- He saved my life.

249
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,500
If this is the way you repay him,
you must be a passionate woman.

250
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,800
I like that.

251
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,400
Will you let him go?

252
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,300
I know your weakness now.

253
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,900
- Remember that, Boroke.
- Yes, master.

254
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,900
Master, how did you survive here?

255
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:29,500
- It wasn't so difficult.
- Master, you've gained weight.

256
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:37,400
I had no choice.
I ate too much meat.

257
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,700
- Will you eat me when I die?
- I only eat rat meat.

258
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,000
Somebody's coming.
Pretend you're dead.

259
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Sleep with the dead.

260
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,200
Corpses are so filthy.

261
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,000
That's him. Take him away.

262
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
How can a corpse
change its expression?

263
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,100
Go on.

264
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,100
- Sister Boroke...
- Luk, get out.

265
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,500
Whatever you wish.

266
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:01,100
Hong, anything Luk can give you,
I can give to you too.

267
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,500
Tonight I shall be yours.

268
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,900
I'm not that strong.
I can't do it.

269
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,300
Don't be nervous.
Be my servant.

270
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,900
You're bewitched.

271
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,900
You are lord Kung's right hand.
What could I possibly mean to you?

272
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,500
O, shut up. I think you are a hero,
that's why I want you.

273
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,500
But you're not a man of the world,
so forget it.

274
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,200
I don't dare.
I'm not prepared.

275
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:55,800
You call me the dog of Manchius,
but dogs have passion too.

276
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,700
Send Luk back in.

277
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,900
Watch your head.

278
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Your highness.

279
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,900
- How is he doing?
- It's not so bad.

280
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,800
I heard you saved my queen.
I want to repay you.

281
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,400
Then she'll owe you nothing.

282
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm sorry you must suffer to save me.

283
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,700
Lord Kung is a gentleman.
I'm just doing you a favour.

284
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,800
- How are you?
- Better, but it's still painful.

285
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,500
Show me.

286
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,700
Can you bear it?

287
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,900
You are nice, but he is a killer.

288
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,700
I will save you.

289
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,200
That depends on your strenght.

290
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,100
You two have a lot to discuss.
I won't bother you any longer.

291
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,500
What do you want?

292
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,100
- I want to walk.
- That won't speed up your recovery.

293
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,800
Help me, it'll go quicker.

294
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,300
Easy. No problems?

295
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Not at all.
Look, it doesn't hurt one bit.

296
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,700
I feel no pain.

297
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,500
- Let me lie down.
- I said: Take it easy.

298
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,200
Why do men always want to be heroes?

299
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,300
- How can you stay with that wolf.
- He hasn't touched me.

300
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,400
- He behaves like he has.
- Let's sit over there.

301
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,000
You must forget him.

302
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,400
Fong, that woman is Kung's pet.
Leave her alone.

303
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,400
Mind your own business.

304
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,400
This is the Red Lotus Temple.
It is forbidden to fool around.

305
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,900
Hong, you've betrayed Shaolin.
You will pay.

306
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,500
Shut the door.

307
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,400
- You're abusing the situation.
- I learned that from you.

308
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,000
Eat.
You're a nice person.

309
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,700
Lord Kung.

310
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

311
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,000
You're pretty when you're scared.

312
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,100
You're disgusting.
If you want me, then take me.

313
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,100
Is this some kind of trap?

314
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Damn it...

315
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Why do you lie down so easily?
Speak.

316
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,400
- I want to obey you.
- Why don't you resist?

317
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,400
Did I tell you to undress?
What kind of a slut are you?

318
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,300
You must resist.
Can anybody take you, just like that?

319
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,300
That's not what I want.
You disappoint me.

320
00:46:50,200 --> 00:47:00,800
I was a great general,
loyal to my lord and ruler.

321
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,900
Then I saw I was turning grey.
I knew I would die someday.

322
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,000
Even rich and fame
won't keep you from dying.

323
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,200
So you must enjoy life
as much as you can.

324
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,700
I want to enjoy life,
although life is unbearable.

325
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,800
For me, there's no other way.

326
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:34,800
So I asked my lord and ruler for
a transfer to the Red Lotus Temple.

327
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:46,100
Here I can do as I please.
Even the emperor cannot harm me here.

328
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:53,900
Here I am a god, and more.

329
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,000
What is the use of power?

330
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:16,500
Women, death...
I'm locked up in here.

331
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,600
The Red Lotus Temple is a horror.

332
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,600
- Aren't you afraid of death?
- Yes, don't kill me.

333
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Tung Tak saw what I did.
You must keep my secret.

334
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:56,900
- I won't say anything, really.
- Really? Try it.

335
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Does Fong want my woman?

336
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,700
I have released Fong.

337
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,200
So tonight you must do
what you promised me to do.

338
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,900
You're so pretty when you're scared.

339
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,100
Fong.

340
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,400
Close the gate.

341
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,700
Hit it.

342
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,900
Open it up.

343
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,100
Who is there?

344
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,600
Hong?

345
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,400
- Did you see anything?
- No.

346
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,600
- I'll go that way.
- I'll look over there.

347
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,600
Don't stick your nose in these
matters, or you will die.

348
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,700
- How dare you be lazy.
- Go to hell.

349
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,200
Stop.

350
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,900
Fong, drop that.

351
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,900
So he works slow.
Is that a reason to kill him?

352
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:57,300
In here, there are no laws.
Drop that if you want to live.

353
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,100
Dog.

354
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,000
Drop it, you don't have a chance.

355
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,600
Fong...

356
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,700
Kneel, all of you.

357
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,900
- Fong, you again.
- So what?

358
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,000
What's with the pride?
You owe your life to a woman.

359
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,200
And you dare call yourself
a Shaolin-student?

360
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,800
- Shame on you.
- What? Fight if you dare.

361
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,800
- With you?
- Are you scared?

362
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,400
Alright, you'll get your chance.
I'll see you on the podium.

363
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,200
Drums.

364
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,700
Go on.

365
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,100
Hurry up.

366
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,000
Move along.

367
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,400
What is this?
A theater for animal fights.

368
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,600
Who's going to fight Fong?

369
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,300
Fong has insulted the elders.
He must die.

370
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,700
Only if you beat the podium master,
you may live.

371
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,500
The podium master.

372
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,600
- Is that you, Hong?
- Hong, you filthy dog.

373
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,000
- Fong, kill that traitor.
- What? Shut up.

374
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,400
Crimson, you coward.
Fight with me if you have the guts.

375
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,600
You are a prisoner,
you cannot fight me.

376
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,500
Fong.

377
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,900
- Lord Kung, what is your command?
- The Tiger and the Crane.

378
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:27,700
If you win,
this woman will be yours.

379
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,500
Lord Kung,
I won't disappoint you.

380
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,500
Traitor. You are my brother,
but I will show no mercy.

381
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,200
Crane, I will show you how it's done.

382
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,500
- Your Tiger has lost some weight.
- You have no respect.

383
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,700
Fong...

384
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,000
Calm down, don't let go of my hand.

385
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,700
Fong, drop him.
No mercy.

386
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,500
I'll repay my debt at once.
Up with you.

387
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,200
Fong, look out.

388
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,200
- Why did you become their dog?
- I owe you no explanation.

389
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,800
To hell together or up together.

390
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,400
Fong, come up.

391
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,000
Up.

392
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,100
Hong, are you no longer loyal?

393
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,500
This map could endanger
the entire temple.

394
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,700
Luk is not only good in bed,
she's also a good informant.

395
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,200
Lord, these Shaolin-students
no longer have any purpose.

396
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:11,800
Fong, if you kill Hong,
this whore is yours.

397
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,300
What do you take me for?

398
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,000
Brother, you're trapped.

399
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,900
Let's save our brothers
and get out of here. Run.

400
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,100
Get the keys.

401
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,700
Fong...

402
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,600
So you want a rebel.

403
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,500
Bitch, you betrayed my brother.

404
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,700
Fong, come on.

405
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,000
Tung.

406
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,500
Fong...

407
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,300
- Are you alright?
- I see stars.

408
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,100
Fight.

409
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Who squeezed my dick?

410
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,400
Stop it, we're on the same side.

411
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,800
- Let's fight.
- Wait for me.

412
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,400
Outside.

413
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,100
- Brother.
- Everything okay?

414
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,300
- Many soldiers.
- Are you scared?

415
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,100
Push the gate.

416
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,600
- Pull him away.
- Let me do it.

417
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:50,600
Careful, there are many soldiers
down there. And behind you.

418
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,400
Step back.

419
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,800
Jump, quick.

420
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,500
Upstairs, now.

421
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,200
Don't let them escape. Fire.

422
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,700
- What do you want from me?
- I want to play.

423
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:53,300
And when I'm finished, I will let
my servants play with you.

424
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,100
Until nobody wants to play with you
anymore.

425
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:02,100
Then I will keep you as a statue.

426
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,100
You're crazy.

427
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:14,600
Dead people are perfect.
They don't think. Perfect.

428
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,700
You're a monster.

429
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,100
If you like death so much,
why don't you die?

430
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:27,400
When we meet again,
you will appreciate my kindness.

431
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,700
Lord Kung, all prisoners
are locked up.

432
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:44,600
Those morons. If escaping was easy,
I would have been out of here.

433
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:50,800
Good dogs are rare.
Hong wants to deceive me.

434
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,700
But all he will find is death.

435
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,600
Boroke, keep an eye on her.
No more mistakes.

436
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,000
No way out here.

437
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,000
- What now?
- Jump.

438
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,500
God, what foul smell.

439
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,000
- You've been here before.
- Traitor.

440
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,100
Master.

441
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,800
So you recognize me, you animal.
Leave me alone.

442
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,200
Leave him alone.

443
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,700
You killed my students.
You must die.

444
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,100
- I will kill you.
- Master, you don't understand.

445
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:47,900
Why am I still alive?
Because I want to save my brothers.

446
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,600
Are you that kind?

447
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,800
There are many traps here,
so I help him.

448
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,900
I have to know the traps.
He drew me a map.

449
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,400
But lord Kung found out.
I'm not lying.

450
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,500
- Then I misunderstood.
- At least you didn't hit me.

451
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,800
- No, he hit me.
- You should have ducked.

452
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,100
- You're much too fast.
- You know it.

453
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,700
We must find a way out of here.

454
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,800
If we can find the gun powder...

455
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,100
we may be able to get out of here.

456
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,400
- But how do we get to it?
- I've not been idle in here.

457
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,100
Follow me.

458
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,500
- Here is a way out.
- How on earth did you dig that?

459
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,700
Aren't I wonderful?
I found it like this.

460
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:45,300
- Master, come.
- I'm safer in here.

461
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,200
Come and get me
when you're ready to escape.

462
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,200
The future of Shaolin
is in your hands.

463
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,200
- Quite a burden.
- Stop complaining.

464
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,400
Master, you're the greatest.
We'll come for you.

465
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,700
- There we go.
- Be careful.

466
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:09,600
The Rode Lotus is as dangerous
as the martial arts themselves.

467
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:18,900
Two parties will fight,
the winner is pronounced king.

468
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,100
Why do you want to leave?

469
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,400
If you leave,
the Red Lotus will cease to exist.

470
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,500
A new man will bring new leadership.

471
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:39,600
Wake up or die.

472
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,700
Tou Tou...

473
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,200
Fong...

474
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,700
Everybody stay here.
Sit down.

475
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,200
Go save the rest.

476
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,700
Fong, look out.

477
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,700
You again.

478
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,700
- Fong, let me do it.
- Brother.

479
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,100
- Boroke, let us go.
- A dog doesn't bite his master.

480
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,800
Fong, save me.

481
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,300
They're running away. After them.

482
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,400
Tou Tou says nobody may leave.

483
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,100
- I don't want to kill you. Go.
- I don't want to.

484
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,600
- Brother, are you alright?
- Yes.

485
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,800
You musn't be too nice.

486
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,600
Hold this.

487
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:16,900
Don't let it drop on me,
that would kill me.

488
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,000
Women are such a pain.

489
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,000
Wait. Hold on.

490
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:33,200
- Let's see if you can carry this.
- You bitch.

491
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,800
Dirty bitch.

492
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Here it comes.

493
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,000
- My leg.
- I'm gonna kill you.

494
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,300
Fong, stop.
She's as good as dead anyway.

495
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,700
- Where were you?
- I was guarding the women.

496
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,000
You should have helped me.

497
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,400
But I'm so confused.

498
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,000
- Help.
- Who called for help?

499
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,200
Let's lift that thing.

500
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,200
- How are you?
- Will you take it easy.

501
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,500
- Tou Tou, are you okay?
- No.

502
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,200
- You've gained weight.
- Untie me.

503
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,100
You're so rude, it's unbelievable.

504
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,800
You let me go the first time.
Now I'll help you.

505
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:40,700
- How do you take this off?
- I'll do it myself.

506
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,300
Simple.
You should have done that earlier.

507
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,300
- I was tied up, you idiot.
- I'm such a fool.

508
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,800
When will that nitwit learn to be careful.
Fong, come back.

509
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,800
Hong, poison gas. Get out of there.

510
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,000
Come on.

511
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,700
- Let me be. You go.
- Why?

512
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,800
I probably won't make it,
and Kung will never let me go.

513
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,500
Everything will work out fine
once we get out of here.

514
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,200
It's working.

515
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,900
Where are we?

516
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,400
Rats.

517
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,900
That one's thin, he must be starved.

518
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,100
This is no time for jokes.

519
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,500
Who is there?

520
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:07,800
- Nothing but corpses.
- All because of that old monster.

521
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,500
- She looks like you.
- Shut up.

522
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,300
- A snake.
- Are you afraid of snakes?

523
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,700
At least it's quiet in here,
no fighting.

524
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:58,700
- Can't we avoid the fighting?
- How would we escape?

525
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,400
Will we get out of here alive?

526
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:07,300
- I'll make sure you get home.
- Really?

527
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,700
I've never lied before.

528
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,300
- Something's bitten me.
- Step aside.

529
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,900
- It hurts.
- Sit down.

530
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,600
Don't panic,
I'll suck out the poison.

531
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,700
- He bit in your toe.
- Let's be serious about this.

532
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,900
- It's smells bad.
- Aren't you going to save me?

533
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,800
Close your eyes.

534
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,700
No, that tickles.

535
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,200
Stop laughing,
I'm saving your life here.

536
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,100
- Are you okay?
- It doesn't matter.

537
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,900
- Are there any traps here?
- Yes.

538
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,200
Kung showed me
where the gun powder is.

539
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,300
- Where is it?
- Straight ahead.

540
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,300
Let me help you.

541
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,600
Turn it to the right
and the door will open.

542
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,400
It doesn't work.

543
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,200
But it will turn to the left.

544
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,600
- That was a mistake.
- Leave it, let's get the gun powder.

545
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,000
Hong, be careful.

546
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,500
- Did I land on you?
- No.

547
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:07,000
Hang on. Don't let go of my hand.

548
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,600
Don't let go.

549
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,100
Boroke...

550
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,800
Boroke.

551
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,200
Boroke.

552
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:43,200
Look, the door opens.
Turn the tap again.

553
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,200
- Come on, let's go.
- Let me put on my shoes.

554
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,900
Get down.

555
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,300
Let's get out of here.

556
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,100
I'm dizzy.

557
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,700
Snake.

558
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,200
- It's real, so don't worry.
- Drop it.

559
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:19,200
- Fong, do you dare to fight me?
- Are you kidding?

560
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,100
Let her go.

561
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,500
- Drop that or she dies.
- Don't trust him.

562
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,200
Tou Tou...

563
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,200
- Bastard.
- It works every time.

564
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,900
Run.

565
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,900
I'm going to kill you.

566
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,000
- Stand still and fight.
- Fong.

567
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,400
- You wait here.
- Be careful.

568
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,300
Stop, you.

569
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,800
So you want to escape? Where to?

570
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,900
I send you to hell.

571
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,600
Uncle, now you can rest in peace.

572
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,700
It's open. Climb out.

573
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:25,000
Tung, Tung, this way, quick.

574
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,700
Hong, master...

575
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,300
You are safe, that is so good.
How I've missed you.

576
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:43,900
What's gotten into you?
I'm not your wife.

577
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,700
- You're making my hand all wet.
- Master, I'm so happy.

578
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,700
- What are we waiting for?
- Master, this is a dead end.

579
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,800
- We must go that way.
- Why didn't you say so. Go on.

580
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,600
Tou Tou...

581
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,700
- Master, there's no way out.
- What do we do?

582
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,000
Buddha will have a solution.

583
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:40,700
Buddha, how do we get out of here?

584
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:49,100
- Master, he doesn't care about us.
- Maybe he's angry.

585
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,900
Hong, burn some incense.

586
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,800
Students, kneel down
and cite the sutra together.

587
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,100
- Are you done?
- Yes.

588
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,200
Get down.

589
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,600
Master.

590
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:44,400
Suckers. What good does your
Shaolin-kung fu do now?

591
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,500
You're even asking help
from a statue.

592
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,000
I built this statue,
it answers only to me.

593
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,000
When I say 'kill', it kills.

594
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,900
Don't you know
that Buddha has gone to hell?

595
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,700
Go and visit him there.

596
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,900
Take care of the master.

597
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,200
Hurry up.

598
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:40,800
Hong, you disappoint me. Shaolin or
Red Lotus, what does it matter?

599
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,000
You had a good life with me,
what more could you want?

600
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,300
Now you must die.

601
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:55,100
- Old monster, fight if you dare.
- Hong, what are you doing?

602
01:27:55,140 --> 01:28:02,600
Beautiful, both of them are here.
Just when it was getting boring.

603
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,000
Show yourself, old wolf.

604
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,300
You want to see me?
Come down to hell.

605
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,500
There.

606
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,400
Look me up in hell.

607
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,400
Show yourself.

608
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,900
He must be here somewhere.

609
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,000
Master, it's just
a big piece of stone.

610
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:44,100
No, Buddha is testing your faith.
On your knees.

611
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,800
Bow down and say you're sorry.

612
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
All the way to the ground.

613
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,900
- Not that hard.
- Look out, master.

614
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:09,200
- Master, look, sunlight.
- A miracle of Buddha.

615
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,700
- The hole is too small.
- I'll talk to him.

616
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:15,000
Why don't we blow it up?

617
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:20,000
We must respect Buddha.
On your knees and pray.

618
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,200
- Nothing.
- Where is that old monster?

619
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,100
Leave it, let's save our brothers.

620
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:48,500
- The Floating Stance?
- Your kung-fu won't save you.

621
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,900
I was just careless.
You're not so tough.

622
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,200
De jeugd denkt dat ze alles kan.
Kun je ook verliezen?

623
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,200
Het zal snel gedaan zijn met je jeugd.

624
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,800
Tijger en Kraanvogel,
dat stelt niks voor.

625
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,200
Behold my Boundless Stance.

626
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,000
And my rainbow.

627
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,600
Boundless dimensions.

628
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Boundless power,
boundless force.

629
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,300
A boundless world.

630
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,200
Tiger and Crane.

631
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,300
- What does it say?
- Boundless. I curse you.

632
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,100
Fong, now.

633
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,600
- Quick, disperse the brothers.
- Master, we're ready.

634
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,000
- How do I explain this to Buddha.
- Just light it.

635
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,100
- You do it.
- No way.

636
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:33,600
- You're young, Buddha forgives you.
- Are you mad?

637
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,500
Boundless creativity.

638
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,000
Fong...

639
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,500
He has gone to hell.

640
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,700
Watch the master, I'll go for them.

641
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,800
- Tung.
- Go now.

642
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,800
Where is Tou Tou? I must find her.

643
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,300
Fong.

644
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:10,200
- Tou Tou, where are you?
- Fong, I'm here.

645
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:16,100
Tou Tou, I'm on the bridge.
Where are you?

646
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:20,100
I'm under the bridge,
come and save me.

647
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:26,100
- I'm coming.
- Quickly, or I will surely die.

648
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:28,100
I'm coming, stop screaming.

649
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,700
- So high, I'll break my neck.
- What did you say?

650
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:36,900
Stop screaming.

651
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,700
Where are you?

652
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:56,700
- You scared the hell out of me.
- What did you yell?

653
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:00,100
That you should stop screaming.

654
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:04,800
- Now what? I can't walk like this.
- I'll carry you.

655
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:12,700
Numbskull, do you want to die?
That way.

656
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,200
- Is there a way out?
- With you it's always a dead end.

657
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,300
- What do you mean by that?
- Isn't love sweet.

658
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,500
Fire. Go back, quickly.

659
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:35,200
- Tou Tou, are you alright?
- Yes, no thanks to you.

660
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,700
Is anybody there? Come and save us.

661
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,600
You wanted to save me
and now we're trapped.

662
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:56,400
This wasn't even your fight,
you were innocent.

663
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,800
- Just like her.
- The people are suffering.

664
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,000
There's war after war after war.

665
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,900
Tou Tou, hold my hand, we're trapped.

666
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,600
I'll take you to heaven.

667
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:23,200
- Fong, enough already. Come on.
- It's too narrow.

668
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:28,200
- It breaks just like that.
- Quick, the temple is gonna explode.

669
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,900
Give me your hand.

670
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,000
Don't touch my butt.

671
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:39,300
- Why are you touching it anyway?
- It's hard to miss.

672
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,800
- What about me? Don't go.
- You jump.

673
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,800
What a pain in the ass.

674
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,100
That way.

675
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:37,000
Master, we must say farewell.
I'll bring Tou Tou home.

676
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:43,200
Fong, there are many temples
like the Red Lotus. Be careful.

677
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,600
Okay, master.

678
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:51,500
- Brothers, I wish you well.
- Come back after you're married.

679
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,500
Don't tease me,
I've never lied before.

680
01:37:56,540 --> 01:38:01,300
- Brother, take care.
- Don't hurry back.

681
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,100
Give me that horse.

682
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,300
Goodbye.

683
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,400
What a couple.
