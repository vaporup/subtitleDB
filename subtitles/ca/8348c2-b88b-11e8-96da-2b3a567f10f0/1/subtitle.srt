1
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,016
How are you doing?

2
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,939
Buenos dias.

3
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,066
Welcome aboard.
Welcome aboard.

4
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:05,676
<i>Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.</i>

5
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,220
<i>This is my TEC-9.
That there is a TEC-9.</i>

6
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:11,098
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.

7
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:14,267
They retail for 380,
I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.

8
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,854
They advertise this TEC-9 as the most
popular gun in American crime.

9
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:21,148
Can you believe that shit? It actually says
that in the booklet that comes with it.

10
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:24,693
"The most popular gun in American crime."
Like they're proud of that shit.

11
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,404
<i>I love my TEC-9.</i>

12
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,990
Let me run this up.

13
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:32,409
<i>Design emphasis behind this weapon.
Check out this gun here.</i>

14
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,120
This here is a Styer Aug.

15
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,372
Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen.

16
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,626
That shit's expensive too, man.

17
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,545
Made in Austria.

18
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:47,589
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.

19
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:51,259
Baby, I really could use me
some more ice.

20
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,597
Hold up.

21
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,600
Let me tell you,
though, man.

22
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,561
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.

23
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,688
I'm serious as a heart attack.

24
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:08,108
When them Hong Kong flicks came out,
every nigger in the world had to have a  .45.

25
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,068
And they ain't want one,
they want two...

26
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:11,987
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.

27
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,322
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...

28
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:17,033
is that a  .45 got a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem.

29
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,452
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimetre...

30
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,621
'cause it's damn near the same weapon
and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.

31
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,916
But you know how them niggers is out there.
You can't tell 'em shit.

32
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,087
They want a .45. The killer had a .45,
they want a .45.

33
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,840
Thanks, baby.

34
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,592
Who's your partner?

35
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:38,386
Cat named Mr Walker. Runs a fishing
boat outta Mexico.

36
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:42,473
I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out
to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.

37
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,643
Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a
pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

38
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,771
Now that motherfucker
rollin' in cash.

39
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:52,941
Got hisself a yacht with all kind
of high-tech navigational shit on it.

40
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,985
Oh, here we go.

41
00:05:56,152 --> 00:06:00,239
AK-47, the very best there is.

42
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:04,827
When you absolutely, positively got to
kill every motherfucker in the room...

43
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:06,745
accept no substitutes.

44
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:10,624
<i>Nothing gets
between me and my AK.</i>

45
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,126
This here is the Chinese model.

46
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:16,212
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.

47
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,131
Grab that for me, would ya, baby?

48
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:21,342
You know it's for you.

49
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,427
Girl, don't make me put my foot
in your ass.

50
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:27,598
<i>The AK-47 is the most popular assault
rifle in the world.</i>

51
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:32,060
<i>This is the Chinese model. You can tell
by the extra rivets running through</i>

52
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,231
Hello. It's for you.

53
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,660
Yo, Junebug. What's up?

54
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,582
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?

55
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,500
Boring, isn't it?

56
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,670
I can sit through it once.

57
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,630
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

58
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,341
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.

59
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,051
He's just repeating shit
he overheard.

60
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,095
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.

61
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,181
- You want?
- Sure.

62
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:16,351
<i>It shoots 500 rounds of full
metal jacket...</i>

63
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:20,146
<i>9-millimetre Luger
at 1,270 feet per second.</i>

64
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:23,107
<i>At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.</i>

65
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,359
Demi Moore.

66
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,611
<i>Really reduce muzzle lights
during firing.</i>

67
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:33,491
<i>I've never held anything
that felt so strong.</i>

68
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,870
So when'd you get out of jail?

69
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,788
Four days ago.

70
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:41,832
- Where at?
- Susanville.

71
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,001
How long?

72
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,296
About two months shy of four years.

73
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,673
Four years?

74
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,509
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

75
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,427
Really?

76
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:59,223
- Hi. Later.
- Shit, I'm impressed.

77
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,059
See what I'm talking about?

78
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:04,520
Now, that was about
a man in New York...

79
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:08,273
wants a 9-millimetre
Smith and Wesson, model 5946.

80
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,317
And why does he want it?

81
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:13,028
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.

82
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:16,489
'Cause of that nigger, I'm gonna make
1,250 off of this nigger.

83
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,950
So, what's your cost?

84
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,869
Low as two.

85
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,497
- You're serious?
- I'm telling you, Louis.

86
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:27,791
Start adding these figures up, tell me
this ain't the business to be in.

87
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,061
- I got me five M-60 machine guns too.
- Hello.

88
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,480
Motherfuckers come straight
out the Gulf War.

89
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,982
I already sold 3 of them,
20 grand a piece.

90
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,694
- Wow, that's good money.
- I'm gonna make a million dollars out of this, man.

91
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,279
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.

92
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:03,741
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mil.

93
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,659
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.

94
00:09:05,784 --> 00:09:08,287
Spend the rest of my life spending.

95
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,831
<i>Pull the trigger and let her rip!</i>

96
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,294
<i>Hi, my name is Huanita.</i>

97
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:24,593
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.

98
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,975
Don't clown on me, bitch.

99
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,938
Beaumont, what's up?

100
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:39,398
What the fuck you doin' in jail?

101
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,859
What the fuck you doin' that for?

102
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,487
Goddamn, nigger.

103
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:49,491
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?

104
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,410
Beaumont.

105
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:55,288
Beaumont.

106
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,333
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.

107
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,294
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'course you're scared.

108
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,462
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out of you.

109
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,506
That's their motherfucking job.

110
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,633
The judge doesn't give
a fuck about that.

111
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,510
He's ready to habitualize you.
Is that what you want?

112
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,637
You wanna look at ten years?

113
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:17,100
Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise, but that
means I gotta pick you up tonight.

114
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,519
Reggie, there ain't
no two ways about it.

115
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,147
You're gonna spend the night in jail, but I
already told you I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.

116
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:27,401
Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?

117
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,319
Put your mother on.

118
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:33,490
Miss Gilmore. Miss Gilmore,
this is Max Cherry.

119
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:36,409
This is Reggie's...
That's right, his bail bondsman.

120
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:39,745
Look, Reggie is in big trouble.

121
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:43,124
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before I...

122
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,084
Sit down.

123
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,253
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.

124
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,465
And look, this is a second chance
for him.

125
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,800
They don't get...
That's correct.

126
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:58,554
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.

127
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,724
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.

128
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:05,436
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.

129
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:10,816
Do yourself a really big favour
and be there when I get there.

130
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,569
How can I help you?

131
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,113
Where can I put my ash?

132
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:21,367
Use that cup there, if you like.

133
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:26,580
Oh, and I need me a bond for 10,000.

134
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:30,083
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,836
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.

136
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:36,172
Who's that big, Mandingo-looking nigger
you got up there on that picture with you?

137
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,217
- That's Winston. He works here.
- Damn!

138
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:41,927
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?

139
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,930
But you're his boss, though, right?

140
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,309
Bet it was your idea to take that
picture, too, wasn't it?

141
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,189
All right, you wanna a $10000 bond.

142
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,984
- What have you got to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

143
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,154
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

144
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,199
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- Come on, man.

145
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,367
You know how they do.

146
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:11,079
Black man show up with 10,000 cash, first
thing they wanna know is where I got it.

147
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:14,499
Then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of
it, start talkin' that court cost shit.

148
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,043
Fuck that noise, Jack. I go through you.

149
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,420
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

150
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:22,089
I can do that.

151
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,300
Who's it for? A relative?

152
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,635
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

153
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:29,930
Started out drunk driving, but they wrote
it up as possession of a concealed weapon.

154
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:33,683
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

155
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,477
They run his name, got a hit.
He'd been inside.

156
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:38,980
Plus, he's from Kentucky, and I
think they're kind of prejudiced...

157
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,941
against brothers from down
South out here.

158
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:45,152
If he runs, and I have to go to
Kentucky to bring him back...

159
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,071
you pay the expenses.

160
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:49,323
You think you can do that?

161
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,993
I've done it.
What's his full name?

162
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,703
Beaumont. That's all I know.

163
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:01,208
Would you say that Beaumont is his
first or his last name?

164
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,795
Uh, if I had to guess, I'd say Beaumont's
his Christian name.

165
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,881
Records office.

166
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:12,719
Hello, this is Max Cherry, Cherry Bail Bonds.
Who's this, please?

167
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:15,555
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.

168
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,516
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

169
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,310
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

170
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:25,105
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

171
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,233
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

172
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,695
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

173
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,947
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

174
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,533
Just point it at the car, push the button,
you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh."

175
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,201
That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.

176
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,202
Okay.

177
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,497
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

178
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,916
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- Okay.

179
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,137
Beaumont Livingston.

180
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,222
Livingston, huh?

181
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:05,601
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years' probation.

182
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,770
- You don't say.
- You know what he's on probation for?

183
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:13,316
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered machine guns.

184
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:17,487
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation of his probation?

185
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:20,865
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

186
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:23,492
Your boy's looking at ten years...

187
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,577
plus the concealed weapon.

188
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:30,749
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

189
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,420
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

190
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,422
O-R-D-E-L-L...

191
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,549
R-O-B-B-I-E.

192
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:42,134
1436 Florence Boulevard...

193
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,596
Compton, 90222.

194
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:50,851
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

195
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:58,107
Who the fuck is this?

196
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:01,193
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

197
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,779
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.

198
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,031
<i>My pleasure of living...</i>

199
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,534
<i>demands that I have a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.</i>

200
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,245
<i>I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.</i>

201
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,290
O.D.!

202
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,209
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

203
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,419
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

204
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,422
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.

205
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,341
My nigger.

206
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,093
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.

207
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,637
- Who was there for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

208
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,556
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

209
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,308
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

210
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,810
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

211
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:42,982
That's my motherfucking job. And I don't mind
telling you, nigger, it's steady work.

212
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,443
Hey, look here, man, I'm still
scared as a motherfucker, O.D.

213
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,362
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

214
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,280
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

215
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,741
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

216
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,659
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

217
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:58,246
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

218
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,790
Three years? Come on, man,
that's an old crime, man.

219
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:03,667
They ain't got room in the joint for all
these niggers out here killing people now.

220
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,377
How they gonna
find room for you?

221
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:07,754
That ain't what
they're telling me.

222
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:11,466
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you." Now,
let me tell you how we're going to retaliate.

223
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:15,261
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick you
up, take you over to Century City...

224
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,388
introduce you to my lawyer.

225
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:21,684
Let me tell you something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

226
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,602
This nigger is a junkyard dog.

227
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,980
He my own personal Johnny Cochran.

228
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:28,398
Matter of fact, he kicked
Johnny Cochran's ass.

229
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:31,860
And like Johnny Cochran, this nigger
hate cops. I'm serious, man.

230
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:34,404
He live to fuck
with the police.

231
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:37,282
Now, as a favour, I had him
look at your case.

232
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:40,701
He say you ain't got shit to worry about.
They're just fuckin' with you.

233
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:46,498
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on their
ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

234
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,625
Good lookin' out, man. Good lookin' out.

235
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,378
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no.

236
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,755
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

237
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:57,634
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

238
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,552
What you mean?

239
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:01,470
You know, man.

240
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,348
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favour...

241
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,642
then bam, hit the nigger up
for a favour in return...

242
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,685
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

243
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,938
- What? What you want?
- I need a favour, nigger.

244
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,816
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

245
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,610
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

246
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:21,155
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

247
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,741
And why are you home, huh?

248
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:27,911
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

249
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,748
Now, look, I got
a little problem, all right?

250
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,167
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

251
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,669
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

252
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,588
Come on.

253
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,551
- I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
- There ain't no problem.

254
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,678
It's more like a situation.

255
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:49,723
You remember them three M-60 machine guns
I sold last year outta the five I got?

256
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,559
Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

257
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:57,021
There's this group of Koreans over in Koreatown
startin' this Neighbourhood Watch thing.

258
00:17:57,188 --> 00:18:01,150
They need some weapons so they can show the
neighbourhood niggers they mean business.

259
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:05,029
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

260
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:08,323
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

261
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,201
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

262
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:13,119
They don't want no trouble.

263
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:15,246
You might argue with them
about price and shit...

264
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,498
but you ain't gotta worry
about them shootin' you in the back.

265
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,709
But I got me a rule:

266
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:23,421
Never do business with people you ain't never
done business with before without backup.

267
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,965
That's why I need you.
Backup.

268
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:30,844
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

269
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:34,180
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

270
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:37,058
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

271
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,976
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't fixin' to shootin' nobody.

272
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:40,895
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

273
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,397
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

274
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:46,817
You must be out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk.

275
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,986
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man.

276
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,071
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

277
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:54,741
I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

278
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,660
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

279
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:01,038
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

280
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:03,749
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

281
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,960
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

282
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:10,589
- I got a problem with small places.
- I got a problem to spend $10000 on ungrateful

283
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,048
niggers to get them out of jail...

284
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,883
but I did it.

285
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,010
How small was that jail cell,
motherfucker?

286
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:19,097
- I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.

287
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:23,100
I want to help you, but I won't be locked
in no goddamn trunk of no car.

288
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,603
You think I wanted to spend $10000
on your ass, huh?

289
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,730
I know you helped me out.

290
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,066
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?

291
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:34,194
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.

292
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:37,739
Now, look, man, all I'm asking you
to do is get in the trunk...

293
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:40,825
hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these
Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?

294
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:44,662
- You're catching a nigger off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what.

295
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,955
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans...

296
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:50,375
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

297
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,294
Think about it now.

298
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,296
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions...

299
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:58,800
side of red beans and rice,
some greens.

300
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,177
That's some good eatin'.

301
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:04,597
Man.

302
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,644
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?

303
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,481
Hey, you said ten minutes. Hey, motherfucker,
you hit my goddamn head!

304
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,774
You ponytail-wearing motherfucker.

305
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,652
What the hell's wrong with you?

306
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:06,625
Do a nigger a favour...

307
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,327
Well, you know, I'm just doin'
that thing I do, baby.

308
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,666
Oh, no. Okay. Hold on.

309
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,713
Uh, Louis, baby. It's Ordell.

310
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,965
Oh, I'm just gonna go pee.

311
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:52,889
Hello.

312
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,808
Louis, my man.
What ya doin'?

313
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,310
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.

314
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,520
Oh, yeah?
She doin' her show for you?

315
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,650
I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?

316
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:07,277
- No, she's pretty good.
- She do Mary Wells for you yet?

317
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:10,489
Nah, I don't know the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch of them.

318
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,407
Well, guess where I am?

319
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,409
I don't know.

320
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:17,036
I'm in the cosy confines
of an Oldsmobile...

321
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,205
parked right outside
Simone's house.

322
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,165
- Oh, you're outside?
- Yeah.

323
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,084
- Come on in.
- Ah, no, man.

324
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,169
I already caught that show.

325
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:29,214
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit to
show you. Why don't you step outside?

326
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,514
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.

327
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,433
Who's Beaumont?

328
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,144
An employee I had to let go.

329
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,860
What'd he do?

330
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:56,281
He put hisself in a position where he was
gonna have to do ten years in prison.

331
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,282
That's what he did.

332
00:24:58,449 --> 00:25:00,326
And if you know Beaumont...

333
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:04,121
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.

334
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:08,750
If you know that, then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...

335
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:11,128
to keep from doin'
them ten years...

336
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:14,756
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...

337
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:17,091
about my black ass.

338
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:20,011
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...

339
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,179
of him or me...

340
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,348
and you best believe...

341
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:26,767
it ain't gonna be me.

342
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,771
Now, Louis...

343
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:37,026
if you gonna come in
on this thing with me...

344
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:38,986
you've got to
be prepared...

345
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:41,739
to go all the way.

346
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:44,700
Now, I got me, so far, a half
million dollars in lock boxes...

347
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:47,703
in a bank down
in Cabo San Lucas.

348
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,122
I make this delivery...

349
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:52,749
I'm gonna have me
over a million.

350
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:57,253
Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little
cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?

351
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,755
You best think again.

352
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:02,633
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...

353
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,052
and ten niggers
look just like him.

354
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:07,846
You understand
what I'm saying?

355
00:26:08,013 --> 00:26:10,182
Yeah.

356
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:14,310
- So we on the same page then?
- Yeah, I follow.

357
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,900
My nigger.

358
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:32,661
Miss Brown!

359
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:35,538
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas,
L.A.P.D.

360
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,708
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.

361
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,377
You know, I'm a flight attendant
for Cabo Air.

362
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:44,338
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?

363
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:47,591
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

364
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:51,052
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I.D.?
- Yeah. Sure.

365
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,348
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?

366
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:58,101
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?

367
00:26:58,226 --> 00:27:00,978
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.

368
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,439
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.

369
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:06,316
If I don't want to go to all that trouble,
I'd just take you in on suspicion now.

370
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:09,987
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?

371
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,656
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.

372
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:16,075
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.

373
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:19,120
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

374
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:22,873
Bad knees.

375
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,001
You have a good flight?

376
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:29,588
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went
down there one time with Susan, my wife.

377
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:32,257
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.

378
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,845
Hey, can I look
in this envelope?

379
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:50,649
Goddamn.

380
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:52,692
I'd say there's
about, oh, uh...

381
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,236
$50,000 here.

382
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:57,530
What would you say, Ray?

383
00:27:57,697 --> 00:28:01,200
Looks like about 50,000
from here.

384
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,372
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

385
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:09,833
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000, you have to declare it.

386
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,419
You forget, or what?

387
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:16,714
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

388
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:20,343
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

389
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:22,636
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie...

390
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,431
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.

391
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:29,184
Those guys down in Customs? They're a bunch of
pricks. Excuse me, but they are.

392
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:33,688
There's something about that job makes
those people really hard to get along with.

393
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:36,065
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

394
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:39,360
who are really suspicious and
really disagreeable human beings...

395
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:44,156
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

396
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:47,576
It's up to you.

397
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,665
Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.

398
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,377
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.

399
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,463
In 1985,
while a stewardess for Delta...

400
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,631
you were busted
while carrying drugs for a pilot?

401
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,050
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off.

402
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,594
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.

403
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:11,348
He did time; you did probation.

404
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:14,351
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.

405
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:16,728
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.

406
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:19,105
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist...

407
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:23,442
but all this criminal activity fucks up your
shit for good with the big airlines.

408
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,237
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age...

409
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:31,450
flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin'
piece of shit Mexican airline there is...

410
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,618
where you make what,
$13000 a year?

411
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:36,704
I make 16,000,
plus benefits.

412
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:40,791
You been in the service industry 19 years,
and all you make is 16,000, plus benefits?

413
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:45,421
Didn't exactly set the world on fire,
did you, Jackie?

414
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:47,422
Jackie, you have a good lawyer?

415
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,966
Can she afford
a good one, is more like it.

416
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:52,260
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...

417
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:55,930
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

418
00:29:56,097 --> 00:30:01,519
Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

419
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:04,605
Yeah? No?

420
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:06,982
Because he knows you.

421
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:08,984
Well, he knew you.

422
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:11,611
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

423
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,656
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning...

424
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,783
shot twice.

425
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,453
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

426
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,788
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

427
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,207
If you don't know Beaumont...

428
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:31,421
how do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

429
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:38,845
Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you.

430
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,930
You know who we want.

431
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:44,433
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.

432
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,353
If you refuse to cooperate, continue to
cop a shit attitude like you're doing now...

433
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,314
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.

434
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,858
With your prior, the judge
will give you two years.

435
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:57,320
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change...

436
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:00,198
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...

437
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:04,618
desperately clinging on to this one shitty,
little job I was fortunate enough to get...

438
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:07,538
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.

439
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:10,999
So let's start again now,
shall we?

440
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:15,336
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who
in America were you bringing it to?

441
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:18,923
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.

442
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,933
I'd like your permission to look through this
again so we'll know how much we're talking about.

443
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,644
Sure. Go ahead.

444
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:38,399
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.

445
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,359
Do you mind?

446
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,698
Beauty case.

447
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,325
- What's in it?
- Beauty products.

448
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,162
Alarm clock.

449
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,414
Glass case.

450
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,458
Birth control.

451
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,963
- What's that?
- My diet shit.

452
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,341
Let's see what else
is in there.

453
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,052
Here. Here. Here.

454
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,432
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

455
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,478
Let's go, ladies.
First door on the left.

456
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,919
Brown, case 70032.

457
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,798
The charge is...

458
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:53,843
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

459
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,972
- How does your client plead?
- Your Honour, she wishes to stand mute.

460
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,891
Very well.

461
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:02,643
Detective... Varga.

462
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,812
- Dargas, Your Honour.
- Sorry.

463
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:07,898
You were the arresting officer
in this case?

464
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:10,817
- That's correct, Your Honour.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?

465
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:13,194
- Yes, I do, Your Honour.
- And that would be?

466
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:15,822
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...

467
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:18,491
and the extreme possibility
of flight due to the occupation...

468
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,993
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.

469
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,704
The People are fine with this?

470
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:35,423
I'm gonna set bond at 10,000...

471
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,301
and set the date
of August 21...

472
00:33:38,468 --> 00:33:40,303
for the prelim.

473
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,221
Your Honour,
when will that be?

474
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:46,308
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then.

475
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:50,062
Owens, case 72242.

476
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,522
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...

477
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:55,442
and striking an officer.

478
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:58,653
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.

479
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,115
Uh, my client would like to
plead guilty, Your Honour.

480
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:06,785
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

481
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:20,631
I didn't hear you wash your hands.

482
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,593
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

483
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,722
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

484
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,932
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

485
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,059
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?

486
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,770
She is an airline stewardess.

487
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:38,439
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

488
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,150
They set her bond this afternoon
at $10000.

489
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:45,195
Now, I'm figuring you could take that
$10000 you owe me from Beaumont...

490
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:47,739
move it over
to the stewardess.

491
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:50,908
The bond for possession's only a thousand.

492
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,913
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent."

493
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,041
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces...

494
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,959
they calling that shit "intent."

495
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:03,671
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession."

496
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,589
Still sounds high.

497
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:10,635
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

498
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:13,888
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses...

499
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:16,099
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.

500
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:18,226
You know, I think
somebody already did.

501
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:20,728
- What?
- You ain't hear?

502
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:24,523
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out.

503
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,401
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes.

504
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:29,403
Blew Beaumont's
brains out.

505
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:33,323
Police make contact
with you?

506
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,743
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

507
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,328
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy...

508
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:42,206
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.

509
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,833
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning.

510
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,002
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

511
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:49,880
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

512
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,341
- This stewardess...
- You know her last name?

513
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:57,053
Brown. Jackie Brown.

514
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,472
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

515
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,975
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

516
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,019
Beaumont worked for you.

517
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:08,397
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

518
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:10,315
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

519
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:13,693
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

520
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,822
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?

521
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,740
Confidentiality.

522
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:21,701
Why should I
tell you anything?

523
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,078
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

524
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,455
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

525
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,583
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

526
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,961
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

527
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:37,382
I'd say you were in the drug business, except
the money's moving in the wrong direction.

528
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:42,178
Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so, uh, more power to you.

529
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,763
All right.
You want another bond?

530
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,474
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

531
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,351
That means paperwork.

532
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,853
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court...

533
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,273
make out a receipt for return of bond
collateral, type up another application...

534
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,317
...another indemnity agreement.

535
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,610
- Jackie ain't got time for this.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

536
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:01,529
What you have to do,
in case you forgot...

537
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:04,657
- is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

538
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:07,534
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

539
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,995
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

540
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:13,915
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

541
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:17,043
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

542
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,837
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen...

543
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,715
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

544
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,050
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

545
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:27,136
Listen to me, all right?

546
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:31,431
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully employed
black woman falsely accused...

547
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:35,059
Falsely accused? She didn't come back
from Mexico with cocaine on her?

548
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:37,395
Falsely accused of "intent."

549
00:37:37,562 --> 00:37:40,731
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying if...

550
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,234
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

551
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,737
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

552
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:51,825
Oh, it's like that, huh?

553
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,331
All right.

554
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,877
I got you a thousand bucks.

555
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:08,006
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

556
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:11,927
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.

557
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:15,180
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.

558
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,487
Max, here she comes.

559
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,549
Miss Brown?

560
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,051
Yes?

561
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:45,019
I'm Max Cherry.
I'm your bail bondsman.

562
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:48,724
I could give you a lift home, if you like.

563
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,961
You really a bail bondsman?

564
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,921
Well, who do you think I am?

565
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,674
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I.D.?

566
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,260
You're serious?

567
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,644
Who paid my bond?

568
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,272
- Ordell?
- In cash.

569
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,552
You got any cigarettes in here?

570
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,722
You won't find
any cigarettes in there.

571
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:23,060
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.

572
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,604
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?

573
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:29,524
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.

574
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:32,944
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

575
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:36,573
- I thought you might like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.

576
00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:40,534
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?

577
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,787
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.

578
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,665
It doesn't sound dark.

579
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:48,834
Why does it have to be dark?

580
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:53,672
Because it looks like
I just got out of jail, that's why.

581
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,008
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.

582
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,894
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago.

583
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:11,438
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.

584
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:14,149
Take it off and put it back on.

585
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:17,694
That's why I don't quit.

586
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:30,288
If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my brand.

587
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,585
You know...

588
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:39,255
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

589
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,758
15,000 bonds since I've been
in the business.

590
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:46,762
I figure about 80% of those
were drug-related, so...

591
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:50,515
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.

592
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:55,520
So far, they told me
if I cooperate...

593
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:59,023
then I'll get probation, maybe.

594
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,401
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

595
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:04,653
Does that sound right?

596
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,532
I'd say that if they try you and convict you,
you won't get more than a year and a day.

597
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,659
That's state time, prison.

598
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:12,869
But they won't
want to do that.

599
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:15,830
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

600
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:18,791
and a year or two
of probation.

601
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:22,002
Do you happen to know
who put the dope in your bag?

602
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:24,463
Yeah.

603
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,841
But that's not
what this is about.

604
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,302
They were waiting for my ass.

605
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:32,220
They knew about the money.

606
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:35,723
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

607
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,601
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.

608
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:42,063
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

609
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:44,398
They said it was him
who told them about me.

610
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:48,402
That would be...
Beaumont Livingston.

611
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,946
How do you know about him?

612
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:54,657
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.

613
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,287
Ordell pick up his bond?

614
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:03,040
Same as you... $10,000.

615
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:12,465
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

616
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:15,260
- The legal advice and the ride.
- You bet.

617
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:19,722
Good luck. We'll be in touch.

618
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:28,410
How ya doin', Miss Jackie?

619
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:30,328
Come on in.

620
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,964
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.

621
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:44,508
Got some O.J.?

622
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,844
Why don't you be
a good hostess...

623
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,721
and hook a brother up
a screwdriver?

624
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,640
Sure.

625
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:00,022
Well?

626
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:03,651
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?

627
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:06,528
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out of jail?

628
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:10,449
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.

629
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:14,994
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.

630
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,830
- It wasn't mine.
- What?

631
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:21,500
Oh, shit.

632
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,587
I bet that was that present
Mr Walker was sending Melanie.

633
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:28,590
Yeah. If you didn't
put it in there, he must have.

634
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:31,760
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.

635
00:46:31,927 --> 00:46:36,180
Bet they asked you a whole shitload
of questions about it, huh?

636
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:40,101
And all that money,
where it came from.

637
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:43,646
Probably asked you who you
was bringin' it to too.

638
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,982
They asked.

639
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:50,110
And you said?

640
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:54,280
"I want to talk to my lawyer."

641
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:58,326
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?

642
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:00,870
I mean, if you did,
I ain't mad at you.

643
00:47:01,037 --> 00:47:02,788
I just gotta know.

644
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:07,292
You ain't asking
the right questions.

645
00:47:14,466 --> 00:47:17,677
You should be asking
why they picked me up.

646
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:21,889
They were waiting for me.

647
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:25,392
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.

648
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,188
They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?

649
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:34,984
Beaumont Livingston?

650
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:38,571
I knew it.
I knew it.

651
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:41,365
They even asked me
if I knew Mr Walker.

652
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:43,284
Yeah?

653
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,287
I didn't tell them
anything about him.

654
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:49,539
My name come up?

655
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:55,795
You ain't said nothin' about me?

656
00:47:55,962 --> 00:47:59,298
Ah, that's mighty noble of you.

657
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:03,844
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?

658
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:06,180
Yeah, they told me.

659
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:08,098
Yeah.

660
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:11,351
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.

661
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:16,105
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.

662
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,944
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.

663
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:25,781
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?

664
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:29,826
You scared of me?

665
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:35,206
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?

666
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:40,670
Is that what
I think it is?

667
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,214
What do you think it is?

668
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,550
- I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick.
- Well, you thought right.

669
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:49,428
Now, take your hands
from around my throat...

670
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,263
nigger.

671
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,350
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up.

672
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:58,394
Don't you move. Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?

673
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,689
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do
with you. I carry that all the time.

674
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,691
You been talking
to them police too much.

675
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,235
- The police didn't try and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.

676
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,654
- I was just playing with you.
- I ain't playing with you.

677
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,990
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers
if you don't do what I tell you to do.

678
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,242
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Jackie, stop acting crazy.

679
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,161
- Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying?
- Yeah, woman. Damn!

680
00:49:17,328 --> 00:49:19,539
Now, sit your ass down
on that sofa.

681
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:24,001
See? Police start fuckin' with your mind,
start pittin' black against black.

682
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:28,171
- That's how they do. They been doing this since...
- Shut your raggedy ass up.

683
00:49:28,338 --> 00:49:30,674
Sit the fuck down!

684
00:49:30,841 --> 00:49:33,885
And put your hands behind your head.

685
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:38,264
- This is gettin' silly now.
- You want to see some motherfuckin' silly?

686
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,434
If I have to tell you to shut up one
more time, I'm gonna shut you up.

687
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,437
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?

688
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:49,691
The way I see it, you and me got
one motherfucking thing to talk about.

689
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:51,902
One thing...

690
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:54,946
and that's what you
are willing to do for me.

691
00:49:55,113 --> 00:49:58,574
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.

692
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,661
Now, sooner or later they're gonna get
around to offering me a plea deal...

693
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:03,621
and you know that.

694
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:06,290
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.

695
00:50:06,457 --> 00:50:08,542
No, that's all right.
It's okay.

696
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:10,961
Now, I forgive you.

697
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:13,963
Now, let's say,
if I tell on you...

698
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,882
I walk.

699
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:18,468
If I don't, I'll go to jail.

700
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:21,220
I want $100,000...

701
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:23,430
in an escrow account
in my name...

702
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:27,017
if I'm convicted
up to a year or put on probation.

703
00:50:27,142 --> 00:50:29,853
Now, if I have to do
more than a year...

704
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,189
you pay another $100,000.

705
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:39,820
I can do that.

706
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:43,157
- You know I got that problem. All my money is...
- In Mexico.

707
00:50:43,324 --> 00:50:46,827
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.

708
00:50:46,994 --> 00:50:49,037
I got me an idea.

709
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,418
Let me hear that.
We friends again.

710
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:58,629
Why don't you point that
motherfucking gun somewhere else?

711
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:08,055
- I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
- All right.

712
00:51:25,154 --> 00:51:27,447
You want your gun back?

713
00:51:27,614 --> 00:51:30,325
Come on in.
I'll get it for you.

714
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:53,888
Max, look,
I am so sorry about this.

715
00:51:54,055 --> 00:51:57,892
You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow it,
'cause I was afraid you would say no.

716
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:00,186
I mean, you'd have to.

717
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,147
Would you like some coffee?

718
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:05,733
- If you're having some.
- I am. Come on in.

719
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:08,193
Why don't you make
yourself at home.

720
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,737
Just, you know,
have a seat.

721
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:13,448
Did you get a chance
to use it?

722
00:52:13,573 --> 00:52:16,201
I felt a lot safer
having it.

723
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,287
Oh, the milk went bad
while I was in jail.

724
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:22,581
- Black's fine.
- Cool.

725
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:25,542
Would you, uh, care to hang
on to it for a while?

726
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,962
It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess...

727
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:31,339
Well, thanks.
I got one now.

728
00:52:31,506 --> 00:52:34,092
You went out this morning and bought a gun?

729
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:37,679
- What? I didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

730
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:42,141
Well, let's say
I got one now, okay?

731
00:52:42,308 --> 00:52:45,060
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.

732
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:51,775
All right!
We're on.

733
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,487
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?

734
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:57,447
Sure.

735
00:52:57,613 --> 00:52:59,365
Cool.

736
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:02,243
You know, I couldn't wait
to get home last night...

737
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,745
and wash the jail
outta my hair.

738
00:53:04,912 --> 00:53:07,706
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.

739
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:11,918
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?

740
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:15,296
Oh, I got a few, but I can't
afford to start all over again.

741
00:53:15,421 --> 00:53:18,174
I mean, I've invested
too much time and money...

742
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:20,176
in my albums.

743
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,470
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.

744
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:26,390
I don't get new stuff
that often.

745
00:53:56,709 --> 00:54:00,880
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.

746
00:54:02,747 --> 00:54:04,008
It's nice.

747
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:10,972
I called in sick today. As far as the
airline knows, I'm still available.

748
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:12,933
- Are you?
- I don't know. I'm gonna go in

749
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,726
and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.

750
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:18,354
I'm going to do what you suggested...
offer to help and see what happens.

751
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:22,191
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

752
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:25,361
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

753
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:29,364
Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants you,
that'll only interest him up to a point.

754
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:31,908
I know, but it's
a lot of money.

755
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:35,745
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

756
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:39,749
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

757
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:43,210
- He called?
- He came by.

758
00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:46,797
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

759
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:49,049
Do you think
he still trusts you?

760
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:52,385
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

761
00:54:52,552 --> 00:54:56,180
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

762
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:00,851
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.

763
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:04,980
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over
there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

764
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:08,900
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.

765
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:11,903
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.

766
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,781
I mean, he can't use
his other people. They're crooks.

767
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:17,617
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself...

768
00:55:17,742 --> 00:55:20,077
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

769
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:23,706
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.

770
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:26,333
And I made him feel
like he still can.

771
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,169
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

772
00:55:29,336 --> 00:55:32,547
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.

773
00:55:32,714 --> 00:55:36,342
It's very possible
that Ordell's killed somebody.

774
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:38,803
Do you realize that?

775
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,932
Well, I ain't going back to jail, and
I ain't doing that probation thing again.

776
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:52,357
Max, how do you feel
about getting old?

777
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:55,610
You're not old.
You look great.

778
00:55:55,777 --> 00:55:59,113
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.

779
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,367
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something I think about.

780
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:07,538
I guess I got sensitive
about my hair a few years ago.

781
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:10,749
It started falling out,
so I did something about it.

782
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:12,709
How'd you feel about that?

783
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:15,587
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

784
00:56:15,753 --> 00:56:19,340
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do.

785
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:22,802
I look in the mirror.
Looks like me.

786
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:25,637
Yeah, but it's
different for men.

787
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:29,391
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.

788
00:56:29,558 --> 00:56:31,935
I bet that, except for
possibly an afro...

789
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,979
you look exactly
the way you did at 29.

790
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:39,150
Well, my ass ain't the same.

791
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:41,527
Bigger?

792
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,781
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

793
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:50,786
Something else worry you?

794
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:57,834
I always feel like I'm starting over.

795
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,295
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 15,000.

796
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,174
- Is that a lot?
- That's plenty.

797
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:10,220
Well, I've flown
over seven million miles...

798
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:13,390
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years.

799
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,893
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air...

800
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,438
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry.

801
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,857
You know I make
16,000 a year...

802
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:26,193
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn.

803
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,738
And with this arrest
hanging over my head, Max, I'm scared.

804
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,449
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again...

805
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,701
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.

806
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,745
I'll be stuck
with whatever I can get.

807
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:43,125
And that shit
is more scary than Ordell.

808
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,929
Hey, great, you're here.

809
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:58,347
- Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?
- Fine.

810
00:57:58,473 --> 00:58:01,100
- Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.

811
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:03,144
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?

812
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,021
Absolutely.

813
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:08,357
- Dude, what up?
- She wants to make a deal.

814
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:11,151
- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.

815
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:13,320
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.

816
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:15,864
- Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.

817
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,449
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?

818
00:58:18,616 --> 00:58:20,576
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.

819
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:23,787
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.

820
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:28,417
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.

821
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,128
Now, what can we do for you?

822
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:34,714
I need permission to leave the country
so I can keep my job.

823
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:38,301
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.

824
00:58:38,426 --> 00:58:41,304
If I don't show up for work tomorrow,
I'm fired.

825
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,806
Well, you know what we want.

826
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:46,100
If I'm working, I can help you.

827
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:48,518
Help us do what, Jackie?

828
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:51,897
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.

829
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:53,815
You never asked if I did or not.

830
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,359
- So you're telling us now that you do know him.
- Of course I do.

831
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:59,070
- I deliver money for him.
- No shit?

832
00:58:59,237 --> 00:59:02,907
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.

833
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,326
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.

834
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:07,619
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.

835
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:10,747
Besides, why else would
an A.T.F. man be after him?

836
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:18,046
Well, how can you help us?

837
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:22,591
I'll do anything I can to help you
get his ass, short of wearing a wire.

838
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:25,719
And in return for my help, I need permission
to leave the country, and immunity.

839
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:28,680
You don't want much, do you?

840
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:30,932
Can you do it or not?

841
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:36,437
You know, I mean...

842
00:59:36,604 --> 00:59:39,315
It's possible.

843
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:41,150
<i>You're going to hear a guy
beg for his life, lady...</i>

844
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,569
<i>'cause he betrayed Nani Vitali.</i>

845
00:59:43,736 --> 00:59:45,404
<i>Read the paper.</i>

846
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:48,282
<i>Read it!</i>

847
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:52,244
<i>Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.</i>

848
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,287
<i>He's already killed two people.</i>

849
00:59:54,454 --> 00:59:57,874
<i>You know what he's known as?
The Mad Dog Murderer.</i>

850
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:02,378
- Hey, girl.
- Hola!

851
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,508
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like
somebody got some new clothes.

852
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:10,761
Yeah, we did
a little shopping.

853
01:00:10,927 --> 01:00:13,638
You know, I couldn't have my boy
running around looking like no bum.

854
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:16,182
- I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.
- Come on now, man.

855
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:19,560
You know you had that Salvation Army
thing going.

856
01:00:19,727 --> 01:00:24,148
Goddamn, girl. You getting high already?
It's just 2:00.

857
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:26,442
It's that late?

858
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:28,694
You smoke too much of that shit, that
shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.

859
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,905
Not if your ambition
is to get high and watch TV.

860
01:00:34,616 --> 01:00:37,327
Oh, y'all a couple of
Cheech and Chongs, huh?

861
01:00:37,493 --> 01:00:40,788
Oh, don't get up. I got it.

862
01:00:40,955 --> 01:00:42,748
Have a seat.

863
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:46,418
Yo. Jackie! What's up?

864
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,837
No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

865
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:52,048
- I was gonna tell you!
- No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.

866
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,050
Here.

867
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,052
- You gotta make sure ain't nobody following you.
- It's ready to go?

868
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,137
Yeah. There's another bowl left.

869
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,606
Take your thumb off the carb.

870
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:17,280
Shit.

871
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:20,658
You okay?

872
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:22,618
I'm just... getting old.

873
01:01:24,954 --> 01:01:29,082
I can't... smoke or laugh now
without coughing.

874
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:31,710
Coughing's good. It opens
up the capillaries.

875
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:35,380
You know, when you cough, you're
pulling air... in this case, smoke...

876
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:37,924
into parts of the lungs
that don't normally get used.

877
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:40,509
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.

878
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:42,678
You definitely know
a lot about that.

879
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:45,180
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.

880
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:47,558
So, since you like
getting high so much...

881
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:49,976
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?

882
01:01:50,102 --> 01:01:52,520
- Way ahead of you.
- See, I get high later on when I come back.

883
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:55,732
See, I get high at night when I
get through with all my business.

884
01:01:55,899 --> 01:01:59,485
Is that Rutger Hauer?

885
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:03,364
No, it's Helmut Berger.

886
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:08,619
Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl?

887
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,914
You know, I hope you don't mind
hanging out with Louis.

888
01:02:12,998 --> 01:02:13,790
No problem.

889
01:02:13,957 --> 01:02:16,668
Try not to tear his clothes
off of him, all right? They're new.

890
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:22,173
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.

891
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:30,055
Want a Metrix?

892
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,474
Damn. Shit.

893
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,601
What's a Metrix?

894
01:02:34,768 --> 01:02:37,895
It's like this major meal that you drink in
a shake instead of having a big meal.

895
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,730
It's like a diet thing?

896
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:42,608
No. It's what bodybuilders drink
to, you know, beef up.

897
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:45,235
No, thanks.

898
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,779
Okay.

899
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,701
When was the last time I saw you?

900
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:55,119
Oh... six, seven years ago.

901
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:57,663
It doesn't seem
like that long ago.

902
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:01,375
It was that long ago.

903
01:03:04,169 --> 01:03:07,464
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?

904
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:10,926
The roller disco picture. This one.

905
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:13,178
14.

906
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:17,140
- You were 14 here?
- Yup.

907
01:03:17,265 --> 01:03:19,767
Shit, man. I thought
you were at least 16.

908
01:03:21,352 --> 01:03:24,230
Well, I'm about the same height now
as I was then.

909
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:45,999
- That other picture, that green one?
- Yeah?

910
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:48,418
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.

911
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:50,712
Do you remember that? It was
in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?

912
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:52,756
- No.
- Where were you?

913
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:55,300
I was in Detroit.

914
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:57,218
With Ordell?

915
01:03:57,343 --> 01:03:59,637
Yeah. We had done
some time already.

916
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:02,807
Were you a... disco guy?

917
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:05,434
Nah.

918
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:09,521
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.

919
01:04:09,688 --> 01:04:13,483
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a few just to meet women, but...

920
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,278
it was so loud and I didn't
like to dance.

921
01:04:17,445 --> 01:04:21,282
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.

922
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:24,493
So who didn't make the cut?

923
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,913
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?

924
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,707
Uh, that's the guy
that I lived with.

925
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,126
His name was Hi-Hiro...
Hiro... Hiroshi.

926
01:04:33,293 --> 01:04:35,837
He must have made
quite an impression.

927
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:39,340
If you count cheese.
I never got to know him really.

928
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:42,259
You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese,
and his English was terrible.

929
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:46,555
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than my Japanese, you know.

930
01:04:46,722 --> 01:04:49,766
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.

931
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:52,227
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.

932
01:04:52,394 --> 01:04:54,687
I never really got to know him,
but I knew enough to know...

933
01:04:54,813 --> 01:04:57,357
that I wasn't
missing much, so...

934
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,775
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there...

935
01:04:59,901 --> 01:05:02,278
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.

936
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:04,405
That's Japan.

937
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,824
Well... Yeah, I can...
Yeah, it looks. I could tell.

938
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,576
Wanna fuck?

939
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:28,093
That was fun.

940
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,971
Yeah. Yeah, that really
hit the spot.

941
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:40,730
Now we can catch up.

942
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,405
You got a beer?

943
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,782
Yeah, sure. In the fridge.

944
01:06:39,617 --> 01:06:42,244
I'm going to the bar, baby.

945
01:06:44,538 --> 01:06:46,832
- Jackie Jack!
- Hey.

946
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:51,419
Damn! I'm gonna have to remember
this place. This is all right.

947
01:06:51,545 --> 01:06:54,130
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.

948
01:06:54,297 --> 01:06:57,008
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, home.

949
01:06:57,175 --> 01:06:59,260
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.

950
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:02,763
Yes, you are.

951
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,474
Damn! I bet you come in here
on a Saturday night...

952
01:07:05,641 --> 01:07:09,269
you need nigger repellant to
keep them motherfuckers off your ass.

953
01:07:09,436 --> 01:07:12,230
- Oh, I do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.

954
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:16,484
You're a fine motherfucker. I bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.

955
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:19,612
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.

956
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:22,573
But it don't matter, 'cause they
already know I'm meeting you.

957
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,783
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.

958
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,785
- You told...
- 3.25.

959
01:07:26,952 --> 01:07:29,287
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.

960
01:07:29,454 --> 01:07:31,206
- You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.

961
01:07:31,373 --> 01:07:33,291
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.

962
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:35,502
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...

963
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:39,130
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.

964
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:42,383
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know... you.

965
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,260
You tell 'em anything else?

966
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:47,804
Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico,
and you want me to bring it in.

967
01:07:47,971 --> 01:07:50,891
- Goddamn... You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?

968
01:07:51,057 --> 01:07:53,768
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

969
01:07:53,935 --> 01:07:55,728
They know I'm delivering for you.

970
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:58,356
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.

971
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,900
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.

972
01:08:01,025 --> 01:08:03,652
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

973
01:08:03,819 --> 01:08:05,863
- Let me bring in the money."
- And they said?

974
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:08,740
Yes.

975
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:12,369
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.

976
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:16,122
This is just seeming kind of
risky now, you know. Fuck this.

977
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:18,833
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?

978
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:21,669
I make two deliveries...
the first with 10,000.

979
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:25,047
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.

980
01:08:25,214 --> 01:08:27,424
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.

981
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:29,843
See, that's too much exposure.

982
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,721
- Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.

983
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:35,014
I told them you never pick up
the money yourself.

984
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,184
You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

985
01:08:38,351 --> 01:08:41,520
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea.

986
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:44,398
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around...

987
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:46,817
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone.

988
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:50,070
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours.

989
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:53,114
- Like a woman?
- If you want.

990
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:55,742
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman.

991
01:08:55,909 --> 01:08:58,995
Wait a minute. If they're gonna let you go...
how come we don't bring all the

992
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:01,539
- cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em.

993
01:09:01,664 --> 01:09:04,250
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils...

994
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,002
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.

995
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:10,464
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.

996
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,882
And they follow the wrong one...

997
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,968
thinking she's bringing
the money to me.

998
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:18,387
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.

999
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,848
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.

1000
01:09:21,015 --> 01:09:23,100
Yeah, I got
the women covered.

1001
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,519
Where are you planning
on pulling this off?

1002
01:09:25,686 --> 01:09:27,980
The Del Amo Mall,
the food court.

1003
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:30,273
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1004
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:33,276
It's my plan.
We're in this together.

1005
01:09:33,443 --> 01:09:36,070
Yeah, but it's my money,
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.

1006
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:38,489
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager.

1007
01:09:38,656 --> 01:09:41,742
And I'm managing to get your money out of
Mexico, into America, in your hands...

1008
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:44,161
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.

1009
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:46,997
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%.

1010
01:09:47,164 --> 01:09:50,083
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.

1011
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,168
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No.

1012
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:54,796
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10.

1013
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:56,714
I'm getting 15%, all right?

1014
01:09:56,881 --> 01:09:59,300
All I'm gonna give you is ten.

1015
01:09:59,425 --> 01:10:01,677
And the same deal as before.

1016
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:08,892
I can do that.

1017
01:10:09,059 --> 01:10:11,686
So he says, "Fuck that,"
and moves over into guns.

1018
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:14,564
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.

1019
01:10:14,731 --> 01:10:17,150
He's acting like he's this big
international arms dealer...

1020
01:10:17,316 --> 01:10:21,028
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.

1021
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,741
Well, he seems
to be making out.

1022
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:28,493
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

1023
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,037
Yeah, well...
so far, he is.

1024
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:33,915
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright.

1025
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:36,876
I wouldn't go
so far as to say that.

1026
01:10:38,127 --> 01:10:40,254
He moves his lips
when he reads.

1027
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:42,339
What does that tell you?

1028
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:45,342
Let's say that
he's streetwise, you know.

1029
01:10:45,509 --> 01:10:49,012
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuckup.

1030
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,859
He killed a man who worked for him
the other day.

1031
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,111
Well...

1032
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:10,490
So, what are you trying
to tell me?

1033
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:12,701
That I should get out of here?

1034
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:15,119
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

1035
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:18,956
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.

1036
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:22,710
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1037
01:11:24,712 --> 01:11:27,381
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so...

1038
01:11:27,506 --> 01:11:30,884
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out.

1039
01:11:31,051 --> 01:11:34,387
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?

1040
01:11:34,554 --> 01:11:37,140
Of course he did. He tells
anybody who's gonna listen.

1041
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:39,559
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.

1042
01:11:39,725 --> 01:11:42,937
They're scheming on how they can
get that money over here.

1043
01:11:43,062 --> 01:11:45,481
And your point is?

1044
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:50,152
Let him and the stewardess get
the money over here...

1045
01:11:50,318 --> 01:11:53,363
and then just
take it from them.

1046
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:04,248
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.

1047
01:12:04,415 --> 01:12:07,125
You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling?

1048
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:08,543
No. It's just about Melanie.

1049
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,296
You know what?
I'm real sorry about that, man...

1050
01:12:11,379 --> 01:12:13,631
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden.

1051
01:12:13,798 --> 01:12:16,259
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.

1052
01:12:16,384 --> 01:12:19,262
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.

1053
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,226
So, what she say?

1054
01:12:26,393 --> 01:12:29,146
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.

1055
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:32,274
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.

1056
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,984
Melanie real good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.

1057
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:38,696
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.

1058
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,574
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1059
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:44,451
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1060
01:12:44,618 --> 01:12:46,370
Well...

1061
01:12:46,537 --> 01:12:49,706
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.

1062
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:52,626
Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.

1063
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,752
Afterwards, I did.

1064
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:07,973
But, um... But, like,
you know, what is she to you?

1065
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,684
You know, she's just
one of the bitches I got set up.

1066
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:13,061
I got Mel
over in Hermosa Beach...

1067
01:13:13,228 --> 01:13:15,897
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying...

1068
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:20,192
and about four blocks away I got this young
19-year-old country girl named Sheronda.

1069
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,820
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia...

1070
01:13:22,987 --> 01:13:25,072
barefoot, country
as a chicken coop.

1071
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:27,950
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.

1072
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:30,786
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.

1073
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:33,538
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.

1074
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:35,790
Closest she's
ever been, anyway.

1075
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:38,626
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

1076
01:13:41,379 --> 01:13:44,089
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1077
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:46,800
See, I knew it.

1078
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:50,971
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch.

1079
01:13:51,137 --> 01:13:54,641
I don't understand why you keep someone around
your business and you can't even trust 'em.

1080
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:57,226
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her.

1081
01:13:57,393 --> 01:14:00,313
I don't know
what that means, man.

1082
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,815
Well, you can't trust Melanie...

1083
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,151
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.

1084
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:09,613
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.

1085
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,699
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.

1086
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:15,243
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be...

1087
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,037
and she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to...

1088
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,122
but she white.

1089
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:52,902
You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.

1090
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:55,363
Hi, Jackie. It's Max.

1091
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:58,783
I was just calling to find out
how everything went today at A.T.F.

1092
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:01,869
If you want to call me,
my home number is...

1093
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:05,956
915-9302.

1094
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:08,583
Or you can reach me
at my office, which is...

1095
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,920
313-3688.

1096
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:14,339
That's on the card I gave you
when we first met.

1097
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:17,216
I don't know whether
you still have it, but it's on it.

1098
01:15:17,342 --> 01:15:19,635
Oh, let me give you
my beeper number.

1099
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,098
It's 991-1075...

1100
01:15:24,223 --> 01:15:27,976
then dial 6872.

1101
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:31,271
Wait for a beep,
dial 59...

1102
01:15:31,438 --> 01:15:33,523
and hit the pound.

1103
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:36,067
Um, okay, so I'll talk
to you later.

1104
01:15:36,234 --> 01:15:38,486
Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.

1105
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:40,404
End of message.

1106
01:15:52,059 --> 01:15:54,853
Now, the money's gonna be in a
Del Amo shopping bag, all right?

1107
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,356
I get some food, sit down here in the
food court, then your girl comes in.

1108
01:15:58,523 --> 01:16:00,525
Did you find somebody yet?

1109
01:16:00,692 --> 01:16:02,443
- Who?
- What you care?

1110
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,821
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.

1111
01:16:04,946 --> 01:16:07,323
You send some hardheaded
rock whore up here and she...

1112
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:11,201
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, I promise.

1113
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:30,511
All right, so we're straight, right?

1114
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:33,180
I'm gonna roll up over here and check
out this shirt I was looking at.

1115
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:36,600
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.

1116
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,455
Shit!

1117
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:20,598
Max! Max!

1118
01:17:22,225 --> 01:17:23,893
Hey.

1119
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:27,897
Well, hello.

1120
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:31,400
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.

1121
01:17:31,567 --> 01:17:34,111
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?

1122
01:17:34,278 --> 01:17:36,863
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?

1123
01:17:38,281 --> 01:17:41,367
What the fuck is up
with this shit?

1124
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:54,254
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.

1125
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:57,757
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can,
you know, talk about the sting we're plotting.

1126
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,343
That's what he calls it, a sting.

1127
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,971
He's been...
He's been real nice.

1128
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,349
You think he's got
a thing for you?

1129
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,684
Maybe.

1130
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:13,647
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.

1131
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,274
Has he hinted around?

1132
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:19,277
No. He just tries to act cool.

1133
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:22,155
You know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

1134
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,991
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.

1135
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,410
I know the type.
Trust me on this.

1136
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:30,579
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.

1137
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:33,790
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction...

1138
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:37,419
but he wouldn't walk off
with the money, it's evidence.

1139
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:40,380
- And what about you, Max?
- What?

1140
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:42,423
If I was in Nicolet's place?

1141
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,593
No, I mean you right now,
not if you were somebody else.

1142
01:18:45,718 --> 01:18:49,722
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a
shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

1143
01:18:49,889 --> 01:18:53,642
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's somebody's life savings.

1144
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:56,395
It wouldn't even be missed.

1145
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:59,564
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.

1146
01:18:59,731 --> 01:19:02,275
You're avoiding
the question, Max.

1147
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:06,612
Okay, sure, I guess
I'd be tempted...

1148
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:09,615
especially now since I'm getting
out of the bail bond business.

1149
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,867
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

1150
01:19:12,034 --> 01:19:16,413
I guess the main one would be,
uh... I'm tired of it.

1151
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,585
When did you decide?

1152
01:19:22,752 --> 01:19:24,837
It's been a long time coming...

1153
01:19:25,004 --> 01:19:27,214
but I finally made up my mind.

1154
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:30,259
I guess it was... Thursday.

1155
01:19:30,384 --> 01:19:32,302
Miss Brown?

1156
01:19:32,469 --> 01:19:36,139
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

1157
01:19:36,264 --> 01:19:38,933
The night you got me out of jail?

1158
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,811
Yeah. I went to pick up this guy.

1159
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:44,730
I hear he's staying
at a house, and, uh...

1160
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:46,941
I sneak in,
and I'm waiting for him...

1161
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:51,236
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?

1162
01:19:51,403 --> 01:19:55,574
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun...

1163
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:58,118
got another gun
and the stun gun...

1164
01:19:58,285 --> 01:20:01,079
went to this guy's house in El Monte
and waited for him to come home.

1165
01:20:01,246 --> 01:20:04,207
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.

1166
01:20:04,373 --> 01:20:07,543
While he's incapacitated, you cuff
him and take him to County.

1167
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,461
- You do that?
- It's my job.

1168
01:20:09,628 --> 01:20:12,047
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.

1169
01:20:12,214 --> 01:20:15,926
But I'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.

1170
01:20:16,093 --> 01:20:19,179
The whole house
smells of cat pee.

1171
01:20:19,304 --> 01:20:22,348
And after a couple of hours,
I think...

1172
01:20:22,515 --> 01:20:24,600
"Why am I doing this?"

1173
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:27,395
It's 19 years of this shit.

1174
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:31,315
And I make up my mind.
That's it.

1175
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:34,860
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.

1176
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:36,653
Which one?

1177
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:40,281
If you had the chance,
unemployed now...

1178
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:44,077
to walk away with a
half million dollars...

1179
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:46,495
would you take it?

1180
01:21:05,555 --> 01:21:08,140
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1181
01:21:09,725 --> 01:21:12,186
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

1182
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:15,230
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.

1183
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:17,732
This is A.T.F. Agent Ray Nicolet.

1184
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:19,943
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie.

1185
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:22,403
Money exchange, trial run.

1186
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,406
Time is 3:07...

1187
01:21:25,573 --> 01:21:28,451
July 1, 1995.

1188
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,911
Location is
a parking structure at LAX...

1189
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:33,163
row "F",
parking structure "D".

1190
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,415
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.

1191
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,959
- I thought you were going to let this one go through.
- We are. Don't worry about it.

1192
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,378
Every bit of this
goes in my report.

1193
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,755
The subject is carrying
a flight bag.

1194
01:21:42,922 --> 01:21:47,051
I am now removing from the flight bag
a manila envelope.

1195
01:21:47,218 --> 01:21:50,596
The envelope contains currency.

1196
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:55,142
All the same denomination?

1197
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:57,144
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1198
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,562
Okay, I'm now counting it.

1199
01:21:59,729 --> 01:22:02,857
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.

1200
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:06,902
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.

1201
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:10,406
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.

1202
01:22:10,572 --> 01:22:12,950
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.

1203
01:22:13,116 --> 01:22:16,620
Okay. The total amount
of cash...

1204
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:19,998
in the manila envelope
is $10000, right?

1205
01:22:21,332 --> 01:22:24,919
The subject will be
delivering the currency in a...

1206
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:27,713
Del Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1207
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,424
Del Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1208
01:22:30,549 --> 01:22:34,011
- The bag is, uh... purple..
- It's white.

1209
01:22:34,177 --> 01:22:36,012
- White.
- It's white.

1210
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:37,931
- Fine, the bag's white..
- With pink lettering.

1211
01:22:38,098 --> 01:22:39,849
- Purp..
- Images of purple.

1212
01:22:40,016 --> 01:22:41,809
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine..

1213
01:22:41,976 --> 01:22:44,520
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple
on it, and the lettering's pink.

1214
01:22:44,645 --> 01:22:47,064
- Right.
- With a really good-looking woman on the cover.

1215
01:22:47,231 --> 01:22:48,983
Okay. There you go.

1216
01:23:37,444 --> 01:23:41,573
- This seat taken?
- No. Have a seat.

1217
01:23:47,745 --> 01:23:50,164
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.

1218
01:23:52,082 --> 01:23:55,293
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.

1219
01:24:02,091 --> 01:24:05,219
And then when I leave...
Well, you know.

1220
01:24:06,637 --> 01:24:08,431
So, what's your name?

1221
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:11,725
Sheronda.

1222
01:24:11,892 --> 01:24:14,186
Sheronda, that's a nice name.

1223
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:19,441
Sheronda, go ahead.
You can eat.

1224
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:31,618
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.

1225
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:52,262
All right. I'll be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.

1226
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,728
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.

1227
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,438
He doesn't give a shit
about the money.

1228
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:04,690
The money won't convict him.
Guns will.

1229
01:25:04,857 --> 01:25:06,984
You're rationalizing.

1230
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:10,029
Well, that's what you do to go through
with the shit you start.

1231
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:11,947
You rationalize.

1232
01:25:12,114 --> 01:25:15,409
I can do it, Max.
I know I can.

1233
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:18,370
I just can't do it
without you.

1234
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:31,924
It's cool.

1235
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:40,682
Excuse me, baby.
Uh, do you know what time it is?

1236
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:44,060
No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch.

1237
01:27:20,398 --> 01:27:22,859
It could work.

1238
01:27:22,984 --> 01:27:25,486
If she handles
the cops right...

1239
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:27,571
it could work.

1240
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:47,298
What?

1241
01:27:47,423 --> 01:27:50,342
Jackie Brown.

1242
01:27:52,553 --> 01:27:55,180
It ain't like I'm asking you to go
somewhere and spend the night.

1243
01:27:55,347 --> 01:27:58,266
I just want you to go out for a little
while while I work this deal.

1244
01:27:58,433 --> 01:28:00,351
So now you're going to pout!

1245
01:28:00,518 --> 01:28:02,687
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes to
find her purse, look for her sandals...

1246
01:28:02,854 --> 01:28:04,772
find her sunglasses,
get outta here.

1247
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:06,774
Jackie, Louis.
Louis, Jackie.

1248
01:28:06,941 --> 01:28:08,984
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there...

1249
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:12,154
that's Melanie,
who's about to leave!

1250
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:15,449
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.

1251
01:28:15,615 --> 01:28:18,702
- Want a drink?
- No. I want to talk to you now, outside. Now.

1252
01:28:18,868 --> 01:28:21,746
Let's step into my office.

1253
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:30,213
What's up?

1254
01:28:30,879 --> 01:28:33,173
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at all!

1255
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,217
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell I'm talkin' about?

1256
01:28:35,342 --> 01:28:37,302
- Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?

1257
01:28:37,469 --> 01:28:39,554
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.

1258
01:28:39,721 --> 01:28:41,806
- I knew you would try to pull some shit like that!
- Hold up!

1259
01:28:41,973 --> 01:28:44,058
- I ain't pulling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?

1260
01:28:44,183 --> 01:28:46,352
It's my goddamn money! I can do whatever
the fuck I wanna do with it.

1261
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:48,604
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!

1262
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:50,814
- If we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1263
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:52,900
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!

1264
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:56,027
Listen! Listen! The woman
you saw was my friend Simone.

1265
01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:58,446
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.

1266
01:28:58,613 --> 01:29:01,157
I think she oughta see how the shit
go down. She's a nice woman.

1267
01:29:01,324 --> 01:29:04,827
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's
on her way over here right now. Hold up.

1268
01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:07,413
Louis, call Simone. Tell her to get
her ass over here.

1269
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,665
We're waiting on her.

1270
01:29:09,832 --> 01:29:13,168
- Damn! Is that what you're pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?

1271
01:29:13,335 --> 01:29:16,004
I'm sorry.

1272
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:20,175
I'm about ready for a refill. Are you sure
I can't tempt you a little bit more?

1273
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,927
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

1274
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:25,471
You better give me
something strong.

1275
01:29:27,515 --> 01:29:30,476
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.

1276
01:29:30,643 --> 01:29:32,603
I don't like that part.

1277
01:29:32,769 --> 01:29:34,980
It washes off!

1278
01:29:35,105 --> 01:29:38,275
I tell 'em we do the same thing as
before, and they'll follow Sheronda.

1279
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:43,905
Yo, Louis. Louis?
She ain't there?

1280
01:29:44,272 --> 01:29:46,741
No answer?

1281
01:29:46,866 --> 01:29:49,243
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?

1282
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:53,330
Lou!

1283
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:59,336
Okay, now, this time you're going to get
Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?

1284
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,380
Right. The same one
Simone gives me, okay?

1285
01:30:02,505 --> 01:30:06,050
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what I look like?

1286
01:30:06,217 --> 01:30:08,260
She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?

1287
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:10,888
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?

1288
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:14,016
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right, right, right. The place y'all try shit on.

1289
01:30:14,141 --> 01:30:16,143
It's a fitting room. Big sign
over the door. You can't miss it.

1290
01:30:18,728 --> 01:30:20,772
Why over there?

1291
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:23,483
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.

1292
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:26,193
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...

1293
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:28,154
or even in the dining area.

1294
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,739
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.

1295
01:30:30,864 --> 01:30:33,283
Okay. Now, you're going to take...

1296
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,994
the Billingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.

1297
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:38,121
- Right.
- And Simone is going to wait.

1298
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:40,707
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you...

1299
01:30:40,874 --> 01:30:43,209
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.

1300
01:30:43,376 --> 01:30:45,294
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.

1301
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:47,380
Hey! See?

1302
01:30:47,505 --> 01:30:49,548
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?

1303
01:30:49,715 --> 01:30:52,384
Now that you got 'em watching my ass, I'm
gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis...

1304
01:30:52,551 --> 01:30:54,803
to call me and tell me
everything's cool.

1305
01:30:57,264 --> 01:30:59,891
I got to go! Hey!

1306
01:31:02,477 --> 01:31:06,230
- Damn! Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

1307
01:31:06,397 --> 01:31:09,608
That shit works my nerves, you and
that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.

1308
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:12,945
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with
that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.

1309
01:31:14,738 --> 01:31:17,741
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.

1310
01:31:19,909 --> 01:31:23,830
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.

1311
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:26,249
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.

1312
01:31:26,415 --> 01:31:28,375
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out.

1313
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:31,837
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really.

1314
01:31:32,004 --> 01:31:35,757
A fellow named Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.

1315
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:38,843
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

1316
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:42,513
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.

1317
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,266
They did two years together about,
I don't know...

1318
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,436
20 years ago or so
over at Huntsville.

1319
01:31:48,602 --> 01:31:51,021
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.

1320
01:31:51,188 --> 01:31:53,857
Ordell's got him staying
down at Compton.

1321
01:31:53,982 --> 01:31:57,152
Living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named, uh...

1322
01:31:58,403 --> 01:32:00,280
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.

1323
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:03,741
- You know her?
- No.

1324
01:32:03,908 --> 01:32:07,203
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.

1325
01:32:09,288 --> 01:32:11,123
Okay, who's the other one?

1326
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,001
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.

1327
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:16,586
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with.

1328
01:32:16,753 --> 01:32:18,880
She knows everything.
She's not a part of it...

1329
01:32:19,047 --> 01:32:21,633
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.

1330
01:32:21,799 --> 01:32:23,843
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.

1331
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,387
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1332
01:32:26,554 --> 01:32:29,139
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1333
01:32:29,265 --> 01:32:31,183
I told him Ordell's changing the
amount he's bringing in.

1334
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:32,518
Think they bought it?

1335
01:32:32,684 --> 01:32:35,354
Oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous...

1336
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,064
and they love thinking
that he's scared of 'em.

1337
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:42,402
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.

1338
01:32:42,568 --> 01:32:45,279
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.

1339
01:32:45,446 --> 01:32:47,531
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1340
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:49,700
What's that?

1341
01:32:49,825 --> 01:32:51,952
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money...

1342
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:54,246
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.

1343
01:32:54,413 --> 01:32:56,998
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil where it is...

1344
01:32:57,165 --> 01:33:00,043
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.

1345
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:02,795
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

1346
01:33:02,962 --> 01:33:05,214
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.

1347
01:33:05,339 --> 01:33:08,175
I'm not gonna show him the whole
amount. He'll see 50,000.

1348
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,886
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.

1349
01:33:11,011 --> 01:33:13,222
- What if he checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.

1350
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:16,975
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.

1351
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:21,604
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.

1352
01:33:21,771 --> 01:33:24,148
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr Walker put it in there...

1353
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:26,901
and I didn't know anything
about it, like the coke.

1354
01:33:27,026 --> 01:33:29,278
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...

1355
01:33:29,445 --> 01:33:31,363
and at least I tried.

1356
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:35,200
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.

1357
01:33:35,367 --> 01:33:38,536
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room.

1358
01:33:38,662 --> 01:33:41,623
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit. There's this one I had my eye on.

1359
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:43,666
You know, it's like...

1360
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,585
Excuse me.

1361
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:49,922
Hello?

1362
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:52,174
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.

1363
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:54,343
No, no, no, no,
it ain't no thing.

1364
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:56,636
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.

1365
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:58,888
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mall?

1366
01:33:59,055 --> 01:34:01,391
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.

1367
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:04,102
Yeah. Me and Louis
went by her pad. She's gone.

1368
01:34:04,268 --> 01:34:08,022
She's gone, her shit's gone and
my 10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone.

1369
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:10,107
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't start buggin' on me.

1370
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:12,192
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.

1371
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:14,361
Everything's just like
we discussed.

1372
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,696
Now, except for this time
when we make the split...

1373
01:34:16,822 --> 01:34:18,740
instead of Simone
it's gonna be Melanie.

1374
01:34:18,865 --> 01:34:21,534
<i>I think someone's knocking
on the door.</i>

1375
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:25,454
Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense as
that bitch has. She'll be in the same place.

1376
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:28,290
All right.
Yeah, later.

1377
01:34:28,457 --> 01:34:31,293
<i>Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.</i>

1378
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,338
<i>I hope he's a good sailor.</i>

1379
01:34:37,465 --> 01:34:39,467
Chicken shit.

1380
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:37,020
Okay, the envelop contains $50,000.

1381
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:40,857
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...

1382
01:35:40,982 --> 01:35:45,236
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.

1383
01:35:47,363 --> 01:35:49,365
Ever been tempted?

1384
01:35:52,993 --> 01:35:55,370
What? Put one of these
in my pocket?

1385
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:02,502
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?

1386
01:36:02,627 --> 01:36:05,254
Of course, nobody knows
how much there is.

1387
01:36:05,379 --> 01:36:09,592
I guess we could take as much
as we want. Isn't that right?

1388
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:12,970
Yes. All those things are true.

1389
01:36:13,136 --> 01:36:17,182
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.

1390
01:36:17,349 --> 01:36:19,934
That would be one point of view.

1391
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:24,063
Except it's not a point of view
shared by the A.T.F.

1392
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:28,859
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.

1393
01:36:28,984 --> 01:36:32,654
You're officially out of trouble now.

1394
01:36:32,779 --> 01:36:34,740
Don't go doing
something stupid.

1395
01:36:34,865 --> 01:36:38,702
How can I do anything stupid when
I'm being watched every second?

1396
01:36:38,868 --> 01:36:40,912
You know, I'm glad
you pointed that out...

1397
01:36:41,079 --> 01:36:43,206
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.

1398
01:36:43,373 --> 01:36:46,626
Now, look.
Here's the deal.

1399
01:36:46,792 --> 01:36:49,295
I want you to take
all this cash.

1400
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:52,256
I want you to put it
in this Billingsley shopping bag.

1401
01:36:52,381 --> 01:36:54,800
And that is exactly
what I expect to see...

1402
01:36:54,966 --> 01:36:58,386
when I look inside Sheronda's
Billingsley shopping bag.

1403
01:36:58,553 --> 01:37:00,305
Comprende?

1404
01:37:00,472 --> 01:37:02,724
- Sí, comprende.
- Cool.

1405
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:05,977
Hey, there's only three reasons you
couldn't make your court appearance.

1406
01:37:06,102 --> 01:37:10,230
One, you're in a hospital, two, you're
in jail, three, your ass is dead.

1407
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:12,316
That means you're not my friend, man.
Why're you putting...

1408
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:13,108
Winston!

1409
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:15,986
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.

1410
01:37:16,153 --> 01:37:17,195
Where you going?

1411
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:19,948
Del Amo Mall. Catch a movie,
maybe something to eat.

1412
01:37:20,115 --> 01:37:21,991
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon and looks good.

1413
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:23,951
Cool. Have fun.

1414
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:27,538
- Let's go!
- In a minute!

1415
01:37:27,663 --> 01:37:31,200
You said that before. Let's go!

1416
01:37:38,882 --> 01:37:39,924
Hello?

1417
01:37:40,008 --> 01:37:41,885
Louis? What the fuck you still
doing there, man?

1418
01:37:42,051 --> 01:37:44,971
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting
on her. I'm ready to go, yeah.

1419
01:37:45,137 --> 01:37:47,681
You're the one who's
motherfucking in charge!

1420
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:49,725
She keeps saying,
"In a minute", right?

1421
01:37:49,892 --> 01:37:52,102
Go in there, grab that bitch by the hair,
drag her fuckin' ass outta there!

1422
01:37:52,269 --> 01:37:54,396
That's my goddamn money we...

1423
01:37:59,526 --> 01:38:02,737
Hey, we gotta go! We're late!

1424
01:38:02,862 --> 01:38:06,616
- Come on, Mel! We gotta go! Let's go!
- Kiss my ass, fuck wad!

1425
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:51,365
You wanna turn it down?

1426
01:38:51,532 --> 01:38:53,283
I'm listening to it.

1427
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:59,205
Louis, man, I've been meaning to
tell you you're a little bit uptight.

1428
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:37,587
Hi. Can I help you?

1429
01:40:37,754 --> 01:40:40,632
I think I like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.

1430
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,722
You look really cool.

1431
01:40:47,888 --> 01:40:51,183
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.

1432
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:54,561
I mean, you wear that suit to a business
meeting, and you'll be the bad ass in the room.

1433
01:40:54,728 --> 01:40:56,813
Yeah? I think I like it.
I'll take it.

1434
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:59,190
- I'm in a hurry. Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1435
01:40:59,357 --> 01:41:01,276
Cash.

1436
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:23,838
- Melanie?
- Jackie?

1437
01:41:24,005 --> 01:41:26,257
Hey, girl, what's up?

1438
01:41:26,382 --> 01:41:29,426
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?

1439
01:41:29,593 --> 01:41:33,305
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?

1440
01:41:33,472 --> 01:41:36,183
You betcha.

1441
01:41:50,321 --> 01:41:53,282
I put a cherry on top.

1442
01:41:53,448 --> 01:41:56,701
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?

1443
01:41:56,868 --> 01:41:59,120
Thanks.

1444
01:42:58,091 --> 01:43:00,969
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1445
01:43:01,135 --> 01:43:03,471
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?

1446
01:43:03,721 --> 01:43:06,974
Okay, there's a blouse...

1447
01:43:07,099 --> 01:43:09,268
pants.

1448
01:43:09,435 --> 01:43:13,105
Comes to $267.

1449
01:43:13,272 --> 01:43:15,190
Okay.

1450
01:43:16,817 --> 01:43:19,819
Wait! Your change.

1451
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:24,115
Uh, by the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1452
01:44:51,987 --> 01:44:54,740
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!

1453
01:44:54,865 --> 01:44:57,659
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.

1454
01:44:57,784 --> 01:44:59,661
She took all the money
and ran out!

1455
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:08,210
Aw, fuck.

1456
01:45:08,377 --> 01:45:10,921
Come on.
Goddamn, we're late. Come on.

1457
01:45:11,088 --> 01:45:14,258
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

1458
01:45:14,383 --> 01:45:15,926
We should've been there already,
and we would've if it hadn't

1459
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:17,302
been for your fuckin' around.

1460
01:45:17,469 --> 01:45:19,512
Jesus Christ, Louis,
maintain.

1461
01:45:22,348 --> 01:45:24,433
- Jesus.
- Just... I'm telling you, cut the shit.

1462
01:45:30,356 --> 01:45:32,941
Idiot.

1463
01:45:33,108 --> 01:45:34,860
- Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.

1464
01:45:35,027 --> 01:45:36,862
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'...

1465
01:45:37,028 --> 01:45:39,948
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice...

1466
01:45:40,115 --> 01:45:43,076
I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.

1467
01:45:43,242 --> 01:45:44,994
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1468
01:45:45,161 --> 01:45:46,912
Cash.

1469
01:45:52,501 --> 01:45:56,213
It's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over
and look at this Michi Moon display.

1470
01:45:56,379 --> 01:45:59,716
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.

1471
01:45:59,883 --> 01:46:02,218
Are you sweating?

1472
01:46:03,594 --> 01:46:05,930
Job a little too much
for you?

1473
01:46:14,896 --> 01:46:16,815
I'm gonna be over there.

1474
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:20,026
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little bit too conspicuous.

1475
01:46:20,193 --> 01:46:24,322
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.

1476
01:46:24,489 --> 01:46:26,949
Hey, would you let go!

1477
01:46:31,662 --> 01:46:34,331
Designer Clothes.

1478
01:46:39,377 --> 01:46:43,006
Fuck it.

1479
01:47:08,279 --> 01:47:10,030
Look, where you goin'?

1480
01:47:10,197 --> 01:47:11,949
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.

1481
01:47:12,116 --> 01:47:14,868
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.

1482
01:47:15,035 --> 01:47:17,662
- Fuck you...
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?

1483
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:20,498
Give me that bag before I knock
you the fuck up.

1484
01:47:20,623 --> 01:47:23,334
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay. Jesus, what's wrong with you?

1485
01:47:23,459 --> 01:47:24,710
I'm carryin' the bag.

1486
01:47:24,794 --> 01:47:26,045
All right, you got it. Take a
chill pill, for chrissake.

1487
01:47:26,212 --> 01:47:28,172
Fuck you and your chill pill.

1488
01:47:28,339 --> 01:47:32,259
'Member where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.

1489
01:47:32,384 --> 01:47:35,345
Where the f...
Which way? Which way?

1490
01:47:39,182 --> 01:47:42,435
Jesus, but if you two aren't
the biggest pair of fuckups...

1491
01:47:42,602 --> 01:47:44,937
I've ever met
in my entire life.

1492
01:47:45,062 --> 01:47:47,690
How did you ever rob a bank?

1493
01:47:47,857 --> 01:47:51,110
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?

1494
01:47:52,277 --> 01:47:54,529
No wonder you went to jail.

1495
01:47:56,823 --> 01:47:59,242
Is it this aisle, Louis?

1496
01:47:59,409 --> 01:48:01,160
Is it?

1497
01:48:05,831 --> 01:48:07,708
Louis?

1498
01:48:08,834 --> 01:48:11,712
Lou-isss?

1499
01:48:14,548 --> 01:48:17,300
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?

1500
01:48:18,551 --> 01:48:20,678
- It's this one.
- You sure?

1501
01:48:20,845 --> 01:48:23,473
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive? You don't seem sure to me.

1502
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:26,267
Hey, don't say...

1503
01:48:26,434 --> 01:48:29,311
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.

1504
01:48:29,478 --> 01:48:32,689
- Well...
- I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word, okay?

1505
01:48:32,856 --> 01:48:34,983
Okay, Louis.

1506
01:48:43,741 --> 01:48:45,826
See, just where I said it was.

1507
01:48:49,413 --> 01:48:51,165
God.

1508
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:55,015
Can I show you something?

1509
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:58,393
Not right now. I'm just killin' time,
waitin' for my wife.

1510
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,605
Oh, sure thing. Well, if anything
grabs you, don't be shy.

1511
01:50:02,772 --> 01:50:04,649
I won't. Thanks.

1512
01:50:06,067 --> 01:50:08,360
- Wow, you look really cool.
- Oh, yeah.

1513
01:50:08,527 --> 01:50:12,239
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great. I mean, you wear that...

1514
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:15,158
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin' mongoloid.

1515
01:50:15,325 --> 01:50:18,995
- Now, look at this.
- I think I like it.

1516
01:50:19,162 --> 01:50:20,914
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

1517
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:23,374
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

1518
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,547
Hey, would you let go!

1519
01:50:39,681 --> 01:50:41,683
Designer Clothes.

1520
01:51:20,635 --> 01:51:23,346
I decided to wear the suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1521
01:51:23,554 --> 01:51:26,474
- Oh, that's no problem. I understand.
- How much is it?

1522
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:30,561
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.

1523
01:51:30,728 --> 01:51:33,647
Comes to $267.

1524
01:51:33,814 --> 01:51:36,733
- Here you go.
- Wait! Your change!

1525
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:41,696
By the way, someone left a bag of beach
towels in the last dressing room.

1526
01:52:05,551 --> 01:52:07,428
Excuse me.

1527
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:11,181
My wife thinks she left a bag of
beach towels in the fitting room.

1528
01:52:11,348 --> 01:52:14,184
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get
'em. There's nobody in there.

1529
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:16,603
- Thanks.
- Last stall.

1530
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:28,794
Got it.

1531
01:54:58,084 --> 01:55:01,421
All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,
where all them car dealerships is.

1532
01:55:01,546 --> 01:55:03,339
We gonna leave this heap in
the parking lot and pick up...

1533
01:55:03,464 --> 01:55:06,133
a car the cops don't
know nothin' about.

1534
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,636
Where's Melanie?

1535
01:55:08,802 --> 01:55:10,888
That's what I wanna tell you.
She was buggin' me the whole time.

1536
01:55:11,055 --> 01:55:13,473
She got pissy with me 'cause I
wouldn't let her carry the bag.

1537
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,184
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like...

1538
01:55:16,351 --> 01:55:18,812
'cause I couldn't remember where the
car was parked right away when we came out.

1539
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:21,648
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?"

1540
01:55:21,814 --> 01:55:24,275
"Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was
totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.

1541
01:55:24,442 --> 01:55:27,486
- So, what? You left her there?
- I, I shot her.

1542
01:55:30,614 --> 01:55:32,699
You shot Melanie?

1543
01:55:32,866 --> 01:55:35,660
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?

1544
01:55:35,786 --> 01:55:37,996
Well, how can you talk to her?
You know how she is.

1545
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:38,663
You couldn't just hit her?

1546
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:41,791
Maybe, but at that time...
moment, I don't know, I...

1547
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:44,043
You shot her? Twice?

1548
01:55:46,003 --> 01:55:50,007
- Is she dead?
- I, I... Pretty much.

1549
01:55:50,174 --> 01:55:51,967
What do you mean "pretty much", Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.

1550
01:55:52,134 --> 01:55:53,969
- Yes or no. Is she dead?
- I, I think so.

1551
01:55:54,136 --> 01:55:56,471
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she...
- She's dead. She's dead.

1552
01:55:56,638 --> 01:55:59,057
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.

1553
01:56:00,767 --> 01:56:03,853
If you had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.

1554
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,564
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.

1555
01:56:06,731 --> 01:56:08,482
Anybody but that woman.

1556
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,912
Louis?

1557
01:56:23,079 --> 01:56:24,831
What?

1558
01:56:24,997 --> 01:56:26,749
Where's the rest of it?

1559
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:31,003
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less.

1560
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:33,505
Well, you... you said 550.

1561
01:56:33,672 --> 01:56:36,967
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.

1562
01:56:37,133 --> 01:56:39,260
Look, look, man. That's
the bag she came out with.

1563
01:56:39,386 --> 01:56:41,137
She never put her hand in it.
Neither did I.

1564
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:41,971
Came out of where?

1565
01:56:42,138 --> 01:56:44,515
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

1566
01:56:44,682 --> 01:56:45,641
How long was she in there?

1567
01:56:45,683 --> 01:56:47,810
A minute. Not even a minute.
She came right out.

1568
01:56:47,977 --> 01:56:50,521
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to God, man.

1569
01:56:50,646 --> 01:56:51,939
I swear on my life.

1570
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:54,066
She came out with that fuckin' bag,
and I took it from her.

1571
01:56:54,232 --> 01:56:55,108
- And then what?
- And that was it.

1572
01:56:55,192 --> 01:56:56,026
We went to the parking lot.

1573
01:56:56,193 --> 01:56:59,529
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.

1574
01:56:59,696 --> 01:57:01,197
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in
a room somewhere...

1575
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:01,990
with a half million dollars...

1576
01:57:02,031 --> 01:57:04,033
I worked my ass off to get
waitin' for you?

1577
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,078
- Fuck you for asking me that.
- I know the bitch tried to set me up.

1578
01:57:07,244 --> 01:57:09,205
Fuck you, brother.
How could you fuckin' ask me that?

1579
01:57:09,246 --> 01:57:10,039
She didn't ask you?

1580
01:57:12,499 --> 01:57:14,293
Shit!

1581
01:57:16,211 --> 01:57:18,672
Pull the car over a minute.

1582
01:57:21,132 --> 01:57:22,884
Why'd you ask me that?

1583
01:57:30,432 --> 01:57:33,143
All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?

1584
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:35,020
It's in there.

1585
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:40,316
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.

1586
01:58:05,131 --> 01:58:07,466
It's Jackie Brown.

1587
01:58:09,593 --> 01:58:12,221
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it all?

1588
01:58:12,346 --> 01:58:14,598
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.

1589
01:58:14,765 --> 01:58:16,725
Well, maybe the Feds got it.

1590
01:58:16,892 --> 01:58:18,727
See, if there wasn't nothin'...

1591
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:19,686
in that bag but them towels...

1592
01:58:19,853 --> 01:58:21,896
then maybe she didn't get a
chance to take the money...

1593
01:58:22,021 --> 01:58:23,815
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. got it.

1594
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:25,691
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.

1595
01:58:25,858 --> 01:58:27,860
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.

1596
01:58:28,027 --> 01:58:30,362
That's right. And then she
puts 40 grand or so in there...

1597
01:58:30,404 --> 01:58:31,572
to rub that shit in my face.

1598
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:34,741
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.

1599
01:58:34,908 --> 01:58:39,079
I don... I don...
You know, I don't know. I don't know.

1600
01:58:39,245 --> 01:58:42,290
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it.

1601
01:58:42,457 --> 01:58:45,459
Or... Or...
Now, check this out.

1602
01:58:45,585 --> 01:58:48,337
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...

1603
01:58:48,462 --> 01:58:51,256
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.

1604
01:58:55,052 --> 01:58:57,470
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1605
01:58:57,637 --> 01:59:00,265
Do you know who I saw in the
dress department?

1606
01:59:00,306 --> 01:59:00,849
No, tell me.

1607
01:59:01,015 --> 01:59:03,184
I didn't think anything of it.
I... No, no, I did wonder...

1608
01:59:03,226 --> 01:59:04,060
what he was doin' there.

1609
01:59:04,185 --> 01:59:05,853
I wondered what he was doin'
there, but I thought it had...

1610
01:59:05,895 --> 01:59:06,812
nothin' to do with us.

1611
01:59:06,979 --> 01:59:09,440
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place...

1612
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:12,151
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

1613
01:59:12,317 --> 01:59:14,778
- Yeah, Max Cherry.
- Max Che...

1614
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,784
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we...

1615
01:59:21,951 --> 01:59:24,662
Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!

1616
01:59:24,829 --> 01:59:26,580
You see that motherfucker
in the dress department when we...

1617
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:27,540
about to get a half million dollars.

1618
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,749
And you don't think nothin'
about him bein' there?

1619
01:59:28,791 --> 01:59:30,125
No. Do they know each other?

1620
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:32,336
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.

1621
01:59:32,461 --> 01:59:34,880
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen.

1622
01:59:35,047 --> 01:59:38,300
You know all them motherfuckers is
crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?

1623
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,759
Why should I think something's
weird if I don't know nothin'...

1624
01:59:39,801 --> 01:59:40,927
about them knowin' each other?

1625
01:59:40,969 --> 01:59:41,970
I don't wanna hear no fuckin'
excuses, Louis.

1626
01:59:42,011 --> 01:59:42,804
I ain't givin' you excuses.

1627
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:45,514
But I'm tellin' you... I don't fuckin'...
I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.

1628
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,600
Oh, you gonna tell me
the reason...

1629
01:59:47,767 --> 01:59:50,144
you lost every goddamned cent
I got in the world?

1630
01:59:50,311 --> 01:59:52,896
- Hey... Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?

1631
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:55,065
- You better...
- Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker.

1632
01:59:55,232 --> 01:59:57,984
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.

1633
01:59:58,151 --> 02:00:00,361
You better fuckin'
back off, man.

1634
02:00:06,826 --> 02:00:10,371
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1635
02:00:10,537 --> 02:00:14,666
Your ass used to be beautiful.

1636
02:00:55,245 --> 02:00:57,706
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.

1637
02:00:57,872 --> 02:01:00,333
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

1638
02:01:08,507 --> 02:01:10,968
You know, if it's me...

1639
02:01:11,135 --> 02:01:14,179
and I got all that shit hangin' over my
head like you got hangin' over yours...

1640
02:01:14,304 --> 02:01:16,348
I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later.

1641
02:01:16,515 --> 02:01:19,225
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...

1642
02:01:19,392 --> 02:01:21,102
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on...

1643
02:01:21,269 --> 02:01:22,895
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.

1644
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:27,024
Just wait a fuckin' second,
all right? Let me finish.

1645
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:31,528
I got there early. The idea was
to try on the suit, see if I liked it.

1646
02:01:31,695 --> 02:01:34,239
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform...

1647
02:01:34,364 --> 02:01:36,908
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.

1648
02:01:36,992 --> 02:01:40,411
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping
bag with the $50,000 and go home.

1649
02:01:40,828 --> 02:01:42,914
Yeah, but you didn't do that.

1650
02:01:43,081 --> 02:01:45,249
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear.

1651
02:01:45,416 --> 02:01:47,960
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag.

1652
02:01:48,085 --> 02:01:50,379
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.

1653
02:01:56,968 --> 02:01:59,220
What happened
to the bag she gave you?

1654
02:01:59,387 --> 02:02:03,558
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.

1655
02:02:03,724 --> 02:02:05,601
Ordell probably told her to do it.

1656
02:02:05,768 --> 02:02:07,728
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.

1657
02:02:07,895 --> 02:02:10,606
But I couldn't go after her, because
I was in my fucking underwear.

1658
02:02:10,773 --> 02:02:13,066
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform...

1659
02:02:13,233 --> 02:02:15,861
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic.

1660
02:02:16,027 --> 02:02:18,613
What was I supposed to do?

1661
02:02:24,494 --> 02:02:26,746
All right,
what you do after that?

1662
02:02:26,912 --> 02:02:29,498
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mall...

1663
02:02:29,623 --> 02:02:31,667
where you were before,
but you weren't there.

1664
02:02:31,834 --> 02:02:35,045
What was I supposed to do if something
happens? You didn't tell me how to do that.

1665
02:02:35,212 --> 02:02:38,131
There was a guy
with Melanie?

1666
02:02:38,298 --> 02:02:40,049
There was nobody
in the fitting room.

1667
02:02:44,637 --> 02:02:46,389
Okay.

1668
02:02:53,604 --> 02:02:55,605
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.

1669
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:57,732
You're clueless, right? You've no idea
where the 50 grand is?

1670
02:02:57,816 --> 02:02:58,900
I have no idea.

1671
02:02:59,067 --> 02:03:00,401
- None. You have no idea...
- None.

1672
02:03:00,443 --> 02:03:01,569
It could've gone here,
could've gone there?

1673
02:03:01,736 --> 02:03:05,531
I know nothin'. Not a clue. I don't have an
idea where the motherfuckin' money is.

1674
02:03:05,698 --> 02:03:07,867
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.

1675
02:03:08,033 --> 02:03:10,661
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy!

1676
02:03:10,828 --> 02:03:14,122
Yeah, put it right there.
I'll do it.

1677
02:03:14,289 --> 02:03:16,041
Man.

1678
02:03:24,757 --> 02:03:27,635
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.

1679
02:03:31,847 --> 02:03:34,224
I gotta talk to you
for a second.

1680
02:03:49,863 --> 02:03:52,116
Fuck.

1681
02:04:05,711 --> 02:04:10,132
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found
him shot in the car on Ninth.

1682
02:04:10,299 --> 02:04:12,426
And we lost Ordell.

1683
02:04:12,593 --> 02:04:15,178
I thought you were
fuckin' watchin' him.

1684
02:04:15,303 --> 02:04:17,806
We were, and we lost him.

1685
02:04:17,973 --> 02:04:21,559
He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out.

1686
02:04:21,726 --> 02:04:26,272
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile
and a half from where they found Louis.

1687
02:04:26,439 --> 02:04:28,691
It looks like Louis' buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.

1688
02:04:28,858 --> 02:04:31,985
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.

1689
02:04:32,152 --> 02:04:34,988
We got three murders
we can link him to, and we got you.

1690
02:04:35,113 --> 02:04:37,449
What about me?

1691
02:04:37,616 --> 02:04:40,660
What about you?

1692
02:04:40,785 --> 02:04:43,037
You think I took
some of that money?

1693
02:04:43,204 --> 02:04:45,456
Hey, I have no evidence
of you doin' anything.

1694
02:04:47,291 --> 02:04:49,752
You didn't pay for that snazzy
new suit with marked bills.

1695
02:04:49,918 --> 02:04:52,838
I'm glad to see that.
You've been helpin' us out.

1696
02:04:53,005 --> 02:04:55,549
You gave us Melanie.
You gave us Louis.

1697
02:04:55,674 --> 02:05:01,095
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.

1698
02:05:01,221 --> 02:05:03,931
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.

1699
02:05:06,309 --> 02:05:09,019
I'll settle for Ordell
with marked bills.

1700
02:05:12,022 --> 02:05:14,149
But if there's
anything else...

1701
02:05:14,316 --> 02:05:19,029
you haven't told me about, you know
what, that's between you and Ordell.

1702
02:05:19,195 --> 02:05:22,115
I just got one thing to say.

1703
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:24,992
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.

1704
02:05:25,243 --> 02:05:28,662
No, no, no, I done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr Walker.

1705
02:05:28,829 --> 02:05:33,542
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.

1706
02:05:33,709 --> 02:05:37,462
Come on, man. If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.

1707
02:05:37,629 --> 02:05:41,799
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who
my friends are, motherfucker, right...

1708
02:05:41,966 --> 02:05:45,303
Hello? Hello?

1709
02:05:45,469 --> 02:05:49,139
Motherfucker hung up on me.
Do you believe that shit?

1710
02:05:49,306 --> 02:05:53,310
Ingrate nigger. See, you
bring a motherfucker up...

1711
02:05:53,477 --> 02:05:56,646
next thing you know they breaking
you off some goddamned disrespect.

1712
02:05:56,813 --> 02:05:59,732
Motherfuck!
Shit!

1713
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:04,195
Goddamn, girl.
How you live like this?

1714
02:06:04,362 --> 02:06:06,697
- Like what?
- Like this.

1715
02:06:06,822 --> 02:06:09,158
This some repugnant shit.

1716
02:06:09,325 --> 02:06:12,536
Bail bonds.

1717
02:06:12,661 --> 02:06:14,913
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.

1718
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:17,791
- Well, where he at? Out of town?
- He's around, man.

1719
02:06:17,958 --> 02:06:20,168
- Well, give me his home number.
- No, I'll give you his beeper number!

1720
02:06:20,335 --> 02:06:22,295
All right. Break out
the beeper number, nigger.

1721
02:06:30,594 --> 02:06:33,889
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.

1722
02:06:34,056 --> 02:06:38,893
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr Robbie, isn't it?

1723
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,771
I have your 10,000.
That's why you called.

1724
02:06:43,689 --> 02:06:47,401
The bond collateral that you
put down on Beaumont Livingston...

1725
02:06:47,568 --> 02:06:49,862
and moved over
to Miss Brown, remember?

1726
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:52,948
Oh, she got off, did she?

1727
02:06:53,115 --> 02:06:56,076
They decided to no-file
this morning.

1728
02:06:56,243 --> 02:06:58,370
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.

1729
02:07:02,749 --> 02:07:04,667
You still there?

1730
02:07:06,502 --> 02:07:09,630
Look here, man.
I know you helped her.

1731
02:07:09,797 --> 02:07:11,507
And I know you know
what I want.

1732
02:07:11,673 --> 02:07:15,093
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head...

1733
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:19,931
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.

1734
02:07:20,098 --> 02:07:23,684
Now, she wanna be my friend,
she do that.

1735
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:26,270
She don't want to be
my friend no more...

1736
02:07:26,437 --> 02:07:29,607
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.

1737
02:07:29,773 --> 02:07:31,692
And if she go to the police...

1738
02:07:31,859 --> 02:07:35,237
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.

1739
02:07:35,404 --> 02:07:39,616
And we'll go upstate, hand
in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.

1740
02:07:39,741 --> 02:07:42,744
And that's a promise. Do you
understand what I'm sayin'?

1741
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:46,163
You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.

1742
02:07:49,333 --> 02:07:52,711
You're right.
It was Ordell.

1743
02:07:52,878 --> 02:07:57,424
If you have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?

1744
02:07:57,591 --> 02:07:59,884
Cops can't locate him, huh?

1745
02:08:00,051 --> 02:08:03,471
They don't have your winning
personality.

1746
02:08:03,721 --> 02:08:07,475
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.

1747
02:08:07,641 --> 02:08:10,936
I think I do.
Good enough?

1748
02:08:11,061 --> 02:08:12,855
You bet.

1749
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:29,703
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on
the door like the goddamned police?

1750
02:08:29,870 --> 02:08:32,206
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.

1751
02:08:32,372 --> 02:08:35,500
You keep fuckin' with me, you
the one gonna be asleep. Forever.

1752
02:08:35,667 --> 02:08:38,128
I'm alone.

1753
02:08:38,294 --> 02:08:41,005
Get your ass
in the house.

1754
02:08:46,469 --> 02:08:48,304
No, freeze, motherfucker.
What you doin'?

1755
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:52,141
You want your money?
Your bond refund?

1756
02:08:52,307 --> 02:08:54,393
This all?

1757
02:08:54,559 --> 02:08:56,436
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, no, no, motherfucker.

1758
02:08:56,603 --> 02:08:59,355
You know what I mean.
You talked to her?

1759
02:08:59,522 --> 02:09:01,774
She wants to give you your money.

1760
02:09:01,899 --> 02:09:05,278
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batteramming your door down right now.

1761
02:09:05,444 --> 02:09:07,488
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.

1762
02:09:07,655 --> 02:09:09,490
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.

1763
02:09:09,657 --> 02:09:11,408
He finds people
that don't wanna be found.

1764
02:09:11,575 --> 02:09:13,910
Oh, well,
bully for that nigger.

1765
02:09:14,077 --> 02:09:16,121
So, she wanna give me
my money, huh?

1766
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:21,334
Yeah. She wants to give it to you herself,
and she wants to collect her ten percent.

1767
02:09:21,501 --> 02:09:24,462
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.

1768
02:09:24,629 --> 02:09:27,214
Oh, and I wanna hear
that shit too.

1769
02:09:27,339 --> 02:09:30,092
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1770
02:09:36,681 --> 02:09:39,225
Why don't you tell me why?

1771
02:09:39,392 --> 02:09:42,603
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already
tried to get Jackie to go in with her...

1772
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:45,731
split the half million
amongst themselves.

1773
02:09:45,898 --> 02:09:49,276
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.

1774
02:09:49,443 --> 02:09:52,321
And you helped her,
didn't you?

1775
02:09:52,488 --> 02:09:54,906
All I did was walk out with it.

1776
02:09:55,073 --> 02:09:58,868
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?

1777
02:09:59,035 --> 02:10:01,204
In a way, yes.

1778
02:10:03,706 --> 02:10:08,210
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.

1779
02:10:08,335 --> 02:10:10,295
Go over there and sit
on that couch.

1780
02:10:12,089 --> 02:10:14,633
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know you're here.

1781
02:10:14,758 --> 02:10:17,010
Sit down.

1782
02:10:17,177 --> 02:10:19,012
Place stinks.

1783
02:10:19,179 --> 02:10:21,139
You get used to it.

1784
02:10:22,432 --> 02:10:25,017
- Where my money at?
- My office.

1785
02:10:25,142 --> 02:10:28,020
- Where Jackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.

1786
02:10:28,187 --> 02:10:30,022
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?

1787
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:33,483
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.

1788
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:36,903
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.

1789
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:40,114
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe, she can't.

1790
02:10:40,281 --> 02:10:42,033
Call her and give her
the combination.

1791
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,368
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got her spooked.

1792
02:10:44,535 --> 02:10:47,788
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.

1793
02:10:47,955 --> 02:10:49,790
Oh, you expect me to just
go walkin' in there?

1794
02:10:49,957 --> 02:10:52,417
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.

1795
02:10:52,543 --> 02:10:56,338
When you told her that you'd name her as an
accessory, that scared her more than anything.

1796
02:10:56,463 --> 02:11:00,008
She believed you.

1797
02:11:00,175 --> 02:11:02,719
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?

1798
02:11:02,844 --> 02:11:06,263
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?

1799
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:09,808
See, I ain't trust Melanie either,
but I could handle her.

1800
02:11:09,975 --> 02:11:12,269
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.

1801
02:11:14,396 --> 02:11:17,274
And I told that fuckin' Louis all
he had to do was hit her in the mouth.

1802
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:20,527
But no, he had to shoot her.

1803
02:11:24,655 --> 02:11:26,699
Jackie's at your office, huh?

1804
02:11:26,824 --> 02:11:29,910
She by herself? That big-ass nigger
Winston ain't there, is he?

1805
02:11:30,077 --> 02:11:32,454
She's all alone.

1806
02:11:32,579 --> 02:11:34,790
All right.

1807
02:11:34,956 --> 02:11:38,501
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.

1808
02:11:38,668 --> 02:11:40,420
She will.

1809
02:11:48,469 --> 02:11:53,265
I'll be here.
See you in a bit.

1810
02:12:29,215 --> 02:12:32,259
Goddamn.
In all the time I've known her...

1811
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:34,970
I ain't never heard her
scared like that.

1812
02:12:35,095 --> 02:12:37,472
Usually, she too cool
for school.

1813
02:12:37,639 --> 02:12:41,434
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

1814
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:29,979
I didn't know
you liked the Delfonics.

1815
02:13:32,439 --> 02:13:34,024
They're pretty good.

1816
02:15:05,941 --> 02:15:08,694
My money's
in that office, right?

1817
02:15:11,071 --> 02:15:13,782
If she start giving me some bullshit
about it ain't there...

1818
02:15:13,949 --> 02:15:16,034
and we gotta go
someplace else and get it...

1819
02:15:16,201 --> 02:15:20,163
I'm gonna shoot you
in the head right then and there.

1820
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:23,583
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch
in the kneecaps, find out...

1821
02:15:23,624 --> 02:15:25,459
where my goddamn money is.

1822
02:15:25,626 --> 02:15:28,212
She gonna tell me too.

1823
02:15:28,337 --> 02:15:31,965
Hey, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you, motherfucker.

1824
02:15:35,343 --> 02:15:37,262
Listen.

1825
02:15:37,429 --> 02:15:41,808
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there...

1826
02:15:41,933 --> 02:15:44,852
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?

1827
02:15:45,019 --> 02:15:47,021
Yeah.

1828
02:15:49,398 --> 02:15:52,985
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out of this car, is there?

1829
02:15:53,151 --> 02:15:57,906
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. Are you sure?

1830
02:16:03,619 --> 02:16:05,871
You better be, motherfucker.

1831
02:16:07,623 --> 02:16:09,458
All right.

1832
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:11,835
Let's roll.

1833
02:16:23,888 --> 02:16:25,681
You got the key, right?

1834
02:16:28,475 --> 02:16:32,521
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?

1835
02:16:32,688 --> 02:16:34,648
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.

1836
02:16:34,815 --> 02:16:37,651
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.

1837
02:16:43,531 --> 02:16:46,242
Why is it so dark in here?

1838
02:16:51,663 --> 02:16:55,459
Say, Jackie.
That you?

1839
02:17:02,298 --> 02:17:04,550
Goddamn, girl.

1840
02:17:04,717 --> 02:17:06,552
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?

1841
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:10,681
Ray, he's got a gun!

1842
02:17:29,073 --> 02:17:31,408
He dead?

1843
02:17:31,575 --> 02:17:33,952
Yeah, he's dead.

1844
02:17:34,119 --> 02:17:36,997
Does he have the marked
bills on him?

1845
02:17:37,163 --> 02:17:40,250
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...

1846
02:17:40,416 --> 02:17:43,336
and maybe another 10,000
I gave him.

1847
02:17:43,586 --> 02:17:45,379
Why'd you give him $10,000?

1848
02:17:46,088 --> 02:17:47,882
Returned a bond collateral.

1849
02:17:48,048 --> 02:17:50,926
Brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.

1850
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:53,971
Well, how'd you know
where he was?

1851
02:17:54,137 --> 02:17:56,056
I found him.

1852
02:17:56,181 --> 02:17:59,017
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's my job.

1853
02:17:59,142 --> 02:18:03,187
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.

1854
02:18:03,354 --> 02:18:05,940
She said you wanted him.

1855
02:18:06,023 --> 02:18:09,193
Ray?

1856
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:12,863
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?

1857
02:18:15,407 --> 02:18:19,786
Well, you did. Thanks.

1858
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:43,474
Knock, knock. Hey.

1859
02:18:45,643 --> 02:18:47,394
Hey, you.

1860
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:49,730
I got your package.

1861
02:18:49,897 --> 02:18:52,608
It was fun gettin' a half
million dollars in the mail.

1862
02:18:52,774 --> 02:18:55,861
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?

1863
02:18:56,027 --> 02:18:59,531
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.

1864
02:18:59,697 --> 02:19:03,076
- I, I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.

1865
02:19:05,494 --> 02:19:07,538
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go...

1866
02:19:07,663 --> 02:19:12,042
- That's Ordell's.
- They confiscated everything else.

1867
02:19:12,209 --> 02:19:14,127
Registration was
in the glove box.

1868
02:19:14,294 --> 02:19:17,005
Keys were underneath
the seat. Hey.

1869
02:19:17,172 --> 02:19:20,842
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?

1870
02:19:21,009 --> 02:19:23,094
Not after they're dead.

1871
02:19:25,972 --> 02:19:28,057
I didn't use you, Max.

1872
02:19:29,808 --> 02:19:32,769
I didn't say you did.

1873
02:19:32,936 --> 02:19:34,938
And I never lied to you.

1874
02:19:35,063 --> 02:19:38,566
- I know that.
- We're partners.

1875
02:19:38,733 --> 02:19:43,362
I'm 56 years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.

1876
02:19:45,573 --> 02:19:48,367
Do you blame yourself
for helpin' me?

1877
02:19:48,534 --> 02:19:50,536
No.

1878
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:53,163
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better
if you took some more money.

1879
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:56,750
You'll get over that.
Where you goin'?

1880
02:19:56,917 --> 02:19:59,544
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?

1881
02:19:59,711 --> 02:20:02,422
Madrid first.
Have you been there?

1882
02:20:02,588 --> 02:20:06,425
- I hear they don't eat dinner until midnight.
- You wanna go?

1883
02:20:06,592 --> 02:20:09,637
Thanks, but, uh,
you have a good time.

1884
02:20:09,803 --> 02:20:12,347
You sure I can't twist your arm?

1885
02:20:12,514 --> 02:20:15,642
Thanks for sayin' that, but no.

1886
02:20:15,809 --> 02:20:18,520
Are you scared of me?

1887
02:20:20,063 --> 02:20:21,856
A little bit.

1888
02:20:58,848 --> 02:21:01,225
I'll send you a postcard.

1889
02:21:01,392 --> 02:21:03,311
Will you?

1890
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:05,730
I sure will, partner.

1891
02:21:23,746 --> 02:21:27,291
You're running a business, Max.

1892
02:21:27,458 --> 02:21:29,627
Cherry Bail Bond.

1893
02:21:31,712 --> 02:21:34,423
Uh, what is it
your son's charged with?

1894
02:21:45,933 --> 02:21:49,103
Yes, that's
a very serious offence.

1895
02:21:50,938 --> 02:21:53,732
Is your son still in school?

1896
02:21:53,899 --> 02:21:57,402
Does his father still live
in the house?

1897
02:21:59,529 --> 02:22:03,950
Could I excuse myself? Would you
call me back in about half an hour?

1898
02:22:08,621 --> 02:22:11,874
Yes, thank you.
