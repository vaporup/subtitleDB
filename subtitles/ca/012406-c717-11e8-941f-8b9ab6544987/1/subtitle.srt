1
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,163
Who are you?

2
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:39,883
Jesus.

3
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,270
You ok?

4
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,441
Do I look ok?

5
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,902
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

6
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,783
No...

7
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,171
Trevor...

8
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,008
You still got half an hour.

9
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:23,886
I can fix you some eggs.

10
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:28,640
I am tired but thanks.

11
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,317
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

12
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,907
Come on guys, keep it moving.

13
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:30,327
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

14
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:35,541
Hey, why is that machine down!

15
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,503
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

16
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,797
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

17
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,382
Your paycheck?

18
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:48,804
- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
- What regulations?

19
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:54,518
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries, (motion 1989)

20
00:06:56,645 --> 00:07:01,608
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

21
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:12,286
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

22
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,337
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

23
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,757
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

24
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,217
That is right.

25
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,427
So then, she stopped

26
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:32,472
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

27
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:37,019
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

28
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,274
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

29
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,776
Man, that's bullshit!

30
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:49,531
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

31
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:53,035
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

32
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,162
You might, I don't!

33
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,455
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:58,957
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

35
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,167
Can't, got plans.

36
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,422
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you?  you used to be alright.

37
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,051
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

38
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:12,596
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

39
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:16,975
Who!  hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

40
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:20,020
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

41
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:24,816
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

42
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:29,613
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

43
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,510
You ok?

44
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,472
Do I look ok?

45
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,184
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

46
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:02,646
What's wrong?

47
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,566
I don't know, deja vu.

48
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,320
You are tired, you need to sleep.

49
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,835
How do you do it?

50
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:25,627
What?

51
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,505
Sleep so little and still look so good.

52
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:30,507
Are you flirting with me?

53
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,467
Commiserating

54
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,098
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?

55
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:41,059
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

56
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,228
You had that last night.

57
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,731
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

58
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,359
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

59
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,988
What else do you know about me?

60
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,074
That you are lonely.

61
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:02,664
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

62
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:09,212
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:14,718
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

64
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,468
Check please

65
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:39,445
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

66
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,910
How are you doing, Reznik?

67
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:47,996
What is this about?

68
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:50,498
Frankly I am concerned about you.

69
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,086
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

70
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,718
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

71
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:05,305
- Anything we can help with?
- No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

72
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:08,558
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

73
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,476
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

74
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,816
Where is Stewart?

75
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,484
He couldn't make it

76
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,154
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union ()
- See what I mean.

77
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,367
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

78
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,161
Then I will just get back to work

79
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,622
Er... Trevor, not yet.

80
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,917
I need to ask you for a UA

81
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:51,828
Look like rain.

82
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,882
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

83
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:12,098
they said right.

84
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,891
I'd say it's already here.

85
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,231
You are on the first shift?

86
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,193
- Yeah
- Me too

87
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,240
Funny I never seen you before.

88
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,535
I've been here.

89
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:36,539
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

90
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,749
Where is Reynolds?

91
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,588
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

92
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:52,513
I am Ivan.

93
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,604
Trevor

94
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:08,738
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

95
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:11,657
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

96
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,492
You got that right.

97
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,412
I will see you around.

98
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:46,233
what is wrong?

99
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,403
I just want to lie here.

100
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,697
We can do that.

101
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,994
I'm... so... tired

102
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:01,499
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

103
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,086
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

104
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,421
Nothing helps.

105
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,926
Don't worry about it honey.

106
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,595
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

107
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,848
Stevie

108
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:24,313
I haven't slept in a year.

109
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,824
Jesus Christ!

110
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,368
I tried him too...

111
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:44,542
I am sorry.

112
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:49,880
Hello?

113
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:57,096
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

114
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:05,813
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

115
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,152
Trevor, I am worried about you.

116
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:16,448
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

117
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:22,580
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

118
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,708
Geee... thanks

119
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,088
Reznik, I need a hand

120
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,933
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

121
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,104
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

122
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,528
How is that?

123
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:55,863
A little to the left.

124
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,709
Do I need more?

125
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:13,547
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

126
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:16,717
Better, now try the other side.

127
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:19,762
I hate this bitch.

128
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,496
Hey! what did you do?

129
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:49,333
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

130
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,046
- Come on, kill it.
- Not working.

131
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,964
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

132
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:57,800
- Kill it!
- Not working

133
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,805
God! Jesus!

134
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,349
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

135
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,142
Hit the breaker!

136
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:17,861
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

137
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:19,905
We need some help

138
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,953
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

139
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,081
Call an ambulance!

140
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,709
What happened here?

141
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,086
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

142
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:35,129
You thought?!

143
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,425
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

144
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:50,204
Shit!

145
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,986
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

146
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:28,784
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

147
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:30,577
I will give you a receipt in the morning

148
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:33,163
Good night mr. Reznik.

149
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:36,249
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

150
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,337
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

151
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,258
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

152
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:50,681
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

153
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,432
Unusual?

154
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:56,937
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

155
00:22:57,145 --> 00:23:01,692
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

156
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:10,283
What we know is this:

157
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:15,997
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

158
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:21,837
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

159
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:25,048
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

160
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:29,344
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

161
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:41,440
What is the fucking point?

162
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:44,609
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

163
00:23:44,818 --> 00:23:48,196
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

164
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:51,825
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

165
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:56,079
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

166
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,542
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

167
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,919
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

168
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,380
I was distracted.

169
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:08,884
By what?
What distracted you?

170
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:19,519
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

171
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:22,272
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

172
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:24,774
Who did you say?

173
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,903
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

174
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,406
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

175
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,910
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

176
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,078
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

177
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:40,624
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

178
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:45,587
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

179
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,024
What is this?

180
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:10,320
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

181
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:20,640
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

182
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,058
No

183
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,894
- Trevor
- Yeah

184
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:27,313
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

185
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,401
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

186
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,486
Is it all the way?

187
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:37,073
An airport? For coffee and pie?

188
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:39,909
Suppose I went to Danni's...

189
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:43,455
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

190
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:46,207
Could I do that just in any diner?

191
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,586
Is someone chasing you?

192
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:54,132
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

193
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:57,469
Oh really!  Who are you?

194
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,846
Can you keep a secret?

195
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,766
To the grave.

196
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:04,684
I am Elvis Presley.

197
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:09,189
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

198
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:11,816
I thought you looked familiar.

199
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,660
Got plans for mother's day?

200
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,747
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

201
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:29,250
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

202
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:31,669
That is ok, when he is older

203
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:33,588
I will let him make it up to me.

204
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:36,216
A little guilt goes a long way.

205
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:37,675
How about you?

206
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,427
Cemetery

207
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:43,681
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

208
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:48,102
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

209
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,940
I am not so good at losing family.

210
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:52,941
Who is?

211
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:59,822
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

212
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:03,451
I pictured her while buying it...

213
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:07,413
...Not knowing it would...

214
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,415
You know, be the one.

215
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,920
Seems unfair, isn't it?

216
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:16,965
Not knowing things like that

217
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:25,306
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

218
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,400
Sounds dreamy

219
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,309
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

220
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:12,645
Armed robbery.

221
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:16,524
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

222
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:20,778
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

223
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:26,075
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

224
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:32,040
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

225
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,333
You made me nervous.

226
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:39,547
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

227
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,299
Nothing is up with me.

228
00:29:41,924 --> 00:29:45,053
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

229
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:50,683
You ain't hearing me, man.

230
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,646
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

231
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:17,668
See you tomorrow.

232
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:34,852
Hey

233
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:10,096
Howdy, partner.

234
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:13,266
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

235
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:16,394
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

236
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,773
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

237
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:25,653
We need to talk.

238
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:29,448
Follow me.

239
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,377
Come on!

240
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:55,266
Another Bourbon.

241
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:01,939
Make it double.

242
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,118
You shooting coke or something?

243
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:19,749
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

244
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:23,377
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

245
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,004
How about abnormally?

246
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:30,634
I see Reynolds is back to work.

247
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:34,388
Gets to me bail

248
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:38,768
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

249
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:43,397
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

250
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:45,232
They ain't get to live to be honest.

251
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:49,195
Where they hiding you these days?

252
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:52,031
Around

253
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,246
Hey, you wanna see something?

254
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:07,671
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

255
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,094
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

256
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,679
That is why I walk with a gimp.

257
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:21,936
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

258
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:29,026
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

259
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,074
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

260
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,496
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

261
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,248
You believe that?

262
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,752
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

263
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,213
I am not laughing.

264
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,179
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

265
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,891
That ain't my problem.

266
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:07,606
You caused the accident, not me.

267
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:14,738
Where are you going?

268
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:20,828
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

269
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:25,833
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

270
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:10,794
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

271
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:13,756
What time is it?

272
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:17,176
How are they biting Reynolds?

273
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:26,769
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

274
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,730
I could use it.

275
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:34,735
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

276
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:36,588
Trevor?

277
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,049
I need to see you, Stevie.

278
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:45,889
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

279
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:49,810
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

280
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:52,980
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

281
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:57,067
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

282
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:02,364
Ok, give me a minute.

283
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,912
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

284
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:12,958
My pleasure.

285
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:17,796
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

286
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,928
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

287
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:29,349
Some kind of... plot.

288
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:36,440
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

289
00:37:36,857 --> 00:37:39,776
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

290
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:45,115
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

291
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,411
Their eyes, their little games.

292
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:54,583
What?

293
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:59,671
E R.. E R..

294
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:04,426
- T U C K E R
- Trevor?

295
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,386
TUCKER?

296
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:12,100
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

297
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:13,143
I mean...

298
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:20,484
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

299
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:23,153
I am not worried about being fired.

300
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:25,989
Then what are you worried about?

301
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:30,410
I don't know yet.

302
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,925
There you go, made to order.

303
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,677
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

304
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:52,724
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

305
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:55,310
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

306
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:58,688
By the carousel.

307
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:01,650
Just a minute.

308
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,406
Okay, ready.

309
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:09,825
Smile!

310
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,168
It helps if you push the button.

311
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:27,717
Trevor? What is it?

312
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,021
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

313
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:43,400
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

314
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:51,199
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

315
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,786
Could you...?

316
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:59,082
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

317
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,674
How long have you known my mother?

318
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:09,801
About a year.

319
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,763
How did you meet her?

320
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:15,849
We just kind of met.

321
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,895
Are you going to see her again?

322
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:21,271
I hope so.

323
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,149
Would you like that?

324
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:25,317
I guess so

325
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:31,156
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

326
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,616
What?

327
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:37,579
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

328
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:40,582
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

329
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,377
You will realise that too some day.

330
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:45,712
What is that?

331
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:47,923
Monster ride.

332
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:51,927
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

333
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:56,973
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

334
00:40:57,307 --> 00:40:58,433
Can we go in?

335
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,437
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

336
00:41:02,562 --> 00:41:03,647
What for?

337
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:07,817
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

338
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,867
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

339
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:21,581
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

340
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,418
Fill her up, cowboy.

341
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,262
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

342
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:53,613
Eww.. look at that.

343
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,953
You should close your eyes.

344
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:13,007
Jesus!

345
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:22,559
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

346
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:28,565
Shady Lady

347
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:33,778
Oh, my God.

348
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,364
Stop!

349
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:37,490
Woo

350
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:57,177
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

351
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:31,586
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

352
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,019
I need some help here.

353
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:51,981
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

354
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,484
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

355
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:55,568
Nicolas!

356
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:06,120
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

357
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,498
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

358
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,919
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

359
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:15,713
It is ok, baby.

360
00:44:29,477 --> 00:44:33,231
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

361
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:36,192
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

362
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,027
It's ok, it's not your fault.

363
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:43,241
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

364
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:53,668
Wanna come in?

365
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:56,254
I think you could use a drink.

366
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:44,010
I hope wine is okay with you.

367
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:47,805
That'll work.

368
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:55,646
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

369
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:58,232
I will have to remember that.

370
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:12,163
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

371
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:16,500
Should my lawyer be present?

372
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:23,007
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

373
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:26,552
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

374
00:46:26,636 --> 00:46:28,471
And entertainment.

375
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,724
- Entertainment?
- You.

376
00:46:33,976 --> 00:46:37,396
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

377
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,943
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

378
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:48,240
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

379
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:49,659
Hmmm?

380
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:52,536
That is a deal.

381
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:01,379
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

382
00:47:03,464 --> 00:47:04,715
I will get it.

383
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:08,135
- You wait on me.
- Thanks

384
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,184
It is the last door on the left.

385
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:51,859
Reznik

386
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:57,072
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

387
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:02,786
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

388
00:51:18,302 --> 00:51:19,261
Shit!

389
00:51:35,402 --> 00:51:39,364
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

390
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:42,701
Bye. See you now.

391
00:51:43,243 --> 00:51:46,497
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

392
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,458
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

393
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,709
Yeah, man, take it easy.

394
00:51:52,628 --> 00:51:56,173
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

395
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,260
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

396
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:03,180
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

397
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:09,645
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

398
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,689
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

399
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:13,982
Fair is fair

400
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:18,278
We are just razzing you, kid

401
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:21,648
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

402
00:52:22,023 --> 00:52:25,902
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

403
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:27,529
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

404
00:52:27,738 --> 00:52:31,450
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

405
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,372
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

406
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:40,542
I will see you around, pal.

407
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:17,746
Ah!

408
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:19,581
Hey!

409
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:21,791
Help!

410
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:28,882
Hey!

411
00:53:29,591 --> 00:53:30,300
Hey!

412
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:35,347
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

413
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:50,904
Reznik

414
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:51,988
Ah...

415
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:52,989
I got ya, I got ya.

416
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:55,033
Be cool, be cool, alright?

417
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:02,415
Who did it, huh?

418
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:04,501
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

419
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:06,628
Was it all of you?

420
00:54:07,671 --> 00:54:08,922
Was it you, Jones?

421
00:54:09,256 --> 00:54:10,840
Was it you? Was it you?

422
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:12,133
Or was it you?

423
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:14,177
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

424
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:17,389
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

425
00:54:18,098 --> 00:54:22,644
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

426
00:54:31,027 --> 00:54:32,570
Where is it?

427
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:34,823
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

428
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:39,577
Get him off me!

429
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,374
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

430
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:45,750
You are fired.

431
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:56,302
This motherfucker's crazy.

432
00:54:56,886 --> 00:54:58,221
You lost it, man.

433
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:20,285
Shit!

434
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,545
Damn it! Where is it?

435
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:40,805
Asshole!

436
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,225
What the fuck did you do with it?

437
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:47,854
Idiot!

438
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:18,319
Hey! Fuck you!

439
00:57:19,862 --> 00:57:20,822
Get out!

440
00:57:37,547 --> 00:57:38,506
What?

441
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:43,219
It's an occupational hazard.

442
00:58:00,403 --> 00:58:07,243
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

443
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,669
I could give it up for the right guy.

444
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:25,053
Oh, that came out wrong.

445
00:58:28,347 --> 00:58:29,682
What I mean is...

446
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:37,607
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

447
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:42,445
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

448
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:51,579
I think I'd like that.

449
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:16,414
Mr. Reznik.

450
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:19,083
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

451
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,751
You leave me in such a scare.

452
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,632
What are you doing in my apartment?

453
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,260
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

454
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,970
That's impossible.

455
01:00:31,304 --> 01:00:32,847
I'm gonna leave a note.

456
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,308
A note? What kind of note?

457
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,268
About the leak.

458
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:40,521
What's that terrible smell?

459
01:00:41,022 --> 01:00:42,565
There is no leak in this apartment.

460
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:44,859
Now if you would excuse me...

461
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:45,526
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

462
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:49,488
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

463
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,992
Miller!

464
01:02:18,494 --> 01:02:19,620
Hey, Reznik.

465
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,206
It's a pleasant surprise.

466
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,291
We need to talk.

467
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,502
Take a look at this, huh?

468
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:28,587
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

469
01:02:29,755 --> 01:02:32,299
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

470
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:33,342
I need to be doing something.

471
01:02:33,342 --> 01:02:35,427
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

472
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:40,140
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

473
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,228
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

474
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,692
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

475
01:02:51,026 --> 01:02:52,903
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

476
01:02:57,866 --> 01:02:59,743
Is there some place we can talk?

477
01:03:02,037 --> 01:03:07,293
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

478
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:10,421
8 cylinders

479
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,675
Speed sensitive steering

480
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:18,304
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

481
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:23,392
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

482
01:03:23,392 --> 01:03:24,977
Of course, it's automatic.

483
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,228
Hell I wanted a stick...

484
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:29,648
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

485
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:34,361
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

486
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:35,863
Yeah, I heard about it.

487
01:03:36,155 --> 01:03:38,073
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

488
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,452
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

489
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,953
Ironic?

490
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:46,123
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

491
01:03:46,915 --> 01:03:48,751
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

492
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,587
Moments after you left the shop,

493
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:53,547
someone powered up my machine.

494
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:55,507
With my arm in it.

495
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:57,384
I nearly got killed.

496
01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:58,761
Accidents happen.

497
01:03:58,761 --> 01:03:59,803
It wasn't an accident.

498
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:03,682
Accidents happen out of negligence

499
01:04:04,725 --> 01:04:06,685
This happened down the spike.

500
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:08,354
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

501
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:09,271
Spike.

502
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:13,233
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

503
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:15,027
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

504
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:16,362
I am onto you Miller.

505
01:04:16,362 --> 01:04:19,740
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

506
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,409
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

507
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:23,827
How did you get into my place?

508
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,454
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

509
01:04:25,454 --> 01:04:27,414
Fuck you, Miller!

510
01:04:27,414 --> 01:04:28,665
This shit is gonna stop!

511
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,843
Get off my property, punk!

512
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:02,991
Bastards.

513
01:05:07,246 --> 01:05:18,674
Shit.

514
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:34,815
Come on.

515
01:06:14,396 --> 01:06:15,897
7-4...

516
01:06:15,897 --> 01:06:17,524
...3-C-R

517
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:19,109
It's 743CR.

518
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:29,036
What?

519
01:06:32,873 --> 01:06:33,665
Shit.

520
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,760
Fuck!

521
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,765
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

522
01:06:49,765 --> 01:06:52,517
...motor's information to the general public.

523
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:53,852
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

524
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:55,604
This guy is a friend of mine.

525
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,732
But you don't know your firend's address?

526
01:06:58,732 --> 01:07:00,651
We just met, I don't know him that well.

527
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:04,446
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

528
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:06,323
I just want talk to him.

529
01:07:07,074 --> 01:07:10,285
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

530
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:11,328
Has a crime been committed?

531
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:16,917
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

532
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,960
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

533
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,762
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

534
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,224
I don't see any bruises.

535
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:34,101
If you did,
would you give me an address?

536
01:07:35,268 --> 01:07:36,895
No, but the police might.

537
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,376
I want to report a hit and run.

538
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:37,390
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

539
01:10:17,889 --> 01:10:19,057
Mr. Reznik.

540
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:23,228
You sure about these plate numbers?

541
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:27,065
743CR. All right, that's the one.

542
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:29,275
Do you ever have a car stolen?

543
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:31,444
No, what?

544
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,572
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

545
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:40,829
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

546
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:43,748
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

547
01:10:55,009 --> 01:10:57,387
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

548
01:10:59,597 --> 01:11:02,100
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

549
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,059
Hey! Hey!

550
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,026
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

551
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:41,157
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

552
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:09,996
Trevor?

553
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:13,958
Oh, no.

554
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:22,842
Trevor, what do you want?

555
01:14:25,303 --> 01:14:27,847
Trevor, it's okay.

556
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,395
Oh God, what happend?

557
01:14:35,855 --> 01:14:39,942
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

558
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,821
Did he stop?

559
01:14:45,156 --> 01:14:48,367
No, he just kept going.

560
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,579
He fucking hit my drivers man.

561
01:14:52,246 --> 01:14:54,123
He gotta be hanged.

562
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,918
It was my fault.

563
01:14:56,918 --> 01:14:59,253
I wasn't paying attention.

564
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:02,006
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

565
01:15:03,507 --> 01:15:04,926
You may have some internal injuries.

566
01:15:04,926 --> 01:15:06,636
it is just bruises.

567
01:15:07,261 --> 01:15:08,512
Okay, you see this?

568
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:12,475
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

569
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:16,562
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

570
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:20,691
I trust you.

571
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,320
Now I know.
You are crazy.

572
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,448
Can I stay here tonight?

573
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:30,493
Babe, you can stay here every night.

574
01:15:32,036 --> 01:15:33,120
You know that?

575
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:36,415
What?

576
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,586
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

577
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:44,173
I really want this to work, Stevie

578
01:15:48,052 --> 01:15:48,844
But?

579
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,140
You know so little about me.

580
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,311
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

581
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:03,442
I will buy you a flea collar.

582
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,658
I love you.

583
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,834
Stevie

584
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:20,751
Yeah.

585
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,294
Thanks.

586
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:41,689
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

587
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,316
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

588
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:49,238
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

589
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,032
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

590
01:16:52,783 --> 01:16:54,452
Hey, perfect fit.

591
01:16:56,328 --> 01:16:57,663
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

592
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,541
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

593
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,335
Hey, how about that idea.

594
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:05,963
I can get a job selling man's wear.

595
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,675
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

596
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:11,969
I'll settle for that.

597
01:17:13,554 --> 01:17:14,972
That's not a bad life.

598
01:17:15,473 --> 01:17:17,349
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

599
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:22,062
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

600
01:17:23,022 --> 01:17:25,608
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

601
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:29,278
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

602
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:31,030
And I wanna do more of that.

603
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:34,074
I would love to paint a place.

604
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:39,580
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

605
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:45,920
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

606
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:15,699
()Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

607
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,326
Not a lot to ask.

608
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:24,750
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

609
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:31,423
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

610
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:35,678
Not even my husband.

611
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,766
Jesus Christ.

612
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,102
Where is he?

613
01:18:45,312 --> 01:18:45,980
Who?

614
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:47,189
You know who.

615
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:51,944
- Trevor.
- Don't.

616
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:56,448
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

617
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,576
This, Ivan.

618
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:02,371
He's your ex, isn't he?

619
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:03,455
What?

620
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:04,873
Why is he doing this?

621
01:19:05,624 --> 01:19:07,459
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

622
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:09,795
Now it all makes sense.

623
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:12,798
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

624
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:13,674
Where is he?

625
01:19:13,674 --> 01:19:15,843
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

626
01:19:15,843 --> 01:19:18,012
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

627
01:19:18,012 --> 01:19:20,097
Ah, don't babe me.

628
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:22,850
Yeah, babe.

629
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,813
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

630
01:19:30,107 --> 01:19:32,860
You know what, I don't deserve this.

631
01:19:33,152 --> 01:19:34,028
What did you do?

632
01:19:34,695 --> 01:19:37,823
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

633
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:38,741
Fuck you!

634
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,785
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

635
01:19:41,785 --> 01:19:44,997
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

636
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:50,669
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

637
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,758
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

638
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:57,468
I'm talking about your ex!

639
01:19:57,843 --> 01:19:58,677
Ivan.

640
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:05,350
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

641
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,646
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

642
01:20:10,814 --> 01:20:13,484
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

643
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:23,786
That's not me.

644
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:33,420
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

645
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:42,971
You lying whore.

646
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:48,727
You get the fuck out.

647
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:50,521
Fucking freak.

648
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:53,440
You are a fucking pig

649
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,691
You fucking whore

650
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,528
You are a fucking freak.

651
01:20:57,528 --> 01:21:00,280
You are a fucking psycho.

652
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:20,551
Fucking psycho

653
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:52,416
Where is Marie?

654
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,709
Who?

655
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:56,753
You know who.

656
01:21:56,753 --> 01:21:59,840
Marie my waitress.

657
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,593
My! You are chatty tonight.

658
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:07,806
Darling, I am your waitress!

659
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:08,598
What's going on here?

660
01:22:08,598 --> 01:22:10,392
I've never seen you before.

661
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,561
What are you talking about?

662
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:17,774
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

663
01:22:19,443 --> 01:22:23,030
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

664
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:25,699
I wanna see Marie!

665
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:30,912
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

666
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:38,003
Is everybody at it?

667
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:43,216
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

668
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:47,262
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

669
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,098
Go home, Mister.

670
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:55,312
Get some sleep.

671
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:25,902
How could you!

672
01:25:46,316 --> 01:25:50,945
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

673
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:55,950
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

674
01:25:55,950 --> 01:26:01,164
What have you done with Nicholas?

675
01:26:01,831 --> 01:26:07,087
What have I done with Nicholas?

676
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:17,180
He can't hear you now, pal.

677
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:23,645
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

678
01:26:26,773 --> 01:26:31,986
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

679
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,366
Might make life a little bit easier.

680
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:41,579
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

681
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:50,755
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

682
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:57,428
Where is your hospitality, partner?

683
01:27:02,934 --> 01:27:08,189
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

684
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,610
Who are you?

685
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,242
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

686
01:30:29,599 --> 01:30:31,100
I know who you are.

687
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,524
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

688
01:32:45,818 --> 01:32:48,737
Yeah, Mrs.shrike, I'm moving.

689
01:32:49,655 --> 01:32:50,823
I didn't receive notice.

690
01:32:51,657 --> 01:32:54,493
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

691
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,997
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

692
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:02,501
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

693
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:10,593
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

694
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:13,512
I just don't understand it.

695
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,985
Oh, isn't that pretty?

696
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,740
Would you care to sell it?

697
01:33:35,451 --> 01:33:37,620
No, it was my mother's.

698
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:45,669
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

699
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:46,712
You just want to get away...

700
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:49,298
If you are going to give it away...

701
01:33:49,298 --> 01:33:54,553
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

702
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:54,071
I like to report a hit-and-run.

703
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:12,089
Some one will record your statement.

704
01:35:13,132 --> 01:35:18,762
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

705
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,064
Just want to sleep.
