1
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:34,594
Founder of Divine Dragon!
You're the best!

2
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:42,659
Founder of Divine Dragon!
You're the best!

3
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,244
Dragon! Why did your mission

4
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,521
to enter the Ching Palace fail.

5
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,218
Ajerk called Wei-Shou-Bou.

6
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,623
Spoiled my mission.

7
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,562
Is his Kung fu extraordinary?

8
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,426
He knows almost nothing about it!

9
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,163
Is he very good at using poison?

10
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,495
No.

11
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,435
Is he a lady-killer
and who bewitched you?

12
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,610
It's really funny! He looks like a hog
and is as crooked as a dog.

13
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,737
He's absolutely a nerd.

14
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,010
So why did you lose?

15
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,774
I'm willing to accept
any punishment from you.

16
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:38,590
It's fate! Wei-Shou-Bou
could be your unbeatable rival.

17
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,722
You have to be more careful
if you meet him again.

18
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,225
Yes, sir!

19
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,595
I know I'm old, just like a candle
which burns to the end.

20
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,063
So I want you to succeed me!

21
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,482
Long! Jump into the blood pool!
Soak yourself in the water.

22
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,455
Then you can be ready
to take my place.

23
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:17,589
The son of the Ping-Shi Ruler
will call on the damned Emperor.

24
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,459
You've to protect him
24 hours a day.

25
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,464
Yes!

26
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:26,098
We've been assisting the Ping-Shi Ruler,
Wu-Sun-Gwei, for three generations.

27
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,201
Now you succeed me.

28
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,607
You must do your best to help
him ascend the throne.

29
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:36,348
Now I'll go in the pool first;
then you follow me.

30
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,314
You'll be able to get
all of my Kung-fu power.

31
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,648
But remember!

32
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:47,187
Our Kung-fu is very special.
Once you lose your virginity.

33
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:53,425
Eight tenth of your Kung-fu power will
be transferred to that man.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't forget! Remember!

35
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,533
Founder of Divine Dragon!
You're the best!

36
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,204
Wei-Shou-Bou!
I'll go back again!

37
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,310
Girls come here to
attend to your guests.

38
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,812
Stinky eggs...

39
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,251
Jerk! Jerk...

40
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,256
Stinky eggs...
Bastard...

41
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,722
Son of a bitch...

42
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,316
Son of a bitch...

43
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,984
Stinky eggs...

44
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,998
Son of a bitch...

45
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,428
You lost, you son of a bitch.

46
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,634
How dare you say I'm a son of bitch!

47
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,139
You said my sister and
I were given birth to by bitch?

48
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,640
You're fined 100,000.

49
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,211
Brother! Mr. Duo didn't mean to
say that! Please forgive him.

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,474
I really didn't mean it.

51
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,741
You favor him so much! Do you have
some special relationship?

52
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,147
Don't talk nonsense!
How could that be possible?

53
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,810
We're innocent.

54
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:24,549
We're pure! Extremely pure!

55
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,919
I hate to see you.
I want to take a pee.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,127
Pretty Lady.
Bastard!

57
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,728
Don't say a word.

58
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,566
Make no sound! Is that son of bitch,
Wei-Shou-Bou, in the next room?

59
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,606
Yes! No... No! Yes!

60
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,038
Yes or no?

61
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,876
What's the feud between Wen and you?

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,371
The son of bitch helps
the wicked perpetrate their evil deeds!

63
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,416
Everyone should kill him!

64
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,186
Thank heaven! I've suffered
disgrace and insults for so many years.

65
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,448
Thanks god! I've been waiting so long!

66
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,849
Are you...
My whole family was murdered by him.

67
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,086
I was forced to be his rabbit!

68
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,187
This traitor! Everybody has
the right to kill him.

69
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,924
Kill him as soon as possible!
I'll bring the fire crackers.

70
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,457
Wait a minute!
Take us with you!

71
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,302
Of course! Let me pick up
my sunglasses first.

72
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,763
This way, please!

73
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,279
Brother! We're innocent!

74
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,407
Duke Wei...
You son of bitch! Keep quiet!

75
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,289
Son of bitch!
Now I'm son of bitch then.

76
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,290
What? Do you want to deny it?

77
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,519
I really want to cut you into pieces!
Peel your skin and bite your bones.

78
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,024
What?

79
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,591
Wei-Shou-Bou! Don't say you don't
know how you were killed.

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm Li-Ko. My master is
the one armed Divine Nun.

81
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,528
I'm not Wei-Shou-Bou.

82
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,898
Murder! Help...
Hurry! Attack them!

83
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,514
Why are you so nervous?
Calm down!

84
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,675
Fortunately, I have a large army.

85
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,275
Of course! You're so many enemies.

86
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,732
Wow! It's a girl!
What a pretty girl she is!

87
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,637
What is it about!
I understand! I understand!

88
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,313
Hold on! Stop!

89
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,951
You want to run away now?
You'll be killed.

90
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,789
Take it easy! I was not sure that
you're an Anti-Ching person.

91
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:41,792
Now I have to reveal

92
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,090
my real identity.

93
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,288
I'm the follower of Prey,
the bird hunting hero!

94
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,733
The master of the East never fails,
the West always fails.

95
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,928
West always fails.

96
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,805
Are you that West Always fails
who fights for justice?

97
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,470
Don't move! Otherwise
I'll kill the two girls.

98
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,579
Give him the poisonous wine!

99
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,438
Poisonous wine?

100
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,016
That kettle!

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,145
What? You!

102
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,449
Don't drink!

103
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,559
Don't drink! He'll lose his nature
after drinking that.

104
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,162
If no woman makes love
to him in half an hour.

105
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,596
He will be turned into blood.

106
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,495
Drink!
No! No!

107
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,394
I won't bother you!

108
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,913
I've drunk the wine. Release them now.

109
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,613
OK! Let's go!

110
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,989
Son of bitch!

111
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,649
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,452
The poison! Save me!

113
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,289
How?

114
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,059
I can survive only if there's a young
woman willing to make love to me.

115
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,398
No way! No!

116
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,407
If we both do that to you...

117
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,870
Can we save your life then?

118
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:09,211
Thanks! But I can't. Get out of my way!

119
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,510
Thanks for sacrificing yourself to save
our lives! We'll never forget you!

120
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,519
After you die, we'll burn
paper money for you.

121
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,080
Wow! Where's the righteousness?
Do you want to see me die?

122
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,993
You can't fool anybody, Y. C
with your devious ways!

123
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,031
Girls, you can't believe that!

124
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,831
You... Let's go!

125
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,498
Young man! You're too
meddlesome! Beat him!

126
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,538
Let's go!

127
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,885
Don't chase him!

128
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,254
Are you all right?

129
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,458
I'm Wu-ln-Shon.
My father is Wu-Sun-Gwei.

130
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,694
I'm Ah-Ko!

131
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,163
Sister! Master said
Wu-Sun-Gwei is a traitor.

132
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,835
If we get invaded by his son,
our master will blame us.

133
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,941
I know how to control it!

134
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,913
Thanks for your help! See you!

135
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,174
Please...

136
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,011
Miss...

137
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,781
Let them go! You've already
made big trouble.

138
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,788
That man was Wei-Shou-Bou!

139
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,286
Is he Wei-Shou-Bou?

140
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,163
Wow! Their Kung-fu is so great!

141
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,129
Ou-Bei's Kung-fu was very good,
but still he was killed by me.

142
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,531
Go back and get some men

143
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,297
We want to call on Ta-Jen!

144
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,169
What's the matter?

145
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,639
Imperial decree: He wants Ta-Jen
to call on him as soon as possible.

146
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,902
Where's His Majesty?

147
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,537
Darling! Why do you want us
to come here in a hurry?

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,843
Darling was hit on the street today!

149
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,615
After calling on his Majesty,
let's beat him!

150
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,119
Who has the guts to do that?

151
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,813
The man who can defeat me
has to be a superman.

152
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,189
His fist is bigger than a kettle.
His eyes are as big as bronze balls.

153
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,217
His tongue is as long as that of
a cow! Two heads taller than me!

154
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,556
Hi! Don't go away!

155
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,631
You look so much alike! Get closer
to each other, and take a look.

156
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,029
So much alike!
As though from the same mould.

157
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,898
Is my tongue as long as that of a cow?

158
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,632
Wow! Really it's you: The sissy!

159
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,665
How dare you take my place! Kill him!

160
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,115
Don't give up! I'm asking for help!

161
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,058
Your majesty is coming here!

162
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,156
My majesty!
Stand up please!

163
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,595
Wei! What's the matter?

164
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,764
That sissy with a black hat ran into
the palace without permission.

165
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,965
He even tried to peep at
the imperial concubine's body.

166
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,506
I tried to stop him,
but was beaten by him.

167
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,565
Really?
Yes!

168
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,506
Ta-Jen Wei! What's your
position in the imperial court?

169
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,977
Pimp! No! I'm Da-Shei-Shi
and Lu-Ding-Kong.

170
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,308
May I help you, mister?

171
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,541
Take a close look
to see who I am!

172
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,614
You say he's the conspirator
of that sissy.

173
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,245
Don't talk nonsense!

174
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,052
This is the son of Ping Shi Ruler,
Wu-Sun-Gwei.

175
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,685
He wants to discuss
national affairs with me!

176
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,228
Princess! You're famous for
your dignity and courage!

177
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,867
This man is my best general!

178
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,172
Brother!

179
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,606
Brother! You're extraordinary!
So glad to see you!

180
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:25,903
What did you say about me?

181
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,206
I say your Kung-fu is extraordinary!

182
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,612
My admiration for you is like
running water lasting forever!

183
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,048
Shou Bou! No more words!
Order them to prepare the food.

184
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,622
Will it be ok?
Sure! Go ahead!

185
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,656
Brother! Cheers!

186
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,132
Let's just forget about
our little mistake!

187
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,335
Please!

188
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,106
Princess! With a superior like him.

189
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,906
I'm sure you'll win every fight.

190
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,470
Even if you want to rise up
against the court, you'll win.

191
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,345
What did you say? Do you want
to slander the prince!

192
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,011
Today is... I like today...

193
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,949
Your Majesty!
Why don't we just have some fun?

194
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,248
Great idea. Do you have any ideas?

195
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,095
I want to bet with 100 taels
that the general official

196
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,893
can smash my superiors
within ten Kung-fu moves.

197
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,400
I can't guarantee it!

198
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,370
Guarantee what? OK! So I'll bet with
1 million taels that you can't win.

199
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,632
OK! A deal!
OK!

200
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,141
Crown Prince!
Don't lose me any face!

201
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,912
My majesty!

202
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,381
Stand up!
Thanks! Your majesty!

203
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,924
Dragon! Now you can start!

204
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,756
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

205
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,165
One more!

206
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,599
Dragon! Don't lose face
for the Ping Shi Ruler.

207
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,941
Ten!

208
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,914
Bugger! Thanks for your money!

209
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,985
Will it be ok if I say it's the equivalent
of your compensation for my wounds?

210
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,188
OK!

211
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,290
Please forgive my rudeness?

212
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,323
That's OK! Boxing is dangerous.

213
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,231
Thanks! Your majesty!

214
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,535
I want to declare one thing here.

215
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,873
I want my sister to marry Wu.

216
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,438
He'll be my imperial brother-in-law!

217
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,669
Thanks. Your Majesty!

218
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,840
This is the happiest news today!

219
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,615
Well I'll designate you to be my
Imperial Inspector General.

220
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,952
Escort my sister to Un Nang!

221
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,153
Yes!

222
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,084
Do you know why
I want to bestow the marriage?

223
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,060
My majesty! I don't dare to
guess in front of you.

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,302
After Ou Bei was killed,
everyone people is loyal to me!

225
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,936
Except for some traitors,
like Tien-Di Gang.

226
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,041
And the One Arm Divine Nun,
who say's she's a Ming Princess,

227
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,440
dare to against me!

228
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,135
Those ballheads!
Let them run their course.

229
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,545
I've been restless due to a big problem.

230
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,082
That Ping-Shi Ruler Wu Sun Gwei.

231
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,984
Why did His majesty want
to be Wu's brother-in-law.

232
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,013
I keep getting information
from my spy that,

233
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,785
He collects troops and horses,
conspiring with Divine Dragon Gang!

234
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,295
It's also him who sent the
fake empress dowager here.

235
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,996
It's obvious he wants
to rise up against you!

236
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,367
That's why I arranged for you to be
the Imperial Inspector General!

237
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,594
To kill him when I've got chance!

238
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:42,800
No! Don't kill him
but eliminate all the trouble.

239
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,133
I hope you can use a conciliatory policy,

240
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,070
to calm him down!
So he can't rise up recently!

241
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,508
When the time comes.
I'll round everything up.

242
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,014
I see!

243
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,685
Now what I'm worried about,

244
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,347
is that my spoiled sister
won't marry him!

245
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,684
Help me persuade her!

246
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,450
Yes!

247
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,967
Your Royal Highness.
It's Wei-Shou-Bou!

248
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,838
Stand up!
Thanks Princess!

249
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,568
Fu! Lu! You may leave now.

250
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,239
Yes!

251
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,546
Princess! You'll choke me to death!

252
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,050
You devil! Why don't you just die?

253
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,550
You don't have to see me!

254
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,814
But I still come here!
Now it's not so bad!

255
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,457
Princess! Congratulations!
I've some great news.

256
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,456
Duke Wei! Congratulations!

257
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,828
I've some great news for you, too.

258
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,365
You do?
You say yours first!

259
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,296
Our majesty confirms on the marriage.
Really?

260
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,768
She'll marry Wu-ln-Shon,
the second son of Ping-Shi-Ruler.

261
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,842
I'll accompany her
when she gets married.

262
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,742
No way! Shou Bou!

263
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,074
Why?

264
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,738
Because I'm carrying your baby!

265
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:04,012
Your words make me realize that!

266
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:14,962
I was frightened out of
my wits, and lost my soul.

267
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,861
Then what should I do?

268
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,405
The charge is serious!
Maybe I have to be decapitated.

269
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,103
Persuade my brother to change
his decision, so I can marry you.

270
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,444
I'll not hit you on the 1st
and 15th day of the month.

271
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,879
That generous?
Yes!

272
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,779
But how can we change
the decision of his majesty?

273
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,115
I don't care! Otherwise, I'll tell
my brother that you raped me!

274
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,384
Why does it still sound logical for you
to describe things in the opposite way?

275
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,924
Otherwise. I'll still marry Wu-ln-Shon.

276
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,390
Tell him this is your son.

277
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,985
But you have to see me
every evening from now on!

278
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,461
How can that be possible?
That's adultery.

279
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,691
I will be disgraced!

280
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,425
So do you want to be
decapitated or disgraced?

281
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,138
Your majesty! We're at Ten-Mile-Forest!

282
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,271
Order the army to take a rest!

283
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,138
Brother-ln-Law! Let's take a rest here!

284
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,439
Yes! Your majesty!

285
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,217
Ta-Jen Wei! Come here!

286
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,751
Ta-Jen Wei! You look very
handsome in the helmet.

287
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,825
My respect to you is
like running water...

288
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,622
Running your mother!

289
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,960
With the turtle shell,
I feel my head has got shot!

290
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,029
Are you a big watermelon?

291
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,793
Sit!
Yes!

292
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,458
Hope you have a nice trip!

293
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,864
Thanks!

294
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,600
Cheers!
Cheers...

295
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,637
Shiu Bou!

296
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,075
I feel bored!
What's the matter!

297
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,515
Shou Bou! Disguise yourself as a turtle.

298
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,745
It's your wedding ceremony!

299
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,254
Disguised as a turtle! What a joke!

300
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,220
It's for your own good! Don't run away!

301
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,849
Like a needle gap arrester.
The thunder will split you first!

302
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,187
It's really thunder!
I'm not a needle gap arrester.

303
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,853
Don't be afraid. The thunder
will split me first.

304
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,397
Take this with you.

305
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,026
Really troublesome!

306
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,400
Stand up! Be more energetic!

307
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,497
Ta-Jen Wei! You look fantastic!

308
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,633
Thanks! When I'm here. No one
dares to touch My Majesty!

309
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,803
Damned Your Majesty!

310
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,409
Assassin!

311
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,345
Bodyguard!

312
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,488
Be careful! Bodyguard!

313
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,523
Cold Ice Slapping!

314
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,280
Damned Your Majesty!

315
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,014
What are you doing!

316
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,181
Protect the emperor!

317
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,100
Cold Ice Slapping!

318
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,875
Shou Bou! Are you OK?

319
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,348
I'm glad that I'm wearing an invulnerable
underwear inside.

320
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,781
Your Majesty! Are you OK!

321
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm OK! You protected me.

322
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,352
So I'll bestow on you a title "Protector"!

323
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,680
Bestow that title on me?

324
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,487
Bodyguard!

325
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,564
Protect Our Majesty!

326
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,176
Wait!

327
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,980
Protect Our Majesty!

328
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,443
What's your name?

329
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,885
Wen Shau Lun!

330
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,582
Go back and eliminate all your family!
Thanks. Your Majesty

331
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,221
Why are there so many people here?

332
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,392
Damn it! Whose shoes are they?

333
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,358
Hi! Don't hit my back!

334
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,931
Who is holding my penis then!

335
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,331
Shut up! We're all unable to act
according to our own will!

336
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,599
Who's being so bossy?

337
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,467
You son of bitch!

338
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,341
It's me! Are you OK?

339
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,643
In this situation it's hard
to decide who's better.

340
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,045
Why don't we use our Kung-fu
to get them out of here!

341
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,050
OK!

342
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,949
I want to kill you.

343
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,528
My Majesty!
I'll accompany you.

344
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,103
Please! Be accompany me, too! Thanks.

345
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,303
Wait!

346
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,846
How long do I have to wait?

347
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,671
Don't exert yourself so hard!

348
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,459
Son of bitch! Don't run away!

349
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,426
I'm OK! I'll follow you
no matter where you go!

350
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,027
Go and catch both of them.

351
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,900
Why don't you run after them!

352
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,236
Don't worry! I'll save your
Imperial-Brother-in-Law right now.

353
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,573
Don't forget to save Duke Wei!

354
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,549
Everyone, listen to me now!

355
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,119
Stop the old nun and the Crown Prince!

356
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,495
What are you doing now?

357
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,030
Your sword is in front of my neck.

358
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,867
So of course I cowered.

359
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,405
Your rascal!
Believe it or not I'll kill you!

360
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:09,806
Master...

361
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,043
Master! How was that?

362
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,950
It's hard to believe there's such a master
of martial arts protecting Kang Hsi.

363
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,782
Is that because the Ching Dynasty
is still fated to survive?

364
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,520
Sister! Do you want me
to help you find a doctor?

365
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,357
Do you want to go? Master!
Wei-Shou-Bou is such a sly person.

366
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,896
Maybe we should just kill him!

367
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,499
I just tried to help you!

368
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,229
No! He's the favourite
person of Kang Hsi.

369
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,498
Now he's our protective shield!

370
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,809
No! No! No! Can't you

371
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,811
remember I saved you that day?

372
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,580
Ko! Did you see him before?

373
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,349
That day I went spying with Sister.

374
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,251
I was almost killed by Wei-Shou-Bou.

375
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,351
Fortunately, he saved me!

376
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,916
Why did I never
hear you talk about that?

377
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,755
I think you still forget about one thing!

378
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,627
He's the son of Ping-Shi Ruler.

379
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,160
The master who
hurt you is his superior.

380
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,697
Is he the son of Ping-Shi Ruler,
the traitor?

381
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:06,965
Ko! Kill him!

382
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,766
No! Don't kill me!

383
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,506
How dare you not listen to me?

384
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,081
Save me! Here I am!

385
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,579
Old nun! Release him!

386
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,453
You may come and take him
back if you have guts.

387
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,901
The old man is hurt already!
No need to be afraid.

388
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,415
You're lucky to be killed
by my Internal Thunder Palm!

389
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,624
I was too bold to help you
with Internal Thunder Plam.

390
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,220
Please forgive me by doing that!

391
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,858
What "Internal Thunder Plam"?
That's a gun!

392
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,565
Why do you help me?

393
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,168
Sir!

394
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:21,378
Why are you so nervous?
I just attacked his sleeping point.

395
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,844
Now you can just say what you want!

396
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,647
Please forgive my rudeness.

397
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,947
Ching-Ming? Left for rebellion!
Right foot for Ching-Ming?

398
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,887
Are you a member of Tien-Di gang?

399
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,893
Yes! I'm Chin-Mu-Tong
leader of Tien-Di gang.

400
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,130
This is my badge of authority.

401
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,064
My master, Cheng-Ging-Nang
sent me to spy in the Palace.

402
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,727
I'm so lucky to have
the chance to see you!

403
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,668
Master! Don't believe him!
He's very sly.

404
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,167
Is that right?

405
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:50,769
How's the General Leader, Cheng?

406
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,772
Thanks for your concern!

407
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,504
My master can eat, sleep,
and usually only talks about you!

408
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,408
He said in the whole world
his Wu-Kung is second best.

409
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,540
You're the No.1. Super No.1!

410
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,617
I don't deserve the praise!

411
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,949
I hope you could be my master, too.

412
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,549
I'm wondering
if I could have that chance!

413
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,653
Mr. Wei! Stand up, please!

414
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,630
If you don't promise me that,
I'll never stand up!

415
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,559
OK!
Thanks!

416
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,466
Sister! I know you still
kind of misunderstand me.

417
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,541
I believe that
you'll understand me soon!

418
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,441
Mr. Wei! So for now you're
just my disciple in name!

419
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:32,414
If General Leader Cheng agrees,
I'll teach you my Wu Kung!

420
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,009
Thanks Sister! No! Thanks master!

421
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,819
We should leave this place quickly.

422
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,456
There's the other sister
waiting for us at the Inn.

423
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,649
OK!

424
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,328
Master. May I ask you a question?
Is One Arm Knife King your father?

425
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,524
No!

426
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,531
There's an Inn!

427
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,395
Yes. You're right!

428
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,946
Ta-Jen Duo! Why do you
keeping looking at that man?

429
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,353
That's a woman!

430
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,688
How do you know?

431
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,626
Because when men see me,
they always vomit!

432
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,731
But he didn't.
So I think "he" must be a "she".

433
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,864
You're so smart! My respect to you,

434
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,163
is as the running water lasting forever.

435
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,362
Damn it! Don't copy my words!

436
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,641
Master! Here!

437
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,038
Thanks!

438
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,352
Sister! Are you looking for me?

439
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,648
Get out of here!

440
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:48,320
Ah-Nong. Master got hurt.
Take here into the room for treatment.

441
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,028
Ah-Ko! Watch him!

442
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,961
Shou Bou! Take a look around us.
See if anyone is following us!

443
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,329
Yes! Master! But this guy...

444
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,896
I stabbed his pressure points.
He can't hear us!

445
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,235
Don't worry!

446
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:10,338
Sister! I want to confess to you.
Actually I...

447
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,574
Get out of here!

448
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,878
Ta-Jen Wei!

449
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,115
Ta-Jen Wei! You're really a big man!

450
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,125
You really flatter a lot!

451
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,060
I really can't stand you!

452
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,857
We got here very quickly.

453
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,454
We knew there's only this Inn
in the neighborhood.

454
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,930
That's how we could get here so soon!

455
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,229
I don't need you help!
That old nun can't defeat me!

456
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,396
The reason why I come here
is because I want...

457
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,296
Your taste is unique!
Even an old nun can interest you!

458
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,967
We really admire you!

459
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,271
Shut up! I want her disciple Ah Ko.

460
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,401
Did you bring my luggage!

461
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,013
Sure! Even your helmet is with us!

462
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,777
What a smart boy you are!

463
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,682
How dare you steal my show!

464
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,754
Marvelous! Ta-Jen!

465
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,754
You're so attractive!

466
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,630
Just as running water lasting forever!

467
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,665
My admiration to you...

468
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,106
Don't keep looking at my penis. OK?

469
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,534
Yes...

470
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,234
Ta-Jen! I've got something
interesting for you!

471
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,079
Don't waste our youth fruitlessly!

472
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,613
Erotic grandma and father-in-law!

473
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,478
Erotic balloon-guitar, Trumpet!

474
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,750
Ta-Jen! These three things are,

475
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,483
the worst things in the world!

476
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,222
Took a look at me, boy!

477
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:31,892
Wow! What's that?

478
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,192
It's "I love one match stick".

479
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,200
It's second only to
"Love match stick on".

480
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,736
Forget touching, even
smelling for a while will kill you!

481
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,635
Really!
Try!

482
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,740
What will happen after I smell it?

483
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,776
Think about the name!
After you smell it.

484
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,934
You'll have special sexual desire,

485
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,877
for sticks or bars.

486
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,481
You'll keep running after them for kisses.

487
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,448
No matter how hard you try to go
against him or humiliate him.

488
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,952
Or hit him!

489
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,418
He'll still go on forever!

490
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,247
Ta-Jen! Is there anyway we can help?

491
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,555
Simple!
I just have to spray medicine on it,

492
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,925
then it'll be OK!

493
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,766
Ta-Jen Wei! I think Miss Ah-Ko.

494
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,994
Won't be able to get away from you!

495
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,064
Ah-Ko. Why don't you let me go?

496
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,435
No! My master will scold me for that!

497
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,033
Why don't you go with me?

498
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,404
How dare you say this?

499
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,045
I'm telling you my true feeling.

500
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,609
The day when I first saw you.

501
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,115
I just fell in love with you.

502
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,546
But I just have no chance
to confess to you.

503
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,548
So why did you marry the princess?

504
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,585
That's my father's conspiracy!

505
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,926
After overthrowing
the Ching Empire, he'll be the emperor.

506
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,729
I'll be the prince!
My wife the princess!

507
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,064
Maybe she'll be the queen very soon!

508
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,927
Why do you have to tell me this?

509
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,396
Don't you understand my love to you?

510
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,098
You're the only woman in my heart!

511
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,803
Only you are qualified to be my wife!

512
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,682
Sister! Did the son of bitch
play any tricks on you?

513
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,651
He won't succeed!

514
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:38,950
Yes! You're right!

515
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,685
Two words are written here...

516
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,963
Disgusting! Did you do this?

517
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,057
You'd better pray for yourself!

518
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:51,965
He!

519
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,801
Sister! Tell me what that means!
Because I can't read!

520
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,168
"Don't move"! I wrote it to him.

521
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,476
Sister! I'm afraid you're tired, too!

522
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,175
Come here! Take a seat first!

523
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,416
Thank you.

524
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,716
Master! You...
Why?

525
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,453
Are you OK?

526
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:19,324
I'm fine! I just cured my
internal injuries by myself!

527
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,888
No! Are you really OK?

528
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,792
Shut up! Go out now!

529
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,832
We've something to talk about!

530
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,196
Don't go now!

531
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,536
Master! What do you want?

532
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,368
Can you really make sure
no one was following us?

533
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,072
I'm sure!

534
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,105
Now you may leave here!
Okay.

535
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,021
What's wrong?

536
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,282
The divine nun got shot by
"I love a match stick".

537
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,431
I'm a girl. Who does she chase me?

538
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,996
Because you look like a stick!

539
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,006
Master!

540
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,541
Let's go away now!

541
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,104
Sister! If you go away,
master will blame you for this!

542
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,050
Go with me! I will treat you well!

543
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,259
Come.

544
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,432
Welcome!

545
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,904
Old nun! Hand over Wei-Shou-Bou
and the Crown Prince!

546
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,877
Get out or I'll rush in now!

547
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,910
Who are they?

548
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,881
Who are they?
You go out first! Stop them!

549
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,857
Hu-Fa! Go away!

550
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,134
Let's get Wei-hou-Bou!

551
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,399
Why do they want me?

552
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,643
What do you want?

553
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,245
Ta-Jen Wei!
Don't look at me that way.

554
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,246
My respect to you is like
running water lasting forever.

555
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,119
Like the overflowing yellow river!

556
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,519
You have no spirit of justice
and loyalty to friends.

557
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,949
No! Ta-Jen Wei!

558
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,682
For only one man to die alone is
better than two men dying together.

559
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,192
I'll give you respect after you die.

560
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,429
Founder! Let's attack her!
You are here!

561
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,167
Why do you dress up like a girl?
Sissy!

562
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,897
How dare you!
Why don't you kneel down!

563
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,966
You don't have to dress up as a girl!

564
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,445
Wei-Shou-Bou!
I said I'll come back again!

565
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,689
Don't you remember me!
Divine Dragon Gang-Divine Virgin.

566
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,349
Did you have an operation!

567
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,225
Actually I'm a woman!

568
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,724
Now you look better!
Better than before, right?

569
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:11,598
Yes...

570
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,601
Since we all know each other.

571
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,227
Why don't we just make everything clear.
Then it'll be OK!

572
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,566
Duo Long! Let's go!

573
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,601
Master! You know each other.
But I don't know you.

574
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,899
Founder! Let's go first!

575
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,102
Wow! You're really cruel!

576
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,244
Nothing special! Bye!

577
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,612
Where's the old nun and the Crown Prince?

578
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,549
Yes! Let's go for here! She's up there!

579
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,882
You go for her!

580
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,727
What a big one!

581
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,878
Shut up or I'll cut off your tongue.

582
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,953
The tongue is the thing I use to make
a living. Do you want me to die?

583
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,086
If you want to go,
I'll cut off your feet!

584
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,756
You want to hit Divine Nun and you
want to cut off my body parts.

585
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,629
So who are you helping indeed?

586
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,896
What's between you
and me is personal feud.

587
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,798
You spoiled my plan in the court and
even tried to kill me.

588
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,778
It's the emperor who wanted
to shoot you. Not me!

589
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,644
If you want to avenge yourself.

590
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,182
Go for the Emperor.
None of my business!

591
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,215
Come here!

592
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,444
I'm coming!

593
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,046
I shouldn't say that! Sorry!
May I help you?

594
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,281
Help me up!

595
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,749
What are you doing?

596
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:17,884
Helping you up!

597
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,865
Nice smell!

598
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,374
You're even angry at my nice smell!
Do you favor awful smell?

599
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,002
If you can help me go back
to the Divine Dragon Gang.

600
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,909
Maybe I won't kill you.

601
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,716
Thanks! Come on!

602
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,555
I know! Wu-Sun-Gwei's
getting involved with you.

603
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,490
The Ping Shi Ruler helps our Gang a lot!

604
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,195
How do you know that?

605
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,527
None of your business!
My master told me that.

606
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,996
How about if your master
fooled you?

607
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,094
What do you mean?

608
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,138
I mean maybe she was cheating you!

609
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,567
Will you cheat your father?

610
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,610
Yes! But it depends on whether
I can gain profit or not!

611
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,744
How about if you can get profit?

612
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,041
Then I'll fool him around!

613
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:10,944
Shameless!

614
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,378
Bitch! Sooner or later I'll fuck you!

615
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,317
What did you say? Hurry up!

616
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,059
Hi... Look! This is a brown pig!

617
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,890
That's a donkey!

618
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,724
A dog which can bark!

619
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,938
What are you doing!

620
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,244
Founder! Ping-Shi Leader's son
and his ambassador.

621
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,749
Feng-Shi-Fan have been
waiting for a while!

622
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:22,745
Let them in!

623
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,990
Founder! Thanks for
your help at the inn.

624
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,387
Its due to you that I escaped alive.

625
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,788
Are you saying that
I can't beat the old nun?

626
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,861
Don't be so serious!
My father is going to rise an army.

627
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,402
He appreciates that
Divine Dragon Gang helps us,

628
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,304
to train people
and contributes to us lot.

629
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,268
So he wants us to
give this wine to you.

630
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,870
And name you
"Hu-Kwo-Shen-Neu".

631
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,674
Thanks!

632
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,073
Give the wine!

633
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,590
I was getting involved with something
important; I can't go there.

634
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,255
I do appreciate your help! Cheers!

635
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,094
Something's wrong.

636
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,002
You can really hold your wine.

637
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,265
I've heard that your Divine Dragon
Virgin Kung Fu,

638
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,308
has lasted from generation to generation.
It's vulnerable to all kinds of poison.

639
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,876
I wonder if it's true or not!

640
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,606
Don't mention that Virgin Wu-Kung.
It's nothing.

641
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,740
I also want to know
if this Wu Kung can defeat,

642
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,184
the strongest poison,
Chi-ln-Ho-Hwang-Sun.

643
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,116
Feng-Shi-Fan.
What do you mean by that?

644
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,653
Our leader is already unhappy about,

645
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,387
your Divine-Dragon gang's
bullying behavior.

646
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,691
He ordered me to root out the gang.

647
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,024
Catch them!

648
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,467
Do you think you can
make me surrender?

649
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,145
Before you came back, we already attacked
and occupied Divine Dragon Gang base.

650
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,953
Now all the people are loyal to us.

651
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,182
Those who refused to
surrender were all killed.

652
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,020
Dragon! I traveled everywhere
just to find this,

653
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,099
"Chi-ln-Ho-Hwang-Sun"
It will can defeat your Kung Fu.

654
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,535
I put it in the wine.
Now do you feel hot?

655
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,010
You have to make love to
a man before the day dawns.

656
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,737
Otherwise, your whole body
will eject blood and then you'll die.

657
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,877
Maybe heaven
can do you a favor!

658
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,283
Founder! We're here to help you!

659
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,020
Master! Your Wu-Kung
is high enough.

660
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,460
So why don't you give me
eight tenth of the Kung-Li.

661
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,497
Crown princess! You...
Am I wrong?

662
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,739
Go! Please!
Hurry up! Go away!

663
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,851
"Divine Dragon Shueh Dun Da Fa".

664
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,433
You look OK!
Do you want to buy us a snack?

665
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,602
What happened? You!

666
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,807
I used my last natural strength
to pass my power,

667
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,678
Now the strength is bumping
around in my heart.

668
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,112
Let me scrub your breast!
Come here!

669
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,481
Don't touch me! Go away!

670
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,644
Who cares!

671
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,414
Big watermelon! You told me you will
fool your father around.

672
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:51,289
To make a profit.

673
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,487
I am the only person you can trust!

674
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,022
Don't go!

675
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,726
I don't like him!
But his words make sense!

676
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,768
My gang was so loyal
to the Ping Shi Ruler,

677
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,803
but they still eliminated
all of my people.

678
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,343
Is this my fate to die here!

679
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,087
Cha-Bau-U?

680
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,561
Come here!

681
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,459
What for? Ask me to go
and come back again!

682
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,896
What do you want?
Make it clear!

683
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,465
Come over here!

684
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,062
Does she want to
kill time with me?

685
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,469
Am I blessed or what?

686
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,079
Spider monster!

687
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,553
Help!

688
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:18,471
Wei-Shou-Bou,
perhaps this is God's will.

689
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:23,486
I won't forgive you
if you treat me badly.

690
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,223
You've woken up.
I haven't slept.

691
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,761
Bou, I'm your woman now.

692
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:40,133
I'll listen to you from now on.

693
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,229
Get my pants for me.

694
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,932
Good girl.

695
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:50,808
It's dawns!

696
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,843
Bou, come here.

697
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,178
What?

698
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:01,922
I heard people say
Wu Sun Gwei was a big hero.

699
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,624
Now I realize it's not true.

700
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,032
Now I realize you're so beautiful!

701
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,129
I'm hungry! I want to eat now!

702
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:20,838
What's wrong?

703
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:24,470
You have eight-tenth of my Kung Li.
No one can beat you!

704
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:27,716
Do I really have
the greatest Wu Kung?

705
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,117
Only a virgin can have
the greatest Wu Kung?

706
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:36,519
Once she loser her virginity,
her Kung Li will be,

707
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,621
transferred into the man's body. Now I
only have two tenths of my Kung Li!

708
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:44,090
I don't believe it! Would you mind
if I give you two fists?

709
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,130
I'm joking! I won't!

710
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,531
After we're been together,
you become royal King of my Gang.

711
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,540
You have responsibility
to avenge me!

712
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:52,607
Against whom?

713
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,467
Wu-Sun-Gwei and Feng-Shi-Fan!

714
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,241
Even if you didn't tell me,
I'll still mess them around!

715
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:12,821
Ta-Jen Wei!

716
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,862
Why are you crying?
Tell me now or I'll kill you.

717
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,693
Princess! Ta-Jen Wei is
my only good friend.

718
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:26,135
Our brotherhood is just like the
running water lasting forever!

719
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,277
That night...
What happened that night?

720
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,438
I fought 100 people at the same time,
but I couldn't even help him them.

721
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,713
That evil woman caught him.
Then, caught his left hand by her

722
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:36,810
right one and his right foot,
by her right hand.

723
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,218
She twisted his head.

724
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,051
Did he die then?
Yes!

725
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:49,199
Your words just make me realize that!

726
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:59,700
I was frightened out of
my wits and lost my soul!

727
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,802
Why is the princess so enthusiastic
about singing suddenly?

728
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:07,483
You don't understand!
Only Wei and I do.

729
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,417
Princess! It doesn't matter
if you do or not!

730
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:17,350
Only if they're the hips of Ta-Jen Wei,
I'll be so willing to wipe them.

731
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:23,931
Not necessary. Someone will do that
definitely! You may leave now!

732
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,558
Yes! Princess!

733
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,403
Ta-Jen Duo!

734
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,102
Forego formalities!
Thanks!

735
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,576
Ta-Jen Duo, I'll have a party in my
official residence tonight.

736
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,047
I hope Princess and Ta-Jen will grace
our place with your presence.

737
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,446
Since Ta-Jen Wei suffered
from such a misfortune

738
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:43,952
we've no appetite.
So pay us in cash.

739
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,347
Yes, sir!

740
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,788
Besides. Ta-Jen Wei served his
fatherland with unreserved loyalty.

741
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,416
We have to give him a
glorious funeral ceremony.

742
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,359
With a gilded coffin,
golden clothes, and a gold basin.

743
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,797
Yes! I'll ask the best
gold smiths to make them.

744
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,995
Forget about it! Pay the cash!

745
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,162
Besides, he liked beautiful girls
when he was alive.

746
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,532
Maybe he'll appear in my dream.
I don't know "Who",

747
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,938
I can find to be his company. So select
10 beautiful girls to sleep with me.

748
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,475
Ta-Jen Duo is very considerate!

749
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,638
If Ta-Jen Wei knew this,
he would feel touched.

750
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:13,513
Sure! I'm such a straight-forward
and virtuous person,

751
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,610
it's really a dilemma for me to sleep
with a dozen beauties.

752
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,480
What are you doing?

753
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,217
Nothing!

754
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:32,867
National humiliation
makes my heart sorrowful!

755
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,195
The hatred is as deep
as the sea! Unforgettable!

756
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,375
Fulfill my dream!

757
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,912
Ta-Jen Wei! You didn't die?
Thank Heaven!

758
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,057
I really saw my dream come true!

759
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,683
How could I give up my life
having such a friend like you?

760
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,389
Yes! Yes!

761
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,463
Duo-Long! You are a good friend!

762
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,133
Ta-Jen Wei!
I suffered from insomnia and,

763
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,833
my eyes dripped until dawn
after I tied you up that day.

764
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,837
I always remember two characters.

765
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,643
I even engraved them on my
arms to remind myself.

766
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,647
That serious! Which 2 characters?

767
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,477
You may take a look yourself.

768
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,251
Revenge!

769
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:24,984
Yes!

770
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,147
I didn't receive a lot of education!
I'm wondering if I misspelled the word.

771
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,518
Seem's all right.

772
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,057
These are the characters that I keep
thinking of day and night.

773
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,627
To "revenge" for you.

774
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,624
Wow! You're still bleeding!

775
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,562
Did you just engrave it?

776
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,068
No! I engraved it a long time ago.

777
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,864
But every time I get excited,
it just starts bleeding.

778
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:42,961
Since I see you now.

779
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,302
How can I not bleed?

780
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,576
So why do you carry a the knife with you?

781
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:51,747
Why do I have the knife?
Who... who put it here?

782
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,478
Duo Long! You're my good brother.

783
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,415
You didn't forget I burned the paper
money for you. I'll forgive you.

784
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,418
Thanks for your kindness.

785
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,654
Do you mind if I tell
you one more secret?

786
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,084
Tell me a secret?

787
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,321
Actually, I am the man sent by
the emperor to spy on the Tien-Di Gang.

788
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,892
The plan is to get close
to Cheng-Ging-Nang.

789
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,128
According to my information.
The organization is nationwide.

790
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,261
They even have
a branch in Nathan Road.

791
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,304
Really?

792
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,908
So. I want you to do me a favor!

793
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:21,609
Me?

794
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,680
You run into the street, and say the
password when you see a fat woman.

795
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,215
Then someone will take you
into a branch of Tien-Di-Gang!

796
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,282
What's the password?

797
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,613
"Against Ching Dynasty
to recover Ming Dynasty".

798
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,951
How can I say such
a traitorous password?

799
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,386
In Rome do as the Romans do!

800
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,960
I'll engrave a special password
on your back.

801
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,259
Anything else?

802
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,194
Sure? After you get there,

803
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,095
you'll see a man who dresses up
like a Ching official.

804
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,566
That's Cheng-Ging-Nang.

805
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,264
You show him the password on
your back. He'll give you one thing.

806
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,498
What's that?

807
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,472
A secret!

808
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,441
Shut up! I'm singing!

809
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,501
Princess! It's me!

810
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,684
Against Ching to recover Ming!

811
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:12,884
Against Ching to recover Ming!

812
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:17,990
Against Ching to recover Ming!

813
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,237
Weird!

814
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,813
A branch of Tien-Di Gang!
So brave?

815
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,555
Wow! Marvelous!

816
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,688
How come Wei-Shou-Bou
is in Kun Ming now?

817
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,964
This man is very cunning.
You can't underestimate him.

818
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,465
Father! Wei-Shou-Bou has
humiliated me several times.

819
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,337
If I don't torture him to death,
I can't feel satisfied.

820
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:03,405
Are you crazy! Now he's
the Imperial Inspector General.

821
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,306
Killing him is the same as rebellion!

822
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,951
Besides it'll take us one month
to get provisions and fodder ready!

823
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:13,646
How can we ruin our plan just
because of a little personal grudge?

824
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,891
Yes! Crown Princess!
After we invade the city,

825
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,021
it's just be little effort for us
to mince Wei Shou Bou into pork buns.

826
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,827
You don't have to rush!

827
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,764
Moreover, you're the imperial son-in-law.

828
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,894
You should go to see the princess
when you have free time.

829
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,839
And we'll pretend to arrange
a wedding ceremony.

830
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,435
It will make that damned
Kang Hsi think,

831
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,535
that we're still loyal to him!
Do you understand?

832
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,873
Yes! I do.

833
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,949
There are agents from Kwang Tong.
To discuss the war with me.

834
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,875
I don't want to have
so many people here.

835
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,146
Evacuate all the soldiers
into the back garden.

836
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,220
Yes!

837
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,701
Just hang the sign here?
What reckless behavior!

838
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:11,941
The door is open wide! No wonder
why they can't beat us!

839
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:18,621
"Against the Ching Dynasty to
recover the Ming Dynasty".

840
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,019
Who is talking nonsense?

841
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,419
"Against the Ching Dynasty to
recover the Ming Dynasty"

842
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,787
Who have the guts to say that?

843
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:29,791
Who are you?

844
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,558
A perfect disguise! Just like
an important Ching's official.

845
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,398
Are you a spy? Password!

846
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,902
What password?

847
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,403
"Against Ching to
recover Ming Dynasty".

848
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,572
How dare you! Someone's coming!

849
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,377
Hi... We're with the same circle!
I have the password! Look!

850
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:50,016
"Against Ching to recover Ming!
Vow to kill Wu-Sun-Gwei".

851
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,750
Now you know who I am!

852
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,352
Go take a crap!

853
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,850
Son of bitch! I have the password!

854
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:01,123
Son of bitch! Someone's coming!
We've an assassin!

855
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,130
How dare you hit me!

856
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,497
How dare you hit me! How dare you?

857
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,237
We've an assassin

858
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,678
So you thought my kung-fu was bad?

859
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:20,942
Get me now.

860
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:21,982
Hit him for me.

861
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,188
Against Ching to
recover Ming Dynasty?

862
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,154
Smash him until
no one can recognize who he is!

863
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,955
Against Ching to recover Ming...

864
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,084
Wang Yeh!

865
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,528
The princess is coming
accompanied by Ta-Jen Wei.

866
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,034
I'm sorry that I didn't
welcome you earlier.

867
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:49,568
Stand up.

868
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,244
The princess will soon be
Wang Yeh's daughter-in-law!

869
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:55,650
What's wrong with your eyes?

870
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,177
My eyes got hurt by accident.

871
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,486
Tell my son to come here!

872
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:05,356
Help! Help!

873
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,590
May I have your surname?

874
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,631
Ta-Jen! It's me! Duo Long!

875
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,597
Go take a crap! Duo Long
isn't as handsome as you.

876
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,196
Confine the traitor to the stone room!

877
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,700
Yes.
Ta-Jen Wei.

878
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:15,634
Of course!

879
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,331
We even bought stewed meat
and had fun with whores.

880
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,532
Are you really Duo Long?
Yes!

881
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,870
He ran into my Ping-Shi Palace.

882
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,104
And shouted "Against Ching
to recover Ming".

883
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,178
He's a traitor!

884
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,873
Wait! He's really Duo Long!

885
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,816
Wang Yeh! Why did you hit
the imperial official?

886
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:28,781
Yes!

887
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,281
He's an official of imperial court?
Yes! I am.

888
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,319
But even if you're an imperial official,

889
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,586
you still have to be decapitated.

890
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:38,426
But he has no reason to against the
Ching Empire! He's a Manchu.

891
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,154
So he's going against his tribe!
Yes...

892
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,290
Duo Long! Have you been wronged?

893
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,061
Yes! Ta-Jen! I'm wrong!

894
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,159
You're telling a lie!
Take a look at his back!

895
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,596
Let me see!

896
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,511
Nothing! A spot! It's dirty!

897
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,750
You wiped it! I did see a tattoo!

898
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,080
"Against Ching to recover Ming".
"Vow to kill Wu-Sun-Gwei!".

899
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,552
Wang Yeh! Are you accusing
me of telling a lie, too?

900
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,421
Shou Bou. How can you be
so rude to Wang Yeh!

901
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,491
Yes!

902
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,292
Wang Yeh! Let me be the judge!

903
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,228
It's my pleasure!

904
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:18,330
I say it's you fault!

905
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:20,902
Duo Long is the Imperial
Inspector General!

906
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,005
He is responsible to protect me
on the journey with the,

907
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,275
Shan Fong Sword. Now he's
going to teach you a lesson,

908
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,275
with this Shan Fong Sword
bestowed by the emperor.

909
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,338
I can't help you, either,

910
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,381
Yes!

911
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,046
Which son of bitch hit me?

912
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,280
Don't be so rushed...

913
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:40,550
You hit me.

914
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,150
Duo Long!

915
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,717
You just decapitated the man
who insulted you!

916
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,559
Its you
Don't act foolishly!

917
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,960
I am going to kill you.

918
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,327
Tablet of death amnesty is here!

919
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,600
Even if you have the sword.
You can't kill me!

920
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,033
Dad! Don't you remember the tablet?

921
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,342
Tablet of death amnesty...

922
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:02,637
Tablet of death amnesty?

923
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,577
Oh! I almost forget about that tablet
bestowed by the late emperor.

924
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:10,112
Now you can't threat me!

925
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:12,520
Can't I?

926
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,351
Of course you can't kill
a man with that tablet!

927
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,119
But those who don't have the tablet...

928
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,323
Father! Would you lend it
to me for a while?

929
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:21,591
Give it to me!

930
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,266
You run fast, so you go first. I can't.

931
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:27,064
No! You're the Ping-Shi Ruler!
He doesn't dare to kill you.

932
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:28,729
No! I must take the tablet
with me at the same time.

933
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,136
No! No!

934
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:31,270
Mine! Return it to me!

935
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:33,000
Stop! Who should I chop first?

936
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,575
Give it to me...

937
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,146
You don't have the tablet!
You did enjoy beating me a lot!

938
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,076
Give it back to me!

939
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,251
Give me that!

940
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,921
Give it to me...
To me...

941
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,360
Where is it?
Where?

942
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,626
It's here!

943
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,030
Hi! I have it!

944
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,843
Sorry...

945
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:10,743
Son! What's wrong with you?

946
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,117
Husband! What's wrong?
Yes!

947
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,244
Take him to rest.
Yes!

948
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:23,949
Let me see what happened
to the Imperial Son-in-law.

949
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,494
It's OK now! You may leave now!
Yes!

950
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,406
Husband! Are you ok?

951
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,600
It's painful!

952
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,168
Painful! So why don't you just
let me take a look at you?

953
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,611
It's embarrassing.

954
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:49,709
Don't be silly! We'll be a couple!
Why do you still say that?

955
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,959
Don't act recklessly! I've the tablet!

956
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,460
Don't rush!

957
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,459
Leader Duo! Men aren't perfect!
We can't change the reality.

958
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:04,966
You just pay him some money?
OK!

959
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,696
He's not seriously hurt, anyway! Well
I'll pay 500 thousand taels to him.

960
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:08,896
What did you say?

961
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,802
Nothing! Go on!

962
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,205
Come on! OK! I'll pay!

963
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,152
Gilded Knife! Jade Stamp!

964
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,584
This... No! This is...

965
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,180
Wu-Sun-Gewi! It's your fate!

966
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,055
Against Ching to ascend the throne!

967
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:32,525
Gilded Knife and jade stamp
can testify to that!

968
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:35,463
Wang Yeh! You...

969
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,226
It's none of my business!
Someone blamed the crime on me!

970
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:39,834
I've never had the intention to
go against the Ching Empire!

971
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,063
Sorry!

972
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:49,270
It's terrible! I'm so scared!

973
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,709
Son!
Princess!

974
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:53,846
Son! What's wrong with you?

975
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,076
Princess! What did you do?

976
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,708
He... He wanted to rape me!

977
01:00:56,887 --> 01:01:01,483
So I just used the knife to cut him!

978
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,559
Son! The princess will
marry you sooner or later.

979
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,423
Why are you so rushed at this moment?

980
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,725
Now you make a mess like this.
How can I make an excuse?

981
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,391
I'm scared!

982
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:12,533
You...

983
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:13,432
Well done!

984
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,037
I learn from you!

985
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:17,962
Some one's coming!

986
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,072
Wang Yeh! What's the matter?

987
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,077
The princess is in shock!
Send her back to Phoenix Villa.

988
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,874
Yes!
I'm so scared!

989
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:28,483
Ta-Jen Wei!
I'm sorry for all of these things.

990
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,980
Please forgive me!

991
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,721
So many things that aren't
supposed to happen, happened today.

992
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,015
I couldn't know what
to do if I were to go!

993
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:37,623
Princess! Let's go now.

994
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:42,288
I'm so scared...

995
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,327
Master! Your son has fainted!

996
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,565
Tell Mr. Feng to come back now.
Yes!

997
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,365
Tell all the army to be on the alert! Go!
Yes!

998
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,900
Wang Yeh!

999
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:52,905
How's my son?

1000
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,343
The crown princess is ok now!
But his penis is seriously hurt.

1001
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,346
I'm afraid he won't be able
to have children!

1002
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:02,250
Ridiculous! How dare Kang Shi.

1003
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,916
Send his sister and Wei-Shou-Bou
to cut off my family line.

1004
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:11,989
I'll take revenge! Gather all the troops!
I want to fight them now!

1005
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:15,726
Don't be angry!
We're not prepared yet.

1006
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,557
If you open fire so recklessly,
I don't think we can win.

1007
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,928
Keep cool! After six months...

1008
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,368
I'll say open the fire!

1009
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,434
I'm the leader.
Do you want to go against me?

1010
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,804
No! I don't dare!

1011
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,871
Tomorrow Surround the Phoenix Villa
with troops and horses.

1012
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:35,340
Torture the damned couple to death!

1013
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,847
Falling flowers in the air.
Moon light so bright!

1014
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,050
A glass of wine on the Phoenix table.

1015
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,950
So romantic!

1016
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,359
My royal highness. Please drink!

1017
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:57,568
You curry favors and flatter all
the time! What's the matter?

1018
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,734
Princess! Your suspicions
are unnecessary.

1019
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,470
I just want to introduce you to a girl.

1020
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,373
Dragon!

1021
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,261
So that's the style you favor!
Don't touch me from now on!

1022
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,454
Come on! She's a girl.

1023
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,032
You're sister now. Be happy!

1024
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,364
Don't even dream about that!

1025
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,904
Who does she think she is? Does she
want to take my husband away!

1026
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:31,973
No way!

1027
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,405
Of course not!

1028
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,137
You only have one fourth of me!

1029
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,449
I was already suspicious that
you'd had love affairs with them.

1030
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,677
It's common for a big man
to have 3 or 4 wives.

1031
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,152
So far I only have 3 wives
and one concubine!

1032
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,222
Shame on you!

1033
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,449
Don't keep dreaming!

1034
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,583
How dare they want to enjoy
the same thing as me?

1035
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,558
No way! Never!

1036
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,630
They are my wives,
and you're my concubine!

1037
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,131
When they have a seat
you must stand up.

1038
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,293
When we sleep, you've
to cover the quilts for us.

1039
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,494
You're dreaming!

1040
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,136
Didn't we have a deal that
you can't smash my face?

1041
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:05,239
Who cares!

1042
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,867
It's really bad for
a concubine to hit you.

1043
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,239
Dear sisters! Give her a lesson!

1044
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,417
Wait! How dare you?

1045
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,554
Yeah! This is Wei's Child

1046
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,819
Hit it! Please! Hurry!

1047
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,992
Of course you can't hit
my flesh and blood!

1048
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,723
But you can just hit her breast!

1049
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,592
Help...

1050
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:37,138
Princess! Don't be afraid!
I'm here to protect you.

1051
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,367
They abuse me!

1052
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:42,605
Duo Long! My fist is called
"Divine Dragon Dismemberment"!

1053
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:45,039
After you're attacked, your body
will be dismembered.

1054
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,512
If you want to try.
Please hold on a moment!

1055
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,377
I'll count to 3!
Hit him!

1056
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,854
One...

1057
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,822
Wow! When did you
learn Kung-fu?

1058
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,022
Do you still want to be a concubine?

1059
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,495
Can I be a wife?

1060
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,427
OK! You may call me
big sister from now on!

1061
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,594
They're the second and third sisters!

1062
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,430
I'll give you a name Dai-Tsi!

1063
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,541
Hope you can deliver
a son for my husband!

1064
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,202
"Dai Tsi" sounds awful!

1065
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:16,642
So how about if I
call you "Wu-Yu-Tsi"?

1066
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,713
"Wu-Yu-Tsi"? It sounds better!

1067
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,009
Do you eat dinner so early?

1068
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:22,478
Master!

1069
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,846
General Leader!

1070
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,014
Master! Let me introduce
you to the Dragon!

1071
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:31,088
This is the leader of the Divine Dragon
gang! Now she's my sweet heart!

1072
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,253
You Know Da Swan
and Shau Swan, right?

1073
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,363
This is Wu-Yu-Tsi!
Come in and take a seat!

1074
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,598
I heart that Feng-Shi-Fan
is serving Wu-Sun-Gwei.

1075
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,034
The man has a very cunning nature.
And his Wu Kung is better than mine.

1076
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,061
I'm afraid you can't handle him.

1077
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,935
I haven't seen him yet!

1078
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,336
But I've followed your instruction,

1079
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,571
to cause a great disturbance
at Wu-Sun-Gwei's palace!

1080
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,204
I'm sure he'll rise up against
the Ching Empire soon.

1081
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,807
I'm sure of it! He's been here tonight!

1082
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,720
And he'll catch you
at home and peel your skin!

1083
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,491
He's stirring us up with these
sensational statements! I'm not scared!

1084
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,026
Duo Long! Prepare a
fast horse for me. I'm leaving!

1085
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,159
I think they'll rise up now.

1086
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,789
Especially now, they'll have
Princess to as a hostage.

1087
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:11,832
What should we do?

1088
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,096
Show Bou. Let's evacuate now!
Get away from Kun-Ming.

1089
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,602
Leader! I'll listen to your plan!

1090
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:25,611
Shou Bou! Take care! At least
you'd take care of one of your wives.

1091
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,483
Don't worry! I'll take care of
all of them! You go first!

1092
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,892
Shou Bou! You'd better go with
Dragon first. I'll follow you!

1093
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:41,995
Master!

1094
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:46,398
Shou Bou! You're smart and
can adapt yourself quickly.

1095
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,968
If you don't desire
honor and wealth,

1096
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:50,869
I'm sure you'll overthrow the Ching
emperor and recover our fatherland!

1097
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:52,668
Yes! Master!

1098
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:55,367
But I really have a question.

1099
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:56,443
Go on!

1100
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,574
After Kang Hsi ascended the throne,
it's been very prosperous and peaceful.

1101
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,683
Especially after the death of Ou-Bei.

1102
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,444
All the people lead a good life.

1103
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,316
Why do you still want
to over throw him.

1104
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,912
Because it's my dream.

1105
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,520
I see!

1106
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,987
But if you want to overthrow him

1107
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,724
just to fulfil your dream.

1108
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,027
Don't you feel it's kind of...

1109
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,557
This is not the time for an argument.

1110
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,734
You stubborn old man! Even your
disciple won't submit willingly.

1111
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:26,398
Feng Shi Fan! Get back!

1112
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,558
Brother! Long time no see!
I'm surprised you're now a lackey.

1113
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,699
Being a lackey of the rich is better
than being a poor man!

1114
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,329
Can't you understand this?

1115
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,566
You're shameless!

1116
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,540
"The Grand Transposition"

1117
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,180
Where's your Kung Li gone?
Who did you give it to?

1118
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,186
Young boy! How dare
you hit her? I'm here!

1119
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,328
Do you want to kill me
with that circle?

1120
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,631
Wow! Do you have more?

1121
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,502
I don't want to play any more!

1122
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,813
Wow! Is that great?

1123
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:46,284
How come?

1124
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,287
You've very strong natural strength!
But it's so wild that, I can't control.

1125
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,485
So she gave her Kung Li to you!

1126
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:54,359
So what?

1127
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,364
Shou Bou! Dragon's hurt!
Take her away!

1128
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,356
Master! Can you handle it by yourself?

1129
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,829
If even you can make it. Why can't I?

1130
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,368
Yeah! Go!

1131
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:02,934
Sword Style!

1132
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:04,631
"The Grand Transposition"

1133
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,499
Brother! You used to make disparaging
comments to our master.

1134
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,772
That's why I was driven out by
him. Now it's your turn for retribution.

1135
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,075
The master asked me to do it.

1136
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,240
I'm so sorry I didn't
kill you at that time.

1137
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,782
So now you can just blame me
for your foolishness.

1138
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,590
Brother! I'm surprised you lost today!

1139
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,389
Shut up! If you want to kill me,
do it now!

1140
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,452
I'm reluctant to kill you!
With your help,

1141
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,621
I can get fame and property!

1142
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:44,000
Dragon! Are you OK?

1143
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,033
Are you all right?

1144
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,801
I'm fine!

1145
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:56,210
Shou-Bou! I didn't hurt you seriously!
Why are you so sad?

1146
01:10:56,686 --> 01:11:00,178
I have many passions!
It's my shortcoming.

1147
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:03,019
Shou-Bou! Don't be silly!

1148
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,057
Actually! You've many merits!

1149
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,423
I have only one "longcoming".

1150
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:14,095
Please! Would you please notice
me first next time when you appear?

1151
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,870
Didn't you hear the sound "fit"?

1152
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,837
Mr. Wei! She...

1153
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:21,838
She's my wife.

1154
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,411
Does she surrender to you, too?

1155
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,844
Hard to say! You monks
won't understand this!

1156
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,287
We common people can
never understand you!

1157
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,981
How did you catch them?

1158
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:40,518
Wu-Sun-Gwei was too busy
arranging the troops.

1159
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,096
Then, the traitor, Ah Ko
went in Ping-Shi Palace.

1160
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,029
So I just got her back.

1161
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,192
Also! I found the book,
42 Chapters Script!

1162
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:49,861
42 Chapters Script!

1163
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,065
You have the book with you?

1164
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:54,175
This book is very important
to our Reconstruction Plan.

1165
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,504
Thanks.

1166
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:57,640
Mr. Wei! Where are they?

1167
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,115
How should we deal with both of them?

1168
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,118
Everyone has the right to kill them!

1169
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,979
But if he's willing to redeem
sin by good deeds.

1170
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:09,819
I'll consider giving them the chance!

1171
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,621
You...
Thanks!

1172
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,924
Die first! It's you! Kill him!

1173
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:16,425
No! Forgive me, please!

1174
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:17,660
We decide to die together!

1175
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,424
You decide it! I didn't!

1176
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,902
Ta-Jen Wei! Please forgive me.

1177
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,130
I'll like to be a slave for all my life!

1178
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:24,867
Why are you so afraid of him?

1179
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,439
You said will never separate!

1180
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,910
I was joking! Are you serious?

1181
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,477
How can you say this to me?

1182
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,445
Now I'm a eunuch.
Why do you still want me?

1183
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:35,811
Don't get me involved!

1184
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,178
Why are you crying? Please...

1185
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,550
Get away! Son of bitch!

1186
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:44,416
Wow! How could you
say things like that?

1187
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:46,985
I've been good enough to you.
What do you want?

1188
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,688
He treats you like this,
but you treat him like that.

1189
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,163
What the hell do you want?

1190
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,757
Shou Bou. What are you talking about?

1191
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,769
Nothing? Why don't you
come home?

1192
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,632
I serve my wives in the morning
they serve me at night.

1193
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,537
You're lucky that Wei
gave shelter to you.

1194
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,804
Otherwise, I'd just kill you.

1195
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,512
You should thank Mr. Wei!

1196
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,245
Yeah! Thanks Mr. Wei!

1197
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,079
Thanks for not killing me!

1198
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,015
Shameless!

1199
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:14,619
Nasty!

1200
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,247
A good lesson!
You too!

1201
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,126
Although I hit you.
I feel pain in my heart.

1202
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,928
Another girl sacrificed!

1203
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,433
Come on! We're just making a living!

1204
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,166
Happiness lies in
giving help to others.

1205
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,206
Your Majesty!

1206
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,671
Stand up! Come on over here!

1207
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,179
Yes!

1208
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:45,150
I care so much about your Majesty!
How's everything going?

1209
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,921
Fine! Do you want to
tell me anything?

1210
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:51,549
Sure! The Ping Shi Ruler wants to
rise up against the Ching Empire.

1211
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,624
I think Your Majesty should
just punish him right away!

1212
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,492
Kill him before he
gets everything ready.

1213
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,360
I already opened fire two days ago!

1214
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,830
Your Majesty is so intelligent and able
to predict the future! I do admire you!

1215
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,906
You must feel strange
Why can I predict the future?

1216
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,100
Yes...

1217
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,073
I want to introduce
a new colleague to you.

1218
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,440
You've to cooperate together
and assist me.

1219
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:12,310
Who's that?

1220
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,309
You son of bitch!

1221
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,445
Shou Bou! Don't be so impolite!

1222
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:26,154
Your majesty! Duke Wei is a man who
doesn't bother with small matters.

1223
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:29,497
It's natural for him to say vulgar words.

1224
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,598
Duke Wei! Now we're both
loyal to Our Majesty.

1225
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:36,797
Please forgive me for
what I've done to you!

1226
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:40,805
What did you do to my master?

1227
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,844
Look at my clothes.
Can't you see?

1228
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,345
Did you take him to Your Majesty?

1229
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,213
Feng Shi Fan has already turn in
Wu's map of the troops to me.

1230
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:53,147
Also, he caught the head of
the Tien-Di Gang. Cheng Ging Nang.

1231
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:55,151
So you have to be friendly
to each other from now on!

1232
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,021
Yes!
OK!

1233
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,321
Shou Bou! That fake queen dowager
slandered you saying you're a traitor.

1234
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,528
I feel very sorry for that.

1235
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,634
I don't want you to be
under the suspicion.

1236
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,299
So I decided to send you to be the
supervisor of Chen's execution!

1237
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,135
Then people won't guess that you've
any relationship with Cheng!

1238
01:15:16,212 --> 01:15:17,406
How do you feel about it?

1239
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,382
I appreciate your kindness!

1240
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,885
After darling got back from the Palace.

1241
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,930
He looked very depressed!
I wonder what's wrong with him!

1242
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:37,927
Even you don't know. How can I?

1243
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,434
Hi! He favors you so much.
Do you have any idea?

1244
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:43,535
He never told me anything.
How would I know?

1245
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,536
My brother has been taking baths
by me from his childhood.

1246
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,300
I know everything about him.

1247
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,434
So he can never hide any secret!

1248
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:50,601
So what happened?

1249
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:54,247
I don't know!

1250
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,342
I used to do every thing
with the help of divine power.

1251
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,186
But I have no confidence at all today!

1252
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,456
Because the emperor
was on your side before!

1253
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:06,026
Now he helps Feng-Shi-Fong.

1254
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,121
So how can you be confident at all?

1255
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:14,897
42 chapters script.

1256
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:17,669
I've been reading the book
thousand of times.

1257
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,937
Burn it for me!

1258
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,541
Darling! Why do you want to do that?

1259
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,411
I'm going crazy!

1260
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,483
The princess is coming!

1261
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:34,753
Your Royal Highness!

1262
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,358
Your Royal Highness!
Stand up!

1263
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,053
Stand up! You may go now!
Yes!

1264
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,258
Big sister! The Second, third,

1265
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:48,893
and fourth sister!

1266
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,801
Wu-Yu-Tsi is paying respect to you!
Ok.

1267
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:51,904
Darling!

1268
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,235
What's the matter with you?
Wu-Yu-Tsi!

1269
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,539
My brother ordered the
highest general to watch you.

1270
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,612
If they feel anything wrong,
they'll surround us.

1271
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:00,247
Take care!

1272
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:01,815
It must be Feng-Shi-Fan!

1273
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,416
Why did he keep burning
for such a long time?

1274
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,419
I can see some words!

1275
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:13,017
East... Read the word!

1276
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:15,422
East Never fails!
He's coming back!

1277
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:16,930
The Mausoleum in the East Suburb!

1278
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,668
This part is fireproof.

1279
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,363
Can we find the secret there?

1280
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,001
I've a plan!

1281
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:30,077
Your Majesty!

1282
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:34,141
I wonder why Your Majesty
wanted me to be here so late!

1283
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:39,715
I've caught some today, but I want
to go hunting tomorrow.

1284
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,722
Would you like to go with me?

1285
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,291
Sure! It's my pleasure.

1286
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:48,689
OK! Give Feng clothes
and the Shan-Fong sword!

1287
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:54,334
Thanks!

1288
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,166
Feng! Don't forget!

1289
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,604
The sword can't leave the scabbard.
Once it's out of the scabbard,

1290
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,505
you have to see blood!

1291
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,071
I know!

1292
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,939
OK! See you tomorrow!

1293
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,378
I'm leaving!

1294
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:24,131
Master! I'm useless,
so you're tortured me so harshly.

1295
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,766
None of your business!
It's my own fault!

1296
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:31,336
I want to say good bye to you.
I played a trick on him.

1297
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:34,405
Tomorrow I will avenge you
at the hunting ground!

1298
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,574
Your Wu Kung can't
rival Feng-Shi-Fan's.

1299
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,270
Now I have eight-tenth of
Dragon's Kung Fu. Besides...

1300
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:41,248
You can't control Dragon's
natural strength!

1301
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,575
Feng has Liou Ho Boy to help him.

1302
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,151
His Wu Kung is matchless.

1303
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,746
I still want to try!

1304
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:50,414
Shou-Bou! Come over here!

1305
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,625
Master! What do you want?

1306
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,799
Why can't I see anyone here?

1307
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,465
Feng She Fong! You were fooled!

1308
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,305
Wei Shou Bou! Come out if
you've got the guts.

1309
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,639
Don't be a turtle!

1310
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,212
I'm here already!

1311
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,758
Wei! You inherited a woman's Kung Li.

1312
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,259
Now you're neither a male nor a female.

1313
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,421
Yes! I really favor you.

1314
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,831
I'm making underwear for you.

1315
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,201
You're really cruel!

1316
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,605
So cruel that you don't
even give the kids clothes!

1317
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,700
Come here! I'll give you
some clothes to wear!

1318
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,585
Liou Ho Ba Styles!

1319
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,684
Golden Snake Twisting Hand!

1320
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:51,445
Liou Ho child eating so much!

1321
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,206
It just fits!

1322
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:59,577
I used to respect you.

1323
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:02,020
But today I've got the Shan-Fong Sword.
I'm afraid it's too late,

1324
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:03,581
for you to feel regret.

1325
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,858
I've no time to play with you.
I want to see His Majesty.

1326
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,196
Our Majesty is here!

1327
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:13,633
Your Majesty!

1328
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,793
I want to go hunting tomorrow!

1329
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,038
I wonder if you'd like to go with me!

1330
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,606
You were in the study last night?

1331
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,105
Correct!

1332
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,806
Wei! We used not to interfere
with each other's affairs.

1333
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,075
But you just pushed me too hard!
Don't blame me for this.

1334
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,214
You son of bitch, traitor!

1335
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,084
You harmed my master! I'll kill you!

1336
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,421
Liou-Ho Divine Kung!

1337
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,104
No!
Sorry!

1338
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,298
That's ok!
I want to use the right Kung-fu.

1339
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,807
Stay cool over there?

1340
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,484
Liou Ho Divine Slapping!

1341
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:23,730
Marvelous!

1342
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,230
Wei-Shou-Bou. How did manage
such a huge improvement?

1343
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,934
Are you scared?

1344
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,979
Shou Bou. You're my only hope!

1345
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,074
You've all my skills & Kung Fu.

1346
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:40,618
From now on, you're the
General Leader of Tien-Di-Gang.

1347
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,883
You're crafty!

1348
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,483
Sure. Otherwise, how can I kill you?

1349
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,622
Wei! You expend all your
mental effort to crush me.

1350
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:53,132
But it's of no use.

1351
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,360
Spirit moving!

1352
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:08,544
Dragon claws!

1353
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:10,516
Crab...

1354
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:14,788
Scratch you son of bitch!

1355
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:18,256
Crab's Nippers!

1356
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:23,895
Hi! Can't you feel pain?

1357
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:25,856
Very relaxing! One more time!

1358
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,400
Bone melting slapping!

1359
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,269
I've got it! Game over!

1360
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,780
Liou-Ho-Da-Fa!

1361
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,377
Shou Bou! Needle & Thread.

1362
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,464
Shou Bou! Cold Ice Slapping!

1363
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,692
I've got it!

1364
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,073
I'm very good at playing this kind
of trick. Can you beat me?

1365
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:56,251
Shou Bou!

1366
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,424
Hi! Shou Bou!

1367
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,835
I didn't expect that I don't
have to work hard.

1368
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:15,602
The gold kept by Ching before now
has been changed into gold sand!

1369
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,075
They declared that the gold
was still buried for away!

1370
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,772
But it's here already!

1371
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:22,680
This is an underground mausoleum.

1372
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:26,413
Maybe the secret
of the book is here!

1373
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,978
This dragon wall was
designed by a master.

1374
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,052
It represents the geomancy
of the Ching Empire.

1375
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:33,253
Let's share this ourselves!

1376
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,657
I agree!
Didn't we work hard just for this?

1377
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,528
We can only be rich if
I have a little bit of that.

1378
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:39,089
Don't hit! What a big watermelon!

1379
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:40,293
Yes! You're right!

1380
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:41,358
OK!
Sure!

1381
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,764
I knew you'd do this!

1382
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,343
What did he step on?

1383
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:01,478
A machine!

1384
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:06,223
Go!

1385
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:20,838
You're bleeding!

1386
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,341
That's ok! His wound is more serious!

1387
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,613
You don't have to stab yourself like
this even though you're crazy!

1388
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:28,875
He's stimulating himself in the way
he stimulated the Liou-Ho child.

1389
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:32,617
To produce all of his potential energy
by covering his extra meridians.

1390
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:33,652
Does that work?

1391
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,623
Definitely! You must do your best
to catch the slapping.

1392
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:42,857
OK!

1393
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,079
Shou Bou!

1394
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,594
Shou Bou, are you ok?

1395
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,768
Dragon! Stick all your silver
needles into my hair.

1396
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,540
To produce all of my potential energy!

1397
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:28,973
I don't know the way he really used them.

1398
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,701
I know only one way.

1399
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:32,643
To exert our potential energy!

1400
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:33,911
What way?

1401
01:27:34,483 --> 01:27:35,381
Pain!

1402
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:36,911
Pain?

1403
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:40,082
I'll insert the needles into
your painful points.

1404
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,753
You must stop breathing.
Don't make any sound!

1405
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:44,314
You can only burst it out
at the last minute.

1406
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47,787
Bite my sandals!
Thanks!

1407
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:50,530
The first needle! Goki Wo Point!

1408
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:54,794
Bei Chei Point!

1409
01:27:58,073 --> 01:27:59,472
Da Chi Point!

1410
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:06,043
Open your mouth!

1411
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,950
Painful!

1412
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,204
I'm surprised it works so well!

1413
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,203
Shou Bou! You win! Marvelous!

1414
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,419
This fortune really kills people!

1415
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:47,887
I wonder how many people died for this?

1416
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:51,882
I decided to move it back home.

1417
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,484
So it won't be harmful to the world.

1418
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,460
Shou Bou! Smash the dragon wall.

1419
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,326
Then the Ching Empire
will go into demise.

1420
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:10,110
Why do we have to go against
the Ching Dynasty?

1421
01:29:10,312 --> 01:29:12,803
Now Kang Hsi is the ruler. Everyone
can go to school and make money!

1422
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:14,278
There's nothing wrong with that!

1423
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,183
What we care about is that whether
the ruler is qualified or not.

1424
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:22,119
Is that right? Dragon!

1425
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:24,719
Maybe!

1426
01:29:24,793 --> 01:29:27,284
OK! Now let's take Feng's body
back to the execution ground.

1427
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:28,656
Otherwise, we'll be late.

1428
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,021
Go!

1429
01:30:01,196 --> 01:30:02,094
Execution!

1430
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:13,899
Why aren't they here yet?

1431
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,002
We're coming!

1432
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:25,585
Master! I'm so happy you're OK!

1433
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,950
I know you're my good disciple!

1434
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,652
Darling! It's late! Let's go now!

1435
01:30:32,227 --> 01:30:35,128
If the emperor found out we swapped
the criminal, we'll have big trouble!

1436
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:38,198
Your Majesty!

1437
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,599
Put them away!

1438
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:45,131
I'll talk to him!

1439
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:48,267
Your Majesty!

1440
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,274
How daring you are!

1441
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:52,312
You killed my officer and took
the criminal away! What a crime!

1442
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:55,948
Duo Long! You...

1443
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:59,348
Ta-Jen Wei! You got it!
I betrayed you again!

1444
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:00,953
You can never change your bad nature!

1445
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,214
Yes!

1446
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:06,792
Your Majesty! To tell you the truth,

1447
01:31:07,529 --> 01:31:09,724
My Wu Kung is
the greatest in the world.

1448
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:13,063
I don't think any of you can
stop me from doing anything!

1449
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,032
Anything?

1450
01:31:14,169 --> 01:31:16,660
Yes! Including talking your head away!

1451
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:19,973
But I really can't figure out
any good excuse,

1452
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:22,566
to kill a good emperor like you.

1453
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:26,309
Please be kind enough to let us go!

1454
01:31:26,448 --> 01:31:28,939
Spare our lives! OK?

1455
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,186
Stand up!
Thanks! Your Majesty!

1456
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:40,121
Your Majesty! Here you come again!

1457
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:44,531
I've heard that your
Wu Kung is the greatest.

1458
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:49,202
I want to prove it! When I caught it.

1459
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,669
I really felt it was as hard as a stick.

1460
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,841
The traitor, Wei-Shou-Bou, has been
scratched to death by me.

1461
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,669
His body was disposed of in the wild
forest! All his companions have gone way!

1462
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:03,076
There's no Wei-Shou-Bou in the world.

1463
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:06,878
Treat my sister and my nephew well.

1464
01:32:07,956 --> 01:32:09,548
Thanks for you "scratching"!

1465
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:10,818
Don't let anyone abuse them!

1466
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:11,922
I know!

1467
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,390
We're always good friends.

1468
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:14,587
Agreed!

1469
01:32:14,663 --> 01:32:16,062
Take care!
Bye!

1470
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:20,065
Ta-Jen Wei! Good Bye!

1471
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,339
I just fooled Your Majesty
around so easily!

1472
01:32:31,413 --> 01:32:33,210
Wives! Let's run away!
