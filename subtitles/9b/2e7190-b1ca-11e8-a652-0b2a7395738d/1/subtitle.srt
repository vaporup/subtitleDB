1
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:38,219
Uh, Charlie-Fox, Charlie-Fox-6,

2
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,723
Roger, be advised...

3
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,731
We'll have resupplies
down by chopper. Over.

4
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,732
Strong shit, man.

5
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:55,987
Where the fuck are the
God damn gooks already?

6
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,991
I don't think they're even out there.

7
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:02,243
Jesus, this shit's something else.

8
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:10,368
Hey, Professor, how many times

9
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,122
can you shit in an hour?

10
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,875
Professor got beaucoupshits, man.

11
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,765
Why do you even bother pulling them up?

12
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,885
You jerking off again, huh, Jake?

13
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,772
Come over here and jerk on this.

14
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,272
Come choke my black root.

15
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,896
Please?

16
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,648
He's asking politely.

17
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:42,151
Ain't got a fucking tweezer, man.

18
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,903
Oh, ho! Yeah!

19
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:47,790
Shit! We got movement in the treeline.

20
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,408
Shit!

21
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,042
Movement in the treeline!

22
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:56,047
1, 3, 2, 0!

23
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:58,917
Fuck, something's wrong.

24
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,918
What the fuck's wrong with you?

25
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,420
Motherfuck.

26
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:05,174
It's my head.

27
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,312
Help me!

28
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,064
Get up!

29
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,066
Paul, help me!

30
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,316
Get up!

31
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,319
Help me!

32
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,071
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Get up!

33
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:22,324
Medic!

34
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:23,826
Medic! Stop it!

35
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:28,946
Medic, we need you here!

36
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,833
Come on, man.

37
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,833
Stop it!

38
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,838
Medic!

39
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,968
1, 2, 3, 0!

40
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:51,853
Fire!

41
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,494
My arm! My arm!

42
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:17,495
Aw, fuck!

43
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:39,934
Oh, God.

44
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,069
Fucking shit!

45
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,873
Excuse me.

46
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,744
Do you know if we've passed
Bergen Street yet?

47
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,749
Bergen?

48
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,754
Um, I fell asleep.

49
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,398
Um, all right. Ok.

50
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,191
Fuck.

51
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,892
Shit.

52
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,109
Hey, Chester.

53
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,111
Go back to sleep.

54
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:25,450
Get insomnia again?

55
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,902
Jake, is that you?

56
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,907
Did you move all the furniture?

57
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,411
I just moved the chair, that's all.

58
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,163
That help?

59
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,166
Yeah, thanks.

60
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,169
So what do you think?

61
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,171
About what?

62
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,172
The room.

63
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,674
Ask me tomorrow.

64
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,927
It is tomorrow.

65
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,931
How come you're so late?

66
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,817
Bud Nash didn't show up again.

67
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,318
Called in sick.

68
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,321
He's always sick.

69
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,938
So I worked.

70
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,441
Got some overtime.

71
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,195
What happened to your pants?

72
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:13,197
Don't ask.

73
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,201
You look terrible.

74
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,452
Thanks.

75
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,009
Help me.

76
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,378
Help me.

77
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,635
Oh, fuck.

78
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,392
You're up?

79
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:32,893
Oh, fuck.

80
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:47,408
What's that?

81
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,793
Your kid dropped it off.

82
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,297
Who, Jed?

83
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,797
No, the little one.

84
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,299
Eli.

85
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,802
Why can't you remember their names?

86
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:00,171
They're weird names.

87
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,174
They're biblical names.

88
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:07,177
They were prophets.

89
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,680
Well, personally,

90
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,182
I never went for church names.

91
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,186
What?

92
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:18,690
Where do you think Jezebel came from?

93
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,575
Nobody calls me that.

94
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,078
You're such a heathen, Jezzie.

95
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,333
How'd I ever get involved

96
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,835
with such a fucking ninny?

97
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:33,837
You sold your soul, remember?

98
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,339
That's what you told me.

99
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,841
Yeah? For what?

100
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,343
A good lay.

101
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,345
Look what I got...

102
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,346
- The best.
- The best.

103
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,473
So what's in the bag?

104
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:53,974
Pictures.

105
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:55,977
Your wife was tossing them,

106
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:58,980
so what's-his-name dropped
it over before school.

107
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,481
Eli.

108
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,483
Eli. Ee-lie.

109
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:13,745
These are great.

110
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:23,887
Yeah?

111
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:27,392
Look at this baby.

112
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:28,893
Aw, who's that?

113
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:31,395
Isn't that the cutest
baby you've ever seen?

114
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:32,896
Little fat little thing.

115
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:34,899
That's me.

116
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:37,402
That's you? Let me see.

117
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:40,404
No, that's all right.
This fat little thing.

118
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,906
You don't have to look.

119
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,910
Who's this?

120
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,413
Sarah.

121
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,914
Sarah.

122
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,418
I can see what you mean.

123
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:55,537
What?

124
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,538
Why you left.

125
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,541
What do you mean?

126
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,294
Jake, she looks like a real bitch.

127
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,297
Well, she looked good then.

128
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,299
Not to me.

129
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,301
You didn't marry her.

130
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,957
Hello, baby.

131
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,961
How you doing?

132
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,096
What's wrong?

133
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,361
Is this the one who died

134
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,997
before you went to Vietnam?

135
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah, it's Gabe.

136
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,003
Oh, God.

137
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:21,506
Sorry.

138
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,509
Took me by surprise.

139
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,511
I didn't expect to see him today.

140
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,884
What are you doing?
Stop it!

141
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,525
I don't like things that make you cry.

142
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,538
I didn't cry.

143
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,488
When there are gray skies

144
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,492
I don't mind the gray skies

145
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:36,998
You'll make them blue

146
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,503
Sonny boy

147
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,387
Hey, Donald.

148
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,390
In to get your check?

149
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,392
You one greedy motherfucker, man.

150
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,393
Don't you know that?

151
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:24,045
Hi.

152
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,801
How's it going?

153
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,304
Better now.

154
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,305
Yeah?

155
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,807
I'm going to go home.

156
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,308
What's wrong?

157
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:39,810
Just one of those days.

158
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,313
My back's killing me.
I'll go see Louie.

159
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,932
Not again. Your boss will kill you.

160
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,817
What can you do?

161
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:51,322
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.

162
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,074
I was looking forward to it.

163
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,076
Easy. My back.

164
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,579
Come on, Jake,
that didn't hurt.

165
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,449
How do you know?

166
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,951
I know you.

167
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:06,453
How come you're so tense today?

168
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,955
I don't know.
What can I tell you?

169
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,209
I saw Sarah the other day.

170
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,210
Oh, yeah?

171
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,212
Her knee acting up?

172
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:17,214
A bit.

173
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,717
So what did she have to say?

174
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:22,103
Turn on your right side.

175
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:26,106
How about the other right?

176
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,108
I don't understand you philosophers.

177
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,977
You got the world figured out,

178
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,480
But you can't remember your left.

179
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,980
What did she say?

180
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,981
Not much.

181
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,983
She's like you that way...

182
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:37,984
two clams.

183
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:39,987
No wonder your marriage didn't last.

184
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,490
Put your hand on your hip.

185
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,991
Take a deep breath...

186
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,495
And let it out slowly,

187
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:48,996
slowly...

188
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,499
That's good.

189
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,885
Now turn to your left.

190
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,890
Did she talk about the boys?

191
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,642
She said you're a son of a bitch,

192
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,644
and she regrets the day she met you.

193
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,646
Thought she didn't say much.

194
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,150
That's all she said.
Hand on your hip.

195
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,152
Take a breath.

196
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:12,653
Easy...

197
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,156
On your back.

198
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,161
I think she still loves you.

199
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,163
I don't think so.

200
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:25,665
She doesn't stop talking about you.

201
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,170
That's love, Jake.

202
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,923
You should go back to her.

203
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,925
She threw me out, remember?

204
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,429
Your problem is you spent
six years getting a Ph.D.

205
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,681
then went to work for the post office.

206
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,682
What can I tell you?

207
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:45,185
After 'Nam, I didn't
want to think anymore.

208
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,806
Any other brain but yours, I'd agree.

209
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:50,307
Now relax...

210
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:54,311
Relax. This is going
to be a little strong.

211
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:55,813
That a boy.

212
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,949
That a boy.

213
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:02,953
I found one.

214
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,455
I think he's still alive.

215
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,462
Wh...

216
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:13,964
What did you...

217
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:15,833
What did you do to me?

218
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,835
I had to get in there.

219
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,336
It's a deep adjustment.

220
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:20,922
Rest a moment.

221
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,422
Let it set a bit.

222
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,424
I had a weird flash.

223
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:25,809
What?

224
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:27,310
I don't know.

225
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,814
I've been having them recently.

226
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,736
You know, you look
like an angel, Louie.

227
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,605
Like an overgrown cherub.

228
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,357
Anyone ever tell you that?

229
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:42,859
Yeah.

230
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,861
You.

231
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,863
Every time I see you.

232
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,784
You're a lifesaver, Louie.

233
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,786
I know.

234
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,632
Mr. Postman.

235
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,134
Mr. Postman.

236
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,635
Where's your letters, baby?

237
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,136
Hey, Mr. Postman.

238
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,771
Where's your bag?

239
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,141
Shake your thing.

240
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:16,143
Wait

241
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,645
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman

242
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:23,150
Wait, Mr. Postman

243
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:25,536
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see

244
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:26,537
whoa, yeah

245
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:30,290
if there's a letter in your bag for me

246
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,044
I've been waitin' for such a long time

247
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:34,545
whoa, yeah

248
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:36,413
Where you going?

249
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:39,299
We don't remember the words.
I'm sorry.

250
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,558
Look out!

251
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,684
Singer?

252
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,188
Please, Elizabeth, sit down.

253
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,691
I need to see Dr. Carlson, please.

254
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,193
Carlson?

255
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:41,694
Is he new here?

256
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,198
No, he's been here for years.

257
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,704
Not according to my charts.

258
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,707
Do you have an appointment?

259
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,210
I need to see him.

260
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,711
I know where his room is.

261
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,214
Just give me a pass.

262
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:04,218
Our doctors are seen
by appointment only.

263
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:06,220
Damn.

264
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,222
I was in the veterans'
outpatient program.

265
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,723
He knows me.

266
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,727
What was your name?

267
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,730
Singer. Jacob singer.

268
00:28:18,231 --> 00:28:20,733
I've got a lot of work here.

269
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,736
Haven't even had lunch yet.

270
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,756
I'm sorry, but...

271
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,259
there's no record of a Jacob Singer

272
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,759
in our files.

273
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,761
What do you mean, no record?

274
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,763
Shall I spell it out?

275
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,766
There is nothing there.

276
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:53,767
That's ridiculous.

277
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,769
I've been coming here for years.

278
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,272
Listen to me. I'm... I'm...

279
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:07,280
I, uh... I need to see Dr. Carlson.

280
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,781
If it's an emergency,

281
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,285
we have a staff of psychiatric
social workers.

282
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,786
There's an hour's wait.

283
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:15,155
Would you just fill out
this form, please?

284
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,657
I don't want any social worker.

285
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,661
I want Dr. Carlson.

286
00:29:21,162 --> 00:29:22,663
He knows me.

287
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:31,922
Hey! Come back here!

288
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,817
Hey!

289
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:47,320
Hey, come back here!

290
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,689
Hey!

291
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:56,079
Look out.

292
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,330
Get out of here.

293
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,333
Hey, come on!

294
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:00,834
Hold him.

295
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,836
He made it.

296
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,461
Can I help you?

297
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,964
Where's Dr. Carlson?

298
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:16,967
Isn't this his office?

299
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,721
Be just a minute.

300
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,729
Why don't we step out in the hall?

301
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,230
It's ok.

302
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:42,125
I'm so sorry.

303
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,127
Dr. Carlson died.

304
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:46,630
Died?

305
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,133
It was a car accident.

306
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,634
Oh, Jesus.

307
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:55,388
Oh, Jesus.

308
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,643
When?

309
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:01,644
Uh, about a month ago.

310
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:03,896
Just before Thanksgiving.

311
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,401
How'd it happen?

312
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,902
No one really knows.

313
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:11,404
They say it blew up.

314
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:13,906
Blew up?

315
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,410
What do you mean, blew up?

316
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:18,912
I really don't know.

317
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:22,415
Is there anything I can do for you?

318
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:23,534
Do you...

319
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:26,537
Do you want me to get you someone?

320
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:28,538
No...

321
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,423
I'm ok.

322
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,941
Maybe it's the pressure, Jake.

323
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,944
You know, the money.

324
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,447
Things like that.

325
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:57,401
Or your wife.

326
00:31:57,401 --> 00:31:59,903
Why do you bring her up?

327
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,906
She's always on your mind.

328
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,461
I never talk about her.

329
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:10,963
It has nothing to do with talking.

330
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,452
Maybe it's the war.

331
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:19,006
You can't spend two years in Vietnam

332
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,007
and expect...

333
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,009
Aw, jezzie, come on.

334
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,012
How does that explain
barricaded subway stations

335
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,147
or these fucking creatures?

336
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,816
Creatures?

337
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:32,819
Jake, New York is filled with creatures,

338
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:35,823
and lots of stations are closed.

339
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:41,828
They're like...

340
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:43,830
demons, Jezz.

341
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,835
Demons?

342
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:50,336
Jake, honey...

343
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,839
they're winos and bag ladies.

344
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,341
Lowlife. That's all they are.

345
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,844
The streets are crawling with them.

346
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,346
Don't make them into something
they're not, hmm?

347
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,849
These guys were trying to kill me.

348
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,351
They were aiming at me.

349
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:05,853
Kids on a joy ride.

350
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,355
It happens all the time.

351
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:15,345
They were inhuman.

352
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,451
Oh, come on.

353
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,557
What were they, Jake?

354
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:36,249
You still love me?

355
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,091
What?

356
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,675
Do you love me?

357
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,845
Yeah.

358
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:55,234
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

359
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,988
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...

360
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:08,999
Hey, where are you going?

361
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,000
Come with me.

362
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,752
Do you have a girlfriend?

363
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:14,788
Do you like her an awful lot?

364
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:16,289
Want a new girlfriend?

365
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,759
I live very close to here,

366
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:22,296
and I'm very lonely.

367
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,720
More

368
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,721
More

369
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:32,855
More

370
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:36,609
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

371
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:40,730
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

372
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,734
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

373
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,988
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

374
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:52,241
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

375
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,745
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir...

376
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:57,247
Hey.

377
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:01,250
Let me look at your hand.

378
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,252
No, thanks.

379
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:04,136
Go ahead, Jake. Let her.

380
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,638
She's real good.

381
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:07,640
Come on.

382
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,642
It's fun.

383
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,643
You left-handed or right-handed?

384
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,645
Um... right.

385
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:14,647
Give it to me.

386
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,649
Ok.

387
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:19,151
Mm-hmm. Married man.

388
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,154
Please.

389
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,158
Oh, no.

390
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:28,160
Oh, divorce.

391
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,662
I like that.

392
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:31,665
You see this here, that split?

393
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:32,665
Where?

394
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:34,167
Right here.

395
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:37,671
It's a paper cut.

396
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:41,674
Ooh, and a sense of humor, too.

397
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:43,176
I love it.

398
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:47,180
Hey, Jake, Jake.

399
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,183
Come on, baby, dance
with me just one, huh?

400
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,685
What, are you flirting?

401
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:55,187
Hi.

402
00:35:56,689 --> 00:36:02,194
Let's see, this is your heart line...

403
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,198
and your head line.

404
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:13,707
And your life line.

405
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:16,709
You have a very strange line, hon.

406
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,714
No, it's not funny.

407
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:24,718
See, according to this,
you're already dead.

408
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,221
You're out of here, baby.

409
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,723
What can you do?

410
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:34,761
Just give me your blue
eyes before you go, ok?

411
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:46,906
Wait, wait. Jake, come here.

412
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:49,408
Come on, come on, you can dance.

413
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,526
I don't want to.

414
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:52,912
Come on, baby, shake it.

415
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,919
Come on, man, move those legs.

416
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,421
Move them size 13s.

417
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:05,424
Those are some big fucking feet.
Shit.

418
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,080
Jesus, look at that.

419
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,582
His guts are hanging out.

420
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:46,086
You'll have to push them back in.

421
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:49,455
I have never...

422
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:53,093
I have never been so
mortified in my whole life.

423
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,095
Screaming like that.

424
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:58,714
I don't understand what's
gotten into you, Jake.

425
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:00,716
You're not acting normal.

426
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,470
There's been too many
crazies in my life.

427
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,971
I don't want it anymore.

428
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:09,225
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.

429
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,861
If you go crazy,

430
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:13,729
You're going crazy by yourself,
you understand?

431
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,366
What's it say?

432
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:21,620
Oh, my God. I'm calling the doctor.

433
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,122
What's it say?

434
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,875
It's gone to the top.

435
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,993
Great.

436
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,997
Dr. Forrest, I'm so sorry to bother you.

437
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,000
This is Jezzie Pipkin up on 14-G.

438
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,002
I just took Jake's temperature,

439
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,504
and it says 106.

440
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,004
Could that be right?

441
00:40:40,256 --> 00:40:41,758
Oh, my God.

442
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:45,511
Oh, my God.

443
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:51,151
Get out of bed.

444
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:53,153
I can't. I'm freezing.

445
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:55,654
Jake, for Pete's sake, get out of bed!

446
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,526
What did the doctor say?

447
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,281
That you'd die on the
way to the hospital.

448
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:05,781
Come on, up, up.

449
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:11,421
Hold on, hold on.

450
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:13,422
You're going to be ok, Jake.

451
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,176
What are you doing?

452
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,680
I need more ice.

453
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,182
I'm freezing!

454
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,687
What's happening?

455
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:32,192
I need some ice. He's
running a 106 fever.

456
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:33,810
It's an emergency... ice.

457
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:36,312
Thank you.

458
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:37,814
Come on, sam.

459
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,066
Oh, my God.

460
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,569
Oh, Jake, oh, Jake,
don't you die on me.

461
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,071
Sam, help me!

462
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:46,071
Sam!

463
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,073
I'll help.

464
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,575
Come on.

465
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:50,075
Be careful with him.

466
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,076
Hold on.

467
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:53,078
Come on. It's for your own good.

468
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
Come on, Jake.

469
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,082
Come on, get him in there.

470
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,718
You're going to be fine.

471
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:06,475
Hold him! Hold him!

472
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,229
It's going to be ok.

473
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:10,229
Is he all right?

474
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,232
He doesn't like this.

475
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:18,988
Help me!

476
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:22,741
Stop it!

477
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:26,245
Jake, don't you die on me.

478
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:28,615
Stop it! You're killing me!

479
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,147
Shit.

480
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:02,649
What was that?

481
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:05,151
I'm freezing.

482
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:06,653
I'm not cold.

483
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:10,156
Of course not. You have all the covers.

484
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,162
Must be 10 degrees in here.

485
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,671
I'm telling you, Sarah...

486
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:26,672
if you want fresh air,

487
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:29,174
you can sleep on the fire escape.

488
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:31,928
From now on, that window's closed.

489
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:34,930
It's not healthy when it's closed.

490
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,933
Healthy? You call this healthy?

491
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:38,435
I'm going to die of pneumonia.

492
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:39,935
This is healthy?

493
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:48,912
What a dream I was having.

494
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:51,413
I was living with another woman.

495
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,870
You know who it was?

496
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,421
I don't want to know.

497
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:01,424
Jezebel from the post office.

498
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:02,926
You remember her.

499
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:07,629
You met her at the
Christmas Party that time.

500
00:44:07,629 --> 00:44:09,665
I was living with her.

501
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:12,951
God, what a nightmare.

502
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:20,026
There were all these demons,

503
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:22,529
and I was on fire.

504
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,533
I was burning from ice.

505
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,037
Guilty thoughts.

506
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:35,075
See what happens when you cheat on me,

507
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,627
even in your mind?

508
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:41,663
She was really good in bed.

509
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,435
Go to sleep.

510
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:51,140
She had these great thighs.

511
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,812
Oh, I thought you said
it was a nightmare.

512
00:44:58,314 --> 00:44:59,314
It was.

513
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:00,817
It was a nightmare.

514
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:06,321
It was a terrible, terrible nightmare.

515
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:12,328
Daddy, what was that noise?

516
00:45:20,336 --> 00:45:22,839
What are you doing up?

517
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:26,843
It's cold.

518
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:28,343
Well, tell your mother.

519
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,346
Go back to bed, darling.

520
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:33,799
Will you tuck me in?

521
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,303
Who, her?

522
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:39,805
No. Daddy.

523
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:41,808
Shit.

524
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,308
Good night, sweetheart.

525
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:48,314
Oh, God. Come on.

526
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,201
Good night, darling.

527
00:46:02,212 --> 00:46:05,214
Ok. Close your eyes.

528
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:27,102
I don't mind the gray skies

529
00:46:27,102 --> 00:46:29,104
You make the moon...

530
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:30,573
Blue?

531
00:46:32,075 --> 00:46:34,076
Sonny boy

532
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:37,412
When I'm old and gray, dear

533
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,283
Promise you won't stray, dear

534
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:43,752
I love you so

535
00:46:43,752 --> 00:46:45,171
Sonny...

536
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:46,589
Boy

537
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:49,091
Dad?

538
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:50,093
Yeah, Jed?

539
00:46:50,593 --> 00:46:53,596
You forgot my allowance.

540
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:55,098
Your allowance?

541
00:46:55,098 --> 00:46:57,100
It's 5:00 in the morning.

542
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,468
We'll talk about it at breakfast.

543
00:46:59,968 --> 00:47:02,971
All right, but don't forget.

544
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,973
I love you, Dad.

545
00:47:06,475 --> 00:47:08,477
What is this, a convention?

546
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,479
I love you too, Pickles.

547
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,482
Go back to sleep.

548
00:47:12,482 --> 00:47:14,484
Wait.

549
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:15,984
Don't go.

550
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,988
I'm not going anywhere.

551
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:21,991
I'm right here.

552
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:24,493
Close your eyes.

553
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,997
See you in the morning.

554
00:47:28,997 --> 00:47:30,500
Don't shut it.

555
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,002
Open it a bit more.

556
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:35,504
There?

557
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:37,506
A little bit more.

558
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:38,508
There?

559
00:47:38,508 --> 00:47:40,509
Good.

560
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:20,633
I love you, Sarah.

561
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,013
Watch the head.

562
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,515
Move it!

563
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:57,153
Don't think we got a
fucking chance down here.

564
00:48:57,153 --> 00:48:58,620
Declare an emergency. Over.

565
00:49:31,937 --> 00:49:33,439
You're a lucky guy, Jake.

566
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:36,442
You must have friends in high places.

567
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:07,649
Let's get down to Orson.

568
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:10,153
I was going to vote for three,

569
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,154
and I switched to two
with some trepidation,

570
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,156
because she said one over one,

571
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:17,160
which means number one
of an addition of one.

572
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,162
I think an artist would know that.

573
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:27,553
Jake?

574
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:40,817
You're going to be all right, Jake.

575
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:43,685
Oh, you're going to be fine.

576
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,692
Am I...

577
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,828
Am I home?

578
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:56,332
Yeah. You're right here.

579
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,700
Home.

580
00:52:00,336 --> 00:52:03,705
Doctor says you're lucky
your brains didn't boil.

581
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:09,712
What a night, Jake, huh?

582
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:13,466
You were screaming and kicking...

583
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:16,718
and you kept saying,

584
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:19,221
"Sarah, close the window,"

585
00:52:19,354 --> 00:52:21,357
over and over.

586
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:23,859
And talking to your kids,

587
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:26,229
even the dead one.

588
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,480
Weird, huh?

589
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:36,988
You know you melted 50 pounds
of ice in 8 hours?

590
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:43,629
Am I dead?

591
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:48,133
Oh, no.

592
00:52:50,136 --> 00:52:52,138
No. You're right here.

593
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,642
Doctor says you got to rest.

594
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:59,645
You see, he says you have a virus.

595
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:01,647
That's what they always say

596
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:04,649
when they don't know what it is.

597
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:08,404
Now, you just lie here, ok?

598
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:15,504
You know, you really
ought to get out today.

599
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,008
You can't just sit around
like this all the time.

600
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,509
It's not healthy.

601
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,513
It's not good for your mind.

602
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:30,151
Go take a walk or something.

603
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:32,154
Do something.

604
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,022
Go to a movie.

605
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:36,024
Go enjoy yourself.

606
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:40,029
One of us should be having a good time.

607
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,419
Anybody in there?

608
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:48,921
Anybody home?

609
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,042
Who are you?

610
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:55,544
Fuck you.

611
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:57,680
Two weeks of this shit!

612
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,180
I've had enough.

613
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,051
Go ahead and rot if you want.

614
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:11,560
Have a good fucking day.

615
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:29,828
Hello.

616
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:30,830
Jake?

617
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,832
Yeah?

618
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:35,334
It's Paul. Paul Gruniger.

619
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:37,837
Paul Gruniger.

620
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:38,837
Paul.

621
00:55:38,837 --> 00:55:41,339
Paul Gruniger. Jesus, how are you?

622
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,843
It's been like five, six years.

623
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:45,227
Yeah. A long time.

624
00:55:45,727 --> 00:55:47,229
So, what's up?

625
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:48,848
Nothing much.

626
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:51,350
Yeah. Well, same here.

627
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,486
I need to see you, Jake.

628
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:54,486
I'd love to see you, man,

629
00:55:54,486 --> 00:55:56,988
But I've been laid up.
I've been sick.

630
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,491
I need to see you.

631
00:56:00,993 --> 00:56:01,993
All right.

632
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:14,006
Something's wrong, Jake.

633
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:17,008
I don't know what it is,

634
00:56:17,008 --> 00:56:21,513
but I can't talk to anybody about it.

635
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:25,935
I mean, I figured I could talk to you.

636
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:28,419
You always used to listen,

637
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,388
you know.

638
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:39,365
I'm going to hell.

639
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:44,787
That's as straight as I can put it.

640
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:47,288
And don't tell me that I'm crazy

641
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,792
'cause I know I'm not.

642
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,292
They're coming after me.

643
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:56,297
Who is?

644
00:56:57,799 --> 00:56:59,801
They've been following me.

645
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:04,807
They're coming out of the walls.

646
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:09,794
I can't trust anybody.

647
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:17,319
But I got to talk to somebody.

648
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:19,821
I got to talk to somebody,

649
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:23,825
or I'm going to fly out
of my fucking mind!

650
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,580
Mind your business.

651
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:44,546
I don't know who they are

652
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:46,047
or what they are,

653
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:48,049
but they're going to get me,

654
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:50,051
and I'm scared, Jake.

655
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:54,055
I'm so scared, I can't do anything.

656
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,058
I can't go to my sister's.

657
00:57:56,058 --> 00:58:00,062
I can't even...

658
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,064
I can't even go home.

659
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,067
I don't know what to do.

660
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,569
Paul?

661
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,071
Shit.

662
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:14,075
Paul, I know what you're talking about.

663
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:17,580
What do you mean?

664
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:22,000
I've seen them, too.

665
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,002
You've seen them?

666
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:27,006
I've seen them, too...

667
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:29,508
Everywhere, like a plague.

668
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:32,511
My God, I thought I was the only one.

669
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,013
Yeah, me, too.

670
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:36,515
I thought I was going out of my mind.

671
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:38,017
I know, I know.

672
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:42,520
Look, I carry these around
everywhere with me,

673
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,524
but they don't help.

674
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:48,526
Nothing helps.

675
00:58:58,037 --> 00:58:59,037
What happened?

676
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:01,540
What happened that night?

677
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:06,511
What have they done to us?

678
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:08,513
I don't know.

679
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:13,518
Profile.

680
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:16,020
Great. That's it.

681
00:59:16,138 --> 00:59:18,140
Give it to him.

682
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,051
My lucky day.

683
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,823
Be advised, we have heavy gunfire...

684
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:12,694
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

685
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,700
Five minutes to Da Nang.

686
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,397
No, no.

687
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,899
You have to be strong for your children.

688
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:17,401
Listen to what she's saying.

689
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:21,906
Did anybody see the police report?

690
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,908
Sounds like a bomb to me.

691
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,910
The paper said it was electrical.

692
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,412
It was an accident.

693
01:02:27,412 --> 01:02:28,412
That's bullshit.

694
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,915
Someone's covering something up.

695
01:02:29,915 --> 01:02:32,917
That was no accident. It was set, man.

696
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:37,421
Why? Paul wasn't hated
by anybody in the world.

697
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,424
What about when you went out?

698
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:40,926
Did he say anything?

699
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,930
Well, he was upset.

700
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,432
He thought people were following him.

701
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:48,933
Yeah? Who?

702
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,935
He didn't know...

703
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,437
Demons.

704
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:56,942
Demons? What the fuck
you talking about, demons?

705
01:02:56,942 --> 01:02:59,944
He thought he was going to hell.

706
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:01,946
Why did he say that?

707
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,948
What would make him say that?

708
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,450
I mean, that's strange.

709
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,953
What else did he say, Jake?

710
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:09,453
He was scared.

711
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,955
He was seeing things

712
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,591
Coming out of the woodwork.

713
01:03:12,591 --> 01:03:15,093
"They're trying to get me," he said.

714
01:03:15,093 --> 01:03:18,462
Did he say what they were?

715
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,227
Excuse me.

716
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:35,730
In one end and out the other,
huh, George?

717
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,616
Still a fucking spaz.

718
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,234
Hope he can hold his dick

719
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:43,238
better than he can his bottle.

720
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:47,743
What?

721
01:03:59,254 --> 01:04:01,006
Something weird is going on here.

722
01:04:01,006 --> 01:04:03,508
Paul isn't the first one who's died.

723
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,761
Remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue?

724
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,145
His car blew up, too.

725
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:09,647
Dr. Carlson's dead?

726
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:12,517
Yeah. An explosion just like Paul's.

727
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,020
We got six guys here
going fucking crazy.

728
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,522
Well, not me, buddy.

729
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:20,524
Ok, but the rest of us are going crazy.

730
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:23,160
Think this has something
to do with that night?

731
01:04:23,662 --> 01:04:25,781
It's got something to do with something.

732
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:28,283
We have to go see the Army.

733
01:04:28,283 --> 01:04:30,285
They're not telling us something.

734
01:04:30,285 --> 01:04:31,919
Oh, come on, Professor.

735
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:33,921
What makes you think

736
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,290
the Army's going to
give you any answers?

737
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,794
You'll be butting up
against a brick wall.

738
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:39,794
We'll get a lawyer.

739
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,797
You should find yourself a shrink.

740
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:44,799
You're all fucking paranoid.

741
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,803
It was bad grass.
That's all it was, man.

742
01:04:47,935 --> 01:04:49,937
There's no such things
as fucking demons.

743
01:04:49,937 --> 01:04:51,439
Come on.

744
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:57,562
Carol, I'm going to
need you with your pad

745
01:04:58,062 --> 01:04:59,564
in about 15 minutes.

746
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,567
Well, I'm sorry,

747
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,569
Mr. Singer,

748
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:09,073
but you know how many people come to me

749
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:11,075
with the injustices of the world?

750
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,576
It would break your heart.

751
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,830
Mr. Geary, this is very important to us.

752
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,332
The Army did something to us,

753
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:19,584
and we've got to find out what.

754
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:22,587
The Army? Jeez, what's with you guys?

755
01:05:22,587 --> 01:05:25,089
This is not a walk to the library.

756
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,591
This is the U.S. government.

757
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:29,093
This is red tape coming out your ass.

758
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,479
You know what I mean?

759
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:31,979
That's why we're here.

760
01:05:31,979 --> 01:05:34,482
Do you think you can help us?

761
01:05:34,482 --> 01:05:37,986
What am I, Perry Mason?

762
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:52,000
All right. I'll look into it.

763
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:55,504
You think we have a chance?

764
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:58,506
I need sworn depositions
from all of you

765
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:00,625
and a list of platoon members

766
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,127
or their survivors.

767
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:03,511
This is great.

768
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:05,513
I'll tell you one thing.

769
01:06:05,513 --> 01:06:07,015
If we do find

770
01:06:07,015 --> 01:06:09,517
that the military is implicated in this,

771
01:06:09,517 --> 01:06:14,022
you all stand to make
quite a bit of money.

772
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,140
Not that I can predict anything,

773
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,642
but class action suits of this kind

774
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,145
have been awarded fairly
generous judgments.

775
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,647
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

776
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:27,151
We're not in it for the money.

777
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,153
- That's right.
- Right.

778
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:33,658
All right, gentlemen,

779
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:37,412
who wants to go first?

780
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:03,939
I put a hungry man in the oven.

781
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:05,941
It will be ready at a quarter of.

782
01:07:05,941 --> 01:07:06,942
Ok.

783
01:07:06,942 --> 01:07:09,310
There's a tossed salad in the fridge.

784
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:10,946
Ok. Thanks.

785
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:13,198
I got you some apple juice.

786
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:14,698
No, not Red Cheek.

787
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:15,950
Red Cheek.

788
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:16,951
Ah, shit.

789
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,703
Don't drink it all.

790
01:07:18,819 --> 01:07:19,821
All right.

791
01:07:21,323 --> 01:07:23,575
Oh, your lawyer called.

792
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:25,576
When?

793
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,578
When you were in the shower.

794
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:29,080
You didn't call me?

795
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,082
He didn't give me a chance.

796
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:32,584
He hung up on me.

797
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,587
Look, Jake, don't be upset, ok?

798
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,591
He's not taking your case.

799
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:41,091
What? What do you mean?

800
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:44,095
He said you didn't have one.

801
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:45,596
What's he talking about?

802
01:07:45,596 --> 01:07:48,098
I don't know. He was very rude.

803
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,100
He said your friends backed out.

804
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,602
I don't believe this.

805
01:07:51,602 --> 01:07:54,238
Oh, baby, I feel terrible.

806
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:00,995
I'd stay, but I'm so late.

807
01:08:01,997 --> 01:08:04,249
We'll talk when I get home, ok?

808
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:05,616
Yeah.

809
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,622
Are you all right?

810
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:13,625
Yeah, I'm fine.

811
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,627
You sure?

812
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:18,129
Give me a kiss.

813
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,267
I'll see you later.

814
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,768
Bye, sweetheart.

815
01:08:43,404 --> 01:08:44,406
Hello?

816
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:45,907
Frank, hi. It's Jake.

817
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:48,410
I just got a strange call from Geary.

818
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,911
He said the guys backed down.

819
01:08:50,911 --> 01:08:52,413
What's he talking about?

820
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:56,917
Yeah, that's right, Jake, we did.

821
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,170
Why?

822
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,057
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

823
01:09:04,175 --> 01:09:06,310
Well, try.

824
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:09,813
You know, Jake, um...

825
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:12,817
War's war.

826
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:14,318
Things happen.

827
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:15,819
Things happen?

828
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:19,823
What does that mean?

829
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,827
I thought we were going
to do something, Frank.

830
01:09:22,827 --> 01:09:25,279
There's nothing to do, Jake.

831
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,198
Who's been talking to you?

832
01:09:30,702 --> 01:09:33,203
What's going on, Frank?

833
01:09:39,094 --> 01:09:40,094
I'll call the others.

834
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,095
They're not interested, Jake.

835
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,596
What do you mean?

836
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,099
They're not interested.

837
01:09:44,099 --> 01:09:46,100
We all talked about this.

838
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,603
We're all suffering the same symptoms.

839
01:09:48,603 --> 01:09:51,105
Listen, the Army's hiding
something from us.

840
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:54,108
We got to find out what it is.

841
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:56,361
Uh, Jake, I got to go.

842
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,112
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

843
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:00,115
No, wait. Don't hang up.

844
01:10:00,482 --> 01:10:02,483
Jake, don't call back anymore, ok?

845
01:10:02,483 --> 01:10:04,986
Wait! I can't do this by myself.

846
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:06,487
Frank?

847
01:10:10,492 --> 01:10:11,992
Frank?

848
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:36,734
We'll get them this afternoon.

849
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:38,236
Have a good lunch.

850
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:39,853
Geary.

851
01:10:39,853 --> 01:10:40,604
Mr. Geary.

852
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,607
Excuse me.

853
01:10:44,108 --> 01:10:46,111
Who's been talking to you, huh?

854
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:47,112
The Army?

855
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:49,113
Have they been talking to you?

856
01:10:49,113 --> 01:10:50,615
Nobody's talking to nobody.

857
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:52,617
You don't have a case.

858
01:10:52,617 --> 01:10:54,118
Keep your hands off me.

859
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,620
Leave me alone.

860
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,505
You can't walk away like this.

861
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:00,008
We need your help.

862
01:11:00,008 --> 01:11:01,009
You need a doctor.

863
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:03,010
The Army did something to me.

864
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,511
I got to prove it.

865
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:07,014
There's nothing I can do, all right?

866
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:08,015
Just leave me alone.

867
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:09,517
Something's going on here.

868
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:11,019
You're not telling me something.

869
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:12,770
What's wrong with you?

870
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,773
I'll tell you what's wrong.

871
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:16,774
I don't know you from Adam.

872
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:18,643
You walk in with some bizarre-o story

873
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:21,145
and demand I check it out. I did.

874
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:24,648
I don't know what you take me for,

875
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:26,151
but you've used me.

876
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:27,152
Used you?

877
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:29,036
I checked with the Army.

878
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,790
You never even went to Vietnam.

879
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,291
What's that supposed to mean?

880
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:35,292
You and your friends are wacko!

881
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,795
You were all discharged
on psychological grounds

882
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:39,797
after some war games in Thailand.

883
01:11:39,797 --> 01:11:41,800
Don't you see what they're doing?

884
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,803
We were in Da Nang.
You got to believe me.

885
01:11:45,303 --> 01:11:46,804
Go fuck yourself, Singer.

886
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:08,076
Hey!

887
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:10,828
What is this?

888
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,330
What is this?

889
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,331
Help!

890
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:14,832
Help!

891
01:12:16,584 --> 01:12:19,086
Come on, get in there, you cocksucker.

892
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:22,206
Get off of me!

893
01:12:33,968 --> 01:12:35,969
You little fuck!

894
01:12:35,969 --> 01:12:37,721
Mr. Singer.

895
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:38,973
What an appropriate name

896
01:12:38,973 --> 01:12:40,974
for someone who can't
keep his mouth shut.

897
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:44,478
Who are you? What do you want?

898
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:48,616
We've been watching you
for a long time...

899
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:50,117
you and your friends...

900
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:52,120
Frightening people with foolish talk

901
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,121
about the Army and experiments.

902
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:56,624
You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

903
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:58,376
Men drown that way.

904
01:13:03,247 --> 01:13:05,250
The Army was part of another life.

905
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,251
Let it lie.

906
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:10,138
I hope we've made our point, Mr. Singer.

907
01:13:21,515 --> 01:13:23,268
Kill this motherfucker!

908
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:40,667
Help!

909
01:13:59,938 --> 01:14:00,938
Look out!

910
01:14:03,057 --> 01:14:05,059
Please give a little something

911
01:14:05,059 --> 01:14:08,062
to help the poor families.

912
01:14:27,081 --> 01:14:29,334
You poor, poor man.

913
01:14:40,594 --> 01:14:44,698
Merry, merry Christmas!

914
01:14:50,572 --> 01:14:52,072
This guy's really hurt.

915
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:54,075
You better get something in him.

916
01:14:54,075 --> 01:14:55,443
Hi, I'm Dr. Stewart.

917
01:14:55,943 --> 01:14:57,946
Can you tell me what happened?

918
01:14:57,946 --> 01:14:58,947
My back.

919
01:14:58,947 --> 01:15:00,948
l... I can't move.

920
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,332
Get my chiropractor.

921
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:04,835
Your back?

922
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:06,587
Did you fall?

923
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:09,090
He said he slipped on the pavement.

924
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:11,091
He may have hit his head.

925
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:13,344
Does he have any identification?

926
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:14,595
No wallet, nothing.

927
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:15,964
He stole it.

928
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:17,348
Who did?

929
01:15:17,849 --> 01:15:19,349
Santa Claus.

930
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:23,971
I got to get the bastard.

931
01:15:26,474 --> 01:15:29,477
It had my son's picture in it...

932
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:30,478
Gabe's picture.

933
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,980
It's the only one I had.

934
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:35,483
Get an orthopedic man in here.
Is Dr. Davis on call?

935
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:37,234
I'll page him.

936
01:15:39,737 --> 01:15:41,238
Call my chiropractor.

937
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:43,241
We're doing everything we can.

938
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:46,243
Louie Denardo,

939
01:15:46,243 --> 01:15:47,745
Nostend avenue.

940
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:57,889
I'll have to move you
to check for injuries.

941
01:15:57,889 --> 01:15:58,889
No, doctor.

942
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,892
This may hurt a little.

943
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:01,893
No, no...

944
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:06,898
I don't have to ask if
you could feel that.

945
01:16:06,898 --> 01:16:08,398
God damn it. I need Louie.

946
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:09,901
Who's Louie?

947
01:16:10,902 --> 01:16:12,402
He's out of it.

948
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:14,404
Let's take him down to X-ray.

949
01:16:53,361 --> 01:16:54,362
Gabe?

950
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,933
Jezzie...

951
01:18:57,434 --> 01:18:59,187
Get me out of here.

952
01:18:59,687 --> 01:19:01,188
Where do you want to go?

953
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:02,072
Home.

954
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:03,573
Home?

955
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,576
This is your home. You're dead.

956
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:06,577
Dead?

957
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:11,081
No. No, I just hurt my back.

958
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,700
I'm not dead.

959
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,701
What are you, then?

960
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,202
I'm alive!

961
01:19:15,202 --> 01:19:16,203
Then what you doing here?

962
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,589
I don't know.

963
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,093
This isn't happening.

964
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:23,344
What is happening?

965
01:19:23,344 --> 01:19:25,846
Get me out of here.

966
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:27,849
There is no out of here.

967
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:29,349
You've been killed.

968
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,853
Don't you remember?

969
01:19:37,724 --> 01:19:38,608
Careful.

970
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:40,111
We're losing him!

971
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:41,612
We're losing him!

972
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:43,113
Watch it! Careful.

973
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:44,615
What the fuck's taking them...

974
01:19:45,099 --> 01:19:46,317
He's still pretty doped up.

975
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:49,319
I don't think he'll
be able to talk yet.

976
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:51,322
I doubt he'll recognize you.

977
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:56,077
I just want to see him.

978
01:19:56,577 --> 01:19:58,578
I'll be outside if you need me.

979
01:20:00,581 --> 01:20:01,581
Dad?

980
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:03,584
Hi.

981
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:05,835
It's us.

982
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:11,091
You ok?

983
01:20:11,591 --> 01:20:12,593
Jake,

984
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:14,594
it's me.

985
01:20:16,096 --> 01:20:17,598
We heard what happened.

986
01:20:29,609 --> 01:20:31,112
I'm not dead.

987
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:33,113
What?

988
01:20:33,113 --> 01:20:35,616
I'm alive.

989
01:20:37,117 --> 01:20:39,620
I'm not dead.

990
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,621
Oh. Oh, no.

991
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:43,624
Of course you're not.

992
01:20:43,624 --> 01:20:46,626
You just hurt your back, that's all.

993
01:20:46,626 --> 01:20:49,630
It'll be fine. It just takes some time.

994
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,631
A month they said.

995
01:20:53,134 --> 01:20:55,135
Just hang in there, dad.

996
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:58,639
Now stop it.

997
01:20:59,139 --> 01:21:00,140
It's not funny.

998
01:21:02,143 --> 01:21:03,144
God.

999
01:21:04,644 --> 01:21:06,147
What a mess, huh?

1000
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:12,152
Oh, Jacob.

1001
01:21:12,152 --> 01:21:14,154
I still love you.

1002
01:21:16,657 --> 01:21:18,658
For whatever that's worth.

1003
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:24,547
Dream on.

1004
01:21:25,549 --> 01:21:26,550
Oh, God, no!

1005
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,051
What?

1006
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,553
What?

1007
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:35,559
Oh, god, what?

1008
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:37,560
Tell me, what can I do?

1009
01:21:39,563 --> 01:21:41,064
Help me.

1010
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:50,573
Hold on.

1011
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,328
Jacob?

1012
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:57,831
Jacob Singer!

1013
01:21:59,082 --> 01:21:59,582
Jacob!

1014
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:01,585
Sir, keep your voice down.

1015
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:04,087
Where's Jacob Singer?

1016
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:05,589
Louie, I'm in here!

1017
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:08,091
Jake? Where are you, Jake?

1018
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,343
You can't go in there.

1019
01:22:09,343 --> 01:22:10,844
Can I help you?

1020
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:11,594
Jacob!

1021
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:14,598
Good god, Jake, what have they done?

1022
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:16,216
Can I help you?

1023
01:22:16,216 --> 01:22:17,718
You can't go in there.

1024
01:22:17,718 --> 01:22:19,603
What is this, the Middle Ages?

1025
01:22:19,603 --> 01:22:21,221
Don't touch him!

1026
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:22,723
They call this modern medicine?

1027
01:22:22,723 --> 01:22:24,724
This is barbaric. Barbaric!

1028
01:22:24,724 --> 01:22:26,477
All right, just calm down.

1029
01:22:26,977 --> 01:22:29,612
Why don't you just burn
him at the stake?

1030
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:31,115
You'll have to leave!

1031
01:22:31,115 --> 01:22:33,867
Stay back! Don't come near me!

1032
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:34,484
Stay back!

1033
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:35,986
Take one step

1034
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:38,488
And I'll wrap this around your neck.

1035
01:22:38,738 --> 01:22:39,740
Calm down.

1036
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,624
Back! Back!

1037
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,376
Calm down.

1038
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:44,879
Come on, Jake.

1039
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:46,880
Come on.

1040
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,381
You can't do that.

1041
01:22:53,504 --> 01:22:55,005
Make sure that security's alerted.

1042
01:22:59,009 --> 01:23:00,144
You can't do this!

1043
01:23:00,644 --> 01:23:02,145
Out of the way!

1044
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,148
I'm upset.

1045
01:23:04,148 --> 01:23:06,399
I'm really upset.

1046
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,402
That's a crazy man.

1047
01:23:08,402 --> 01:23:09,903
That man is crazy.

1048
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:12,406
Watch your toes, Jake.

1049
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:23,917
Well, you've done it
to yourself this time,

1050
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,419
haven't you?

1051
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,422
Am I dying, Louie?

1052
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:31,925
From a slipped disk?

1053
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:34,428
That would be a first.

1054
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,432
I was in hell.

1055
01:23:40,434 --> 01:23:42,435
I don't want to die, Louie.

1056
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:45,939
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

1057
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:49,943
It's all pain.

1058
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:53,947
Straighten out your head.

1059
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,202
Relax.

1060
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,206
You ever read Meister Eckhart?

1061
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:04,207
No.

1062
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:07,210
How did you get your doctorate
without reading Eckhart?

1063
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,461
Relax.

1064
01:24:09,964 --> 01:24:12,465
Ok, good. Now turn over gently...

1065
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:13,968
right side.

1066
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,470
The other right, ok?

1067
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:21,975
You're a regular basket
case, you know that?

1068
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:30,850
Eckhart saw hell, too.

1069
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,853
You know what he said?

1070
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:35,855
He said the only thing
that burns in hell

1071
01:24:35,855 --> 01:24:37,358
is the part of you

1072
01:24:37,358 --> 01:24:39,859
that won't let go of your life...

1073
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:41,362
your memories, your attachments.

1074
01:24:41,362 --> 01:24:43,363
They burn them all away.

1075
01:24:43,363 --> 01:24:46,367
But they're not punishing you, he said.

1076
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:48,368
They're freeing your soul.

1077
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:49,370
Relax.

1078
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:52,872
Good.

1079
01:24:58,379 --> 01:25:01,381
So the way he sees it...

1080
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:05,385
if you're frightened of dying
and you're holding on...

1081
01:25:07,388 --> 01:25:10,390
you'll see devils tearing
your life away.

1082
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,894
But if you've made your peace,

1083
01:25:13,894 --> 01:25:16,229
then the devils are really angels

1084
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:18,232
freeing you from the earth.

1085
01:25:18,232 --> 01:25:23,237
It's just a matter of how
you look at it, that's all.

1086
01:25:23,237 --> 01:25:25,238
So don't worry, ok?

1087
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:27,241
Ok?

1088
01:25:30,243 --> 01:25:31,245
Good.

1089
01:25:31,245 --> 01:25:32,246
Relax.

1090
01:25:32,246 --> 01:25:33,746
Relax.

1091
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,251
Relax...

1092
01:25:38,251 --> 01:25:40,254
And wiggle your toes.

1093
01:25:41,755 --> 01:25:44,258
Come on, wiggle your toes.

1094
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,261
Perfect.

1095
01:25:48,261 --> 01:25:49,763
We got it.

1096
01:25:51,264 --> 01:25:52,765
We got it.

1097
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,401
Get on your back. Come on.

1098
01:25:54,902 --> 01:25:55,902
Easy.

1099
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:57,403
Ok?

1100
01:25:57,654 --> 01:25:59,657
Now let's just give it a little try.

1101
01:25:59,657 --> 01:26:02,660
I want to see if you can stand.

1102
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:09,666
By myself?

1103
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:12,670
You can do it.

1104
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:16,172
Come on.

1105
01:26:17,675 --> 01:26:20,176
Just give it a try, Jacob.

1106
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,178
Come on.

1107
01:26:24,682 --> 01:26:26,183
Come on.

1108
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:31,188
Attaboy. Go ahead.

1109
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:33,691
Go ahead.

1110
01:26:35,192 --> 01:26:36,693
Go ahead.

1111
01:26:43,817 --> 01:26:45,818
Hallelujah.

1112
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:53,817
Jake?

1113
01:30:53,817 --> 01:30:55,318
What's wrong?

1114
01:30:55,818 --> 01:30:56,819
It's me.

1115
01:30:59,322 --> 01:31:00,823
Are you ok?

1116
01:31:02,826 --> 01:31:05,328
Jesus Christ, where have you been?

1117
01:31:05,328 --> 01:31:06,830
I've been worried sick.

1118
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:10,334
I mean, it's two days,
and you don't call me?

1119
01:31:10,334 --> 01:31:12,335
I was in the hospital.

1120
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:15,839
Oh, Jesus. In the hospital?

1121
01:31:18,341 --> 01:31:19,843
Jake, honey, what hospital?

1122
01:31:20,344 --> 01:31:22,845
I called every hospital in the city.

1123
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:27,850
No, don't.

1124
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:30,353
What's going on?

1125
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:33,105
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

1126
01:31:35,608 --> 01:31:36,609
Hello?

1127
01:31:36,609 --> 01:31:38,111
Is Jacob Singer there?

1128
01:31:38,111 --> 01:31:40,112
No. I haven't seen him all night.

1129
01:31:40,613 --> 01:31:41,615
When do you expect him?

1130
01:31:41,615 --> 01:31:42,616
I don't know.

1131
01:31:43,116 --> 01:31:44,617
Could you tell him something?

1132
01:31:44,617 --> 01:31:46,118
Tell him I was in Vietnam...

1133
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:47,120
Vietnam?

1134
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,621
There was a secret experiment...

1135
01:31:48,621 --> 01:31:49,622
What experiment?

1136
01:31:49,622 --> 01:31:52,125
I need to see him as soon as possible.

1137
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,626
Hello. This is Jacob Singer.

1138
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:55,629
I was in-country in '68.

1139
01:31:55,629 --> 01:31:58,130
I was in a chemical
warfare unit in Saigon.

1140
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:00,133
We conducted secret
government experiments.

1141
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:01,134
My God.

1142
01:32:01,134 --> 01:32:02,135
Are you there?

1143
01:32:02,135 --> 01:32:03,135
Yeah.

1144
01:32:03,135 --> 01:32:04,136
Do you want to know more?

1145
01:32:04,638 --> 01:32:06,139
Where can I meet you?

1146
01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:07,139
On 128th and westside highway

1147
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,642
in front of a coffee truck.

1148
01:32:08,642 --> 01:32:10,143
How will I know you?

1149
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:11,644
You already know me.

1150
01:32:11,644 --> 01:32:12,645
I do?

1151
01:32:12,645 --> 01:32:14,648
Yes. Make sure you're not followed, ok?

1152
01:32:14,648 --> 01:32:17,149
All right. Bye.

1153
01:32:17,149 --> 01:32:18,902
I knew it.

1154
01:32:21,904 --> 01:32:24,407
Who was that?

1155
01:32:24,407 --> 01:32:25,908
A chemist.

1156
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:31,915
Part of a chemical warfare
unit out of Saigon.

1157
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:34,417
I knew something was going on.

1158
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:37,420
Jake... please don't go.

1159
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,432
Oh, I'm sorry.

1160
01:33:05,081 --> 01:33:06,450
Jacob?

1161
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:09,702
Hi. I'm Michael Newman.

1162
01:33:12,589 --> 01:33:13,590
Yeah.

1163
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,841
I told you you'd know me.

1164
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:18,344
I've been tracking you for a long time.

1165
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,846
I wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.

1166
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,349
Why are you following me?

1167
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:25,218
You're one of the survivors, Jacob.

1168
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:30,223
Come on. We can't talk here.

1169
01:33:30,223 --> 01:33:32,475
It's not safe. Come on.

1170
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,733
So, first I'm arrested, right?

1171
01:33:40,233 --> 01:33:43,236
Best LSD I ever made
right down the drain.

1172
01:33:43,737 --> 01:33:45,237
I figured, "This is it.

1173
01:33:45,738 --> 01:33:47,741
20 years in the can if I'm lucky."

1174
01:33:48,241 --> 01:33:49,242
That was 1968.

1175
01:33:49,742 --> 01:33:50,743
Long time ago.

1176
01:33:50,743 --> 01:33:53,746
Really. Next thing I know,
I'm on Riker's island.

1177
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:55,881
Ever been there, man?

1178
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:58,385
Well, suddenly, they
take me from my cell,

1179
01:33:58,385 --> 01:34:02,389
they throw me in a waiting room
With bank teller windows.

1180
01:34:02,889 --> 01:34:05,392
Four army colonels with
medals up their asses

1181
01:34:05,892 --> 01:34:06,893
are standing on the other side.

1182
01:34:06,893 --> 01:34:10,897
They say to me, if I come
to Vietnam for two years...

1183
01:34:11,398 --> 01:34:12,898
No action, just work in a lab...

1184
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:15,902
they'll drop all charges
and wipe the record clean.

1185
01:34:15,902 --> 01:34:17,903
I'd only been in jail 13 hours.

1186
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,906
I knew 'Nam couldn't be any worse.

1187
01:34:20,407 --> 01:34:21,407
Shows how little you knew.

1188
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:24,411
Yeah, really. They had me by the balls.

1189
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:26,412
Next thing I know, I'm in Saigon.

1190
01:34:26,779 --> 01:34:29,282
I'm working in a top-secret lab

1191
01:34:29,282 --> 01:34:31,283
synthesizing mind-altering drugs.

1192
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:32,786
Not the street stuff.

1193
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:35,287
They had us isolating
special properties...

1194
01:34:35,287 --> 01:34:36,790
the dark side.

1195
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:41,294
They wanted a drug that increased
aggressive tendencies.

1196
01:34:41,294 --> 01:34:43,295
They were scared. They were worried.

1197
01:34:43,295 --> 01:34:45,297
They figured you guys were too soft,

1198
01:34:45,297 --> 01:34:46,800
not fighting up to your potential.

1199
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,801
They wanted something to stir you up,

1200
01:34:48,801 --> 01:34:52,805
make you mad, you know,
tap into your anger.

1201
01:34:52,805 --> 01:34:54,808
And we did it.

1202
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:57,309
Most powerful thing I ever saw.

1203
01:34:57,309 --> 01:35:00,813
Even a bad trip, and believe
me, I've had my share,

1204
01:35:00,813 --> 01:35:03,817
do not compare to the
fury of the Ladder.

1205
01:35:03,817 --> 01:35:04,818
The Ladder?

1206
01:35:04,818 --> 01:35:07,319
Yeah. That's what they called it.

1207
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:10,322
A fast trip straight down the Ladder...

1208
01:35:10,322 --> 01:35:13,827
right to the primal fear,
right to the base anger.

1209
01:35:13,827 --> 01:35:16,328
I'm telling you, man, it was powerful.

1210
01:35:16,328 --> 01:35:19,832
I don't need to tell you.
You already know.

1211
01:35:19,832 --> 01:35:22,835
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.

1212
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:24,336
It worked.

1213
01:35:24,336 --> 01:35:26,840
They bashed each other's heads in,

1214
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,341
gouged out their eyes,
chewed off their tails.

1215
01:35:29,341 --> 01:35:30,844
The brass loved it.

1216
01:35:30,844 --> 01:35:33,846
Then they made us try it on charlie.

1217
01:35:40,737 --> 01:35:43,740
We...

1218
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:46,742
took these POWs, you know?

1219
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:49,246
Just kids, really.

1220
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:53,750
And... we put them in this courtyard,

1221
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,254
And we fed them huge
doses of the stuff.

1222
01:35:59,255 --> 01:36:02,259
I mean, they were worse
than the monkeys.

1223
01:36:02,259 --> 01:36:05,261
I didn't know men could do those things.

1224
01:36:09,265 --> 01:36:12,769
Anyway, there was this big
offensive coming up, right?

1225
01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:14,770
Everyone knew it...

1226
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,273
Time Magazine, Huntley, Brinkley...

1227
01:36:16,273 --> 01:36:17,773
And the brass were scared

1228
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,276
because they knew we couldn't win.

1229
01:36:19,276 --> 01:36:22,278
Morale was down, it was
getting ugly in the States.

1230
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,279
You remember.

1231
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:24,781
Yeah.

1232
01:36:24,781 --> 01:36:26,782
So, a couple days later,

1233
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:29,786
they decide to use the Ladder...

1234
01:36:29,786 --> 01:36:32,288
on one test battalion...

1235
01:36:32,706 --> 01:36:33,706
Yours.

1236
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:37,710
Just an infinitesimal dose in
the food supply, they said,

1237
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:40,714
just to prove its effectiveness
in the field.

1238
01:36:40,714 --> 01:36:43,716
They were sure your unit would
have the highest kill ratio

1239
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:45,167
in the whole God damn offensive,

1240
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:46,670
and they were right...
you did...

1241
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,171
except not the way they thought.

1242
01:36:52,675 --> 01:36:55,178
No one can remember that night.

1243
01:36:55,178 --> 01:36:58,682
I get flashes, but
they don't make sense.

1244
01:36:58,682 --> 01:37:00,200
What happened?

1245
01:37:00,433 --> 01:37:02,434
Was there an offensive?

1246
01:37:02,434 --> 01:37:06,438
Yeah, a couple days later.
It was fierce,

1247
01:37:06,438 --> 01:37:08,441
but you guys never saw it.

1248
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:10,076
But there was an attack?

1249
01:37:10,076 --> 01:37:12,077
It was a fight, right?

1250
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:15,165
Yeah, but not with the Cong.

1251
01:37:19,368 --> 01:37:20,370
With who?

1252
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:31,264
You killed each other.

1253
01:37:32,765 --> 01:37:34,384
What?

1254
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:36,885
It was brother against brother.

1255
01:37:36,885 --> 01:37:39,389
No discrimination.

1256
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:41,390
You tore each other to pieces.

1257
01:37:41,774 --> 01:37:43,526
My God.

1258
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:46,528
I knew it would happen.

1259
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,031
I warned them.

1260
01:37:48,031 --> 01:37:50,532
I fucking warned them!

1261
01:37:53,286 --> 01:37:55,287
Ohh, fuck.

1262
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,801
I was just some hippie chemist, right?

1263
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:10,804
What did I know?

1264
01:38:11,804 --> 01:38:13,305
Fuck.

1265
01:38:14,307 --> 01:38:17,309
I talked to the guys
who bagged the bodies.

1266
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:20,813
They were in worse shape
than you, believe me.

1267
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:23,316
They saw what was left.

1268
01:38:28,822 --> 01:38:32,826
I needed to find you, you know?

1269
01:38:32,826 --> 01:38:35,327
I felt responsible.

1270
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:39,749
The Ladder was my baby.

1271
01:39:16,536 --> 01:39:18,037
I'm going to Brooklyn.

1272
01:39:18,037 --> 01:39:20,040
Not with me, you're not.

1273
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,791
I get lost in Brooklyn.

1274
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,294
I know the way.

1275
01:39:24,294 --> 01:39:25,795
Listen...

1276
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:29,549
This is all the money I have.

1277
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:31,417
Take me home, please.

1278
01:39:31,417 --> 01:39:34,054
Where's your home?

1279
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:15,772
Dr. Singer.

1280
01:41:16,272 --> 01:41:19,776
Well... it's been a long time.

1281
01:41:19,776 --> 01:41:20,777
Hello, sam.

1282
01:41:21,277 --> 01:41:23,278
Are you all right?

1283
01:41:23,278 --> 01:41:25,415
Yeah, I'm ok.

1284
01:41:25,415 --> 01:41:29,035
Do you want some help?
I can call upstairs.

1285
01:41:29,035 --> 01:41:31,537
No, no. That's ok.

1286
01:41:31,537 --> 01:41:33,422
Thanks, sam.

1287
01:42:11,277 --> 01:42:12,778
Sarah?

1288
01:42:31,296 --> 01:42:33,299
Jed?

1289
01:42:33,299 --> 01:42:34,800
Eli?

1290
01:43:57,966 --> 01:43:59,969
If you're frightened of dying

1291
01:43:59,969 --> 01:44:01,470
and you're holding on,

1292
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:05,974
you'll see devils
tearing your life away.

1293
01:44:05,974 --> 01:44:08,478
If you've made your peace,

1294
01:44:08,478 --> 01:44:10,529
then the devils are really angels

1295
01:44:11,029 --> 01:44:13,666
freeing you from the earth.

1296
01:45:33,895 --> 01:45:35,398
Gabe?

1297
01:45:44,122 --> 01:45:45,992
Gabe?

1298
01:45:46,992 --> 01:45:48,493
Hi, Dad.

1299
01:46:09,514 --> 01:46:11,517
It's ok.

1300
01:46:22,027 --> 01:46:24,029
Come on.
Let's go up.

1301
01:46:32,537 --> 01:46:34,040
Come on.

1302
01:47:12,627 --> 01:47:14,130
He's gone.

1303
01:47:21,636 --> 01:47:25,640
He looks kind of peaceful, the guy.

1304
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,644
Put up a hell of a fight, though.

1305
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:35,651
What's the guy's name?

1306
01:47:37,652 --> 01:47:40,656
Singer. Jacob singer.

1307
01:47:51,666 --> 01:47:57,672
I don't mind the gray skies

1308
01:47:57,672 --> 01:48:00,175
You make them blue

1309
01:48:00,175 --> 01:48:04,764
Sonny boy

1310
01:48:05,363 --> 01:48:09,551
Friends may forsake me

1311
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:13,555
Let them all forsake me

1312
01:48:13,555 --> 01:48:16,692
I still have you

1313
01:48:16,692 --> 01:48:20,112
Sonny boy

1314
01:48:21,613 --> 01:48:25,334
You're sent from heaven

1315
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:28,955
And I know your worth

1316
01:48:28,955 --> 01:48:39,965
You made a heaven for me here on earth

1317
01:48:39,965 --> 01:48:44,469
When I'm old and gray here

1318
01:48:44,469 --> 01:48:48,474
Promise you won't stray, dear

1319
01:48:48,474 --> 01:48:51,978
For I love you so

1320
01:48:52,478 --> 01:48:55,480
Sonny boy
