1
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,390
<i>I amar prestar aen.</i>

2
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,690
The world is changed.

3
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,690
<i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>

4
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,990
I feel it in the water.

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,390
<i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>

6
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,090
I feel it in the earth.

7
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,990
<i>A han noston ned 'wilith.</i>

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,090
I smell it in the air.

9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,390
Much that once was...

10
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,190
...is lost.

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,890
For none now live who remember it.

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,390
The Lord of the Rings.

13
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,090
It began with the forging of the great rings.

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,290
Three were given to the elves:

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,190
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,990
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,490
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,290
And nine...

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,390
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,490
...who, above all else, desire power.

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,690
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

22
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,490
But they were all of them deceived.

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,890
For another ring was made.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,190
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

25
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,090
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

26
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,390
... to control all others.

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,490
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,890
...and his will to dominate all life.

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,790
One ring to rule them all.

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,390
One by one...

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,090
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

32
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,390
But there were some who resisted.

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,490
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

34
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,390
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

35
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,490
Tangado haid! (Hold positions!)

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,190
Leithio i philinn! (Fire the arrows!)

37
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,390
Victory was near.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,490
But the power of the ring...

39
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,590
...could not be undone.

40
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,690
It was in this moment...

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,290
... when all hope had faded...

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,490
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

43
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,990
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

44
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,290
The ring passed to Isildur...

45
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,590
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

46
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,490
But the hearts of men...

47
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,190
...are easily corrupted.

48
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,990
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

49
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,890
It betrayed Isildur...

50
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,190
... to his death.

51
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,190
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

52
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,690
...were lost.

53
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,790
History became legend...

54
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,990
...legend became myth.

55
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,990
And for two and a half thousand years...

56
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,990
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

57
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,390
Until, when chance came...

58
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,190
...it ensnared a new bearer.

59
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,290
My precious.

60
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,190
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

61
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,190
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

62
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,490
And there it consumed him.

63
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,690
It came to me.

64
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,290
My own. My love. My own.

65
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,190
My precious.

66
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,290
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

67
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,290
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

68
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,990
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

69
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,590
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

70
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,690
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

71
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,690
... whispers of a nameless fear.

72
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,190
And the ring of power perceived...

73
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,190
...its time had now come.

74
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,290
It abandoned Gollum.

75
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,290
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

76
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,790
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

77
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,190
What's this?

78
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,890
A hobbit.

79
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,690
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

80
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,790
A ring.

81
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,790
Lost!

82
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,190
The 22nd day of September...

83
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,890
My precious is lost!

84
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,490
For the time will soon come...

85
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,790
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

86
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,090
...in the year 1400...

87
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,690
...by Shire-reckoning.

88
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,490
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

89
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,790
...the Shire...

90
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,790
...Middle-earth.

91
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,690
The third age of this world.

92
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,090
The Fellowship of the Ring.

93
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,990
There and back again.

94
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,690
A Hobbit's tale.

95
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,790
By Bilbo Baggins.

96
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,290
Now...

97
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
...where to begin?

98
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,490
Ah, yes....

99
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,790
"Concerning...

100
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,490
...Hobbits."

101
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,090
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

102
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,390
...for many hundreds of years...

103
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,690
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

104
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,790
...by the world of the big folk.

105
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,690
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

106
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,190
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

107
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,290
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

108
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,690
...nor counted among the very wise.

109
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,090
Frodo! Someone at the door.

110
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,890
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

111
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,390
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

112
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,090
A rather unfair observation...

113
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,790
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

114
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,090
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

115
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,390
But where our hearts truly lie...

116
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,690
...is in peace and quiet...

117
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,590
...and good, tilled earth.

118
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,890
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

119
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,390
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

120
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,790
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

121
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,290
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

122
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,790
Frodo, the door!

123
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,590
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

124
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,490
Frodo!

125
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,690
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

126
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,290
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

127
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,490
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

128
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,990
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

129
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,190
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

130
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,690
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

131
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,790
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

132
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,190
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

133
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,590
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

134
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,190
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

135
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,090
How is the old rascal?

136
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,190
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

137
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,790
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

138
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,990
Well, that should please him.

139
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,990
Half the Shire's been invited.

140
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,890
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

141
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,290
And so life in the Shire goes on...

142
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,590
... very much as it has this past age.

143
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,190
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

144
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,390
If it comes at all.

145
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,090
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

146
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,690
...passing from one generation to the next.

147
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,090
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

148
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,790
...in Bag End.

149
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,290
And there always will be.

150
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,290
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

151
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,890
I mean, more than usual.

152
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,790
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

153
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,490
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

154
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,990
Where's it gone?

155
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,790
He's up to something.

156
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,390
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

157
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,290
But I know you have something to do with it.

158
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,690
Good gracious me.

159
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,790
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

160
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,990
Indeed.

161
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,490
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

162
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,790
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

163
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,690
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

164
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,990
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

165
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,390
Oh, really?

166
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,990
Gandalf! Gandalf!

167
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,390
Fireworks, Gandalf!

168
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,990
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

169
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,990
Gandalf?

170
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,490
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

171
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,890
So am I.

172
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,190
No, thank you!

173
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,090
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

174
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,890
And what about very old friends?

175
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,890
Gandalf?

176
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,890
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

177
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,190
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

178
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,090
You haven't aged a day.

179
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,690
Come on, come in!

180
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,290
Welcome, welcome.

181
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,990
Oh, here we are.

182
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,190
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

183
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,090
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

184
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,190
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

185
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,890
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

186
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,790
Just tea, thank you.

187
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,890
I was expecting you sometime last week.

188
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,390
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

189
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,690
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

190
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,290
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

191
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,490
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

192
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,190
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

193
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,190
I've just found some sponge cake.

194
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,490
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

195
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,990
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

196
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,290
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

197
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,390
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

198
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,190
I'm not at home!

199
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,790
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

200
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,090
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

201
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,190
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

202
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,190
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

203
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,290
...never giving me a moment's peace.

204
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,590
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

205
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,290
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

206
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,390
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

207
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,890
All the arrangements are made.

208
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,490
Oh, thank you.

209
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,290
Frodo suspects something.

210
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,990
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

211
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,790
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

212
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,190
You will tell him, won't you?

213
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,090
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

214
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,890
I know.

215
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,590
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

216
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,490
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

217
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,490
The woods, the fields.

218
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,990
Little rivers.

219
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,190
I am old, Gandalf.

220
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,690
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

221
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,590
I feel thin.

222
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,490
Sort of stretched...

223
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,990
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

224
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,690
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

225
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,090
And I don't expect I shall return.

226
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,590
In fact, I mean not to.

227
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,190
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

228
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,290
Gandalf, my old friend...

229
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,190
...this will be a night to remember.

230
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,190
Hello, hello.

231
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,390
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

232
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,990
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

233
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,090
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

234
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,090
Go on!

235
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,990
So there I was...

236
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,290
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

237
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,490
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

238
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,990
...about how they were going to cook us.

239
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,190
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

240
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,790
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

241
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,590
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

242
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,090
...and turned them all to stone!

243
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,890
Quickly.

244
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,090
Up they go!

245
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,290
No no, the big one - big one

246
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,190
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

247
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,290
Are all these children yours?

248
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,390
Good gracious, you have been productive.

249
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,790
Bilbo?

250
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,190
Sackville-Bagginses!

251
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,490
Quickly, hide!

252
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,590
Thank you, my boy.

253
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,390
You're a good lad, Frodo.

254
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,490
I'm very selfish, you know.

255
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,390
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

256
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,990
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

257
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,690
...but it wasn't out of charity.

258
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,690
I think it was because...

259
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,090
...of all my numerous relations...

260
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,890
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

261
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,090
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

262
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,990
No.

263
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,790
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

264
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,290
The point is, Frodo...

265
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,390
...you'll be all right.

266
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,790
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

267
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,590
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

268
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,290
This was your idea.

269
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,690
Bilbo.

270
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,490
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

271
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,090
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

272
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,090
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

273
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,890
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

274
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,090
I might've known.

275
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,090
Speech, Bilbo!

276
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,390
Speech!

277
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,590
Speech!

278
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,090
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

279
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,990
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

280
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,690
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

281
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,990
...Hornblowers...

282
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,790
...Bolgers...

283
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,790
...Bracegirdles...

284
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,590
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

285
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,890
Today is my 111th birthday!

286
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,290
Happy birthday!

287
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,590
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

288
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,790
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

289
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,490
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

290
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:49,190
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

291
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,590
I have things to do.

292
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,090
I've put this off for far too long.

293
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,890
I regret to announce this is the end!

294
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,290
I'm going now.

295
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,290
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

296
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,890
Goodbye.

297
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,190
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

298
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,790
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

299
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,890
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

300
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,190
...and none of them should be used lightly.

301
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,390
It was just a bit of fun.

302
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,290
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

303
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,190
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

304
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,090
As often as I can spare them.

305
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,490
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

306
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,990
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

307
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,490
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

308
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,590
No. Wait, it's...

309
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,790
...here in my pocket.

310
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,590
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

311
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,790
Yet, after all, why not?

312
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,090
- Why shouldn’t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

313
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,790
Is that so hard?

314
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,390
Well, no.

315
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,290
And yes.

316
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,290
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

317
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,390
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

318
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,690
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

319
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,890
It's mine.

320
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,790
My own.

321
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,990
- My precious.
- Precious?

322
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,090
It's been called that before, but not by you.

323
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,890
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

324
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,890
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

325
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,890
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

326
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,290
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

327
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,190
I am not trying to rob you.

328
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,990
I'm trying to help you.

329
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,690
All your long years, we've been friends.

330
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,290
Trust me as you once did.

331
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,990
Let it go.

332
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,490
You're right, Gandalf.

333
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,290
The ring must go to Frodo.

334
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,690
It's late. The road is long.

335
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,390
Yes, it is time.

336
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,990
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

337
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,890
I've thought up an ending for my book:

338
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,390
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

339
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,190
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

340
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,690
Goodbye, Gandalf.

341
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,990
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

342
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,990
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

343
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,090
Until our next meeting.

344
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,990
It's mine. My own.

345
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,690
My precious.

346
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,790
Riddles in the dark.

347
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,590
Bilbo!

348
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,190
Bilbo!

349
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,890
My precious.

350
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,590
Precious.

351
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,290
He's gone, hasn't he?

352
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,190
He talked for so long about leaving...

353
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,090
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

354
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,590
Gandalf?

355
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,490
Bilbo's ring.

356
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,190
He's gone to stay with the elves.

357
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,390
He's left you Bag End.

358
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,690
Along with all his possessions.

359
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,690
The ring is yours now.

360
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,790
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

361
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,190
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

362
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,590
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

363
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,190
I don't understand.

364
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,590
Neither do I.

365
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,190
Keep it secret.

366
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,190
Keep it safe.

367
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,290
Shire!

368
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,690
Baggins!

369
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,090
"The year 3434 of the second age.

370
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,590
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

371
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,590
...and the finding of the ring of power."

372
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,990
"It has come to me.

373
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,590
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

374
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,190
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

375
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,190
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

376
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,990
It is precious to me...

377
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,490
...though I buy it with great pain.

378
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,690
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

379
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,690
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

380
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,990
A secret now that only fire can tell."

381
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,690
Shire...

382
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,790
...Baggins.

383
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,290
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

384
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,490
That way.

385
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,390
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

386
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,790
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

387
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,290
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

388
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,390
<i>But there still be...</i>

389
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,990
<i>...many miles to go</i>

390
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,190
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

391
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,490
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

392
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,590
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

393
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,190
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

394
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,390
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

395
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,590
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

396
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,690
War is brewing.

397
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,090
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

398
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,090
Far-off tales and children’s stories, that's all that is.

399
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,690
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

400
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,690
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

401
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,490
And proud of it.

402
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,090
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

403
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,090
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

404
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,490
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

405
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,190
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

406
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,790
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

407
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,390
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

408
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,990
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

409
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,290
Does she?

410
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,890
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

411
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,190
Is it secret? Is it safe?

412
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,190
What are you doing?

413
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,390
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

414
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,790
It's quite cool.

415
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,990
What can you see?

416
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,190
Can you see anything?

417
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,390
Nothing.

418
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,890
There's nothing.

419
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,590
Wait.

420
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,890
There are markings.

421
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,790
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

422
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,490
There are few who can.

423
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,790
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

424
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,690
Mordor!

425
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,890
In the common tongue, it says:

426
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,590
"One ring to rule them all...

427
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,190
...One ring to find them...

428
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,590
...One ring to bring them all...

429
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,890
...and in the darkness bind them."

430
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,590
This is the One ring...

431
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,890
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

432
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,190
Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself.

433
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,590
Bilbo found it.

434
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,990
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

435
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,690
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

436
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,290
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

437
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,290
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

438
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,990
The ring has awoken.

439
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,890
It's heard its master's call.

440
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,890
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

441
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,790
No, Frodo.

442
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,090
The spirit of Sauron endured.

443
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:05,490
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

444
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,090
Sauron has returned.

445
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,090
His orcs have multiplied.

446
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,290
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

447
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,190
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

448
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,590
He is seeking it.

449
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,490
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

450
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,590
For the ring yearns above all else...

451
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,190
...to return to the hand of its master.

452
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,290
They are one...

453
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,390
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

454
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,790
Frodo...

455
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,090
...he must never find it.

456
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,390
All right.

457
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,990
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

458
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,890
No one knows it's here, do they?

459
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,790
Do they, Gandalf?

460
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,190
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

461
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,390
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

462
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,790
But the enemy found him first.

463
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,090
I don't know how long they tortured him.

464
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,690
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

465
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,090
Shire!

466
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,890
Baggins!

467
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,990
Shire.

468
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,890
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

469
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,890
Who goes there?

470
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,890
Take it, Gandalf!

471
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,390
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

472
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,790
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

473
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,290
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

474
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,090
I dare not take it.

475
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,890
Not even to keep it safe.

476
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,090
Understand, Frodo...

477
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,290
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

478
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,290
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

479
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,990
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

480
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,490
No, it can't.

481
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,290
What must I do?

482
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,290
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

483
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,890
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

484
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,290
Bree.

485
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,190
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

486
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,890
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

487
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,790
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

488
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,990
I don't have any answers.

489
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:48,890
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

490
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,390
He'll know what to do.

491
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,790
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

492
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,590
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

493
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,490
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

494
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,390
I can cut across country easily enough.

495
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,290
My dear Frodo.

496
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,590
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

497
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,590
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

498
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,190
And yet, after a hundred years...

499
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,390
...they can still surprise you.

500
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,490
Get down.

501
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,990
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

502
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,790
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

503
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,690
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

504
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,390
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

505
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,490
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

506
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,790
Nothing important.

507
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,790
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

508
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,490
...and something about the end of the world but...

509
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,190
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

510
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,690
No?

511
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,090
Perhaps not.

512
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,690
I've thought of a better use for you.

513
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,390
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

514
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,190
Be careful, both of you.

515
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,190
The enemy has many spies in his service:

516
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,290
Birds, beasts.

517
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,990
Is it safe?

518
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,990
Never put it on...

519
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,590
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

520
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,290
Always remember, Frodo...

521
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,890
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

522
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,490
It wants to be found.

523
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,190
This is it.

524
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,690
This is what?

525
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,090
If I take one more step...

526
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,390
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

527
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,290
Come on, Sam.

528
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,590
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

529
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,790
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

530
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,390
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

531
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,690
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

532
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,490
Sam.

533
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,190
Wood-elves.

534
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,290
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

535
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,590
To the Grey Havens.

536
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,290
They're leaving Middle-earth.

537
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,590
Never to return.

538
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,590
I don't know why...

539
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,790
...it makes me sad.

540
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,290
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

541
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,990
Just shut your eyes...

542
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,790
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

543
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,990
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

544
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,990
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

545
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,990
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

546
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,690
Me neither, Sam.

547
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,290
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

548
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,190
The hour grows late.

549
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,790
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

550
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,590
...seeking my counsel.

551
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,690
For that is why you have come, is it not?

552
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,190
My old friend.

553
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,090
Saruman.

554
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,890
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

555
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,990
So the ring of power has been found.

556
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,290
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

557
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,790
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

558
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,690
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

559
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:47,590
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

560
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,390
Time?

561
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,990
What time do you think we have?

562
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,190
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

563
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,690
He cannot yet take physical form...

564
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,590
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

565
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:08,190
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

566
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:14,690
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

567
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,490
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

568
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:25,490
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

569
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,390
The eye of Sauron.

570
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,190
He is gathering all evil to him.

571
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,390
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

572
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,490
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

573
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,190
You know this?

574
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,290
How?

575
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,490
I have seen it.

576
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,090
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

577
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,390
Why?

578
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,490
Why should we fear to use it?

579
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:59,090
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

580
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,490
We do not know who else may be watching.

581
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,890
The hour is later than you think.

582
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,390
Sauron's forces are already moving.

583
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,390
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

584
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,790
The Nine?

585
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,890
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

586
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,890
...disguised as riders in black.

587
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,990
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

588
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,890
And kill the one who carries it.

589
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,790
Frodo!

590
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,790
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

591
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,390
There are none who can.

592
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,590
Against the power of Mordor...

593
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,490
...there can be no victory.

594
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,590
We must join with him, Gandalf.

595
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,190
We must join with Sauron.

596
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,490
It would be wise, my friend.

597
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,590
Tell me...

598
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,290
...friend...

599
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:24,190
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

600
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,490
I gave you the chance of...

601
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,290
...aiding me willingly...

602
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,590
...but you have elected the way of pain!

603
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,490
Mr. Frodo?

604
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,890
Frodo? Frodo!

605
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,490
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

606
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,590
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

607
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:53,290
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

608
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,290
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

609
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,290
Frodo.

610
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,790
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

611
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,390
Get off him.

612
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,390
Come on, Frodo.

613
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,390
What's the meaning of this?

614
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,890
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

615
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,290
You get back here!

616
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,590
Get out of my field!

617
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,490
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

618
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,690
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

619
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,090
And some cabbages.

620
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,190
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

621
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,290
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

622
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,790
...he's clearly overreacting.

623
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,490
Run!

624
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,490
Oh, that was close.

625
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,690
I think I've broken something.

626
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,090
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

627
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,790
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

628
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,390
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

629
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,590
That's mine.

630
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,990
That's nice, Merry.

631
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,590
Here's a nice one, Sam.

632
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,190
I think we should get off the road.

633
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,890
Get off the road!

634
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,490
Quick!

635
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,690
Be quiet!

636
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,190
What was that?

637
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,390
Anything?

638
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,590
Nothing.

639
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,590
What is going on?

640
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,790
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

641
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,690
Frodo?

642
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,490
Get down!

643
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,590
I have to leave the Shire.

644
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,990
Sam and I must get to Bree.

645
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:14,590
Right.

646
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:18,190
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

647
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,790
Run!

648
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,990
This way! Follow me!

649
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:35,690
Run!

650
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,690
Get the rope, Sam!

651
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,890
Frodo!

652
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,990
Run, Frodo!

653
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,490
Go!
- Hurry!

654
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,190
Frodo, come on!

655
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,290
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

656
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:23,290
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

657
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,590
Come on.

658
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:54,090
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

659
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,490
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

660
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,490
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

661
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,190
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

662
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,790
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

663
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,490
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

664
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,690
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

665
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,990
Can't be too careful.

666
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,090
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

667
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,790
Excuse me.

668
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,590
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

669
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:18,690
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

670
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:23,690
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

671
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,890
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

672
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,690
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

673
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:33,990
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

674
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,190
Gandalf.

675
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,690
Oh, yes...

676
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,990
...I remember. Elderly chap.

677
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,290
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

678
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,490
Not seen him for six months.

679
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,690
What do we do now?

680
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,090
Sam...

681
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,090
...he'll be here. He'll come.

682
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,990
Get out of my way!

683
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,090
What's that?

684
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,690
This, my friend, is a pint.

685
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,590
It comes in pints?

686
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,490
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

687
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,690
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

688
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,890
Excuse me.

689
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,590
That man in the corner. Who is he?

690
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:48,190
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

691
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:52,890
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

692
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,590
Strider.

693
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,790
<i>Baggins...</i>

694
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:18,890
<i>Baggins...</i>

695
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,590
<i>Baggins...</i>

696
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,290
<i>Baggins...</i>

697
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,890
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

698
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,190
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

699
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,490
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

700
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,790
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

701
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,090
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

702
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,090
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

703
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:26,090
<i>I see you.</i>

704
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,590
<i>There is no life...</i>

705
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,890
<i>...in the void.</i>

706
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,590
<i>Only...</i>

707
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,090
<i>...death.</i>

708
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:47,790
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

709
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,590
What do you want?

710
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,890
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

711
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:59,290
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

712
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,090
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

713
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,890
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

714
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,090
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

715
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,390
Yes.

716
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,390
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

717
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,890
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

718
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,690
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

719
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,890
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

720
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:32,190
They're coming.

721
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,290
What are they?

722
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,590
They were once men.

723
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,990
Great kings of men.

724
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,590
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

725
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:11,390
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

726
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,890
One by one, falling into darkness.

727
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,590
Now they are slaves to his will.

728
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,690
They are the Nazgûl.

729
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,490
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

730
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:26,890
At all times they feel...

731
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,890
... the presence of the ring...

732
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:33,490
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

733
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,490
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

734
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,690
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

735
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,890
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

736
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:06,090
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

737
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:09,590
We have no choice but to trust him.

738
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,090
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

739
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,790
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

740
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,190
We're going to see the elves.

741
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,990
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

742
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,990
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

743
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,390
What about second breakfast?

744
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,790
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

745
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:05,290
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

746
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,690
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

747
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,890
Pippin!

748
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,690
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

749
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:55,490
<i>"Tinúviel elvanui
(Tinúviel the elven-fair)</i>

750
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:03,690
<i>Elleth alfirin ethelhael
(Immortal maiden elven-wise)</i>

751
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:10,990
<i>O hon ring finnil fuinui
(About him cast her night-dark hair)</i>

752
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:15,490
<i>A renc gelebrin thiliol."
(And arms like silver glimmering.")</i>

753
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,890
Who is she?

754
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:21,090
This woman you sing of.

755
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:26,990
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

756
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:32,190
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

757
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,290
What happened to her?

758
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,990
She died.

759
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,290
Get some sleep, Frodo.

760
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:01,690
The power of Isengard is at your command...

761
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:06,190
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

762
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:15,390
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

763
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,390
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

764
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,890
We have work to do.

765
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:15,190
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

766
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:17,590
Rip them all down.

767
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,790
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

768
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:52,090
We shall rest here tonight.

769
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,190
These are for you.
Keep them close.

770
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,990
I'm going to have a look around.

771
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,290
Stay here.

772
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,090
My tomato's burst.

773
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,190
Could I have some bacon?

774
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,290
Want a tomato, Sam?

775
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:27,290
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

776
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,190
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

777
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:34,290
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

778
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,590
Go!

779
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,590
Back, you devils!

780
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,290
Frodo!

781
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,190
Oh, Sam.

782
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,290
Strider!

783
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:56,290
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

784
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:02,690
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

785
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,490
Hurry!

786
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:12,590
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

787
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,690
Hold on, Frodo.

788
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,290
Gandalf!

789
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,490
Gwaihir - Go.

790
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:58,390
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

791
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,390
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

792
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,090
Is he going to die?

793
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:13,090
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

794
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:22,090
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

795
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,890
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

796
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,090
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

797
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,390
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

798
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,890
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

799
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,290
Frodo.

800
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:18,990
Im Arwen - Telin le thaed.
(l am Arwen - l've come to help you.)

801
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:24,390
Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice...come back to the light.)

802
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,590
Who is she?

803
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,990
Frodo.

804
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,690
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

805
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,290
He's not going to last.

806
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:45,090
We must get him to my father.

807
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,690
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

808
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:54,890
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

809
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,790
Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon.
(Stay with the Hobbits, l'll send horses for you.)

810
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:01,390
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.
(l'm the faster rider, l'll take him.)

811
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:02,890
Andelu i ven.
(The Road is too dangerous.)

812
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,090
What are they saying?

813
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:06,190
Frodo fîr. Ae athradon i hîr...
(Frodo is dying. lf l can get across the river...)

814
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:09,790
...tûr gwaith nîn beriatha hon.
(...the power of my people will protect him.)

815
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,790
I do not fear them.

816
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,990
Be iest lîn.
(As you wish.)

817
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,190
Arwen...

818
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:26,390
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

819
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:35,790
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

820
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,290
Noro lim, Asfaloth!
(Ride fast Asfaloth!)

821
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:33,890
Give up the halfling, She-elf.

822
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,690
If you want him, come and claim him.

823
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,990
Nîn o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

824
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:51,390
...lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

825
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:54,390
Rimmo nˆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths)

826
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:55,990
Nîn o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

827
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,490
...lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

828
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,390
Rimmo nˆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths)

829
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:33,090
No. No!

830
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:38,590
Frodo, no.

831
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,090
Frodo, don't give in.

832
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,290
Not now.

833
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,790
What grace is given me...

834
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,290
...let it pass to him.

835
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:01,690
Let him be spared.

836
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:04,290
Save him.

837
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,490
Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice...come back to the light.)

838
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:21,790
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

839
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:28,590
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

840
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:34,490
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

841
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:39,290
And you're lucky to be here too.

842
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:43,890
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

843
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:48,190
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

844
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,390
What happened, Gandalf?

845
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:04,690
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

846
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,190
I was delayed.

847
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:16,290
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

848
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:25,090
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

849
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:28,190
Embrace the power of the ring...

850
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,290
...or embrace your own destruction!

851
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,390
There is only one lord of the ring.

852
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:41,690
Only one who can bend it to his will.

853
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:46,490
And he does not share power.

854
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,090
So you have chosen...death.

855
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:17,990
Gandalf? What is it?

856
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:20,890
Nothing, Frodo.

857
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,490
Frodo!

858
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,090
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

859
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:30,090
Sam has hardly left your side.

860
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,490
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

861
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:37,990
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

862
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:43,090
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

863
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:34,390
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

864
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,490
Bilbo.

865
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,390
There and back again

866
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:46,090
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

867
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,690
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

868
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:56,790
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

869
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,590
...visit Lake-town...

870
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:03,190
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

871
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:08,490
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

872
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,590
I miss the Shire.

873
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:27,990
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

874
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,890
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

875
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,390
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

876
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,890
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

877
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,390
My dear boy.

878
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:58,390
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

879
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:00,990
No harm in being prepared.

880
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:03,790
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

881
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,790
- More than anything.
- I did.

882
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,090
It's just....

883
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:12,390
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

884
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:16,190
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

885
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,790
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

886
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,690
Off home.

887
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,790
You are right, Sam.

888
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,790
We did what we set out to do.

889
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,890
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

890
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:42,390
I am ready to go home.

891
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:45,090
His strength returns.

892
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:50,890
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

893
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:54,190
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

894
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:57,990
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

895
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:01,690
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

896
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:07,190
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

897
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:12,090
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

898
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:15,090
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

899
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:18,590
Our list of allies grows thin.

900
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,090
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

901
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:25,890
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

902
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,590
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

903
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:33,390
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

904
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:36,090
Saruman is coming for the ring.

905
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:40,490
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

906
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:45,090
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

907
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:50,090
Gandalf...

908
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:53,890
...the ring cannot stay here.

909
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,690
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

910
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:19,690
They must decide now how to end it.

911
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:24,190
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

912
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:28,490
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

913
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:33,790
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

914
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,290
It is in men that we must place our hope.

915
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:40,390
Men?

916
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:44,390
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

917
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:48,990
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

918
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:52,890
It is because of men the ring survives.

919
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:54,790
I was there, Gandalf.

920
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:58,290
I was there 3000 years ago...

921
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:07,490
... when Isildur took the ring.

922
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:11,490
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

923
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,690
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

924
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:21,890
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

925
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:25,690
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

926
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:28,390
Cast it into the fire!

927
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:37,290
- Destroy it!
- No.

928
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:40,890
Isildur!

929
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:45,990
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

930
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:54,390
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

931
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:58,990
There's no strength left in the world of men.

932
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:03,990
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

933
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:07,590
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

934
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:13,090
He turned from that path a long time ago.

935
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:15,490
He has chosen exile.

936
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:48,490
You are no elf.

937
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,790
Men of the South are welcome here.

938
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:54,890
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

939
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:59,190
Then we are here on common purpose...

940
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,990
...friend.

941
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:19,190
The shards of Narsil.

942
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,990
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

943
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:32,290
It's still sharp.

944
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:44,190
But no more than a broken heirloom.

945
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:14,190
Why do you fear the past?

946
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:20,190
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

947
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:23,990
You are not bound to his fate.

948
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:28,390
The same blood flows in my veins.

949
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:34,090
The same weakness.

950
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:39,590
Your time will come.

951
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:44,090
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

952
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:50,090
A si i-Dhuath ú-orthor, Aragorn.
(The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn)

953
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:54,390
Ú or le a ú or nin.
(Not over you, not over me.)

954
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:09,490
Renich i lú i erui govannem?
(Do you remember when we first met?)

955
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:16,290
Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.
(I thought I had strayed into a dream.)

956
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,890
Gwenwin in enninath.
(Long years have passed.)

957
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:24,590
Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.
(You did not wear the troubles you carry now.)

958
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:28,890
Renech i beth i pennen?
(Do you remember what I told you?)

959
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:37,390
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

960
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:44,290
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

961
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,490
And to that I hold.

962
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:51,190
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

963
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:55,290
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

964
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:07,490
I choose a mortal life.

965
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:13,090
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

966
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:18,890
...like my heart.

967
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,390
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

968
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:42,490
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

969
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:47,990
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

970
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:51,790
You will unite, or you will fall.

971
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,290
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

972
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,590
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

973
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,490
So it is true.

974
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:28,790
<i>The ring of power...</i>

975
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:32,390
<i>The doom of men...</i>

976
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,990
In a dream...

977
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:41,890
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

978
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:43,890
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

979
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:46,490
A voice was crying:

980
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:49,590
"Your doom is near at hand.

981
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:53,390
Isildur's bane is found."

982
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,190
Isildur’s bane.

983
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:00,090
Boromir!

984
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:03,490
"Ash nazg durbatulûk...
("One ring to rule them all...)

985
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:07,290
...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

986
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:10,890
...Ash nazg thrakatulûk...
(...One ring to bring them all...)

987
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:18,190
...agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."
(...and in the darkness bind them.")

988
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:27,990
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

989
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:31,890
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

990
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:34,190
...for the black speech of Mordor...

991
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:35,890
...may yet be heard...

992
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:38,990
...in every corner of the West!

993
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:41,890
The ring is altogether evil.

994
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:43,790
It is a gift.

995
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:46,490
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

996
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,190
Why not use this ring?

997
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,190
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

998
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:56,590
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

999
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:59,190
...are your lands kept safe.

1000
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:05,190
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1001
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:09,190
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1002
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:13,890
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1003
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:17,690
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1004
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:19,890
This is no mere ranger.

1005
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:24,490
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1006
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:27,990
You owe him your allegiance.

1007
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:34,090
Aragorn.

1008
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:38,690
This is Isildur’s heir?

1009
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:43,790
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1010
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,590
Havo dad, Legolas.
(Sit down, Legolas.)

1011
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:53,490
Gondor has no king.

1012
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,090
Gondor needs no king.

1013
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:07,290
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1014
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:11,790
You have only one choice.

1015
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:14,390
The ring must be destroyed.

1016
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:22,190
What are we waiting for?

1017
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,290
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1018
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:41,790
...by any craft that we here possess.

1019
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:46,390
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1020
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:50,490
Only there can it be unmade.

1021
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:54,190
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1022
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:58,790
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1023
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:01,290
<i>Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)</i>

1024
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,390
One of you...

1025
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:06,090
...must do this.

1026
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:12,690
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1027
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:17,190
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1028
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:22,090
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1029
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:26,590
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1030
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:29,390
It is a barren wasteland...

1031
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:33,090
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1032
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:37,290
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1033
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:41,690
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1034
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:46,390
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1035
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:49,190
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1036
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:53,990
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1037
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:59,490
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1038
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:04,090
Never trust an elf!

1039
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:10,990
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1040
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:14,290
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1041
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,690
<i>Ash Nazg Durbatuluk
(One ring to rule them all...)</i>

1042
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,190
<i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)</i>

1043
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,290
<i>Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)</i>

1044
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:24,290
<i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)</i>

1045
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,290
<i>Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)</i>

1046
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,490
<i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)</i>

1047
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:30,590
<i>Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)</i>

1048
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:35,090
I will take it.

1049
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:39,890
I will take it.

1050
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:48,690
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1051
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:58,090
Though...

1052
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:03,090
...I do not know the way.

1053
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:09,190
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1054
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,890
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1055
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:17,090
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1056
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:19,190
...I will.

1057
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:24,690
You have my sword.

1058
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,590
And you have my bow.

1059
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:31,590
And my ax.

1060
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:41,590
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1061
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:47,290
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1062
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,390
...then Gondor will see it done.

1063
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:57,590
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1064
01:44:57,990 --> 01:45:02,690
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1065
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:05,190
Oy. We're coming too!

1066
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:10,090
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1067
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:13,490
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1068
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:15,190
...mission.

1069
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,740
Quest.

1070
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,240
Thing.

1071
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,740
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1072
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,240
Nine companions.

1073
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,840
So be it.

1074
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:33,240
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1075
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,740
Great!

1076
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,240
Where are we going?

1077
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,140
Anirne hene beriad i chen lîn.
(She wanted to protect her child.)

1078
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,840
Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.
(She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.)

1079
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,240
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1080
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,540
That you'd never escape your fate.

1081
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,440
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

1082
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:38,840
...but only you have the power to wield it.

1083
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,440
I do not want that power.

1084
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,340
I have never wanted it.

1085
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,140
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1086
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,040
My old sword! Sting.

1087
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,540
Here, take it. Take it.

1088
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:06,740
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

1089
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:11,540
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

1090
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:16,440
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1091
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:19,140
Here's a pretty thing.

1092
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,840
Mithril.

1093
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:25,940
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1094
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:29,440
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1095
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,640
My old ring.

1096
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:44,740
I should very much like...

1097
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:48,940
...to hold it again, one last time.

1098
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,940
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1099
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:14,340
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1100
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:22,040
I'm sorry for everything.

1101
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:41,240
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

1102
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:45,140
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1103
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:48,540
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1104
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,440
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1105
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,740
May the blessings of elves and men...

1106
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:02,040
...and all free folk go with you.

1107
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:09,040
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1108
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:30,140
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1109
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,540
Left.

1110
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:56,340
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1111
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:00,340
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1112
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:04,340
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1113
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:08,240
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1114
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:11,240
Move your feet.

1115
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,740
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1116
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,440
Faster!

1117
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:19,440
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1118
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:22,340
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1119
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,940
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1120
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,340
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1121
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:35,940
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1122
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,540
Sorry!

1123
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,740
Get him!

1124
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:52,540
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1125
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:55,440
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1126
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,840
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1127
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,940
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1128
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:06,840
It's moving fast.

1129
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,340
Against the wind.

1130
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,240
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1131
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,140
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1132
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:50,340
Spies of Saruman.

1133
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:54,240
The passage south is being watched.

1134
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:58,840
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1135
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,040
Frodo!

1136
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,340
Boromir.

1137
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:38,840
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1138
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,040
...over so small a thing.

1139
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,340
Such a little thing.

1140
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,040
Boromir!

1141
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:52,240
Give the ring to Frodo.

1142
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:04,140
As you wish.

1143
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,940
I care not.

1144
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:46,840
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1145
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:51,740
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1146
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:56,040
If the mountain defeats you...

1147
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:00,640
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

1148
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:12,940
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1149
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,940
There is a fell voice on the air.

1150
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,140
Nai yarvaxea rasselya!
(May your horn be bloodstained!)

1151
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,640
It's Saruman!

1152
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:32,040
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1153
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,240
No!

1154
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:42,340
Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!
(Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!)

1155
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:47,640
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1156
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,140
Nai yarvaxea rasselya...
(May your bloodstained horn...)

1157
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:55,840
...taltuva notto-carinnar!
(...fall upon enemy heads!)

1158
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:42,540
We must get off the mountain!

1159
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:47,240
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1160
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:50,840
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1161
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:54,740
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1162
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:57,840
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1163
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:03,340
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1164
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:09,040
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1165
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:14,840
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1166
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:19,540
Shadow and flame.

1167
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,740
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1168
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,640
We cannot stay here!

1169
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,540
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1170
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,440
Frodo?

1171
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:43,240
We will go through the mines.

1172
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,040
So be it.

1173
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:56,440
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1174
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:02,240
How is your shoulder?

1175
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:05,640
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1176
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:09,840
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1177
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:13,140
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1178
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:17,440
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1179
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:20,240
And, I fear, from within.

1180
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,040
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1181
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:30,040
Trust your own strengths.

1182
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,940
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1183
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:35,140
...for good or for evil.

1184
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,640
Some are greater than I am.

1185
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:41,640
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1186
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,540
The walls...

1187
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,340
...of Moria.

1188
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,040
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1189
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,540
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1190
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:03,540
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1191
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:14,740
Well, let's see.

1192
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,540
Ithildin.

1193
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:20,440
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1194
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:39,040
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1195
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:44,040
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1196
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:48,740
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

1197
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:54,540
Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!
(Gate of the elves, open now for me!)

1198
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:09,140
...lasto beth lammen.
(...listen to the word of my tongue.)

1199
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,640
Nothing's happening.

1200
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,840
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

1201
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:28,040
...men and orcs.

1202
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:29,540
What are you going to do, then?

1203
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:31,940
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1204
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:34,140
And if that does not shatter them...

1205
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:37,040
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1206
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:40,640
...I will try to find the opening words.

1207
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,240
Ando Eldarinwa...
(Gate of elves...)

1208
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:50,440
...a lasta quettanya...
(...listen to my word...)

1209
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:53,140
...Fenda Casarinwa...
(...threshold of dwarves...)

1210
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:56,040
Mines are no place for a pony.

1211
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:00,240
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1212
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:01,640
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

1213
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:04,340
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1214
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,540
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1215
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,840
Do not disturb the water.

1216
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:20,040
Oh, it's useless.

1217
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:34,840
It's a riddle.

1218
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:40,740
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1219
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,040
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1220
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,740
Mellon.

1221
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:09,540
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1222
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:15,640
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1223
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:20,340
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1224
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:23,240
And they call it a mine.

1225
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,340
A mine!

1226
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,640
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1227
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,440
No....

1228
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:40,340
No!

1229
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:44,540
Goblins.

1230
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:52,640
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1231
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,340
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1232
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,540
- Frodo!
- Help!

1233
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,440
Strider!

1234
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,240
- Help!
- Get off him!

1235
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:07,540
Aragorn!

1236
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,040
Frodo!

1237
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:46,440
Into the mines!

1238
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:49,740
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1239
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:55,840
Run!

1240
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:16,340
We now have but one choice.

1241
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:21,240
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1242
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,640
Be on your guard.

1243
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:27,240
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

1244
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:30,940
...in the deep places of the world.

1245
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,740
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1246
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,840
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1247
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:36,340
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1248
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:39,040
...or jewels...

1249
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:42,240
...but mithril.

1250
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:05,340
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1251
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,640
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1252
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,740
I never told him...

1253
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:16,740
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

1254
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:30,940
Pippin.

1255
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:54,140
I have no memory of this place.

1256
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,740
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1257
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:00,440
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1258
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,140
- Merry?
- What?

1259
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,240
I'm hungry.

1260
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:19,940
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1261
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:24,240
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1262
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:28,740
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1263
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:31,140
...or was set loose.

1264
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:35,240
Now the ring has brought him here.

1265
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:40,640
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1266
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:46,440
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

1267
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:51,540
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1268
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:57,640
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1269
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,540
Before it drove him mad.

1270
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:04,640
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1271
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:06,040
Pity?

1272
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:10,040
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1273
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:16,040
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1274
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,140
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1275
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:26,440
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1276
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:29,540
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1277
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:35,940
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1278
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,740
...before this is over.

1279
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:45,040
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1280
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:55,140
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1281
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,640
I wish none of this had happened.

1282
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:03,640
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1283
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:10,040
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1284
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:15,540
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1285
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:18,540
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1286
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:23,240
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1287
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:26,640
And that is an encouraging thought.

1288
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,540
It's that way.

1289
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,040
- He's remembered.
- No.

1290
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:39,940
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1291
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:45,240
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1292
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:04,340
Let me risk a little more light.

1293
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:11,140
Behold...

1294
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:16,740
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1295
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:22,640
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1296
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:49,440
Gimli!

1297
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,440
No!

1298
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,140
Oh, no.

1299
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,240
No.

1300
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,540
"Here lies Balin...

1301
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,040
...son of Fundin...

1302
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,940
...Lord of Moria."

1303
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,640
He is dead, then.

1304
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:28,140
It's as I feared.

1305
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:49,240
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1306
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:54,040
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1307
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,840
We have barred the gates...

1308
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:00,940
...but cannot hold them for long.

1309
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:03,940
The ground shakes.

1310
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:05,940
Drums...

1311
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:09,640
...drums in the deep.

1312
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,340
We cannot get out.

1313
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:21,140
A shadow moves in the dark.

1314
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:25,440
We cannot get out.

1315
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:30,340
They are coming."

1316
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,340
Fool of a Took!

1317
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:19,340
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1318
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,140
Frodo!

1319
02:13:49,540 --> 02:13:50,940
Orcs.

1320
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:59,940
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1321
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:08,940
They have a cave-troll.

1322
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:25,940
Let them come!

1323
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:29,740
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1324
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:51,540
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1325
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,040
Frodo!

1326
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,340
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1327
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:36,240
Frodo!

1328
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:23,340
Frodo!

1329
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:24,940
Oh, no.

1330
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:35,140
He's alive.

1331
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:40,540
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1332
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:42,940
You should be dead.

1333
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,640
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1334
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:50,540
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1335
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,640
Mithril.

1336
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,940
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1337
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:10,740
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1338
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,540
This way!

1339
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:40,840
What is this new devilry?

1340
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,840
A Balrog.

1341
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:03,240
A demon of the ancient world.

1342
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:07,840
This foe is beyond any of you.

1343
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:10,640
Run!

1344
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:19,440
Quickly!

1345
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:37,440
Gandalf.

1346
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:39,540
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1347
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,540
The bridge is near.

1348
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:49,540
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1349
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,440
Gandalf!

1350
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:40,040
Merry! Pippin!

1351
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:52,640
Sam!

1352
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:58,540
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1353
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:03,140
Not the beard!

1354
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:18,340
Steady.

1355
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:21,940
Hold on!

1356
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:44,340
Hang on!

1357
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,740
Lean forward!

1358
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:00,740
Steady.

1359
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:03,240
Come on!

1360
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,940
Now!

1361
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,840
Over the bridge!

1362
02:25:24,140 --> 02:25:25,640
Fly!

1363
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:12,340
You cannot pass!

1364
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,240
Gandalf!

1365
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:23,240
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1366
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:28,040
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

1367
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,140
Go back to the Shadow.

1368
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:52,240
You - shall not - pass!

1369
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:23,240
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1370
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,440
Fly, you fools!

1371
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:39,740
No!

1372
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:48,040
Aragorn!

1373
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:48,240
Legolas, get them up.

1374
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:54,140
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1375
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:57,940
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1376
02:28:58,340 --> 02:29:01,440
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1377
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:05,740
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1378
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,540
On your feet, Sam.

1379
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:11,340
Frodo?

1380
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:15,040
Frodo!

1381
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:10,040
Stay close, young hobbits!

1382
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:14,940
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1383
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:17,640
An elf-witch...

1384
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:21,140
...of terrible power.

1385
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:23,940
All who look upon her...

1386
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:25,940
...fall under her spell.

1387
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,440
<i>Frodo!</i>

1388
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:31,740
And are never seen again.

1389
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:36,240
<i>Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1390
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:40,240
<i>You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.</i>

1391
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,240
Mr. Frodo?

1392
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:53,140
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1393
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:57,840
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1394
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,040
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1395
02:31:14,340 --> 02:31:17,540
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
(Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.)

1396
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:19,840
Govannas vîn gwennen le,
(Our fellowship stands in your debt,)

1397
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:21,740
Haldir o Lórien.
(Haldir of Lórien.)

1398
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:25,540
A, Aragorn in Dúnedain...
(Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...)

1399
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:28,040
...istannen le ammen.
(...you are known to us.)

1400
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:28,840
Haldir.

1401
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,540
So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

1402
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,740
Speak words we can all understand!

1403
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:37,340
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

1404
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:40,140
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

1405
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:45,140
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
(I spit upon your grave!)

1406
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:49,040
That was not so courteous.

1407
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:59,540
You bring great evil with you.

1408
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:03,640
You can go no further.

1409
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,740
Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!
(We need your protection. The road is fell!)

1410
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:16,940
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1411
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:19,140
Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn!
(Please, understand, we need your support!)

1412
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:23,340
Aragorn!

1413
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,840
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1414
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:40,040
Andelu i ven.
(The road is very dangerous.)

1415
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:43,540
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1416
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:46,640
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1417
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:51,440
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1418
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:55,540
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1419
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,440
You will follow me.

1420
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:14,140
Cares Galeton.

1421
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:17,640
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1422
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:23,340
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1423
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:45,640
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1424
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:51,340
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1425
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:57,540
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1426
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,840
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1427
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:03,040
For I much desire to speak with him.

1428
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:05,940
I can no longer see him from afar.

1429
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:11,940
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1430
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:14,740
He has fallen into shadow.

1431
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:23,840
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1432
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:29,240
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1433
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:33,440
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1434
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:38,740
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1435
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:42,740
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1436
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:51,640
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1437
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:54,240
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1438
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:58,740
For the world has grown full of peril...

1439
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:02,940
...and in all lands...

1440
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:06,640
...love is now mingled with grief.

1441
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:22,040
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1442
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:25,540
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1443
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:31,840
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1444
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:34,940
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1445
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:38,640
...to the ruin of all.

1446
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:48,640
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

1447
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:54,940
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1448
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:59,140
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1449
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:03,540
Tonight, you will sleep....

1450
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:07,240
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1451
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:10,540
<i>...one who has seen the eye!</i>

1452
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:27,740
A lament for Gandalf.

1453
02:37:35,140 --> 02:37:36,540
What do they say about him?

1454
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,440
I have not the heart to tell you.

1455
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,640
For me, the grief is still too near.

1456
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:50,440
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1457
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:53,640
There should be a verse about them.

1458
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:59,040
The finest rockets ever seen

1459
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:03,040
They burst in stars of blue and green

1460
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:09,140
Or after thunder, silver showers

1461
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:12,640
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1462
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:16,740
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1463
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:30,240
Take some rest.

1464
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:33,140
These borders are well-protected.

1465
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:35,840
I will find no rest here.

1466
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:41,640
I heard her voice inside my head.

1467
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:45,640
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1468
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:51,140
She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

1469
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:55,440
But I cannot see it.

1470
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:59,340
It is long since we had any hope.

1471
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:11,740
My father is a noble man.

1472
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:14,740
But his rule is failing...

1473
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:20,340
...and our people lose faith.

1474
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:25,340
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1475
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:29,040
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1476
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:34,940
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1477
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:37,540
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1478
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:41,540
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1479
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:45,740
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1480
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:50,740
Have you ever been called home...

1481
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:54,740
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1482
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:58,540
I have seen the white city...

1483
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:00,440
...long ago.

1484
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:06,340
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1485
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:10,240
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1486
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:14,040
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1487
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:23,840
Will you look into the mirror?

1488
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:25,540
What will I see?

1489
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:30,940
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1490
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,640
For the mirror...

1491
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:36,340
...shows many things.

1492
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:41,640
Things that were...

1493
02:41:42,040 --> 02:41:44,540
...things that are...

1494
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:47,140
...and some things...

1495
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:54,140
...that have not yet come to pass.

1496
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:19,540
I know what it is you saw.

1497
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:24,340
For it is also in my mind.

1498
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:30,140
<i>It is what will come to pass if you should fail.</i>

1499
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:37,340
<i>The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1500
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:41,440
<i>He will try to take the ring.</i>

1501
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:43,640
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1502
02:43:44,740 --> 02:43:49,140
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1503
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:53,240
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1504
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:56,640
<i>... I will give you the one ring.</i>

1505
02:43:57,940 --> 02:44:00,040
<i>You offer it to me freely.</i>

1506
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:08,340
<i>I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.</i>

1507
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:18,140
In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

1508
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:22,240
...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

1509
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:26,040
Treacherous as the sea!

1510
02:44:26,540 --> 02:44:31,340
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1511
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:34,340
All shall love me...

1512
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,340
...and despair.

1513
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:55,740
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1514
02:44:56,140 --> 02:44:58,440
...and go into the West...

1515
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:03,140
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1516
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:10,840
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1517
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:13,340
...is to be alone.

1518
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:19,540
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1519
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,340
And I am its keeper.

1520
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,140
This task was appointed to you.

1521
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:32,040
And if you do not find a way...

1522
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:35,340
...no one will.

1523
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:38,840
Then I know what I must do.

1524
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,740
It's just...

1525
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:46,240
...I'm afraid to do it.

1526
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:54,740
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1527
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:05,840
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

1528
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:09,940
They were elves once.

1529
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:14,440
Taken by the dark powers...

1530
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:17,940
...tortured and mutilated.

1531
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:23,440
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1532
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:25,640
And now...

1533
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:29,040
...perfected.

1534
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:32,840
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1535
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:37,140
...whom do you serve?

1536
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:39,840
Saruman!

1537
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:04,040
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

1538
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:07,240
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1539
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:10,340
You will taste man-flesh!

1540
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:19,040
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1541
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:23,440
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1542
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,740
Kill the others.

1543
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:51,140
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1544
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:56,140
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

1545
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:05,040
Lembas.

1546
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:06,940
Elvish waybread.

1547
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:12,240
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1548
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:20,740
How many did you eat?

1549
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:22,540
Four.

1550
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:30,940
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1551
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:35,140
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

1552
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:37,940
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1553
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:41,940
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

1554
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:47,140
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1555
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:57,940
Le aphadar aen.
(You are being tracked.)

1556
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:04,440
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

1557
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:26,540
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

1558
02:49:26,940 --> 02:49:30,240
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

1559
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,240
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

1560
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:42,340
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

1561
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,840
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

1562
02:49:45,140 --> 02:49:48,240
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1563
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:52,240
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1564
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:55,140
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

1565
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:57,340
Thank you, my lady.

1566
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:02,440
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1567
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:11,840
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

1568
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:14,340
Nothing.

1569
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:18,240
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1570
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:23,940
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1571
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:32,640
Actually....

1572
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:34,540
There was one thing.

1573
02:50:35,440 --> 02:50:37,940
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossible.

1574
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:40,940
Stupid to ask.

1575
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:45,640
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1576
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:49,340
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

1577
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:52,140
Am meleth dîn...
(For her love...)

1578
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:57,740
...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.
(...I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.)

1579
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:03,540
Aníron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham...
(I would have her leave these shores...)

1580
02:51:03,940 --> 02:51:07,140
...athar i methid en-amar hen.
(...and be with her people.)

1581
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:14,440
Aníron i e círatha na Valannor.
(I would have her take the ship to Valinor.)

1582
02:51:14,840 --> 02:51:17,740
That choice is yet before her.

1583
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:21,440
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1584
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:27,340
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1585
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,040
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1586
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:41,440
Namárië.
(Farewell.)

1587
02:51:44,940 --> 02:51:48,740
Nadath nâ i moe cerich.
(There is much you have yet to do.)

1588
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:58,940
Dan, ú-'eveditham, Elessar.
(We shall not meet again, Elessar.)

1589
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,940
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1590
02:52:03,140 --> 02:52:06,440
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

1591
02:52:07,440 --> 02:52:09,640
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

1592
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:23,040
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

1593
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:27,440
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

1594
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:39,540
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1595
02:52:40,340 --> 02:52:44,340
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1596
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:48,540
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1597
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:50,840
What was her gift?

1598
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:55,840
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1599
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:59,540
She gave me three.

1600
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:45,140
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1601
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,940
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1602
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:55,340
But he's too clever a waterman.

1603
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:59,540
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1604
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:01,840
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1605
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:04,140
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1606
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:07,440
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1607
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:10,740
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1608
02:55:11,740 --> 02:55:14,640
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1609
02:55:14,940 --> 02:55:16,040
But you're not.

1610
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,940
I'm here to help you.

1611
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:20,740
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1612
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:29,340
You can't help me, Sam.

1613
02:55:31,740 --> 02:55:33,340
Not this time.

1614
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:38,340
Get some sleep.

1615
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:46,840
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1616
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:50,040
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1617
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:52,940
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1618
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:56,040
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1619
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:58,640
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1620
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:03,340
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1621
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:06,340
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1622
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:09,940
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1623
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:12,340
But you will not see that.

1624
02:56:12,840 --> 02:56:14,140
You are afraid!

1625
02:56:14,540 --> 02:56:16,940
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1626
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:20,640
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1627
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:27,440
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1628
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:40,740
Frodo.

1629
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:44,040
The Argonath.

1630
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:51,140
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1631
02:56:52,040 --> 02:56:53,840
My kin.

1632
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:15,040
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1633
02:58:15,440 --> 02:58:17,840
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1634
02:58:18,140 --> 02:58:21,440
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1635
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:25,740
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1636
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:29,140
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1637
02:58:29,440 --> 02:58:32,440
And after that, it gets even better.

1638
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:37,640
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1639
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:39,440
That is our road.

1640
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:44,140
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1641
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,040
Recover my...

1642
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:51,040
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1643
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:55,540
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1644
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:59,340
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1645
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:03,440
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1646
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:08,140
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1647
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:15,040
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1648
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,440
Where's Frodo?

1649
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:45,040
None of us should wander alone.

1650
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:48,440
You, least of all.

1651
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:51,040
So much depends on you.

1652
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:54,140
Frodo?

1653
03:00:01,340 --> 03:00:03,840
I know why you seek solitude.

1654
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:07,940
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1655
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:11,840
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1656
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:16,140
There are other ways, Frodo.

1657
03:00:16,440 --> 03:00:20,140
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1658
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:24,040
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1659
03:00:24,440 --> 03:00:27,440
Warning...against what?

1660
03:00:27,740 --> 03:00:29,740
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1661
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:33,540
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1662
03:00:33,940 --> 03:00:37,540
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1663
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:42,640
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1664
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:46,340
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1665
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:51,140
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1666
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:56,340
What chance do you think you have?

1667
03:00:56,640 --> 03:01:01,140
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1668
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:05,140
And you will beg for death before the end!

1669
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:09,440
You fool!

1670
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:13,540
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1671
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:16,540
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1672
03:01:16,840 --> 03:01:18,040
- Give it to me!
- No!

1673
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:20,140
- Give it to me!
- No.

1674
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:29,740
I see your mind.

1675
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:32,940
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1676
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:35,040
You will betray us!

1677
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:38,440
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1678
03:01:38,940 --> 03:01:42,440
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1679
03:01:49,640 --> 03:01:51,140
Frodo?

1680
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:57,040
Frodo.

1681
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:02,940
What have I done?

1682
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:04,940
Please, Frodo.

1683
03:02:05,240 --> 03:02:07,740
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1684
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:41,640
Ash Ghurûm
(They will fall)

1685
03:02:56,440 --> 03:02:57,740
Frodo?

1686
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,040
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1687
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:04,140
Stay away!

1688
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:06,140
Frodo!

1689
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:12,140
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1690
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:24,340
Would you destroy it?

1691
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:31,340
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1692
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:37,040
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1693
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:40,740
<i>Elessar.</i>

1694
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:51,640
I would have gone with you to the end.

1695
03:03:52,440 --> 03:03:55,240
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1696
03:03:58,740 --> 03:03:59,840
I know.

1697
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:07,540
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1698
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:13,140
Go, Frodo!

1699
03:04:16,240 --> 03:04:17,740
Run.

1700
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:19,540
Run!

1701
03:04:44,140 --> 03:04:45,740
Mr. Frodo!

1702
03:04:55,240 --> 03:04:56,840
Find the halfling!

1703
03:04:58,540 --> 03:05:00,940
Find the halfling!

1704
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:06,240
Elendil!

1705
03:05:12,740 --> 03:05:14,240
Aragorn, go!

1706
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:37,240
Frodo!

1707
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:39,440
Hide here. Quick!

1708
03:05:40,140 --> 03:05:41,540
Come on!

1709
03:05:44,040 --> 03:05:46,040
What's he doing?

1710
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:52,240
He's leaving.

1711
03:05:57,140 --> 03:05:59,940
- No!
- Pippin!

1712
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:07,140
Run, Frodo. Go!

1713
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:10,740
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1714
03:06:11,340 --> 03:06:12,840
- Over here!
- This way!

1715
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:26,040
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1716
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:24,340
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1717
03:08:07,640 --> 03:08:08,640
Run!

1718
03:11:40,340 --> 03:11:41,840
No.

1719
03:11:45,940 --> 03:11:48,840
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1720
03:11:49,140 --> 03:11:51,140
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1721
03:11:53,140 --> 03:11:54,540
I let Frodo go.

1722
03:11:55,240 --> 03:11:57,740
Then you did what I could not.

1723
03:11:58,840 --> 03:12:02,040
I tried to take the ring from him.

1724
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:06,740
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1725
03:12:07,140 --> 03:12:09,340
I did not see it.

1726
03:12:09,640 --> 03:12:12,740
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1727
03:12:13,340 --> 03:12:15,740
You fought bravely.

1728
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:18,640
You have kept your honor.

1729
03:12:19,440 --> 03:12:21,140
Leave it.

1730
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:23,640
It is over.

1731
03:12:24,940 --> 03:12:30,040
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

1732
03:12:30,640 --> 03:12:33,440
...and my city to ruin.

1733
03:12:37,640 --> 03:12:40,340
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1734
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:44,440
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1735
03:12:45,540 --> 03:12:47,940
...nor our people fail.

1736
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:50,340
Our people.

1737
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:56,240
Our people.

1738
03:13:18,040 --> 03:13:20,940
I would have followed you, my brother.

1739
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:24,540
My captain.

1740
03:13:27,340 --> 03:13:29,140
My king.

1741
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:50,940
Be at peace...

1742
03:13:51,540 --> 03:13:53,340
...son of Gondor.

1743
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:13,040
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

1744
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:16,640
But he will not return.

1745
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:41,940
Frodo!

1746
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:04,640
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

1747
03:15:05,940 --> 03:15:08,740
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1748
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:14,640
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

1749
03:15:14,940 --> 03:15:18,240
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1750
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:21,140
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1751
03:15:21,440 --> 03:15:26,040
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

1752
03:15:54,940 --> 03:15:56,940
Frodo, no!

1753
03:15:57,740 --> 03:15:58,940
Frodo!

1754
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:02,240
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1755
03:16:05,940 --> 03:16:07,840
Go back, Sam!

1756
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:11,840
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1757
03:16:12,140 --> 03:16:14,840
And I'm coming with you!

1758
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:17,840
You can't swim!

1759
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:23,340
Sam!

1760
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:30,340
Sam!

1761
03:17:11,240 --> 03:17:13,940
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1762
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:18,440
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1763
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:22,240
And I don't mean to.

1764
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:24,740
I don't mean to.

1765
03:17:26,540 --> 03:17:28,240
Oh Sam.

1766
03:17:43,240 --> 03:17:44,840
Come on.

1767
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:17,640
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1768
03:18:32,740 --> 03:18:37,640
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1769
03:18:41,140 --> 03:18:45,840
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1770
03:18:57,840 --> 03:19:00,940
Not if we hold true to each other.

1771
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:06,740
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1772
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:12,940
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1773
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:16,340
We travel light.

1774
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:18,540
Let us hunt some orc.

1775
03:19:21,540 --> 03:19:23,540
Yes!

1776
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:43,940
Mordor.

1777
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:47,840
I hope the others find a safer road.

1778
03:19:48,940 --> 03:19:51,440
Strider will look after them.

1779
03:19:52,540 --> 03:19:55,740
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1780
03:19:56,240 --> 03:19:58,540
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1781
03:19:58,740 --> 03:20:00,240
We may.

1782
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:03,540
Sam...

1783
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:09,640
...I'm glad you are with me.
