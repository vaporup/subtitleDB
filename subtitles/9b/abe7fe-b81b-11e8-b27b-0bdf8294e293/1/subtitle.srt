1
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:25,342
-  Wait, one 

2
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,646
 Wait, two 

3
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,555
 Three 

4
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,557


5
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,150
Hey. What's up, everybody ?

6
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:40,458
l'm Thurgood Jenkins.
You know, it's funny,

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,934
but l can trace the entire path
of my life to one childhood memory.

8
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,902
My last clear memory, really.

9
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,633
You see, it was the summer
before ninth grade.

10
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,369
lt was me, Brian, Kenny,
Scarface...

11
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,207
and of course
the loveable Old James.

12
00:00:56,279 --> 00:01:00,477
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.
Old James-- Old James wasn't there.

13
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,613
l don't even know nobody named
Old James. Shoot. Go on !

14
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:11,923
- Why don't you
light it up there, brother ?
- All right. Here goes nothin'.

15
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,559


16
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:22,833
l don't remember graduatin'.
And my first sexual experience--
l don't remember that either.

17
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:27,741
- But, man, l will never forget
the first time l smoked...


18
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,904
that sweet, sweet chiva.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,383
- Feel anything ?
- Yeah, l feel my chest cavin' in.

20
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,909
-  This stuff
didn't even work.
- Man !

21
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:41,219
Come on. Let's get some candy
and get out of here, B.

22
00:01:56,273 --> 00:02:01,108
 l've heard people say
they don't get high
the first time they smoke.

23
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:03,975
Not me. Oh, not us.

24
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:07,244
We were really, really high.

25
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:09,911
We was toe up !

26
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:21,623
- Do you guys feel different ?
- A little.

27
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,723
How 'bout you, Scarface ?

28
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:29,533
How you doin', Kenny ? Kenny ?

29
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:35,010
l haven't been so thirsty
in my entire life.

30
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,807
Do you guys hear that ?

31
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:42,216
Feels like Jerry Garcia's in my head.
Am l goin' crazy ?

32
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:47,655
We look at that
day as the day we met the fifth
member of our crew-- marijuana !

33
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:53,126
- Oh, Lord, we was hooked !

34
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:55,721
So, now we all live together
in New York.

35
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,428
l myself am a master
of the custodial arts,

36
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:02,528
or a janitor if you want
to be a dick about it.

37
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:06,803
Anyway, l work at this lab,
Frankensense and Burr Pharmaceutical.

38
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,538
- They do pharmaceutical testing
for the government...


39
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,671
and big corporations and--

40
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:15,240
And l am
the happiest custodian alive.

41
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,515
This job... sucks.

42
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,818
Abba-Zabba,

43
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,829
you my only friend.

44
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,025
Ah, it could be worse.
l could have Scarface's job.

45
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:35,367
- Heifer with cheese.
- You son of a bitch,
l'm right behind you !

46
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:38,236
Turn around and ask me
for Heifer with cheese, yo !

47
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:42,074
Why you gotta make me feel inferior
'cause l'm on the grill, B ? Damn !

48
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:46,104
-  Scarface is kind
of a hyper guy for a pothead.
- Sorry.

49
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,946
Kenny is probably doin'
the best out of all of us.

50
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:52,010
He's a kindergarten teacher
at some school downtown,

51
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,115
which l know might scare a lot
of parents, seeing as how he's
a weedhead and all.

52
00:03:56,192 --> 00:04:01,152
But let me tell you, man,
that guy does wonders for those
children's self-esteem.

53
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,462
- Thank you.
- Oh, l love you so much, little one.

54
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:08,698
- 
- All of you. All of you. lt's so good.

55
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,707
-  Brian works
at a new and used record store.
- Hi.

56
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:15,176
- He gets to talk about music all day.
- l got a used Kenny Loggins album.

57
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,770
Perfect job for a stoner.

58
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:22,011
Lady, you want seven bucks
for a used Kenny Loggins record ?

59
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,919
- l'll give you five.
- Uh-uh. He autographed it himself.

60
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,657
All right,
l'll give you four.

61
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:34,128
Jan, stop it, man.

62
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,992
- 
- As far as herb goes, you can
get it all over this town.

63
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,730
l mean, they might call it the city that
never sleeps, but l'll tell you this:

64
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:46,606
- lt takes a lot of fuckin' weed naps.
- Free !

65
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:50,077
You can get the stuff at little
corner stores called bodegas.

66
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:53,274
Say it with me:

67
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,283
Yes, very good.

68
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:59,310
- These places always have
incredibly old products.
- Como esta, fellas ?

69
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,482
- Hey-Hey.
- But the weed ain't bad.

70
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:07,190
- Let me get four dime bags.
- Uh, l don't have no idea
what you're talking about.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,960
Jose, you crazy, man. He's crazy.
Come on, man. Let me get them dimes.

72
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,768
See, the problem with bodegas
is they never remember you.

73
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,470
- 
- You always have to do something
extreme to let 'em know you're cool.

74
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:24,604
Hey, fellas. Y'all know me.
Come on, now. Look at this.

75
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:29,482
Hey, black ass. Why you
didn't moon us earlier, eh ?

76
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:31,179
lt was a little degrading.

77
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:35,213
lf you desperate, you can get it from
the Rastas at Washington Square Park,

78
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,124
but their stuff ain't even weed
most the time.

79
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,128
l don't fall
for that shit anymore.

80
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,194
Then there's a delivery service run
by a guy named Samson Simpson.

81
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,670
Now, when you can afford it,
this is the best way.

82
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:52,867
l mean, you can get anything
you want, from weed to heroin.

83
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:55,502
Now, l don't do drugs, though.
Just weed.

84
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,512
- 
- Coming.

85
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,310
See, all you have to do is call
them up, and a half hour later,

86
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:03,546
you got a delivery guy
at your house.

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,646
- 
- What a country !

88
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,191
Hi, you called about your plumbing ?
Empty pipes ?

89
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:16,358
-  Secret code.
- Come on in.

90
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:20,232
- You want highs, mediums or lows ?
- How are the highs, man ?

91
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:24,933
l say they got a piney taste, almost
minty. Notice the little red hairs.

92
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,339
- Yeah.
- And the rich greenery ?

93
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:30,836
- l see those.
- And it's definitely the highest
grade hydroponics in the city.

94
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,576
What, did you go
to weed college ? Damn, nigger.

95
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,448
All right.
Give me a 50 bag of that.

96
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:40,712
- Been a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

97
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,782
- Tell Samson l said hello, would ya ?
- Sure thing.

98
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,489
 Now, everybody has
their own little ritual
when it comes to smokin'.

99
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:49,964
- Dope has arrived, fellas.
- And we were no different.

100
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,400
- Break out Billy Bong Thornton.
-  Yeah.

101
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,733
Whoo !

102
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:03,073
Billy, good to see you, man.

103
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,946
All right.
Light it up.

104
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,952
Shoes off.

105
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, Brian,
put yours back on, man.

106
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,257
For real, amigo.
Do your sock laundry, yo.

107
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,455
- 
- 

108
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:26,798
Gentlemen,
assume your positions.

109
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:29,838
-  
- Yeah.

110
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:32,170
 

111
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,175
Fire in the hole.

112
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:37,906
 We found it on the corner
So when we say 

113
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:41,747
-  Bip 
-  Oxygen 

114
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:45,914
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm--
-  Oh, bip 

115
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:50,455
 Th-That's good 

116
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,689
- Yo, who's on munchies tonight, yo ?
- Not me.

117
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:56,163
l guess that'd be me.

118
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,502
What do you guys want ?

119
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,835
Get some...

120
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:07,467
sour cream and onion chips...

121
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,477
with some dip, man.

122
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,672
Some beef jerky.
Some peanut butter.

123
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:15,275
Get some Haagen Dazs
ice cream bars. A whole lot.

124
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,649
Make sure chocolate.
Gotta have chocolate, man.

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,883
Some popcorn. Bread. Popcorn.
Graham crackers.

126
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,891
Graham crackers with the marshmallows,
the little marshmallows.

127
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,359
And little chocolate bars.
We'll make some smores, man.

128
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:28,886
Yeah, that's what
l was sayin', yo.

129
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:32,731
Also celery, grape jelly, Captain Crunch
with the little crunch berries.

130
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,499
Pizzas.
We need two big pizzas, man.

131
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,201
Everything on 'em.
With water, whole lot of water.

132
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:44,372
And... Funyuns.

133
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,381
Yeah.

134
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,744
- That's it ?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,754
- Anything else ?
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:57,156
Get me a box of condoms,
and, um, what's that stuff ?

137
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,717
We used to eat it all the time
back in the day.

138
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:02,788
- Pussy. That's right.
- You got it.

139
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:06,392

00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:14,572

You're hungry,

You like popcorn.

lt makes your teeth go
pop, pop, pop.

153
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:07,493
This is Buster Phillips, and coming

00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:11,932
''Samson Gets Me Lifted,'' by my
main man-- Who ? Sir Smoka Lot.

155
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,935
Ha !

156
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:21,867
This guy is weed crazy.
Look at that.

157
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:26,608
-  What do you want, Master ?
- Bitch, you know what l want.

158
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,075
 l wanna talk to Samson 

159
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:33,145
 Fly me to the moon like
that bitch Alice Kramden 

160
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:35,417
 'Cause it's hard bein'
black and gifted 

161
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:38,619
 Sometimes l wanna throw it
all down and get lifted 

162
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:41,060
-  
- That is so cool, man.

163
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,429
- He got the same dealer as us.
- What you mean ?

164
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,802
- Samson.
- Oh, right.

165
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:53,501
 Everybody knows in my neighborhood

 That's where

00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:02,377

00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:28,237
l repeat:
Officer down !

176
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:30,677
What the hell

177
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,180
l just gave him some candy
and some chips...

178
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,945
and some pink popcorn
and some Funyuns--

179
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:39,681
This horse is a diabetic !

180
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:44,089
Buttercup. Buttercup.

181
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,926
Don't you leave me.
Breathe, Buttercup.

182
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:51,398
- Breathe.
- Breathe. Breathe.

183
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:57,033

00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:30,872


195
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,374
Why must you rage ?
Stop the hate, child.

196
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:46,319
Bail is set at one million
dollars for the crime of killing
an officer of the law.

197
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,483
And may God have mercy
on your soul, young man.

198
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:54,291
- Court is adjourned.

Back to your cells. Lockdown.

199

Good night, Fish.

00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:06,704
Fish ! Fish ! Fish ! Fish ! Fish !

201
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:09,711
- My weed's wearing off.

202
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,911

- Hey, nigger, what time is it ?
- lt's 8:30.

205
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:27,124
Kenny didn't come home last night.
We are worried, man.

206
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,130
- Word, yo.
- Where the hell is he ?

207
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,201
Did he just move ?

208
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:40,001
Kenny called. He's in jail.

209
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,169
He didn't leave
a number.

210
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:45,008
Sincerely,
The Guy on the couch.

211
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:52,482
Come on, guys. We gotta get Kenny
out of jail, man.

212
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,991
Hey, Kenny. How they
treatin' you in there ?

213
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,121
Let's just say l'm not gettin'
the respect a cop killer deserves.

214
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,189
All right, time's up.

215
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:08,635
l was up all night
getting harassed.

216
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:12,470
- Hi, there, Fish.
- See what l mean ?

217
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:17,205
l think they're mistakin'
my kindness for weakness. l'm scared.

218
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,943
Hey, Kenny, we're gonna get you
out of there, man.

219
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:25,215
All we gotta do is raise ten percent
of one million, yo.

220
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:29,553
- Which, by our calculations--
- ls fucking impossible, man !

221
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,616
Hey !

00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:34,026
Sorry, man. l'm sorry.

223
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,496
All my life,
l did everything right.

224
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:40,558
l never screwed up.
l fed the horse.

225
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:44,766
l didn't know it was a diabetic.
l'm scared.

226
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,105
Kenny, stop crying.
Stop crying, Kenny. Look at me.

227
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:50,805
Come on. Don't let them
see you cry in there.

228
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,007
- Come on, man. Show me your mean face.

229
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,209

but it's good.

233
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:08,193
- 
- Kenny, how long
can you make it in there ?

234
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:13,361
l don't know.
Maybe 5:00... 6:30.

235
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:19,030
Come on, man. lt's gotta be
a little longer than that.

236
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:22,475
But-But-- But we'll get you out,

237
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:26,743
- Yeah, you're out. You're out of here.

238
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,011

Tomorrow l'll be a cowboy,

258
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:31,111
Every day of the week, l dress up

l don't do drugs.
Drugs make me sick.

265
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,468
They're bad for your body.
Up with hope, down with dope.

266
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:58,302
Thurgood. Come on, man.
We gotta go.

00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:18,449
Hey, guys. Meet Mary Jane.

Listen, do you guys need a ride ?

00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:41,181
- You don't have to take the subway.
- Wow, you smoke ?

280
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,119
- No, my grandmother died
of lung cancer.
- l'm sorry to hear that.

281
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:49,521
Well, that's all the more
reason to toke up, man. Ease the pain.

282
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:52,459
Ah ! What l'm talkin' about.

283
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,467
You know, l think what they're tryin'
to say is we'd love a ride home.

284
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,730
Great.

285
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,295
- What the hell's wrong with y'all ?
- She looked good.

286
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:08,639
- Mary Jane ! What is that about, man ?
- l hate y'all.

287
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:10,872

- Hey, thanks for this ride.
We really appreciate it.

00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:22,317
Guys, shut up about the weed
for two seconds. l don't want
this girl to know l smoke.

290
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,655
Yeah, it's bad enough
you're a janitor, yo.

291
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,127
Custodian, dick.

292
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:29,426


293
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:31,432
- Hey !
- Hey.

294
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,031
 lt's really real 

295
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:39,073
 lt's really real 

296
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,939
 Said they're lookin'
for brains, guts, looks and skills 

297
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:44,377
-  Step on up if you think
you fit the bill 
-  Yeah 

298
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:47,313
 l know what you look like
but looks can be deceivin' 

299
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:50,181
 Let me check the brain
so l can justify the reason 

300
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:52,186
-  Yeah 
-  Mister 

301
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,188
-  
-  This good for ya ?

302
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:57,817
Could you drop me
in the lobby ? lt's perfect.

303
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,191
 l could feel
she wanted me to say something.

304
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:02,753
l had to make my move
while the guys were asleep.

305
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:07,200
l'm real bad at this, but you think
sometime we could get together,

306
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:10,102
maybe go out for some ice cream
or something ?

307
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,333


308
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:15,844
- Motherfucker said, ''ice cream'' !

309
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:18,175
- Damn.

310
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:22,650

00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:33,287
l knew it.

315
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:37,423
You know, l might've came on too strong
with the whole ice cream thing.

316
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,967
Let me just give you my number.
ls that cool ?

317
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,969
- Okay.
- All right.

318
00:19:42,037 --> 00:19:45,131
Now, don't call too late, 'cause you
know l be strippin' in the evenings.

319
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,141
Joking !

320
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,140
Here you go.
You can call me anytime you want.

321
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:55,445
- Maybe.
- ''Maybe'' is an acceptable answer.

322
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,884
lt's that ''no'' thing that gets me.
Maybe l'll hear from you.

323
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,013
- Bye.
- Be thinkin' about you.

324
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,359

isn't your responsibility,

331
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:25,013
but would you be a dear and run
this down to the supply department ?

332
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,446
- lt's on the second floor.
- Just run this down ?

333
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:31,077
Yes. But make sure you bring
the order right back to me.

334
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:33,121
l need it A.S.A.P.

335
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:38,057
Got ya. l know this
isn't your responsibility,
but mop the rest of this shit up.

336
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,186
l'll be right back.

337
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:45,490
What it smell like ? Smell like--

338
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,558
No.


339
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:51,299
No. l smell weed, man.

340
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:54,706
Hey. Here you go.


341
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:59,174
- This all you need ?
- l guess. l don't know.

342
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:02,374
- Just a sec.
- Okay. 

343
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:05,079
Damn.

344
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:09,420
Either someone's having a party, or
somebody gotta do their shirt laundry.

345
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,585
- 
- Here you go.

346
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:17,394
One pound of marijuana,
and you can sign for it right here.

347
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,991


348
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:23,060
l-- l sign for this,
and it's mine ?

349
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,470
And l take it ?

350
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,640
Oh, yeah.

351
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,609
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

352
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,850
Some good shit.

353
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:47,624
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank... you.

354
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:55,899
Look, here's-- here's a little
something for your troubles.

355
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,941
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Shh !

356
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:03,068
Let's not tell anyone
about it, okay ?

357
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:05,079
Sure. Shh.

358
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:10,109
Hey, why didn't you tell me
you were into this shit ?

359
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:13,313
- We could've been hangin' out
months ago.
-  No, no, no.

360
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:18,451
The Food and Drug Administration are
having us do a study to determine what,

361
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:22,759
if any, are the medicinal purposes
of marijuana.

362
00:22:22,831 --> 00:22:25,732
Mmm. Wow.

363
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,769
lf you ever need
a guinea pig, let me know.

364
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:30,498
My grandfather was
in the Tuskegee experiments.

365
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,506
Oh, really ?

366
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:35,975
Anyway, thank you,
janitor. Enjoy.

367
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:39,013
Thank you, scientist.
Got any papers ?

368
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:46,480
No cocktail party would be
complete without the ice plant.

369
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:49,649
Hey, fellas.
What's goin' on ?

370
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,659
- What's up ?
- Nothin', man.

371
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,718
Bummin', thinkin' about Kenny.

372
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:56,889
Yeah.

373
00:22:56,965 --> 00:23:00,025
l got some weed at work today,
if y'all wanna try it out.

374
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:02,662
Nah, yo. We don't feel like
smokin' right now.

375
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:06,868
Me neither. Me neither.

376
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,679
- So, y'all want to smoke ?
- l'll get Billy Bong Thornton.

377
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:21,018
- That's what l'm talkin' about.
- No, Scarface.

378
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,387
No Billy Bong Thornton
without Kenny.

379
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:28,760
That would not be right, man.
Use Wesley Pipes. Yeah.

380
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:36,269
Man, they got whole bunch
of this stuff at work.

381
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:38,966
One of those scientists
gave it to me.

382
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:43,137
Ain't tried the shit out yet,
but it smells like the bomb.

383
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:46,840
- All right.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

384
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:48,906
l'll do the honors.

385
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:51,782
-  Excuse me.
- Please do.

386
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,494


387
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,729
Yo, this shit
must be good, B.

388
00:24:07,803 --> 00:24:10,237
My man ain't coughed like
that since back in the day.

389
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,310
You sure l should
do this, man ?

390
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:25,479
Oh, yeah. That shit made
my head hot.

391
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,488
Oh, man.

392
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:33,158
Pass it this way.
Don't break the cipher.

393
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:35,753
Oh-- hold it.
l gotta give The Guy some of this.

394
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:38,129
The Guy gotta taste this.

395
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,634
- Yeah.
- Hey, Guy.

396
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:45,765
Hey, man. Sorry to wake you,
but you gotta try this.

397
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,775


398
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,146


399
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,546
l'm takin' it slow, man.

400
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:02,452
Hey, who's
on munchies tonight ?

401
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:05,925
We should make
that lazy bitch, The Guy, go.

402
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:10,055
For real. l don't know about y'all,
but l can't even move.

403
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,293
Real, B, right ?

404
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,131
lt's like
l feel stuck here, yo.

405
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:18,070
l'm glued to the floor.

406
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:39,249
You guys feel
like you're floating ?

407
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,921
Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:47,093
- Wanna go outside ?
- Yeah.

409
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:02,072
 l don't need to
tell you this, but this weed was...

410
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,914
the shiz-nittle-bam
snip-snap-sack !

411
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:10,581
-  Look !
-  Wow, look at that !

412
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,923
Hey, you guys.

413
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,929
Let's go check in
on Kenny, huh ?

414
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:22,797
You're not a fish. You're a man.

415
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:27,240
You're not a fish.
You're a man.

416
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:29,243


417
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:33,210
Where did that come from ?

418
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:36,580
We've really gotta get
this guy out of jail.

419
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:42,021
You walk around
on both legs, homo erectus !

420
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,823
 Did l say ''homo'' ?
l didn't mean that !

421
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:50,661
Thurgood ! 
Thurgood !

422
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:56,862
l got it ! l know how
we could get Kenny out.

423
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:59,065
- How ?
- Weed, man.

424
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:01,735
We'll sell weed.

425
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,937
Man, you can't up
and decide to sell weed.

426
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:06,879
You gotta know people to plug you
into that kind of thing.

427
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,916
- l do !
- Who you know ?

428
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,680
- You, yo.
- Me ?

429
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,221
What, you think l can just walk in
and take this shit ?

430
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,849
l gotta-- l gotta get
a form from a scientist.

431
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:21,692
Well, how hard can it be, man ?
There's gotta be forms laying around.

432
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:24,960
l mean,
they are scientists.

433
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,797
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man ?

434
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:32,806
Look, l'm not stealin' weed.
We are not sellin' weed.

435
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:36,207
We are three
reasonably bright young men.

436
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:38,212
- Bully, man.
- Word, yo.

437
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,580
There has got to be a legitimate way
to come up with this money.

438
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:45,245
We just gotta think.
That's all that is.

439
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,895
Hmm.

440
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:57,022
Mm-hmm.

441
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:04,372
Wait. Wait.
l think l got an idea.

442
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,375
Why don't we sell that shit
we smoked the other night, yo ?

443
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,968
- Yeah.
- You suggested that already.

444
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:14,106
- For real, B ?
- 

445
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:16,650
Marijuana affects the memory.

446
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:18,982
lt won't take us
hardly any time, B.

447
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:23,089
- Too risky, man.
- Stop bein' such a wussy, yo.

448
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,991
- What other choice do we have, right ?
- Yeah.

449
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,689
Okay, fine. Fine.
We'll do it.

450
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:33,063
- Yeah.
- Gonna do it till Kenny's out,
and we're done.

451
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:36,592
We're not drug dealers.
We're fund-raisers.

452
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,697
- Of course, B.
- Bully, man.

453
00:28:39,774 --> 00:28:41,935
Okay.

454
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,605
Scarface, lay it
on me, brother.

455
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,444
Check it out, yo.
lt's like this.

456
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:51,610
Scarface's plan wasn't that bad.

457
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,450
- Hey, good night, Mike.
- See you tomorrow.

458
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:57,320
Good night.

459
00:28:57,392 --> 00:29:02,227
All l had to do was get forms from that
scientist that kept calling me janitor,

460
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:06,097
forge one of the forms and put
the order in like l did before.

461
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,364
- Thank you.
- Then we scraped together
what little money we had...

462
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:12,736
and bought bikes
to help us move the product,

463
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:17,369
then stapled samples of our weed
on the back of our business cards.

464
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:22,212
Then we called the company Mr. Nice Guy
in honor of our friend Kenny.

465
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:25,913
Hey, uh, you guys believe
in angels or--

466
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:28,581
Man, give me
your fruit cocktail.

467
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,627
Well, l can't.

468
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:36,061
lf l did that, then l'd have
to give it to you every day,

469
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:38,827
and l won't get
all my vitamins.

470
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,597
- Do you know who you're dealing with ?
- Chill, Nasty Nate.

471
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:46,732
He's my bitch. Anybody gonna
stab him, it's gonna be me.

472
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:49,572
You got a problem with that ?

473
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:57,150
Watch your back, Fish, 'cause
Squirrel Master ain't gonna be
there for you all the time.

474
00:29:57,218 --> 00:30:01,416
'Cause next time l come for you,
l'm gonna want some cocktail-- fruit.

475
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:05,092
Take it.

476
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,264
l'm somebody's bitch.

477
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:19,367
You guys gotta do something.
There's this guy Nasty Nate
who's after my cocktail fruit,

478
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,375
and everyone here
likes fresh fish.

479
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:25,174
And then the Squirrel Master came out
of left field and told me l'm his bitch.

480
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:29,114
- Help !
- Ken, listen. We got a plan.

481
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:34,053
- What is it ?
- lt's not the most honest plan.
You might not like it.

482
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:37,888
- We gonna sell weed, yo.
- Yeah, great. Weed. Good. Go.

483
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:41,554
- All right, man.
- Go !

484
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:44,189
No more window love.
Go and sell it.

485
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:47,564
 We figured the best way to
spread the word was to hit the streets.

486
00:30:47,635 --> 00:30:50,570
And hit the streets we did.

487
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:53,801
-  Mary Jane 
-  How y'all feel about Mary Jane 

488
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:58,403
-  Y'all don't know about Mary Jane 
-  Mary Jane 

489
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,007
 So listen to what they say
'cause Mary never could trip 

490
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,678
 Mary very, very necessary
Extraordinary bein' Mary 

491
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:09,417
 To the mortuary, One kiss from
her sweet lips and out come a-vision 

492
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,016
-  
- Three for dinner.

493
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,355
Smoke that
and get back to us.

494
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,833
Mr. Nice Guy has arrived, baby.
He's on.

495
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,837
- All right.
-  l'm in love with Mary Jane
l'm not the only one 

496
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:27,170
- Oh, yes.
-  Mary likes to play around 

497
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:29,506
Look at all these people !

498
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:33,035
 All right, guys. Be quick.
Let's just do this and get out of here.

499
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:36,515
- Let's go, man.
- Let's go.
- lt's money.

500
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,518
 Mary likes to spread her love 

501
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:41,282
 And turn my head around 

502
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,483
 l'm in love with Mary Jane 

503
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:49,087
 She is my main thing
She make me feel all right 

504
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:52,133
-  She make my heart sing 
- All right, how'd you guys make out ?

505
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,567
- Good. l'm all out of cards, B.
- Me too.

506
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:58,435
That would make three of us.

507
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,168
All right.
We did our part, right ?

508
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:03,301
l just hope they smoke it.

509
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:09,544
-  lf you love me, Mary Jane

510
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,551

00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,587
 How y'all feel about Mary Jane 

512
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,352
-  Mary Jane

513
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:21,020
-  We're talkin' about Mary Jane 
- Damn, this weed is good.

514
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,428
-  Y'all don't know about Mary Jane 
-  Mary Jane 

515
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,201
 She make my heart sing 

516
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:31,432
 

517
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:33,440


518
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,903
- This is so--
- We are in business, man.

519
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,504
- Hold on. Hold on.
- 

520
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:46,920
- Mr. Nice Guy.
- Oh, l may have the wrong number.

521
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,456
Um, is Thurgood around ?

522
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:53,460
- Speaking.
- Oh, hey, hey. lt's Mary Jane.

523
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,088
Do you remember ? l gave you
a ride home from prison ?

524
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:58,098
Well, could you be
a little more specific ?

525
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,532
l get so many rides home
from prison.

526
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,797
That was a joke.

527
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,839
Oh.

528
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:07,101
What happened ? l didn't think
you were gonna call me.

529
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:11,236
Well, l wasn't, but then l decided
l don't care what my friends think.

530
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,540
See, that was a joke.
Get it ?

531
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:16,777
- A little joke.
-  Not funny.

532
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:19,479
So, you wanna
get together ?

533
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:23,149
Okay. Sure. When ?

534
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:27,126
How 'bout right now ? Just meet me
at the place you dropped us off at.

535
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:30,995
Okay. Can you give me
half an hour ?

536
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:33,056
- Yeah, half an hour's cool.
- Great.

537
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,625
- All right. Okay.
- l'll see you there.

538
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,235
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

539
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,502


540
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,248
l've got a date with Mary Jane !

541
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:52,252
- Word, yo ?
- Yes !

542
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,654
- All right, man.
- Y'all got money ?

543
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:59,284
 The date couldn't
have come at a worse time.

544
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,658
l was flat broke.

545
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:04,664
All my money was tied up
in our drug-dealing venture.

546
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:09,192
l only had eight bucks.
This was gonna take some careful
budgeting and maneuvering.

547
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,398
- Hey.
- Watch the master at work.

548
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:15,203
- You look great. You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

549
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:18,211
You know what ? l was thinkin'
it's so nice out,

550
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,713
wanna go for a walk ?

551
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:24,013
Yeah, sure.
We can go for a walk.

552
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:26,019
Good. Good. Let's.

553
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:28,248
So far, so good.

554
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:33,761
Three hours and 14 miles later,
l hadn't spent one penny.

555
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:35,887
Damn, l was good !

556
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:39,127
- And then it happened.
- l'm hungry too.

557
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,796
- Hey, you wanna
eat at the Happy Palace ?
- Uh, how 'bout a hot dog, huh ?

558
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:46,567
- Hey, what luck.
- Hot dog.

559
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:51,772
- Hey, what can l get you ?
- Could l have a hot dog
with ketchup and sauerkraut ?

560
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:54,679
- Sauerkraut's 50 cents extra.
-  Damn !

561
00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:57,741
l've not had a hot dog
in so long.

562
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:00,788
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
-  Anything to drink ?

563
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:03,915
- You son of a bitch !
- Yes. Could l have a Pepsi, please ?

564
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:08,019
- Anything for you, sir ?
- No. l'm fine. Thank you.

565
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:11,657
- Greedy bastard !
- Didn't you promise me
ice cream the other day ?

566
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:14,600
l know a really
good place uptown.

567
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:16,796
Great. Let's hoof it.

568
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:20,807
Um, do you mind if we take
a cab this time ?

569
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:23,810
Sure.

570
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,985
Thanks a lot, buddy.

571
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:33,145
You should be happy
with the tip l gave you. Damn.

572
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:36,156
- You should be kissing my ass.
- You guys are greedy.

573
00:35:36,224 --> 00:35:38,192
Best ice cream in town.

574
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:41,490
- Spare change for some food ?
- Oh.

575
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:45,999
- Don't mind if l do.
- Thanks, young brother.

576
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,763
No, thank you.

577
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:55,836
- Mmm. Mmm-mmm.
- Yeah, l mean, l do miss my dad.

578
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,710
But... he deserves
to be where he is.

579
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,579
Drug dealers belong
in jail.

580
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,084
Yeah. Yeah, wow.

581
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:08,680
Yeah. Um, how long
he been in there ?

582
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,748
- Four years next month.
- Four years.

583
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:15,193
- And what exactly was he sellin' ?
- Marijuana.

584
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:18,323
Four years
just for weed ? Damn !

585
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,959
Just ? No, no, no, no.
Not just.

586
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:24,266
Marijuana is terrible.
lt's a gateway drug.

587
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,398
l mean, everybody knows
that it leads to other stuff.

588
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:29,034
Yeah, mostly junk food.

589
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:33,208
You don't smoke weed, do you ?

590
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,850
Come on, Mary Jane.

591
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:41,082
l mean, do l look like somebody
that would smoke... marijuana ?

592
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:43,350
So you swear you don't ?

593
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:45,722
Yeah, sure.

594
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay, well, swear on this banana split
that you don't do marijuana.

595
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:53,665
What ? Oh, my God.

596
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:56,101
Do you swear ?

597
00:36:57,772 --> 00:37:00,673
Yes, Mary Jane. l swear.

598
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:03,836
That you got pretty eyes.

599
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,845
That's good.

600
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:09,215
That's real good.

601
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:13,583
l got some booty. l got some booty.
l got some booty.

602
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:15,645
lt was really good too.

603
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:18,851
Ooh, she was a giver,
a caring nurturer.

604
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:23,761
She held me in her arms, and it was
like l was 15 years old all over again.

605
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:26,732
- l was hooked on Mary Jane.
- 

606
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:31,403
The next mornin' the phones blew up like
we were havin' a fuckin' telethon, man.

607
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:35,272
Everybody in New York was callin'
to get down with Mr. Nice Guy.

608
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:38,642
We met all kinds of customers,
like this guy here.

609
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:40,704
He's what we call
an enhancement smoker,

610
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:44,878
'cause he thinks marijuana
makes every activity that much better.

611
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:47,113
- Mi casa es su casa.
- Observe.

612
00:37:47,188 --> 00:37:49,122
- You're Scarface, right ?
- Yeah.

613
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,283
l love Al Pacino, man.

614
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,294
- Did you ever see Scent of a Woman ?
- Yep.

615
00:37:56,097 --> 00:38:01,125
Did you ever see
Scent of a Woman... on weed ?

616
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:06,230
That's the way to see it, man !
lt's just whacked ! Pow !

617
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:11,144
- Sixty bucks, yo.
- That's cool, man.

618
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:13,146
l got it. l got it.

619
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:20,345
- Did you ever see
the back of a $20 bill, man ?
- Man, l don't know, yo.

620
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:24,585
Did you ever see the back
of a $20 bill... on weed ?

621
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,991
Oh, there's some weird shit
in there, man !

622
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:29,120
There's a dude sittin' in the bushes.
Does he have a gun ?

623
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,427
l don't know, man.
What ? What ?

624
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,967
Red team go. Red team go.

625
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:37,698
- Just some weird shit, man.
- Man, you're fuckin' crazy, yo.

626
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:40,206
- Take your shit.
- No, that's cool. Thanks, man.

627
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:43,607
Hey, yo, wait ! Dude, l'm gonna
check out the stars later.

628
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:48,138
lt's really trippy.
Especially on weed, man.

629
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:51,879
 A scavenger smoker is
someone who never has weed of their own.

630
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:54,547
But as soon as you smoke it,
here they come.

631
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:57,022
- Damn !
- What up ?
- Man !

632
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:59,286
What's up, dogs ? Scoot over.
Let me get in here, man.

633
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,294
- What y'all doin'?
- Nothin'.

634
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:03,227
- Nothin'?
- Yeah, just chillin'.

635
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:06,061
What's the matter ?
Let me inhale it. Let me have some.

636
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:10,399
All right, man.
Just one hit, you scavenger.

637
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,462
Always come around.

638
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,599


639
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,371
Can't even smoke weed
in peace.

640
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:22,382


641
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,146
l ain't even into the
motherfucker yet. Back up, brother.

642
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:28,711
You know we sell this ?
l don't know if you knew that.

643
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:32,247
lt's too bad, man.
l just stopped smokin' yesterday.

644
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:41,328
l'm gonna get up out of here.
Y'all stay up, now. Nice seeing y'all.

645
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:44,496
- Yeah. Look at that shit.
- Man.

646
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:46,506
Then there's the ''You
Should've Been There'' smoker.

647
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:50,101
They love talkin' about the old days,
back when weed was grass.

648
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:53,169
Hell, back in the '60s, we used to
smoke that shit on the street.

649
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:57,047
Cops didn't say nothin'.
Hell, they was gettin' high too.
Everybody was doin' it.

650
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:59,643
- Mm.
- lt wasn't the thing to do because
it was the thing to do, you know ?

651
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,915
lt was the thing to do
because it got you high.

652
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:04,924
- Can you dig ?
- l feel ya. That's why l'm doin' it.

653
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:09,554
l feel it. Man, you're cool
as shit, mister.

654
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,088
l hate to do it, but l gotta
charge you. That's 60 bucks.

655
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,829
- Sixty bucks ?
- Yeah.

656
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:19,999
Man, l remember when a dime bag
cost a dime, you know what l mean ?

657
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:25,475
- You know how much condoms
used to cost in them days ?
- How much ?

658
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:28,208
l don't know.
l-- We never used 'em.

659
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:31,115
We call this kid
the ''After School Special'' smoker.

660
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:33,745
He spends all
of his allowance on reefer.

661
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:36,381
Thanks, little buddy.

662
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:39,984
Now, in the next room, his father,
an ''l'm 40, But l'm Still Cool'' smoker,

663
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:44,157
is tokin' up, trying to figure
out a way to bond with his son.

664
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:47,997
lsn't that ironic ?
Don't you think ?

665
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,903
'Course across town, the kid's Nana's
smokin' up, tryin' to ease her glaucoma.

666
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:55,272
And it's good
for arthritis too.

667
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:58,540
- We made over 20 grand
that first week, man.
- 

668
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:02,709
And because we were stealin' the weed,
not buyin' it, it was all profit.

669
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:06,310
But if we were gonna save Kenny,
we had to deliver full-time.

670
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,220
Scarface quit his job.

671
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,020
Still waiting
on that Heifer, Julio.

672
00:41:14,762 --> 00:41:16,889
Fuck you. Fuck you.

673
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,956
Fuck you. You're cool.

674
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:22,832
And fuck you. l'm out !

675
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:24,871


676
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:29,342
Brian was gonna quit,
but they fired him before he could.

677
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:42,349
Don't worry. Don't worry.

678
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:46,018
l'm not gonna do what
everyone thinks l'm gonna do:

679
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:49,358
Flip out, man !

680
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,231
All l wanna know is:
who's comin' with me ?

681
00:41:57,171 --> 00:42:00,163
Who's comin', man ?
Who's comin' with me ?

682
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:05,472
Huh ? Who's comin' with me, man ?

683
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:10,515
- l will.
- Jan.

684
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:14,577
Thank you, Jan. Yeah.

685
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:19,257
That's what
l'm talkin' about.

686
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:22,227
Bully, man. Yeah.

687
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:32,830
Jan, will you be
my girlfriend ?

688
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:36,843
l would... but l'm gay,
you know ?

689
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:38,902
- Ohh.
- l'm a big dyke.

690
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:40,913
What's that like ?

691
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:43,609
- 
- Thank you for calling.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

692
00:42:43,684 --> 00:42:46,812
We had to hire that girl Jan
'cause she followed Brian.

693
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:48,855
- But it actually worked out.
- Mr. Nice Guy.

694
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:52,188
She was more organized than we were,
and she was willing to work for weed.

695
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:54,193
All right, then.

696
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,788
Mr. Nice Guy
was blowin' up, man.

697
00:42:57,865 --> 00:43:01,062
We got customers
from all over New York.

698
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:03,899
- We even stole a few from Samson.
- 
Oh, what's up, nigger ?

699
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:06,940
Come on in, man.
Come on, weed man.

700
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:08,941
Thanks, baby.

701
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:11,978
Get on. Beat it.
You're scarin' him.

702
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:15,880
Ha ! Sir Smoka Lot.

703
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,180
- What can l get you today, Smoka Lot ?
- Love weed.

704
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:21,221
Um, let me get a pound
of your sweetest chiva.

705
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:24,655
Damn. Yes ! Somethin' told me
to bring a lot of weed, man.

706
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:29,389
Aw, shit. Pound
of my sweetest chiva.

707
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:32,432
- Don't get no better than that.
- Can smell it through the bag.

708
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,060
That's gonna be
9,600 bucks, bro.

709
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:37,263
Let's see what l got here.

710
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:43,272
Come on, man. Hang out
for a minute. Smoke with me.

711
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,835
l got weed. l got my bong out.
Come on, son.

712
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:49,371
For you, man,
l'll stay for a minute.

713
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,146
But then l gotta be--
gotta be goin'.

714
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:55,120
l understand.

715
00:43:55,189 --> 00:44:00,354
And Smoka Lot opened up to me like l
was Barbara Walters. lt was ridiculous.

716
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:05,455
- He told me about his lawyer.
- He had sex with my mama ! Why ?

717
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:09,333
- His spirituality.
- God, if you listenin'... help !

718
00:44:09,403 --> 00:44:11,997
- His bad back.
- Doctor said l need a backeotomy.

719
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:15,940
- His love life.
- l'm impotent, man.
Get away from me, bitch !

720
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,173
- l mean, talk about a guy with problems.
- Tough break.

721
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:23,273
- l can't take it no more.
- No wonder he smokes a pound a week.

722
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,081
- Somebody ?
- So now we had a famous clientele and--

723
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,088
Greeneyes gonna miss ya.

724
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:33,286
- And guess what else ?
- Call me next week...
about weed, about weed.

725
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,796
l got more booty !
l got more booty !

726
00:44:36,864 --> 00:44:39,731
l don't mean
to rub it in, folks.

727
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,768
lt's just that, you know,
l liked this so much, man.

728
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:44,737
When l was with her,
l didn't even think about weed.

729
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:47,035
- Didn't have to.
- Bye.

730
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:50,702
- She was all the Mary Jane l needed.
- 

731
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:53,144
 When l was young 

732
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:57,310
 l never needed anyone 

733
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:01,514
 Makin' love
was just for fun 

734
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:03,921
 Those days are gone 

735
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:06,926


736
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:11,897
 All by myself 

737
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,103


738
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,515
What did l tell you, Nate ?
Come on. Come on.

739
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,281
Come on. Come on, Nate.

740
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:37,119
- 
-  He had to stay vigilant.

741
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:41,389
- Wash off your han--
- Kenny's butthole
was in constant jeopardy.

742
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:44,192
- But we were makin' money.
- Hey, what's up, mates ?

743
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:46,961
-  What's up, man ?
- What's up, boy ?

744
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,901
- What's up, yo ?
- Nada. l'm just chillin'.

745
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,428
Hey, guys. Why is there a dog
biting The Guy ?

746
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:57,466
-  'Cause l bought a dog, B.
- Bought a dog ?

747
00:45:57,544 --> 00:46:00,604
- For how much ?
- Oh, it's cool. Yo, he's used.

748
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:03,275
lncluding the house,
it was only 250, yo.

749
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,717
You spent $250
on a used dog ?

750
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:09,551
And a dog house, yo.
Brian bought something too.

751
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:14,822
For $400, l got Jerry Garcia
in a pouch, man.

752
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:18,956
- Who the hell told you that ?
- The guy who sold it to me.
Barry Garcia.

753
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,263
And what he's supposed to be ?
Jerry Garcia's brother ?

754
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:25,795
No. Actually,
it's Andy Garcia's brother.

755
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:29,969
Why the hell
are you guys spendin' money ?
We're not drug dealers, remember ?

756
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:35,175
- We're fund-raisers.
- Well, you said you gave
Mary Jane a pearl necklace.

757
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:37,843
- How much did that cost, man ?
- Ah.

758
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:41,615
You know, obviously you missed
the point of that story, Brian.

759
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:44,249
- Come on, guys. Return this shit.
- We can't, yo.

760
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:48,386
- Why am l tellin' Mary Jane
l don't have any money ?
- 'Cause you're a fibber.

761
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:51,898
No, because we don't
have any money.

762
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,093
The money we do have
is not for spending.

763
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:58,662
lt's for saving Kenny's
sweet virgin ass, man !

764
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,267
lf you guys spend one more dime,
l swear l will bitch-slap you.

765
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:06,445
Gimme that.

766
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:12,074
Sorry for yelling.
But l'm serious.

767
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:16,418
 We gotta start
bein' more responsible and focused.

768
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,822
All right ? Let's be sharp.

769
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:22,453
Scarface, your dog is mean, man.

770
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:24,520
l know, all right.

771
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:27,726
Somebody gotta do somethin'
about this shit right now.

772
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,735
Mmm. Come here, doggie.

773
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,397
- Hey, little fella. Smell it ?
- 

774
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:37,501
Hey ! Smell it.
Okay. All right. Mm.

775
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:39,842
- Good boy.
- 

776
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:42,848
- He likes it.
- He loves it, man.

777
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:46,477
- Of course he loves it.
- Yeah, your paws are tingling,
aren't they ?

778
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:49,681
- Now you're one of us.
- 

779
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:54,488
-  Get it, Killer.
- 

780
00:47:54,561 --> 00:48:00,227
-  He likes it, yo.
-  Yeah, man,
he really likes it.

781
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,997
- Good for you, man.
- Man, what did you guys do to him, yo ?

782
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:07,507
-  Nothin', man.
- Yo, Killer. Kill ! Killer, kill !

783
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:11,106


784
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:18,780
This weed is fantastic !

785
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:25,452
 We kept pluggin' away
with the weed deliveries,

786
00:48:25,526 --> 00:48:29,292
and we kept meetin' different kinds
of smokers, like this lady.

787
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:31,763
- She's an ''l'm Only Creative
lf l Smoke'' smoker.
- Hi.

788
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:35,825
She believes weed, and only weed,
brings out the artist in her.

789
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:40,034
- Would you like to hear
some of my poetry ?
- Not really.

790
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:42,098
You really should.

791
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:47,980
l have killed.
l have helped kill.

792
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:53,543
l have killed part of myself.
l cannot change this, l.

793
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,283
l must seek Buddha.
l must seek Christ.

794
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:03,760
You must seek therapy. That's what
l would go with, but that's my own--

795
00:49:03,831 --> 00:49:07,733
 The MacGyver smoker
is a very handy guy to have around,

796
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,735
especially when it comes
to reefer.

797
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:13,169
Hey, man,
we're out of papers.

798
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,301
All right. Then get me a toilet paper
roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil.

799
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:20,346
We don't have a corkscrew.

800
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:24,009
All right. Then get me an avocado,
an ice pick and my snorkel.

801
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:27,781
Trust me, bro.
l've made bongs with less. Hurry up !

802
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:30,346
-  And then you got
your straight-up potheads.
- Ooh !

803
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:33,484
You can spot these people
by their lack of motivation,

804
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,463
mood swings, forgetfulness and,
of course, the dreaded low sperm count.

805
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:43,060
l don't know
which one of these categories
we fall into, but l'll tell you this:

806
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:45,332
We ain't no goddamn potheads.

807
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:47,168
Hmm.

808
00:49:47,241 --> 00:49:49,368
Shit.

809
00:49:49,643 --> 00:49:51,907
Then you have
the avid nonsmoker.

810
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:55,608
A lot of times they'll get
your number accidentally
from one of their girlfriends,

811
00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:58,617
call up and place an order
knowing they don't smoke weed...

812
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:01,313
and request
that you personally deliver it.

813
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:05,848
Then when you get there, they're
all mad that it's you sellin' weed.

814
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:10,863
You smoke weed ? At last
we can share everything.

815
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:14,833
Get off me, you lying
son of a bitch ! What is this ?

816
00:50:14,902 --> 00:50:17,302
Looks like some sort
of a business card.

817
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:21,171
Yeah, with your number on it.
You know, l can't believe this !

818
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:25,075
l can't believe that l fell for another
one of you lowlife assholes again.

819
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:28,273
- God, what is wrong with me ?
- Hey--

820
00:50:28,348 --> 00:50:30,873
Hey, Mary Jane, l can explain
everything, all right ?

821
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:33,146
- Good-bye, Thurgood.
- Wait ! Hold up !

822
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,245
Hey, Mary Jane !

823
00:50:35,322 --> 00:50:39,656
Mary Jane, look, the only reason
l lied to you was because l like you...

824
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:41,660
and l wanted
to be with you.

825
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:44,663
Mary Jane.

826
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,743
Knight Rider.

827
00:50:57,811 --> 00:51:00,405
A shadowy flight
into the dangerous world...

828
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,608
of a man who does not exist.

829
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:10,120
Thurgood, why the long face, man?

830
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,784
- Mary Jane dumped me.
- Shh. Quiet down, yo.

831
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:15,885
- Sir Smoka Lot's on TV.
- Cecil ?

832
00:51:15,963 --> 00:51:19,922
 When life is hard, l pick up
that card with the smiley face 

833
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,731
-  Call him over to my place 
- 

834
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,139
 Box it
Man, it gets you high 

835
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:31,939
-  
-  And that's
when things started going wrong.

836
00:51:32,012 --> 00:51:37,075
 Samson, it looks like somebody
is cuttin' into your business, baby.

837
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:41,382
- Shit.
- Do you like what you see, Samson ?

838
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:43,389
Do l look like
l like what l see ?

839
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:47,325
Who is this
Mr. Nice Guy ?

840
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:50,420
l would imagine he's
some sort of drug dealer.

841
00:51:50,497 --> 00:51:52,556
Go get me this Mr. Nice Guy.

842
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:55,966
- l wanna sit him down
and ask him some questions.
- 

843
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,498
- Hey, Squirrel Master.
- Kenny.

844
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,744
Listen, uh, l, uh,
just wanted to say thank you...

845
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:10,248
for protecting me back there.

846
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:14,219
- We didn't mind.
Huh ? Did we, Fuzzy Nuts ?
- 

847
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:17,815
l hope there's some way l can pay
you back when we get on the outside.

848
00:52:17,891 --> 00:52:21,088
You better hurry up.
l get out in 11 days.

849
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:23,288
ls that right ?

850
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:32,604
Kenny, 11 days ?
That seems a little stiff, man.

851
00:52:32,673 --> 00:52:36,131
Eleven days, Thurgood,
l'm as good as skewered.

852
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:39,701
Ever take your clothes off
and run backwards through a cornfield ?

853
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,340
- Ooh.
- Hurry, Thurgood.

854
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:45,852
l'm countin' on you, man !
Please ! Please !

855
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:48,979
 Eleven days wasn't
gonna give us much time.

856
00:52:49,056 --> 00:52:52,651
We really had to hustle, and
that meant takin' on new customers.

857
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:55,991
 

858
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:58,793
 

859
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:04,567
 

860
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:06,572
 

861
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,667
Damn, B ! l been set up.

862
00:53:13,814 --> 00:53:16,180
We'll get back to that in a second.

863
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:19,685
But meanwhile l hadn't seen
Mary Jane in, like, a week.

864
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:23,120
l couldn't stop thinkin'
about her, man. l missed her.

865
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:28,059
Then l started thinkin' about
the fact that she was the only
girl l slept with in five years.

866
00:53:28,128 --> 00:53:31,256
Then l started thinkin' about the girl
l slept with before Mary Jane.

867
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,827
l had to get Mary Jane back.

868
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:39,804
- 
- What do you want ?

869
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:43,603
l want you back, Mary Jane.

870
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:48,637
l miss you. l'll do whatever
it takes to get you back.

871
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:51,650
l can't quit sellin' it yet,
but l'll quit smokin' it.

872
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:55,051
lf that's what you want, then--
then l'll change for you.

873
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:58,421
- Heard that before.
- Said that before.

874
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:02,690
But this time l mean it. l'm gonna
come back here. l'm gonna be clean.

875
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:06,164
l'm gonna be sober.
There's no more weed, no more nothin'.

876
00:54:06,233 --> 00:54:10,897
Mary Jane, you'll see.
l'll be back. l'll be a changed man.

877
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:13,371
There's a new
Thurgood Jenkins today.

878
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:17,671
l love you.

879
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:20,372
 Man, that first day
of sobriety sucked.

880
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:25,407
And l realized something:
l was a real irritable guy
when l wasn't smokin' marijuana.

881
00:54:25,485 --> 00:54:28,386
l couldn't stop thinkin'
about gettin' high.

882
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:30,923
lt was time to get help.

883
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:34,358
Hi, everyone.
My name is Thurgood.

884
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:38,797
-  Hi, Thurgood.
- Hi.

885
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:43,529
l'm here today because
l'm addicted... to marijuana.

886
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:47,266
- 
- You in here because of marijuana ?

887
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,399
Marijuana ?

888
00:54:49,476 --> 00:54:52,240
Man, this is some bullshit !

889
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:54,280
Marijuana is not a drug.

890
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:58,078
- l used to suck dick for coke.
- l seen him !

891
00:54:58,151 --> 00:55:00,085
And that's an addiction, man.

892
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,314
- You ever suck dick for marijuana ?
- Huh ?

893
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:08,457
- No. No, l can't say l have.
- l didn't think so.

894
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:11,429
- Boo this man !
-  Boo !

895
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:23,268
No.

896
00:55:23,343 --> 00:55:26,005
No !

897
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,604
No !

898
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:30,741
Devil man.

899
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:34,617
Devil-- 666--
The mark of the beast !

900
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:37,885
No ! Naughty !

901
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:40,586
Naughty jungle of love !

902
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,365
- The man is serious.
- Calm down. How serious can it be ?

903
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:49,368
He wants to see Mr. Nice Guy.
He told me.

904
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:55,507
Oh, man.

905
00:55:57,777 --> 00:56:00,143
No, yo !

906
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:02,306
They killed Killer, B !

907
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,279
Yo, Samson did this, man.

908
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:10,221
Yo, he killed Killer, man.

909
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,191
- Hey.
- He killed--

910
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,820
l'm gonna call Brian.

911
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:18,763
- Let's just give him
a proper burial, all right ?
- 

912
00:56:18,832 --> 00:56:21,300
l'm sorry, man.

913
00:56:21,368 --> 00:56:23,302
Jesus Christ.

914
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:27,170
- Oh ! l'm sorry.
- Watch it, man !
You stepped on his head !

915
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,175
l'm sorry.
l didn't even see him.

916
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:34,179
 

917
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,370
l gotta smoke.
l have got to smoke.

918
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:09,847
- 
- What happened, man ?

919
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,283
You wanna know what happened ?
l'll tell you what happened.

920
00:57:13,353 --> 00:57:16,720
Samson and his girls
came rollin' up in here lookin' for me.

921
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:20,089
They was gonna mess me up
if l didn't bring them Mr. Nice Guy.

922
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,685
So they probably
roughed the Guy up,

923
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:25,356
then they started
goin' to war with the apartment.

924
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,765
They had num-chuks, bolos.
They be doin' lndian burns.

925
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:31,360
Killer paid the price, yo.

926
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:35,704
He got the wrath. He got
the wrath of the num-chuks, yo.

927
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:40,611
l think it's more complex
than that.

928
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,140
- More complex than that ?
- You know what l think happened ?

929
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:48,449
You want to hear
what l think, man ?

930
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:54,484
First of all, to understand
what happened to Killer,

931
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:58,725
you gotta understand
who Killer the dog was.

932
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:02,256
Now, Killer was born
to a three-legged bitch mother.

933
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:05,304
He was always
ashamed of this, man.

934
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:10,105
And right after that, he's adopted
by this man, Tito Liebowitz.

935
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:12,872
He's a small-time gunrunner...

936
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:15,210
and, uh,
rottweiler fight promoter.

937
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:19,047
So he puts Killer into training.
They see Killer's good.

938
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,246
He is damn good.

939
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:25,257
But then he had
the fight of his life.

940
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:28,692
They pit him against
his brother Nibbles.

941
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:32,596
And Killer said, ''No, man, that's
my brother. l can't fight Nibbles !''

942
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,464
And he made 'em fight anyway.

943
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:38,333
And then Killer,
he killed Nibbles.

944
00:58:39,406 --> 00:58:42,170
And Killer said, ''That's it.''

945
00:58:42,242 --> 00:58:47,839
He called off all his fights, and he
started doing crack, and he freaked out.

946
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:52,146
And then in a rage,
he collapsed,

947
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:54,413
and his heart...

948
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:56,717
no longer beat.

949
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:01,022
Wow.

950
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:03,494
You know, uh,

951
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:06,498
l never thought l'd say
this to anybody,

952
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:10,058
but you two smoke
entirely too much reefer.

953
00:59:10,136 --> 00:59:13,299
What if The Guy did it ?

954
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:16,001
No way. You think ?

955
00:59:16,076 --> 00:59:18,010
Yo ?

956
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:25,109
Yo, The Guy,
did you kill my dog ?

957
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:33,626
l believe him, yo.
l don't know why, but l do.

958
00:59:35,161 --> 00:59:38,392


959
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:40,399
Samson did this shit, yo.

960
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,434
Mr. Nice Guy,
Party Accessories.

961
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:48,997
Well, did you get
my message ?

962
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:53,171
- Who is this ?
- This is Samson, smarty-pants.

963
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:55,976
 Operator with an
emergency breakthrough from your sister.

964
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:58,745
Samson, this is Sheila. Mama fell--

965
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:00,752
Shut up, bitch !

966
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:04,483
You tell Mr. Nice Guy
to get his Jamaican ass...

967
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:07,549
over to my place
at 3:00 tomorrow !

968
01:00:07,627 --> 01:00:11,893
- Now, you don't want me to get ugly.
- No, sir.

969
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:14,627
- Shit.
- All right. l'll tell 'em.

970
01:00:15,969 --> 01:00:18,267
Oh, my God.

971
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:21,136
We're in a lot of trouble.

972
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:25,268
Scarface, perhaps
you could help me.

973
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:29,839
Why do you think Samson thinks
that Mr. Nice Guy's a Jamaican ?

974
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,408
Oh, 'cause l told him
Mr. Nice Guy was Jamaican, yo.

975
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:38,822
- Why ?
- l just thought he sounded
Jamaican inside my head.

976
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:41,656
We're in a lot
of trouble, guys.

977
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:46,222
We have a meeting
with Samson tomorrow at 3:00.
Where are we gonna get a Jamaican ?

978
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:49,860
l'll pretend
l'm Jamaican, man.

979
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:51,870
Yeah.

980
01:00:53,673 --> 01:00:56,107
You have smoked yourself
retarded.

981
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:06,244
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Nice Guy.

982
01:01:07,587 --> 01:01:10,385
Welcome to my lair.

983
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:14,483
Well, now. Tell me
a little bit about yourself.

984
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:17,155


985
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,997
Well, you know, l be from
Jamaica, man. Lord have mercy.

986
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:24,298
What part of Jamaica ?

987
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,703
Right near the beach--
 Boy 

988
01:01:27,774 --> 01:01:31,039
l think
you're bullshitting me.

989
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,546
Samson Simpson,
l stick by my story !

990
01:01:34,614 --> 01:01:36,548
l'm from Jamaica.

991
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:42,179
lf l wasn't Jamaican, then why
would l wear this hat ? Hmm ?

992
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:44,382
Delilah,

993
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:48,757
get me 814.

994
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:51,524
814.

995
01:01:51,598 --> 01:01:54,533
What the fuck is 814 ?

996
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:05,377
Oh ! l'm sorry, y'all.
l don't want to be the first nigger
to die from a crossbow.

997
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:08,903
You know, l have been
lying to you.

998
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:12,941
l'm sorry.
Samson, l'm sorry. Okay ?

999
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:16,011
We-- We just started this
because our friend got locked up.

1000
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:19,525
Brother, you know how that is.
We had to get him outta jail.

1001
01:02:19,592 --> 01:02:22,026
Now this
is what's gonna happen.

1002
01:02:22,095 --> 01:02:25,360
You make about 40,000,
50,000 a week.

1003
01:02:25,431 --> 01:02:27,922
Shit. l wish.

1004
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:30,663
Well, l want half,

1005
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:34,503
$20,000 a week,
or you're dead !

1006
01:02:34,574 --> 01:02:36,735
You understand ?

1007
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:41,178
Twenty thousand seems fair.
That seems fair, right guys ? lt's fair.

1008
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,841
Class dismissed.

1009
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:48,682
Man, we are
in trouble, man.

1010
01:02:52,558 --> 01:02:58,394
Jerry, l really need
your help, man. Feel us--

1011
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:02,833
Brian, will you stop praying to
a bag of sand, man ? Come on.

1012
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:09,032
You heard the man. lf we don't
get this money, we're dead. All of us !

1013
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:16,204
Yo, Thurgood, why don't you get your
boy, The Guy, to lend you some money ?

1014
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:19,843
- You certainly let him
stay here long enough.
- Man, that's Brian's boy.

1015
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:23,878
- l didn't let him stay here.
- l don't know him, man.

1016
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:32,596
- Hey, what day is it ?
- Saturday.

1017
01:03:32,665 --> 01:03:34,599
- 
- ls it January ?

1018
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:37,431
No, man, it's August.

1019
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:40,438
Oh, wow. August.

1020
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:43,270
- 
- Hey, l couldn't help
overhearing you guys.

1021
01:03:43,343 --> 01:03:48,110
You know, if you want to double
your profits, you should rob that lab.

1022
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:50,479
Tomorrow's Sunday.
There'll be no one in there.

1023
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,519
Just go in and rob
the place blind.

1024
01:03:53,586 --> 01:03:55,520
lt'll work, l promise you.

1025
01:03:55,588 --> 01:03:58,284


1026
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:01,759
Hey, uh, seein' as how
we don't know who you are,

1027
01:04:01,828 --> 01:04:04,922
are you plannin'
on movin' out anytime soon ?

1028
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:09,025
Thurgood, why don't you just
focus on one thing at a time ?

1029
01:04:09,102 --> 01:04:13,368
l'll be fine. The robbery
is what's important now.

1030
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:47,706


1031
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:53,611
Phase One is complete, yo.

1032
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:55,977
- 
-  All right.

1033
01:04:56,049 --> 01:04:59,644
Now all we gotta do is go down this
hatch to the second-floor supply room.

1034
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,552
Grab all the weed you can grab,
and we are outta here !

1035
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:04,556
Sick, man !
This is it ?

1036
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:06,558
Let's do it.

1037
01:05:06,626 --> 01:05:08,560
Watch your step.

1038
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,067
- You didn't say nothin'
about no door, yo.
- Chill out, man.

1039
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,906
l smoke weed here all the time.
This door's never locked.

1040
01:05:24,977 --> 01:05:27,502
- 
- l didn't say the alarm would be off.

1041
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,674
- l said it never locked.
- Well, hurry, yo !

1042
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,014
You guys, wait up !


1043
01:05:35,288 --> 01:05:37,222
Oh.

1044
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,588
- 
- Hold up !

1045
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:43,959
- lsn't that Thurgood, the custodian ?
- Yeah.

1046
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:48,364
- Want me to call the cops ?
- No. This is too much fun.

1047
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,629
Right over here !
Come on !

1048
01:05:50,703 --> 01:05:54,764


1049
01:05:56,642 --> 01:05:58,576
l hope there's some left.

1050
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:07,485


1051
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:16,726
Maui Wowie !

1052
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:20,288


1053
01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:27,672


1054
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,511
l never seen this much weed
in my life ! Let's go !

1055
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:40,981
- Come on, man !
- 

1056
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:53,765
 

1057
01:06:55,234 --> 01:06:59,034
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head.

1058
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:02,563
Yo, l'm gonna make
a run for it, B.

1059
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:04,610
Just get down, man.

1060
01:07:08,147 --> 01:07:10,445
At least Brian
got away, yo.

1061
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:15,510
Whoa ! My nads ! Oh !

1062
01:07:16,923 --> 01:07:19,619
Hey, thank God, man !

1063
01:07:19,692 --> 01:07:22,786
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head !

1064
01:07:24,363 --> 01:07:26,297
Move in.

1065
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:32,069
Breaking and entering.

1066
01:07:32,138 --> 01:07:34,106
You got me ?
Open and shut.

1067
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:36,801
l say we book 'em.
You got me ? We book 'em.

1068
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:40,812
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

1069
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,714
lt's not open and shut.
What do you guys do for a living ?

1070
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:47,275
- l'm a detective.
- Yeah, we're detectives.

1071
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:50,811
Oh. Okay then, detect.
Ask us somethin'.

1072
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,224
- What do you know about this
new Jamaican, this Mr. Nice Guy ?
- Yeah.

1073
01:07:55,294 --> 01:07:58,457
Aw, shit, yo.

1074
01:07:58,531 --> 01:08:03,025
Well, l heard he's got great weed,
but that's neither here nor there.

1075
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:06,128
- l mean, we can't bring him down.
- Crazy.

1076
01:08:06,205 --> 01:08:08,673
But we can
bring you Samson.

1077
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:12,336
Just ask me how. Ask me !

1078
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:15,278
How are you gonna
bring Samson down ?

1079
01:08:15,348 --> 01:08:18,374
We got a meeting with him
in a couple days.

1080
01:08:18,451 --> 01:08:20,612
l'll wear a wire. Hmm ?

1081
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:24,850
All right, listen to me.
There's $30,000 in this knapsack.

1082
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:27,358
When you get in there,
give him the 20 grand you owe him,

1083
01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:30,486
and with the remaining ten,
buy whatever narcotics he's got around.

1084
01:08:30,563 --> 01:08:33,794
You got me ?
You paying attention ?

1085
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:36,664
No. Sorry, man.

1086
01:08:36,736 --> 01:08:39,899
Unless you say out loud what it
is you're buying, we got nothin'.

1087
01:08:39,972 --> 01:08:43,738
So make sure that you say it, and make
sure that you get Samson to say it.

1088
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:45,743
- No codes. No slang.
- Yeah.

1089
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:50,145
As soon as you got the stuff,
or if anything goes wrong,
say the phrase, ''Abracadabra.''

1090
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:53,310
- Abracadabra.
- Abracadabra ?

1091
01:08:54,887 --> 01:08:58,152
- Okay. Okay.
- Make sure that you are relaxed.

1092
01:08:58,224 --> 01:09:00,158
And just act
completely normal.

1093
01:09:00,226 --> 01:09:02,990
- That's gonna be a problem.
- What do you mean ?

1094
01:09:03,062 --> 01:09:06,520
l mean we haven't smoked
any weed today, man.

1095
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:11,969
lf the three of us go in there
all clear-eyed, Samson
is gonna know somethin's up.

1096
01:09:14,473 --> 01:09:16,907
Well, if you think
it's gonna help.

1097
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:20,002
Yeah. Yeah, l think that's
gonna help. You got a light ?

1098
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:27,717
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1099
01:09:27,787 --> 01:09:30,620
- 
- Thanks, Officer.

1100
01:09:32,858 --> 01:09:35,383


1101
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:37,486
l just wanna say,

1102
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:41,522
that was a great idea,
Thurgood.

1103
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,401
- Wow. l mean, where do you even--
- Just smoke it, yo !

1104
01:09:48,007 --> 01:09:50,271
lf somethin' happens to us,
could you--

1105
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:53,710
could you give this letter
to Mary Jane Potman ?

1106
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,747
Sure thing, kid.

1107
01:09:55,815 --> 01:10:01,515
And-- And tell our friend Kenny Davis
we love him. He's in prison.

1108
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:04,579
- Let's go. Come on.
- All right. Let's move.

1109
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:08,017
Just remember to speak clearly.

1110
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,756
- Get him to say what he's sellin' you.
- Yeah.

1111
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,764
lt ain't always good...

1112
01:10:12,832 --> 01:10:15,960
to get high before you have
important things to do.

1113
01:10:16,035 --> 01:10:20,802
Lucky for us,
the cops had our backs.

1114
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:24,832
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Samson.

1115
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:28,812
So... where's the money ?

1116
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:30,815
Right here in my bag.

1117
01:10:30,883 --> 01:10:34,011
Um, Samson, can l
ask you a question ?

1118
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:36,384
Go ahead.

1119
01:10:36,455 --> 01:10:40,323
Do you know where we can score
some cocaine ?

1120
01:10:40,393 --> 01:10:44,056
- You want some candy ?
- Uh, no, thanks.

1121
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:48,726
But it'd be great
if we can get some cocaine.

1122
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:52,237
- 
- What's so funny ?

1123
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:54,772
Those guys--
Those guys are doomed !

1124
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,331
l can't feel my hands !

1125
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,344
l-- l can feel them.

1126
01:10:59,412 --> 01:11:03,280


1127
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:05,840
What we have here...

1128
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:08,011
is some Columbian heaven.

1129
01:11:08,087 --> 01:11:10,214
Pure cocaine.

1130
01:11:10,289 --> 01:11:13,725
- Candy makes you dandy.
- Hmm.

1131
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:17,627
This is all the cocaine
we get for ten G's, B ?

1132
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:20,358
- We have other product.
- Oh, like more cocaine ?

1133
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,628
And that is ?

1134
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:28,969
Fine China. Babaloo.

1135
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:32,841
- Looks like heroin to me, yo.
- Yeah. ls that heroin ?

1136
01:11:32,912 --> 01:11:36,473
You've got to be the dumbest dealers
in the history of the dope game.

1137
01:11:36,549 --> 01:11:39,985
You mean the game
that you run, yo ?

1138
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:42,714
- Good.
- Just call me Jesse Owens.

1139
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:45,757
Jesse, can we get some cocaine
and get the hell outta here ?

1140
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:49,852
- Okay.
- Can l buy some of your heroin too ?

1141
01:11:49,929 --> 01:11:52,955
- Okay.
- 

1142
01:11:53,032 --> 01:11:55,125
All right. All right.

1143
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:57,601
lt's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1144
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,639
Thank you very much for the heroin
and the cocaine. Here's your money.

1145
01:12:00,706 --> 01:12:02,367
All right.

1146
01:12:04,643 --> 01:12:06,577
Abracadabra.

1147
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,814
Yeah, man !

1148
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:14,817
Abracadabra.

1149
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:18,287


1150
01:12:18,357 --> 01:12:21,190
''You're all the Mary Jane
l'll ever need.''

1151
01:12:24,597 --> 01:12:28,465
- Abracadabra, yo !
- Oh, abracadabra, man.

1152
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:33,028
- Abracadabra.
- Boy, why do you keep saying that ?

1153
01:12:33,105 --> 01:12:35,630
What ? Abracadabra ?

1154
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:37,972
Yes. Abracadabra.

1155
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:41,012
lt's the latest thing.
All the kids are saying it, all right ?

1156
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,640
- Abracadabra, my brother.
- What's up ? Abracadabra.

1157
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:47,277
- Abracadabra.
- Slim, take off your shirt.

1158
01:12:48,354 --> 01:12:51,619
Samson, Samson,
l hardly know you.

1159
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,988
- Ladies.
-  Abracadabra.

1160
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:56,220
- Abracadabra, man !
- Abracadabra, yo !

1161
01:12:56,295 --> 01:12:59,059
Abracadabra ! Abra--

1162
01:12:59,131 --> 01:13:03,534
You're dead ! All of you !

1163
01:13:03,602 --> 01:13:06,696
Hey, fellas,
let's beat these bitches !

1164
01:13:09,975 --> 01:13:12,671


1165
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,267
Let's work it out.

1166
01:13:42,508 --> 01:13:45,272
Oh, yo, your titty.

1167
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:50,937
- Now, that's a titty.
- Fully, man.

1168
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:54,179
That is an official fully.

1169
01:13:54,253 --> 01:13:56,084
Aah !

1170
01:14:00,893 --> 01:14:06,024
- These are mean people. Mean, mean, man.
- Look out !

1171
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:09,527


1172
01:14:11,837 --> 01:14:14,670
This is for Killer, B.

1173
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:19,177
- 
- Surprise, surprise, surprise.

1174
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:21,212
Look who's walkin'.

1175
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:24,708
Nigger, l thought
you said you was crippled.

1176
01:14:24,783 --> 01:14:28,947
Well, sweet pea,
we're all crippled in some way.

1177
01:14:29,021 --> 01:14:31,990
- Put it down !
- You win.

1178
01:14:32,057 --> 01:14:33,991
Now...

1179
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:37,392
this is the way
it's gonna work.

1180
01:14:37,463 --> 01:14:40,398
l'm gonna take your little
Mexican friend with me,

1181
01:14:40,466 --> 01:14:42,400
and l'm gonna kill him.

1182
01:14:42,468 --> 01:14:45,494
- l'm Cuban, B.
- Yes, Cuban B.

1183
01:14:45,571 --> 01:14:50,736
- Now is there anything you want
to say to your friends ?
- Jerry, we need you.

1184
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:53,403
Abracadabra, B !

1185
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:01,653
Oh, man !

1186
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:06,753
Oh, wow.

1187
01:15:08,427 --> 01:15:11,828
Sucks to be you, man !

1188
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:16,227
Oh, man ! Oh, man !

1189
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:20,601
What did l--
l told you he was real, man.

1190
01:15:20,673 --> 01:15:24,734
Jerry... thank you, man.

1191
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,778
You're welcome, Brian.

1192
01:15:26,845 --> 01:15:29,370
Peace.

1193
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:36,420


1194
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:39,389
- Well, abracadabra.
- Whoa !

1195
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:42,586
- All right.
- What the hell's goin' on here ?

1196
01:15:42,661 --> 01:15:47,098
- Our job is done.
These guys can go home.
- You guys are wasted, man.

1197
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:50,533
Thurgood, Thurgood.
Nice letter.

1198
01:15:50,602 --> 01:15:53,503
- Gimme that back.
- Queer.

1199
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:56,507


1200
01:15:59,344 --> 01:16:01,312
- Everybody, freeze !
- Oh, shit !

1201
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,314
Nobody move !

1202
01:16:06,118 --> 01:16:10,282
 The cops took all
the credit for bustin' Samson,
but that's not important.

1203
01:16:10,355 --> 01:16:14,382
What was important is that we cut
a deal, and Kenny was finally free.

1204
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,395
- Hallelujah !
-  

1205
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:21,690
Which brings me
to the Brooklyn Bridge,

1206
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:24,497
where l had to make things right
with Mary Jane.

1207
01:16:27,606 --> 01:16:31,440
- Hi.
- Are you ?

1208
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,671
A little bit from yesterday,
you know, when Kenny got--

1209
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:38,615
But-But-But, Mary Jane, listen.
l'm done. l'm done sellin' it.

1210
01:16:38,684 --> 01:16:41,847
l'm done smokin' it.
This is the last of it, right here.

1211
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,583
l just wanted you to see me
get rid of it.

1212
01:16:47,426 --> 01:16:49,860
Could we just have a--
a moment alone ?

1213
01:16:52,164 --> 01:16:55,292
Do what you gotta do.
Be strong.

1214
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:57,301
Thanks, baby.

1215
01:17:00,439 --> 01:17:02,430
Mary Jane,

1216
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:06,706
bein' with you these past
11 years has been wonderful.

1217
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:08,713
But l gotta move on.

1218
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:13,047
Come on. Smoke me.
Have a quickie for old time's sake.

1219
01:17:13,118 --> 01:17:16,281
No. She's looking.

1220
01:17:16,355 --> 01:17:19,051
She's looking.
All right. Real quick.

1221
01:17:22,194 --> 01:17:25,391
No. No ! lt wouldn't be right.

1222
01:17:25,464 --> 01:17:27,830
Goddamn you !

1223
01:17:30,569 --> 01:17:33,299
You'll be back !

1224
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:36,307

1225

1227
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:49,476
 l know.
l know what you're thinkin'.

1228
01:17:49,555 --> 01:17:53,616
- That old Thurgood sold out, right ?
- l'm your girl now.

1229
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:58,095
But let me tell you something.
l love weed, okay ? l love it.

1230
01:17:59,498 --> 01:18:03,457
But not as much
as l love pussy.

1231
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:05,469
The End.

1232
01:18:06,538 --> 01:18:10,770
