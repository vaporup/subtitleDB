16
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:46,093
Hello? Yes, it's me.

17
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:51,899
I really love this place. I even named it.

18
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,273
Who designed it? It's quite extraordinary.

19
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,407
I see.

20
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,846
Thanks again for the furniture and the stereo.

21
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,991
I'll call again soon.

22
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,570
Hi, I just moved into...

23
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,144
Hi

24
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:13,947
Hello

25
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,417
How are you?

26
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,683
Is the water hot enough?

27
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,687
Wow, these fellas sure look good!

28
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,691
I put in sliced carrots and onions

29
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,921
Get ready.

30
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:02,663
1, 2, 3... pull!!

31
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:07,965
- Help!
- We won!

32
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,934
One more time.

33
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,275
Let's begin at Merry Christmas.

34
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,711
Get with it!
- Let's get it right.

35
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,782
Ok, here we go.

36
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,754
Merry Christmas.

37
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,303
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

38
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,841
Hi, I'm the previous tenant of your place.

39
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,473
I must ask you for a favor. I'm waiting for a letter.

40
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:05,155
If a letter arrives for me,
please forward it to the address below?

41
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,324
Thanks.

42
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:14,099
Best wishes, Kim Eun-joo, Dec. 21, 1999

43
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:23,442
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in...

44
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,208
...l never got around to removing them.

45
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,177
You'll get used to them.

46
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,590
Hello.

47
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:48,861
No, I was waiting for a call.

48
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,834
He's a jerk.

49
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,756
Merry Christmas...

50
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,751
Hi. Cigarettes, please.

51
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,321
Help yourself, they're over there.

52
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,728
What's that you write by your place?

53
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,471
"IL MARE". It means the "sea".

54
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:40,311
Sea? What do you know about the ocean?

55
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,672
I thought I'd start learning.

56
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:51,383
Did anyone live there before?

57
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:55,723
Nope. Your aunt finished building it a last month.

58
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,229
It's a brand new place.

59
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,267
- Time for dinner
- Ok.

60
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:46,769
Talk about a lousy disappearing act!

61
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,801
We brought your designs from school.

62
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:54,312
- Design my ass.
- Want some tea?

63
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:12,256
I'm leaving today to go study abroad.

64
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,294
Dropped by to say good bye.

65
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:23,436
I guess you have to get going.

66
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:31,347
Thanks for everything.

67
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,250
Learn as much as you can out there.

68
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,984
I think I should learn how to mend hearts first.

69
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,393
Hye-won, it's time to go. Let's get going.

70
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:51,426
Nice place. I'll come by again.

71
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,636
Come on.

72
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,206
Hey!

73
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,681
Hey, you!

74
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:54,492
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in.

75
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:57,162
I never got around to removing them.

76
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,268
You'll get used to them.

77
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:23,421
- Hello.
- Hey the girl from "il mur".

78
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:26,227
It's "Il Mare".

79
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,666
"il mur", "Il Mare", same difference.

80
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:36,542
Has the place been sold?

81
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,005
Nope.

82
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,243
May I go see it?

83
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,946
The keys are over there.

84
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,451
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

85
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,020
- Honey, want some noodles?
- Add rice cakes too.

86
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:51,074
I thought I should write you.

87
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,702
I'm the first occupant of "Il Mare".

88
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,380
And I think your letter came to me by mistake.

89
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,315
I know you're waiting for important mail.

90
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:02,782
so you may want to check the address again.

91
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,585
Sincerely, HAN Sung-hyun Dec. 28, 1997

92
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:12,696
P.S. How did you know this place is called Il Mare?

93
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,747
I don't know how my letter got there...

94
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:36,481
...but I hope you're not playing some game.

95
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,513
Please don't tamper with my mail.

96
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:42,750
Sincerely, Kim Eun-joo Dec. 29, 1999

97
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:49,700
P.S. I hope you're not really from 1997.

98
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:16,526
I know it's the last day of the millennium.

99
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,832
Of course I want to go but I have to work...

100
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,034
I'll watch the shop for you.

101
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Where should I meet you?

102
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,951
- I read 7 volumes.
- 2,100 Wons. Thank you.

103
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,607
Let's countdown to the new millennium together.

104
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:15,051
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

105
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:21,122
4... 3... 2... 1!

106
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:26,429
Happy New Millennium!

107
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:37,997
'Listen to this your letters keep ending up in my
mailbox.

108
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:42,000
You should look for other ways to retrieve your mail.

109
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,877
'Sincerely, Han Sung-hyun Jan. 7, 1998.'

110
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:55,687
'P.S. It is definitely 1998 right now.'

111
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:04,352
Eun-joo, you are the voice actor,
I'm the comic book store owner,

112
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:09,165
I should be the one with the crazy stories.

113
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,774
I know, but it's so weird.

114
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:22,306
I read more comics books anyhow!

115
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,108
1998?

116
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,649
- Hello.
- It's snowing Eun-joo!

117
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:39,689
You're right.

118
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:46,165
Remember 2 years ago? We caught the killer flu.

119
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:57,581
But I'm from an island, I can't resist the snow.

120
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,378
You'll watch the store for me tomorrow, right?

121
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:05,452
- Ok.
- Thanks.

122
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,492
Let's call it a day, guys.

123
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:00,740
- Sung-hyun, what're you waiting for?
- Coming.

124
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,986
Is the sky falling?

125
00:25:10,356 --> 00:25:13,086
I thought I'd cover up the control box.

126
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,021
- No snow forecasts for tonight.
- Let's get a couple of drinks.

127
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,192
Sounds good to me.

128
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:39,676
It's going to snow a lot from Jan. 9 in 1998.

129
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:46,052
If you're still in 1998, watch out for the flu.

130
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:52,420
There was a nasty virus going around.

131
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:08,437
Dear Eun-joo, you were right, it snowed heavily on
January 9.

132
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:13,408
...and despite your warning, I managed to catch
the cold.

133
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:17,847
You must be a psychic because...

134
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:21,424
...l can't believe you're living in the future.

135
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,290
Psychic? I told you to...

136
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,540
I still can't believe that you're living in 1998.

137
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:44,910
But I don't think you're joking either.

138
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:51,482
I wish I was a psychic then I could tell the futur

139
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:57,357
But please forward my mail to me, ok?

140
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,898
- Let's go.
- I need to go somewhere.

141
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,567
- Tomorrow's the deadline.
- I'll do an all-nighter.

142
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,720
Why a construction site?

143
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:39,230
- She was telling the truth.
- What?

144
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:45,139
- I wonder what she looks like?
- Who?

145
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,813
The girl who lives there.

146
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:53,074
Fool, who the hell lives on a construction site?

147
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,551
Sung-hyun, hey man!

148
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:13,897
Hey, Cola. Look at the little fish eat.

149
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:30,715
- I have one more question...
- Dog? You mean Cola.

150
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:38,224
You're the one who had him first
so why did you leave him here?

151
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,832
He was wandering around Il Mare when I found him.

152
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:44,801
He sleeps like a person, doesn't he?

153
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,938
Hey, you're Cola?

154
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,201
Hey, Cola!

155
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,748
There must be a wrinkle in time...

156
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:11,119
...because he can't be in 2 places at one time.

157
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:14,061
He should only be with one of us.

158
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:18,066
but I swear that he's with me now.

159
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,570
It's the mail box, the mail box!

160
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,283
I think you're right.

161
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,388
But I'm not a big on hair bands my hair's a little
short.

162
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:54,631
Well, maybe you should grow it, it's a gift after all.

163
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:07,864
- We're going on a picnic.
- Whoopee!

164
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,833
I'm so excited!

165
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:14,540
Let's go!

166
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:19,281
Wait, I forgot our picnic basket.

167
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,218
Do you have the key?

168
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,516
No!

169
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:29,156
No one has the key!

170
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:33,655
Oh, no! Don't leave your keys behind.

171
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,891
Yeah!

172
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:01,654
Whoopee...

173
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:31,880
Hello?

174
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,681
Hello.

175
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,251
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

176
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:28,744
Hi.

177
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:35,443
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Worm.

178
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:39,216
Do you live here?

179
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:45,295
Sure. Here is my home.

180
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:21,065
I thought love meant eternal bliss.

181
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,569
Cooking sometimes helps.

182
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,935
If you want to cook pasta the right way,

183
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,875
...throw the cooked noodles at the wall.

184
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:40,509
If it sticks, it's just right.

185
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:17,781
Do you feel better?

186
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,962
We're tormented because love goes on...

187
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:37,398
...not because it goes away.

188
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:43,712
It's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all.

189
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:50,518
I hope you feel better, Eun-joo.

190
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:19,975
Request for academic leave.

191
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:51,134
You're an architect not a construction worker.

192
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:58,076
Why leave with only one semester left?

193
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:05,279
I hate all the hypocrites who preach family values.

194
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,118
Well, you should talk.

195
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,294
That's why I'm leaving.

196
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,557
Geez, you've been acting weird lately.

197
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:34,274
I feel like I'm being ambushed by memories
I'd rather forget.

198
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,818
Do you have any memories
you'd prefer to abandon?

199
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:57,502
Hey, Cola. Doing laundry can be therapeutic.

200
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:05,575
Thanks for helping me move in. I've tried to be a
nice neighbor.

201
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:12,073
But please stop leaving chocolate almonds in my mailbox.

202
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:19,857
The chocolate melts all over my mail.

203
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,625
This chocolate, chocolate...

204
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:32,592
The chocolate melts all over my mail and I can't read them.

205
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:00,995
What would I want back from 1998?

206
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:08,132
My friend gave me a tape recorder
to practice voice acting and I lost it.

207
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,576
I looked in my diary and it was on Feb. 11...

208
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:16,741
I was at the station on my way home.

209
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:19,813
I always sat on the last bench towards south.

210
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,615
I lost it that night.

211
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:33,153
Go there, and you'll see me in the year 1998.

212
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:39,721
I love you... I LOVE you... l love YOU...

213
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,846
Hey, wait! Eun-joo!

214
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:13,858
What're you doing?

215
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,498
Didn't you lose this?

216
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,535
Listen to this... I love you...

217
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,667
Hi, Eun-joo. It's me Sung-hyun.

218
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:32,372
- I hope you received the recorder.
- Hey, who's this?

219
00:44:56,908 --> 00:45:00,366
Thank you for the recorder.

220
00:45:00,912 --> 00:45:03,904
I'm sending you 2 gifts...

221
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:10,080
...but 1 of them may not get there because it's alive.

222
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:16,126
The earmuffs are to keep you warm.

223
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:20,890
If you need a favor from me, let me know.

224
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:10,840
Your aunt called me.

225
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:18,719
I know it's not easy for you, but she's like your mother.

226
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,653
...and she really wants you to do this.

227
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:27,855
Please go visit Professor Han at the hospital in right away.

228
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:42,564
In the year 2000, is there anything on Professor Han?

229
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,064
That's "Il Mare".

230
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I can't accept...

231
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
...neither my father's death
nor my love for him.
