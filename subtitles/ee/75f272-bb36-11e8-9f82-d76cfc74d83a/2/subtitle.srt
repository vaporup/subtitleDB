1
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:04,559
Yeah, I'm back from the hospital.

2
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,431
I'm ok.

3
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:16,505
Did you put the book in the mailbox?

4
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,816
Okay.

5
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,077
I'll go get it.

6
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,326
Seung Hyun.

7
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:41,566
There are 3 things a person can't hide...

8
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:46,465
...coughing, poverty and love.

9
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,440
The harder one tries to hide them,
the more they rise to the surface.

10
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:56,277
But there are times when you still want to hide them.

11
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:00,549
I just sit and cry...

12
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:06,385
...and cry until I can't anymore.

13
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,129
Love is a self-inflicted pain.

14
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:22,536
I hope you'll find peace within you.

15
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,603
Il Mare looks like a lonely place.

16
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:56,235
But its warmth and comfort comes from the love within.

17
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,176
Love comes to us in different ways

18
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:04,014
but underneath all those ways,
I believe there is only one love.

19
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,815
It's been delivered a little late..

20
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,351
but I hope your father's book
helped you to understand him.

21
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,436
Hye-gi!

22
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,406
Auntie!

23
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,303
- Have you been good, kiddo?
- Yes.

24
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,903
Are you ok?

25
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,942
Yes, how's dad?

26
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:12,043
He's at a seminar in Seoul.

27
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,611
Let's get in. Come on.
/ Let's go.

28
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,664
Eun-joo,

29
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:34,139
Everyone I loved
were always out of my reach...

30
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:40,276
...and I think I ached for them.

31
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:48,413
I was 7 when my father left me.

32
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:36,169
Cola!

33
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,362
It's dinner time.

34
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:43,841
You like Mr. Fish?

35
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,413
Cola,

36
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:01,951
I'll be right back. Be good now.

37
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:10,147
Gosh, it's freezing...

38
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,144
Excuse...

39
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:22,292
I saw you at the station tonight.

40
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:26,196
White sweater, black muffler,

41
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:29,725
and very long pretty hair...

42
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:35,909
Haven't heard from you in a while...
I'm anxious to hear from you.

43
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,971
Il Mare can make you feel so alone.

44
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,501
I felt like that when I was there.

45
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:48,148
Sung-hyun, wanna have some fun?

46
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:01,487
Go inside a convenience store and grab a beer.

47
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,767
Drink it down...

48
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,401
Now start running!

49
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,475
Go for a ride on the Viking.

50
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:24,314
The adrenaline rush is amazing.

51
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,663
This is the moment when...

52
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,585
It's my turn!

53
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,114
Take a bus to Bomunri.

54
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:48,130
Get off at Mulmok near the tree-lined boulevard.

55
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,932
Do you like to take walks?

56
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,204
It's a beautiful place to just walk alone

57
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,076
and think things through.

58
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,411
You'll feel better.

59
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:24,636
Just when you start to get tired,
You'll see a little cafe.

60
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:28,038
I go there to drink wine sometimes.

61
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,328
Do you like wine?

62
00:13:56,203 --> 00:14:00,435
I heard that wine drinkers are lonely.

63
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,500
...but it doesn't matter to me.

64
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:12,717
I reserved a bottle of wine to be opened
in the year 2000.

65
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,017
How is it?

66
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:21,218
Wine is supposed to get better with age.

67
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,528
Thanks to you ...

68
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,195
I had a great time.

69
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,464
How about you, Eun-Joo?

70
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,536
I did too.

71
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:45,613
But I felt a little sad coming back alone.

72
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,767
I'd really like to meet you,

73
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,709
if it's ok with you.

74
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:24,783
Hey, Cola.

75
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,718
You really think we'll meet?

76
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,691
Can you come down to Cheju lsland?

77
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:38,431
I'm going home next week.

78
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:42,943
Cola, Cola!

79
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:52,751
Cola, I'm going to meet Eun-joo.

80
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:59,051
What'll we do for the next two years?

81
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,991
Are you looking at the photo?

82
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:06,625
The coral beach is where I want to live.

83
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,969
Once you see it you'll want to build a house on it.

84
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:19,480
Oh, our rendezvous date is March 11, 2000 at 3 p.m...

85
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,573
on the coral beach.

86
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,982
March 11, 2000...

87
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,853
It's a Saturday.

88
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,584
Don't forget. I only have a week,

89
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:38,360
...but you still have over 2 years to go.

90
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,361
Eun Joo, aren't you going to sleep?

91
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:46,668
I'll be right down. Good night

92
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,732
Go to bed, dear.

93
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,034
Can I help you?

94
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,369
No, I was just...

95
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,100
Are you building a house here?

96
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,405
Yes, we are.

97
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,377
Are you going to live here?

98
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:39,886
No, I'm here for the construction.
Why do you ask?

99
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:45,187
Just curious...

100
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,421
A friend of mine designed it.

101
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,657
Isn't it perfect for this beach?

102
00:18:57,171 --> 00:19:00,504
He dedicated it to his true love.

103
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,506
I see...

104
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,013
I gotta run.

105
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,016
Good luck.

106
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,376
I waited for you a long time.

107
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:30,788
I know 2 years is a long time
but I still hoped you'll show.

108
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,183
I guess I expected too much again.

109
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:38,396
I know I shouldn't...

110
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:44,027
because it always leads to disaster.

111
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:53,672
But everyone I care about is so far away.

112
00:21:56,283 --> 00:22:00,185
What happened to you in those 2 years?

113
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:05,382
I hope you just forgot.

114
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,026
I wouldn't forget a promise like that.

115
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:23,176
This is breathtaking.

116
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:54,571
Sung-hyun's letters were little pieces of happiness.

117
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,009
But there still is this sense of emptiness.

118
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,908
Is it because of losing Ji-hoon?

119
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:11,982
Or not being able to meet Sung-hyun?

120
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,529
There's a technical problem...

121
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,567
so let's take a 30 min.

122
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,830
Let's get some coffee!

123
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,271
My treat!

124
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,342
More animation, the better. It means more work for us.

125
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,680
And it's great that are many big projects in the works.

126
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,276
That's true.

127
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,962
Sorry, I'm late.

128
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,932
No, not at all, I just got here too.

129
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,698
Ji Hoon, about our engagement...

130
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,796
Yeah, let's do it this month.

131
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:00,999
Really?

132
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,508
How about 2 Wednesdays from now?

133
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:05,546
Ok!

134
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,036
It's about time.

135
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,207
But why do you want to rush this?

136
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:13,049
I'm not rushing. You're the one who's stalling.

137
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,020
Just be patient...

138
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:20,617
until my animation project's finish.

139
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,061
ok.

140
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,892
I thought I could forget him...

141
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:16,305
...but when I heard his voice again,
everything fell apart.

142
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:23,913
I know he loves someone else...

143
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:30,619
...but I can't help it.

144
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:36,257
I can't stop thinking about him.

145
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,830
Please help me stop him from leaving.

146
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,469
I'm sorry..

147
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,777
I'm really sorry, Seung Hyun.

148
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,100
Hi. -Sorry, I'm late.
It's ok. Are you hungry? -No but dinner is on me.
What should we eat? -Whatever you want.

149
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,184
Was I just a stranger to you?

150
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,060
Am I only a meaningless faceless stranger to you?

151
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,027
Jung Sook!

152
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:03,900
Was it the right decision not
to go with Ji-Hoon to USA?

153
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,634
and become a radio-performer?

154
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,437
Of course.

155
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:15,879
True love comes from true independence.

156
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,349
Forget all about Ji-Hoon.

157
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,584
I want to believe it too.

158
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:29,519
All I want is career and love.

159
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:09,388
My happiest moments were opening my mail

160
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:15,898
under your Christmas lights.

161
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,880
Eun-Joo.

162
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:43,228
It was really hard studying in the USA alone.

163
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:53,531
I just got too tired and lonely...

164
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,234
...and I wanted someone there.

165
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,170
I'm sorry...

166
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,587
We should have went together.

167
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:44,983
Please help me stop him from leaving me.

168
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:49,859
I'm so sorry,
I'm asking you for this.

169
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,191
I'm sorry, Seung Hyun.

170
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,468
I'll help you.

171
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:11,872
Why didn't you tell me how you felt before?

172
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,710
We don't have much time.

173
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,214
Eun Joo, do you remember your first letter?

174
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,115
You wished me good fortune at Il Mare.

175
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:33,326
Knowing you has been a blessing.

176
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,004
This time I want to return this good fortune to you.

177
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:53,914
Best wishes to you.

178
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:10,429
Thank you for everything.

179
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,667
Good bye...

180
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:24,206
Excuse me. Where's the department of architecture?

181
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:25,410
That's over there...

182
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,282
Thank you.

183
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:37,560
My Lord, you're the biggest whiner these days...

184
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,622
You are complaining about your room again?

185
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,232
Well, life isn't fair.

186
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,674
He dedicated it to his true love..

187
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:14,631
May I help you?

188
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:19,100
Sung-hyun dedicated it to you. Eun-joo.

189
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,514
It was a car accident.

190
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,492
Help me...

191
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,994
Help me stop him from leaving me...

192
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:48,465
He was on his way to Youido to meet someone.
The driver didn't see him.

193
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:09,354
Seung Hyun! Don't go there.

194
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,330
It's that house over there.

195
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:22,616
Please...

196
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:26,157
Please... hurry...

197
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:31,200
The letter has to reach him.

198
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:36,374
Seung Hyun, please don't go there.

199
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:39,611
It's all my fault.

200
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,845
The letter has to reach him in time...

201
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:12,044
Our last date was at a cafe called morning.

202
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:18,250
in Youido on March 25, 1998.

203
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:22,750
Cheer up, Eun Joo.

204
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,120
I'm not going away forever.

205
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:27,022
Don't be so down.

206
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,829
I know, I just feel weird.

207
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,462
I asked you to come with me.

208
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:37,094
It's not easy becoming a voice actor.

209
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:41,773
Not many people pass the exam.

210
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:45,235
It's only 3 years... right?

211
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,972
It will be alright.

212
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:51,945
I just feel so uneasy.

213
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,701
Please don't go.

214
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:57,104
Don't go there.

215
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,369
Don't die.

216
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:04,044
Seung Hyun... I'm sorry.

217
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:19,357
The fact that I don't show up 2 years from now...

218
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,697
...must mean that we weren't meant to be.

219
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,479
And you are...?

220
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:01,333
I hope you're ready to hear
a long and magical tale.

221
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,532
Can you trust me?
