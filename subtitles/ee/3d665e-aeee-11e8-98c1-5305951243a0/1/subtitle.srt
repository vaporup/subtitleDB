1
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,252
Our India is the best...

2
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,760
of all the world by far

3
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,926
Our India is the best...

4
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,435
...of all the world by far

5
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,609
We are it's buds.

6
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,277
It is our garden, all ours, ours.

7
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,285
Our India is the best...

8
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,290
...of all the world by far

9
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,288
This way.

10
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,631
Our tomorrow is based on our today

11
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,136
What we choose to do today will decide...

12
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,541
...what happens to us tomorrow.

13
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,971
The choice isn't between good and evil.

14
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,314
That's easy.

15
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,980
The real choices of life
are choosing between...

16
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:44,988
...the lesser of two evils,
or the greater of two goods.

17
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,922
Now what do you choose,
Zooni, what's your choice?

18
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,228
Oh, leave my little girl alone!

19
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,759
Just listen to your heart dear...

20
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,334
...not your father’s philosophy!

21
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,931
Try and take some decisions...

22
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,004
...from the heart rather than the brain, Zulfi

23
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:07,835
If I'd used my brain you wouldn't be here,
Nafisa my love.

24
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,779
So? Zooni?

25
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,586
Papa, Mama, I really can't decide.

26
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,851
I'll do whatever you say.

27
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,254
So that's it. It's decided.

28
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,362
Zooni will not go to Delhi.

29
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:36,364
I found my prince.
When will Zooni find hers?

30
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,274
When will some footballer
hit her head with a ball?

31
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,039
Any regrets?

32
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,443
Regrets?

33
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:51,148
I praise God every day that the
great Zulfikar Ali Beg's...

34
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,622
...penalty kick missed the goal...

35
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,392
...and hit me, square on the head.

36
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,222
It was my worst kick ever!

37
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,488
Any regrets?

38
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,729
Regrets?

39
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,567
That's why I tended to you
in the hospital for a week.

40
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,574
We must accept that Zooni...

41
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,007
...may have to live her life without
that special someone.

42
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,080
That perhaps she will never marry.

43
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:24,383
And when we're gone
who will look out for her?

44
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,251
We must give her the
chance to live her life.

45
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,095
We need to support her independence.

46
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,897
Be her strength, not her weakness.

47
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,352
Madam Mehbooba

48
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,454
Bobo, the name is Bobo not Mehbooba

49
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,128
Whatever you command your highness.

50
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,957
By the way, your bags weigh
more than your brain!

51
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,960
Obviously! Haven't you heard that saying?

52
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,693
- Which one?
- "The buffalo is bigger than the brain."

53
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,131
No dummy, it's "Is the brain bigger
or the buffalo?"

54
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,308
- Fatty!
- Not Fatty, Fatima.

55
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,909
Don't know why you girls insist on
distorting perfectly good names.

56
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,047
- Yes, Ruby.
- Not Ruby, Rubina.

57
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,382
Come on... take the bags at least!

58
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,316
We have to represent Kashmir,
at a Republic Day performance...

59
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,825
...at the President's Palace,
in front of the Chief Minister of Delhi...

60
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,156
...and what do I have to pull this off?

61
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,493
A bunch of wild cats!

62
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,071
If we're a bunch of wild cats
what does that make our leader?

63
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,336
Who said that?

64
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,339
You've carried your knitting?

65
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,946
When we're upset,
we say things to distract

66
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,013
"Have you taken your knitting?

67
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,444
Kept your ticket safely?

68
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,179
Don't get off at a station on the way."

69
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,683
God keep you safe.

70
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:09,294
Papa... papa! When papa's upset,
not just his voice

71
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,860
His walk also changes.

72
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,363
Yes, and he can't even cry in front of all these girls.

73
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,772
But I have no such problem!

74
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,878
I know you have to do this...

75
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,540
...but I don't know why, I'm afraid.

76
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,775
Afraid of what?

77
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,882
Loosing me to some prince?

78
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:35,553
Oh, I wish!

79
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,223
One look at you,
and he'll be on his knees

80
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,721
Heaven forbid! Will he be a porter?

81
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,450
- Kneel to get my bags?
- Hush!

82
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,219
Not a porter, not your bags,
he'll take your heart away.

83
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,800
With some poetry maybe...

84
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,068
..."Every once in a while
I get this feeling in my heart...

85
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,634
...that you were made for me, all apart."

86
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,570
"You were living in the
mountains somewhere...

87
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,073
...before there was me."

88
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,747
"You have been called down
to this earth, only for me."

89
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,751
God keep you safe, my child,
God keep you safe!

90
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,925
God keep you, mama.

91
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,590
Have a safe journey.

92
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,098
- Be sure to say a prayer for me at the Jama Masjid.
- Yes, mama.

93
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,766
Take Zooni for an eye test in the big city...

94
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,697
...and you, Rubina take care of my baby!

95
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,097
Relax Aunty.

96
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,931
Don't worry, I'm here aren't I?

97
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,606
That's what I'm afraid of Fatima.

98
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,934
It's Fatty, aunty.

99
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,271
Bye dear, Bye Zooni!

100
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,349
Mama! Mama!

101
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,118
Yes, my child!

102
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,282
If the Prince recites poetry
what should I say?

103
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,793
"May my life's breath find refuge in your heart...

104
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,626
...destroyed in your love may my life depart."

105
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,299
Bye Mama!

106
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,993
Why do you do this?

107
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,430
You can say something as well.

108
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,829
Now listen up Rao.
We're here for just 7 days.

109
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,335
5 days to the show, and 2 for holidaying.

110
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,498
I want to sight-see Delhi,
not your bald head.

111
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,574
Stand straight like a man!

112
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,004
I'm not even a man any more Madam.

113
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,442
After years of bowing to
government officers...

114
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,013
...I have come to this sorry state.

115
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,844
Today if I have children,
even they will be born bent over.

116
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,579
I have no interest in your
family planning program!

117
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,779
Where is that tour guide?

118
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,427
I am the Balwaan.
Not the Cartoon Network.

119
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,127
You are exactly what you look like!

120
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,599
Now tell me what's the problem here?

121
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,871
Where do I start?

122
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,200
From the head light to the exhaust...

123
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,275
...there are problems and more problems.

124
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,647
I mean your tour guide.
Where on earth is he?

125
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:28,392
"Don't look around the city
Forget the wasteland too"

126
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:34,560
"Behold God's greatest creation.
Rehan is just above you."

127
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,407
You Mr. Romeo. Stop this cheap poetry!

128
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,187
You didn't applaud me, now at least help me

129
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,150
Oh, you're blind.

130
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,193
Yes, you didn't see that?
Are you blind too?

131
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,994
Thank God, I'm not.

132
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,270
That's a nice thing to say to a blind person.

133
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,303
If I was blind, I couldn't have seen...

134
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,940
...the most beautiful thing in the world, you.

135
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:27,510
"Your beauty made God make a mistake,
what more can I say?

136
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,314
So that you don't caste an evil eye on yourself,
he took your eyes away."

137
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,622
Zooni, where are you?

138
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:35,790
I'm coming Fatty.

139
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,861
Fatty? Is that your name or your dog's?

140
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,794
Come on Balwante...

141
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,798
...hit the gas!

142
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,497
Heavenly!

143
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,741
If wish I was a roll of wool...

144
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,348
If wish I was a roll of wool...

145
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,686
...wrapped around her fingers...

146
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,524
If you were a roll of wool,
with the needles... I'd...

147
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,685
I wish she'd make a sweater out of me,
wear me, even in the summer.

148
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,362
Wow! What a thought!

149
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,696
Zooni, stop encouraging his nonsense.

150
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,640
"I am not the flower jasmine,
I am the flower rose.

151
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,843
I am your lifelong admirer,
not of your friend sitting close."

152
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,649
Hey Mr. Guide, your cheap poetry
is going to get you nowhere.

153
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,051
So, who are you knitting this sweater for?

154
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,890
She's knitting it for a prince,
not for a devil like you.

155
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,396
And if she was interested in you...

156
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,726
...she would speak up not sit silent.

157
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,129
Oh, so she does speak?

158
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,635
I knew she was blind,
thought she was mute too

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,142
Zooni! Don't talk to him,
You don't know these men...

160
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,236
Looks like you know men very well.

161
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,145
Stupid guide

162
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:44,486
"If you sit there in silence, regret it you will.

163
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,082
So often after silence love
has awakened, stronger still."

164
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,438
"There is no limit to human desire..."

165
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,935
"There is no limit to human desire, no dearth.

166
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,107
After 2 yards of burial cloth,
we still want 2 yards of earth."

167
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,110
Superb!

168
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,941
Superb! Outstanding!

169
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:19,954
"I'll look pain square in the eye,
face every test laid out for me.

170
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,463
For the sake of your friendship,
dear friend, I'll even love my enemy."

171
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,468
Oh yeah, I love your style!

172
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,309
The emperor Shah Jahan once walked
these lanes of the Red Fort.

173
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:47,542
- And so did Mumtaz, his very, very beautiful wife.
- Careful!

174
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:50,989
I can manage myself.

175
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,885
But how will I manage myself, around you.

176
00:14:59,031 --> 00:14:59,827
Shall we?

177
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,165
Bobo, tell me, what does he look like?

178
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,674
Killer, girl, a real killer.

179
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,319
He's simply obnoxious!

180
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,854
He looks ok, so I thought
he must be a nice guy...

181
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,122
...but he called me a stupid girl... so...

182
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,695
And forget all his sweet talk...

183
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,196
...the way he looks at women, its shameful!

184
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,271
And he told me he doesn't believe in God,
can you imagine that?

185
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,032
Look even the crows are cawing.
It's a sign.

186
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,801
Stay away from that Rehan guide.

187
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,713
"How can you stay away from me and go?

188
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,212
How can your heart forget me so?

189
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,614
That fragrance on your breath is me.

190
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,649
How ever will you stop, not breathe?"

191
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,230
Great! Fabulous!

192
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,398
Come on, let's go.

193
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,223
Come.

194
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,453
If the moon was to recommend me.

195
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,628
This is what he'd say to you.

196
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,298
I want to drop the veil of decency.

197
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,470
I want to cross the line with you.

198
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,138
I insist on destroying myself.

199
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,971
On destroying myself in you.

200
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,976
If the moon was to recommend me.

201
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,152
This is what he'd say to you.

202
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,820
I want to drop the veil of decency.

203
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,322
I want to cross the line with you.

204
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,354
Your charms are like a gentle breeze.

205
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,354
Let them touch me as you pass.

206
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,090
Your every move a graceful branch.

207
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,299
Please move into my heart.

208
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:26,201
Come into my arms,
any excuse will do.

209
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,034
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

210
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:34,042
If the moon was to recommend me.

211
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,215
This is what he'd say to you.

212
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,985
I want to drop the veil of decency.

213
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,714
I want to cross the line with you.

214
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,932
If I tell you my true intentions.

215
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,164
I'm sure they'll make you blush.

216
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,934
If I make you hear my heartbeats.

217
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,115
I'm sure they'll leave you flushed.

218
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,779
But I cannot hide my feelings true.

219
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,787
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

220
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,722
If the moon was to recommend me.

221
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,955
This is what he'd say to you.

222
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,461
I want to drop the veil of decency.

223
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,805
I want to cross the line with you.

224
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,403
I insist on destroying myself.

225
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:17,480
On destroying myself in you.

226
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:42,166
Stand straight. Looking at you
I'm getting a backache.

227
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,342
And you Mr. Cartoon Network...

228
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,841
...we have to leave for rehearsal
at exactly 9 a.m. tomorrow.

229
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:47,841
So then leave.

230
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,346
It's me. Rehan.

231
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,348
I know. Only you can be so impudent.

232
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,029
I want to be even more impudent.

233
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,864
I want you to run away with me.

234
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,207
I want to show you Delhi.

235
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:26,541
Without your bodyguards,
don't say no, not without thinking at least

236
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,051
You'll anyway be thinking about me so...

237
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,720
God forbid, the crows are cawing.

238
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:47,230
I'll wait for you after the rehearsal tomorrow.
With these crows.

239
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,244
You have had more girls in your life
than there is mileage on my bus.

240
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,917
Why do you want this blind girl?

241
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,915
What can I do Balwante,
everyone wants the moon.

242
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,086
There's just one headlight in the sky,
that shows us the way.

243
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,765
Now you want that too?

244
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,770
"They say in love you always loose sleep.

245
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:26,099
I wish someone would love me,
I bloody sleep and sleep and sleep."

246
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,609
Let's go.

247
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,613
Zooni! You must be tired, go to sleep.

248
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,457
I am awake after so many years.

249
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:47,454
I can't sleep now. I can't sleep now.

250
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,971
I want to be even more impudent,
I want you to run away with me.

251
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,477
Why aren't you concentrating?

252
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,479
Can I use your phone?

253
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,480
Pick up, mama!

254
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,992
This is one decision you'll have
to take on your own Zooni.

255
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,328
Oh Lord, how silly of me.

256
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,001
Of course there's no point in your...

257
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,500
...going sightseeing when you can't see.

258
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,505
Okay. You can go back to the
hostel after rehearsal.

259
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,515
Fine! At least you'll be away from
that Rehan guide.

260
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,358
Brother, tell me something.
You stand here all day.

261
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:54,191
Don't you wish you were inside
on the President's chair?

262
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,863
Why should I think that?

263
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,534
In the police we regularly get promoted.

264
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,036
But once you're President,
there's no scope of promotion at all!

265
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,202
You're a very jolly man!

266
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,707
All thanks to my grandfather.

267
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,545
- Grandfather?
- My grandfather worked for the British.

268
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,216
All day long he would hear them say
'Jolly Good' this and 'Jolly Good' that.

269
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,045
When I was born he was losing his memory.

270
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,221
All he remembered was 'Jolly Good'.

271
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,889
So that's what he named me. Jolly Good.

272
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,392
Yes, yes have a laugh at me.

273
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,060
Even the officers that pass by here say...

274
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,560
..."Jolly Good... Singh" laugh and move on.

275
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,060
I think that's great.

276
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,063
Thanks to you, the country
is run in good spirits!

277
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,577
"I felt God himself had blessed me.

278
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,909
When all she did was to address me."

279
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,260
Look, I sent Rana with Balwaan and the bus.

280
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,096
No, I'm not coming today.

281
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,264
So what if I didn't tell you earlier.
I'm telling you now.

282
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,609
- Let's go.
- You left work without permission?

283
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,277
So?

284
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,610
My father says that if a person
can't be loyal to their work...

285
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,442
...they can't be trusted for anything.

286
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,445
I've left work for you and you're
giving me a speech on loyalty?

287
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,125
My mother says there is
nothing bigger than loyalty.

288
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,287
If you're done with your mother and
father's sermons can we go?

289
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,963
Why am I saying all this to you?

290
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,131
Why are you saying all this to me?

291
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,299
So that I go back to work?

292
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,299
Yes.

293
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:50,307
Think about it, if I go today
I won't come back tomorrow.

294
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,815
I'll go back to the guest house,
you'll go back to work.

295
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,648
Tomorrow you'll take the day off
and then we'll go, ok?

296
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:06,653
You've heard what your parents
have said. Now hear me.

297
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,502
If I go today I will not come back tomorrow.

298
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,668
You'll come. Let's go.

299
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:26,840
"I don't live the life of the selfless,
nor do I grab another's wine.

300
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,350
If she has love let her come and declare it...

301
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,856
...to ask her, to follow her, I decline."

302
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,190
God be with you.

303
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,714
Greetings Ms. Zooni.

304
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,208
Greetings Mr. Jolly

305
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,213
You know what happened yesterday?

306
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,390
Yesterday I said good morning to 20 people...

307
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,559
...and they all said good evening to me instead.

308
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,561
How can so many people be wrong?

309
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,230
It was my watch that was wrong.
It stopped in the morning...

310
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,899
...so I said 'good morning' to
people all day long!

311
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,895
I can't see Rehan today.

312
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,734
I can't see him either.

313
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:29,079
I think he's like me.
Completely clean at heart...

314
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,908
...and completely muddled in the head.

315
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:36,246
"I couldn't quench my thirst with water
so I set off for the bar.

316
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,583
I gave up complaining to God about you...

317
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,924
...for He is the most smitten by you, by far."

318
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,434
I'm with you now.

319
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,433
So, how are you going to
show Delhi to a blind girl?

320
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,603
Can you see me?

321
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,773
No.

322
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,454
What's my voice like?

323
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:19,126
Like the thunder before the storm.

324
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,466
What do I smell like?

325
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,964
Like the earth after the first rain.

326
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,644
What do I feel like?

327
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,822
Like a prince in a beggar's clothing

328
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,833
And just like this you will see Delhi.

329
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,170
Watch out! This is the Gateway of Blood.

330
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,011
The emperor Aurangzeb had his brother...

331
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,347
- ...Dara Shikoh beheaded, and hung his head up here.
- There.

332
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,351
Exactly where you are standing.

333
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,188
And the British government
killed two sons and...

334
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,191
...a grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar,
right there, behind you.

335
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,525
Please. That's enough.
Let's leave from here.

336
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,533
This is the bloody history of Delhi.

337
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,543
The Mughals, the British,
a lot of bloodshed had happened here

338
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,378
That's why, till today, tears of
blood flow from these walls.

339
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,879
Scared? What did you think?

340
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,055
I wouldn't get back at you for yesterday?

341
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,387
And what did you think,
I'd get scared so easily?

342
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,387
When I have never seen any colours...

343
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,062
...how can the colour of blood scare me?

344
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,421
Now you're scared.

345
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm going. I'm going to Delhi,
to get her back.

346
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,438
It's been 4 days.
That's enough to understand life.

347
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,104
What'll be happening to her without us?
Just think?

348
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,290
She's brought up on home food,
she must be starving.

349
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,794
The Delhi crowds,
who will look out for her?

350
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:12,799
I'm not there.

351
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,982
I can't take her agony any more, I'm going.

352
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,152
Are you going for her sake or for your own?

353
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,525
You were right, Rehan.

354
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,694
You did show me Delhi.

355
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,714
They say, the feelings one
gets for the country...

356
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,213
...in front of the Eternal Soldier Flame...

357
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,047
...one gets for love in front of the Taj Mahal.

358
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,553
Feelings, love, that's all just talk.

359
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,389
When it comes down to basics
then needs are everything.

360
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,563
Needs of the stomach, needs of the body

361
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,240
So you believe needs are everything...

362
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,739
- ...and feelings are nothing?
- Yes.

363
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,237
So all this time you're spending with me...

364
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,574
...is this also to fulfil some need?

365
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:14,417
You shouldn't tease a man like me.
My needs are great.

366
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,252
Even one chicken is not enough.

367
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,920
Even one girl is not enough.

368
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,110
So, Mr. Rehan, how are things with you?

369
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,110
And how are you Zeenat?

370
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,118
Forgotten how I am?

371
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,616
Come and meet me, I'll remind you.

372
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:53,289
It's my fault actually.
He's been busy with me.

373
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,292
That's what makes Rehan guide so special.

374
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,138
So, when do you plan on
being busy with me again?

375
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,311
"I can't explain the ways
of this market to you,

376
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,478
He who is sold, can't ever be a buyer anew."

377
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:20,321
You'll never improve. Ever.
Good evening.

378
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,332
You seem to know her very well.

379
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,341
That's me.

380
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:43,836
I told you I only believe in needs...

381
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,849
...not in feelings or love.

382
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,013
And I only believe in love.

383
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,695
Meeting that guide on the sly.

384
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,359
Forget Helen,
I can't believe you lied to me!

385
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,199
This is just why I lied to you.

386
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,204
You're less of a friend and more of a Hitler.

387
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,207
Hitler? I was just protecting you.

388
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,879
Not me. You were protecting
my blindness.

389
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,215
Zooni, how do I explain it to you?
He just isn't right for you.

390
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:30,383
Perhaps, but when I'm with him
I feel happy, feel alive.

391
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,728
And this feeling is special.
Very special.

392
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,065
But I don't like that Guide.
Not one bit.

393
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,237
And I don't care what you say.

394
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,236
I'll never let you go with him.
Never.

395
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,411
Turn off your light.

396
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,929
Jolly Singh! Could you please allow
my good luck to come in? Please?

397
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,424
Don't insist.
This tough Sikh has a soft heart.

398
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,432
I'm sorry but rules are rules and
rules are never Jolly Good.

399
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,428
It's ok. I know you're only doing your duty.

400
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,274
But still, I will be singing for him.

401
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:43,128
People say that after so many years
of Independence...

402
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,461
...our Republic Day has lost all meaning.

403
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,798
That it's just another holiday.

404
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,471
But it's not just a holiday for me.

405
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,637
This day marks the birth of my country.

406
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,811
They say that the state
of our country is like...

407
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,984
...that of our old monuments.

408
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,311
What's beautiful was only in the past.

409
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,155
I am blind so I don't see the
faults in my country...

410
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,484
...but why can't those who see,
see the beauty here?

411
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,992
What Emperor Shah Jahan had said
of my home state of Kashmir...

412
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,998
...we believe that's true for all of India.

413
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,664
If there is a heaven on earth...

414
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,003
...it is here, it is here, it is here.

415
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,704
The earth here changes colour at every step.

416
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:09,215
The language here has all the colours best.

417
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,720
The earth here changes colour at every step.

418
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:18,384
The language here has all the colours best.

419
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:23,056
The climes wear green on their head.

420
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,897
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

421
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,905
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

422
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:36,409
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

423
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,914
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

424
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:45,244
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

425
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:50,583
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

426
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:08,602
Motherland, I bow to you.

427
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:17,618
The sun with its rose-tinted
neck plays around.

428
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:26,290
The yellow scarf of flowers
covers the shy ground.

429
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,797
Colour in the veil, colour on the mound,
bright, bright colour all around.

430
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:35,300
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

431
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:40,633
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

432
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:07,661
Bright red faces all around,
smiling and glowing in fervour.

433
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:16,340
Colourful laughter, colourful happiness,
relationships full of colour.

434
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,681
Colour in promises, colour in memories,
colour, colour, more colour.

435
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:25,015
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

436
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,353
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

437
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:12,895
The colour of love here runs so deep,
once its on it's there for keeps.

438
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:22,073
The colour of true love so still
simply glistens does not spill.

439
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,238
Colour in charm, colour in manner,
all colours full of flavour.

440
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,917
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

441
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,418
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

442
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:40,086
The earth here changes colour at every step.

443
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,597
The language here has all the colours best.

444
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:49,432
The climes wear green on their head.

445
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,770
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

446
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,111
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

447
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,612
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

448
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,621
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

449
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,791
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

450
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,125
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

451
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:24,304
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

452
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:29,468
My colourful, colourful country,
my country full of colour.

453
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,495
Go Zooni, he's waiting outside for you.

454
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,668
He said I am the cutest of all the girls.

455
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,671
After you of course, Zooni. Go.

456
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,671
Stop. You're not going anywhere.

457
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,346
Certainly not like this.

458
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,181
With your hair all over the place.

459
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,179
You haven't even worn your stole properly.

460
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,684
I can't let you go like this.

461
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,853
You're really...

462
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,025
Ok, Ok, that's enough of that.

463
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,022
Go now.

464
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,534
Let's go.

465
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,041
"The fire is in the sun,
but it's the earth that does the burning.

466
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,886
The eyes fall in love,
but it's the heart.

467
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,384
...that does the suffering."

468
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,890
You're looking exceptionally
beautiful this evening.

469
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:52,896
Really?

470
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,230
You're looking exactly the same to me.

471
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,741
You have brought me here? You?

472
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,747
I thought you don't believe in God.

473
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,920
Will you just keep quiet for a bit?

474
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,588
Shut your eyes now.

475
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,926
Rehan, my eyes are always shut.

476
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,771
Rest your eyelids

477
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,607
They say this blessed water does miracles.

478
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,455
I hope that's true.

479
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,790
No one has ever asked for
such a blessing for me.

480
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,470
I'm not asking for you,
I'm asking for myself.

481
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,802
Perhaps if your eyes are open
you'll keep your mouth shut!

482
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,317
It's so loud!

483
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,153
This is the real Delhi.

484
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,820
The quiet museums, Red Fort,
that's not the real Delhi.

485
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,321
This is the sound of Delhi.
The essence of Delhi

486
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,990
I wish I was deaf as well...

487
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,663
Just a minute. Wait here.

488
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,662
Yes, it's me.

489
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,668
Yes, yes, I got it alright.

490
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,999
Rehan, you're watching me, aren't you?

491
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,849
What's this madness?

492
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,680
I just wanted to show you.

493
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,853
Show what? That you're such a fool?

494
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,014
I'll call you later.

495
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,357
Boys, and girls you know...

496
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:07,690
...they impress each other
on their first dates. So I too.

497
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,535
Your life is very precious Zooni...

498
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:18,368
...don't waste it on anyone.
Certainly not on me.

499
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,209
My mother says, to gain something
you have to loose something.

500
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:24,873
Oh God!

501
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,880
Mother says this, father says that...

502
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,053
...where is Zooni in all this?
What does Zooni say?

503
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,215
Nobody's ever asked Zooni

504
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,549
I'm asking you. Tell me.

505
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,392
I like you.

506
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,228
Let's go.

507
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,087
Now you're scared.

508
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:20,429
Our destiny has brought us
these precious moments today

509
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:32,113
Look at me up close,
imbibe me in every way

510
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:33,949
You're still scared.

511
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:44,459
Just in case your fate has
another card to play

512
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:52,796
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

513
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,300
I'll manage from here.

514
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:08,812
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

515
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:19,987
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

516
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:31,335
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

517
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:42,177
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

518
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,681
Where is Rehan the gorgeous?

519
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,853
What's the time, Bobo?

520
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,351
Ten thirty

521
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,356
My watch is fine, why is he late?

522
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,358
It's our last day.

523
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:00,194
Maybe he's getting you a gift, so he's late.

524
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,196
He himself is a gift.

525
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,869
No news?

526
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,205
No.

527
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,054
No Fatty. Nothing yet.

528
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:23,392
Mama.

529
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,562
How are you my child?

530
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,892
We saw the performance on TV.

531
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,728
It was fantastic.

532
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:37,066
When everyone stood up to clap.
Your father and me...

533
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:40,903
I want to speak to you about something.

534
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,078
What is it? Tell me.

535
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,580
When papa and you first met.

536
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,748
After he tended to you in the hospital...

537
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,754
...if he had suddenly disappeared.
What would you have done?

538
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,257
I would have asked him why
he was misbehaving.

539
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,590
And told him to stop his
nonsense immediately.

540
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,426
Misbehaving? Who is misbehaving?

541
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,430
So is that what I should do?

542
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:07,935
Who is he?

543
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:08,763
Who is who?

544
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,104
So do you love him?

545
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,610
Do you love him? What are you saying?
Give me the phone.

546
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,442
- Just a minute.
- Give me the phone. I'll deal with this.

547
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,450
So what have you decided?

548
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,948
Nothing. I don't think he loves me.

549
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,621
Just remember one thing dear...

550
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,299
...give your life for the one
who gives you his love...

551
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,798
...but give your self-respect only to...

552
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,130
...the one who is willing to be
destroyed for your love.

553
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,313
This is Humayun's tomb.

554
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,813
It was constructed for him
by his wife Hamida.

555
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,815
Take a look at what a wife
made for her husband.

556
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,817
And you can't even make me breakfast.

557
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:03,152
Don't worry, I'll start building
your tomb right away.

558
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:08,156
- Come...
- I am blind and you are the one who can't see me...

559
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,494
"If by mistake I have made a mistake...

560
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,330
...then please consider it a
mistake and forget it.

561
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,504
But only forget the mistake...

562
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,173
...even by mistake don't ever forget me."

563
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,676
Heard that? Great!

564
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,509
Take them ahead.

565
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,686
- Let's go.
- But our guide?

566
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:43,024
Move it! Look here, the Qutub Minar.

567
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,205
No Zooni, Fatty was right.

568
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:57,872
You should love a prince,
not a devil like me.

569
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:05,714
It's too late now.
Now this devil is my prince.

570
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,887
I can't give you anything.

571
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:19,060
Remember I told you, I believe in needs,
not in feelings or love.

572
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:29,068
Women are like cities for me.
I spend some time in one.

573
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,077
I get to know it, get immersed in it and...

574
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,408
...and then move to another city.

575
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,820
This is me, and I can't change.

576
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,922
Look Rehan, all this stuff about princes
is good in dreams and stories.

577
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,761
In reality I have found you.

578
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,598
We haven't met by chance,
we've met by destiny.

579
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,933
If not the rest of our lives, we can spend...

580
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,611
...the next 12 hours together, can't we?

581
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:09,781
Perhaps that's all we have,
just today, just now.

582
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:21,464
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

583
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,138
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart

584
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,807
May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart.

585
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,808
Destroyed in your love may my life depart."

586
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:52,826
How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?

587
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,504
I promise you this Zooni Ali Beg...

588
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,172
...the next 12 hours will be the
most beautiful of your life.

589
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,071
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

590
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,907
They have a silent wish, a plea.

591
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,913
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

592
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,746
They have a silent wish, a plea.

593
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:29,084
Look, just see.

594
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:35,595
Look, just see.

595
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,930
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

596
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,763
Says so much, listen please.

597
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:48,104
Why the distance between you and me.

598
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:52,938
Look, just see.

599
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:59,619
Look, just see.

600
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,652
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

601
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:42,654
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

602
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:48,834
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

603
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:54,666
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

604
00:56:56,045 --> 00:57:01,347
This rain is not so straight, it has a twist.

605
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:06,351
It's telling us something as it pours and mists.

606
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:11,526
Just understand it.

607
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,693
Just understand it.

608
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,369
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

609
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,538
Says so much, listen please.

610
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:29,705
Why the distance between you and me.

611
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:34,043
Look, just see.

612
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:41,554
Look, just see.

613
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:26,769
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

614
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,597
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

615
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:38,273
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

616
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:44,283
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

617
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:51,452
Don't discard the request
from our lips like this.

618
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:56,128
Don't call this wish of
our breathe remiss.

619
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:01,126
Just touch, Feel this.

620
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:07,636
Just touch, Feel this.

621
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,472
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

622
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,645
Says so much, listen please.

623
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:19,152
Why the distance between you and me.

624
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,490
Look, just see.

625
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,163
Look, just see.

626
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,831
Look, just see.

627
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,665
Look, just see.

628
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:44,005
Look, just see.

629
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:13,342
Rehan! Wake up. Wake up.

630
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,240
My train is at 10.
If you don't wake up I'll miss it.

631
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,281
I spoke to Fatty and she's bringing
my things to the station.

632
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,482
We don't have to go to the guest house.
How much you sleep?

633
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,013
Wake up! Don't you have to
go to work as well?

634
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,121
And don't you dare miss work today

635
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,895
See I forgot, Mama had told me
to get the eye test done.

636
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,996
And Papa has asked for a chess set.

637
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,793
Can we stop and get one on the way?
Do we have time?

638
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,664
Rehan! Are you listening?

639
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:51,074
Oh, I didn't even say goodbye
to Jolly Good Singh.

640
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:58,911
You please tell him for me.
Here's my address...

641
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,049
Will you write to me?

642
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,851
Your wife's first visit home after marriage?

643
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,209
I want to say...

644
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:32,184
No, Rehan. You made no promises
and I will not ask you for anything.

645
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:38,787
I always wanted love to be the
most important thing in my life...

646
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:47,969
...and now, thanks to you, it is.
You were wrong Rehan.

647
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:53,303
I am not destroyed in your storm
I am rejuvenated.

648
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:05,151
Now your picture will
remain with me always.

649
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,554
And now I can't leave.

650
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,627
Not until you step off my stole.

651
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,847
God be with you Rehan, be happy.

652
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,434
Now can I say I told you so

653
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:29,897
No

654
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,140
I won't say it. I'll never say it.

655
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,242
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart."

656
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,650
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart."

657
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,159
"Destroyed in your love
may my life depart."

658
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:10,674
Fatty! If not for me at least
pull the chain for Zooni.

659
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:13,944
With pleasure.

660
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,216
What's going on?
What is the guide doing here?

661
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,448
The brave heart is taking the bride.

662
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,600
He wants to marry you?

663
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,142
What? Who is he?
Where is he from?

664
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,745
What does he do? What does he look like?
He wants to marry her!

665
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,972
They love each other.

666
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,874
So what did you say?

667
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:52,577
What could I say?
I said he must ask my parents.

668
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,652
What did she tell him?

669
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,982
She's our daughter...

670
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,421
...she wouldn't give any answer
without our consent.

671
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:02,756
Zooni, I have complete faith in your choice.

672
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,092
Yes, my darling, tell him yes.

673
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,396
And we're coming to Delhi
right away to get you married.

674
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,506
Come quickly mama, I miss you.

675
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,339
Now where are you off to?

676
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,170
We're going to Delhi aren't we?
We'll need tickets.

677
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,581
As usual he runs away the moment
there are tears in his eyes.

678
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,515
God keep you mama, God keep you.

679
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,123
God keep you my child, God keep you.

680
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,300
Our daughter has found her prince.

681
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,938
She has found her prince.

682
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,615
When did you get your eyes checked last?

683
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,881
I don't remember.
Many years ago in Srinagar.

684
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:58,951
This is the problem.

685
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:04,883
We doctors go on about checkups
and no one listens.

686
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,388
These days science has
progressed so much.

687
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,724
What was impossible 5 years ago
is today possible.

688
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,162
What do you mean?

689
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:16,496
Retinal replacement can help you.

690
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,172
The chances are very slim...

691
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,236
...I warn you, but there is still a chance.

692
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:23,003
Are you saying Zooni will be able to see?

693
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,074
There's a chance...

694
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,744
We'll take the chance doctor.

695
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,512
I'll check the first available date.

696
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,494
There won't be any problem doctor?

697
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,767
The operation must go well.

698
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,434
Don't worry our best team is on it.

699
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,670
I'll meet you after the operation.

700
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:04,942
Rehan! You're hugging me
for the 10th time.

701
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:12,189
I'm not complaining but please don't worry.
I'll be fine.

702
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:17,296
If you're so worried then why didn't
we wait for mama and papa?

703
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,899
We could have done this after the wedding?

704
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,964
Let's go, it's time.

705
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,240
Don't forget to get mama and papa
from the station.

706
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,140
And Jolly Good wants to
come here later as well.

707
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:37,475
You're going to the
President's Palace, right?

708
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:38,653
Yes.

709
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,410
I love you very much.

710
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:09,847
I know.

711
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,853
After the bomb blast in Peshawar...

712
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,525
...Pakistan the Independent Kashmir Front
has demanded...

713
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,956
...that both India and
Pakistan leave Kashmir.

714
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,186
They want an Independent Kashmir...

715
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:26,699
...or else there will be many more
attacks to come.

716
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,552
The Chief Minister is alive...

717
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:49,554
...but as per early reports,
8 security officers have been killed.

718
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:52,784
And at least 15 others are
badly wounded.

719
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,893
The main building has not been
harmed very much...

720
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:00,057
...but the left side of it has been
completely destroyed.

721
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,393
2 terrorists have been captured and...

722
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,573
...the IKF have claimed responsibility.

723
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,231
Their demand is that India
and Pakistan leave Kashmir.

724
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,241
And let it be an independent country.

725
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,106
My Child

726
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,614
Mama I can see, I can see.

727
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:50,284
Yes, my darling.

728
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:58,450
Papa I can see.
You can cry in front of me now papa.

729
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:06,962
I can see you cry. But where is Rehan?
He's not with you?

730
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,070
Didn't he get you from the station?

731
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:18,804
Papa, where are they taking us?
