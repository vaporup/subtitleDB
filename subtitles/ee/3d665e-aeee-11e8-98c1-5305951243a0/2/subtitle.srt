1
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:04,214
Why has your breathing changed papa?
Why? I don't understand.

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:08,149
Mama, where is Rehan?
Why aren't we waiting for him?

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,388
Mama why are you crying?
Mama? Papa?

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,063
Why are you crying mama?
Papa where are we?

5
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:25,734
Please let me go from here.

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,911
- Is it necessary to do this now?
- Yes Ma'am.

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,079
What do we have to do?

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,079
Why can't we wait for Rehan? Papa,
where are we? Papa?

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,750
I'm getting suffocated here papa.

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,419
Please let's go. Mama let's go. Please.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,087
The bomb blast at the President's Palace.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,313
What do we have to do with that?
We don't know anything.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:48,864
You're still crying mama, please don't.
Please papa get me out. Doctor?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,262
I was going to identify him,
but his state was such that I could not.

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,008
So you have to identify him, Zooni.
Is this Rehan?

16
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:07,282
No! It can't be Rehan. It can't!

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,717
Please, don't make my daughter
go through this. Please.

18
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:17,890
It's compulsory.

19
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,805
Zooni my darling, even this is life.

20
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,077
If only I was a roll of wool

21
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,314
wrapped around her fingers...

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,996
That fragrance on your breath is me.

23
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,164
How ever will you stop, not breathe?

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,012
How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,616
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

26
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:35,194
Think about it, if I go today
I won't come back tomorrow.

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,549
At this time we are at the
Bureau of Military Intelligence.

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,719
There is not much information
forthcoming on the blast...

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,889
...but here is the head of the
Anti-Terrorist Unit.

30
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,787
Mr. Susheel Rawat. Mr. Rawat.
What can you tell us about the blast?

31
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,392
When we know more.
We'll tell you more.

32
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,226
But something to go on,
who is responsible.

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,397
These media people.

34
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,400
They start 24 hour channels
and then get after us to fill the time.

35
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,399
Everything is under control.

36
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,674
Sir, Tyagi has been called from
intelligence agency RAW

37
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,807
Tyagi? Now things will be out of control.

38
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,147
So Tyagi, case solved yet?

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,590
So what does your psychology
mumbo-jumbo say?

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,926
This is his work.

41
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,603
Who? Who are you talking about?

42
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,269
These two are telling the truth.

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,940
They haven't seen him.
They were simply given instructions.

44
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,512
The master planner is someone else.

45
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,042
Do you need an invitation
to tell me his name? Who is it?

46
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:00,522
This man has changed the face of the IKF.

47
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:07,286
He has taken a rag-tag group
and made it a professional organization.

48
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,126
A group on par with the most
deadly in the world.

49
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:17,197
On par with the best
intelligence agencies in the world.

50
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,805
It's because of this man that 8 ships and...

51
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,411
...a large part of the Bombay port
are under water.

52
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,539
It's because of this man
that Islamabad airport's...

53
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,579
...new wing was destroyed even
before it could be completed.

54
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:34,220
He has changed the face of terrorism
in India and Pakistan

55
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,827
Those blood shot eyes and...

56
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,663
...fanatical terrorists are a thing of the past.

57
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,501
This man is a thinker. A planner.
No one knows his name.

58
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:54,837
No one knows his past,
or where he comes from.

59
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,338
He can be anyone.

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,538
The man sitting next to you on the train...

61
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,512
...or a bank teller, or even the
cigarette seller outside.

62
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:09,519
He is intelligent and he's dangerous,
and he can be anyone.

63
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,861
We have to find him.

64
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,192
For if we don't, he can take
terrorism to a level beyond...

65
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,034
...our imagination because our
imagination is be nothing like his.

66
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,082
I'm sorry Grandfather, the mission
was not entirely successful.

67
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,589
I had set everything.

68
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,419
Those fools just didn't follow instructions.

69
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,594
Not everyone can be like my grandson.
A perfect soldier.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,098
But even he slipped this once.
That too for some woman.

71
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,938
It's very unusual that
you were carried away like this.

72
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,104
And the woman what about her?

73
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,108
She is with God.

74
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:39,944
Now listen to me.

75
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,448
You don't have to worry about this soldier sir.

76
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,220
My concentration was, is...

77
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,218
...and will always remain
on our independence.

78
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,181
I am a soldier and nothing else.

79
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,124
That's all I wanted to hear my son.

80
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,231
Now I'll meet you after the Bangkok operation.
May God keep you.

81
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,472
You had taken me to my goal, Zooni.

82
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:16,286
Should never have taken you off that train.
But I became weak.

83
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:18,311
And I fell in love with you.

84
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,586
I hope you can forgive me.

85
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,656
I should never have brought you
into my life. Never.

86
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,743
God be with you, Zooni.

87
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,295
You are the Defence Secretary.

88
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,670
Do something.
Get that Tyagi off my back!

89
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,877
Last year the Al-Qaeda's attempt
on Delhi airport...

90
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,875
...was foiled by Tyagi.

91
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,372
She got lucky, once.

92
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,209
And now she thinks she's a
big shot intelligence officer.

93
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,044
I can't do anything now.

94
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,380
The Defence Minister himself
has asked hereto be on this case.

95
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,881
Sir, it's nothing less than the Armageddon.

96
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,386
The press shouldn't even get a whiff of this.

97
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,289
This IKF has made our life hell.

98
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,497
First the President Palace bombing...

99
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,729
...then Karachi Oil refinery
and last year it was the...

100
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,404
...plane hijacking. And now we hear
they've stolen parts from us,

101
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:52,646
Pakistan and Russia and are ready
with a nuclear missile!

102
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,482
Sir, This is their way of forcing India
out of Kashmir.

103
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,151
When Kashmir's ruler, Hari Singh,
decided to join India...

104
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,414
...in 1947, then why this talk of
independence now?

105
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,753
But the Kashmiri's had also been
promised a vote,

106
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:09,923
a referendum to decide
whether they wanted to stay a...

107
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,658
...part of India, join Pakistan
or then be independent.

108
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:16,703
All these years later they are
still to get that referendum.

109
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,431
What referendum are you talking about?

110
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:23,543
When half of Kashmir is occupied
by Pakistan, how is it possible?

111
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,007
A referendum needs
to include all of Kashmir,

112
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,115
why should it include only half?

113
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,779
This is not an India-Pakistan
issue any more.

114
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,786
IKF wants both India and Pakistan
to leave Kashmir.

115
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,294
They want a separate country.
An independent Kashmir.

116
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,955
Please, I know the history
of India and Pakistan.

117
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,963
Tell me about this bomb.

118
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,968
How powerful is this bomb,
Mrs. Tyagi, and what are the dangers?

119
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:52,174
In the last few years over 15,000 people
have been killed in Mumbai,

120
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:59,178
Oklahoma City, New York, Bali,
Madrid and London.

121
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,642
And losses have run into millions.

122
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,652
But if they use this bomb

123
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,424
5 million people can die.
An entire city can be destroyed.

124
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,656
That city can also be our capital, New Delhi.

125
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,834
We must stop this bomb.
Whatever it takes.

126
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,336
But Sir, this bomb is useless for them.

127
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,002
What do you mean?

128
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,573
The missile needs a special,
Indian made trigger.

129
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,846
If they don't have that,
they can't use the bomb

130
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:35,850
Only until they get the trigger.
Only until then.

131
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,684
Sir, there's nothing to worry about.
Outside of Delhi,

132
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,915
We have 6 triggers at various
military bases around the country.

133
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,860
In Rajasthan, Kutch, Darjeeling,

134
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,859
Amritsar, Leh and Kashmir.
They are safe there.

135
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,032
I want all the triggers brought to Delhi.

136
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:53,703
In the next 12 hours they will all be here, Sir.

137
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,864
Get me the Defence Minister of Pakistan,

138
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:59,208
...I want to share this information with him.

139
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,303
We can be sure. Just as we are
taking steps to secure the triggers,

140
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,810
IKF's mastermind will be
taking steps to steal them.

141
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,259
Rate on missions, Sir.

142
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,928
And I will bring this trigger to you myself.

143
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,030
Be alert. IKF will be after you at every step.

144
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,597
If the weather holds up,
the trigger will be...

145
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,929
...with you in 3 hours, Sir.
Glory to India!

146
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:01,935
Glory to India!

147
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,935
This is the day every soldier lives for.

148
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:07,976
For a chance to serve his country.

149
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,805
The last time you saved me from the IKF.

150
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:13,881
Today we both must save the
country from the IKF.

151
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,450
This soldier is ready to take
lives or to give his own life.

152
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,057
Anything for his motherland, Sir.

153
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:39,072
Good news. The trigger will be
with us soon. God keep Rehan!

154
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,209
God is great!

155
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,156
Mummy is fine. How are you?

156
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,991
Mummy will save the country

157
00:12:56,893 --> 00:13:00,158
I know you wanted custard.
But Grandma has made rice...

158
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,058
...pudding with so much love, so please eat it.

159
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,994
What have you brought?
Rice pudding or custard?

160
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,894
We've checked the list of officers
coming from Kashmir.

161
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,071
How can it not be ok?
I have hand-picked these officers.

162
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:15,175
They are the army's very best, elite forces.

163
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,010
Ok, so that's where he is.

164
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,874
Who?

165
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,015
An ace officer from the Jat Regiment Sir,
Captain Ranjeev.

166
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,744
His wife reported he hadn't called her
for a couple of months.

167
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,524
She wanted to know if he was
on some secret mission.

168
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:34,027
That's wives for you. Am sure she was
after him with some pudding or such.

169
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,690
Poor man must have needed a break from...

170
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,196
...all that so he didn't call, understandable.

171
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,868
He didn't call his wife for two months?
Just find out,

172
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,765
was his last mission to do with the IKF?

173
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,038
Yes Ma'am. Major Suraj's regiment
was surrounded by the IKF.

174
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,545
At the last moment Captain Ranjeev's
regiment got there and saved them.

175
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:58,718
Everyone from Captain Ranjeev's regiment
was killed. Only he survived.

176
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:05,222
That's him! We have to stop him!

177
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:15,737
Sounds like the base is trying to contact us.
The signal is too weak.

178
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:31,212
It's amazing isn't it? Such a small thing
can take so many lives.

179
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,922
- Our lives too, in it's defence
- So?

180
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,587
I'm not afraid of dying Sir,

181
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,919
But it's better to kill for your country
than be killed

182
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,086
You want to kill people?
Make them eat your wife's cooking!

183
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,460
You are dying the death of a brave soldier.

184
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:24,466
He who dies on the battlefield goes to heaven.
God keep you.

185
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,023
Grandfather. I am not empty handed.

186
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,691
Praise be to God! You don't have
just a trigger there with you.

187
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,975
It is our decades long dream.
We have sacrificed so much for.

188
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:44,881
You must get that trigger to us now
at any cost. Kill, or be killed.

189
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,215
Yes, grandfather. I will meet you in 3 hours...

190
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,722
...At Shikara 1 pick up point. Goodbye.

191
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,622
I was right. That was no accident.
He was in the helicopter.

192
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,064
Jam all the phone lines in the area...

193
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,395
...mobiles, satellite, internet, everything.

194
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,901
I want a communications blackout.

195
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:07,668
We can't jam radio signals,
we have military operations in that area

196
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:13,247
If you can't jam them, you can at least
monitor them, can't you?

197
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,085
Search the entire area.

198
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,253
How far is the road unit?

199
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:51,587
No! He's still alive.
I don't care how many bodies you saw.

200
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:54,792
I know Rehan will reach the pick up point.

201
00:21:55,898 --> 00:22:00,699
I have not given him permission to die.
He cannot die.

202
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,877
Quickly, call Grandpa.
Go. Fast. Papa!

203
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,550
Hand me the scissors please.

204
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,963
Who is this, mom?

205
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,796
Rehan, I don't know.
Go, please sit over there.

206
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:50,302
Is he also dead like Grandma?

207
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,236
Quiet! Little monkey

208
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,979
His pulse is quite weak.
Try the phone. Is it working now?

209
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,158
No papa. It's still dead.

210
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,152
We've done the best we could.
I'm no doctor.

211
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:10,999
What can we do?

212
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,499
You can't go and get a doctor in this weather.

213
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,002
Not 50 kilometres in this storm.
No way.

214
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,005
Mom! Please leave Rehan.

215
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,014
Nothing darling. Nothing

216
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,851
Now it's up to you young man.

217
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:36,514
We can only pray you have
some reason to live.

218
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,197
It can be two days?
It can be two weeks?

219
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,360
How can you not know when
the storm will pass?

220
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,034
I want an update every hour, you hear?

221
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,964
Can't you do anything right?

222
00:24:55,578 --> 00:25:01,210
Till I don't see a body
I can't believe he's dead.

223
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,458
Don't do that Rehan.
What are you up to?

224
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,264
I can't hear his heartbeat.
There is no heartbeat.

225
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:23,564
Rehan wants to hear his heartbeat,
like he hears Grandpa's.

226
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,737
The heart is not here, it's there.

227
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,718
Forgive me Zooni. I have no choice.

228
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,572
Do you know the cricketer Rahul Dravid?

229
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,008
Rahul Dravid is Rehan's father.

230
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,755
Because Rehan's father is dead you see,

231
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:33,087
...so mom said Rehan could choose any father.
So Rehan chose Rahul Dravid.

232
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,093
Are you Mr. Dependiddle like Rahul Dravid?

233
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:52,605
Can you also be completely
trusted like Rahul Dravid?

234
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,481
That outhouse of yours is falling apart.

235
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,416
Look, look the dead man is awake.

236
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,222
Don't talk like that.

237
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:10,622
When the weather is better
we'll get it fixed. It's freezing.

238
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:18,369
Before you thank me.
Come and eat something.

239
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:49,565
Don't drink so much
you'll become a hittototomas.

240
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:57,805
Not hittototomas, kid. Hippopotamus.
And where did you learn this word?

241
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:02,280
From Colonel uncle.
Hitto. Hittototomas.

242
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,087
Would you like something?
I'm sorry I didn't get your name.

243
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,197
I didn't know there were military
operations here.

244
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:24,569
There are such few of us here.
What will the militants do here?

245
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,199
They can hide.

246
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:36,309
The dead man stinks so Rehan thought...

247
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:45,090
Strange, when Zooni couldn't see
she didn't bang into a thing.

248
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:51,132
And now that she can see,
she's constantly walking into things.

249
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,200
Thank you for saving me.

250
00:30:56,405 --> 00:31:01,069
You were lucky, so you survived.
What did I do?

251
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:09,582
Is it just the 3 of you here?

252
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:17,323
Zooni's mother died a couple of years ago.

253
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,219
And left me all alone.

254
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:27,394
And before that her husband
died in a bomb blast.

255
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:33,035
I don't know why, but Zooni
blames herself for his death.

256
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,413
When will this storm end?
I must leave from here.

257
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:51,515
It's hard to say. It might stop
tomorrow or maybe a week.

258
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,195
Don't think of leaving in this
weather though.

259
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:05,473
Certainly not in your state.
Rest a while. You are our guest.

260
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,798
Dispenser of India's destiny.

261
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:43,102
You keep teaching me things.
Tell Rehan a story.

262
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,438
...Dispenser of India's destiny

263
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,810
You're not a good mother.
You never tell Rehan stories.

264
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:50,450
I don't know any stories.

265
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:54,778
Not me. You. You're a bad boy.
Go. I'm not talking to you.

266
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:05,563
Rehan loves you more than
you love Rehan.

267
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:13,135
But mom Rehan already knows
the national anthem.

268
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:14,070
Let's hear it.

269
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,141
Thou art the ruler of the minds of
all the people... Dravid,

270
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:19,803
...Orissa and Bengal. Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

271
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,380
You and your Dravid fixation.

272
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,710
Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

273
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,488
Do you know the national anthem?

274
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,383
No.

275
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,220
See even the dead man doesn't know
the national anthem.

276
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:41,460
Please tell mom, not to teach Rehan.
The phone's dead. Tell her not to teach Rehan.

277
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,265
What's this?

278
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:49,205
Which soldier doesn't know
the national anthem?

279
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:50,670
Why are you lying to the child?

280
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,847
I am not here to teach him
the national anthem,

281
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,979
...and I'm not here to play with him.
I don't care if I lied to him...

282
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,152
...I'm a soldier on a mission not his father!

283
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,388
Come here immediately!

284
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:47,496
If you don't eat vegetables
how will you slay the dragon?

285
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:56,976
Captain Ranjeev, come and join us.
Tell us about your life.

286
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:00,476
I've heard soldiers have
fascinating stories to tell.

287
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:05,214
I'm not hungry thank you.
I'll just go to bed.

288
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:08,347
Your bed has been made upstairs.
The room on the left.

289
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,234
Dead man made mom cry.

290
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,431
Eat your food.

291
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,852
What's this?

292
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,357
Mom has sent it for you.
So you'll get better faster...

293
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,358
...so you can leave faster.

294
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:51,265
But what is it?

295
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:52,228
Poison.

296
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,298
Milk with turmeric.

297
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,366
And don't try and throw it in the WC,
it stinks it up and mom finds out.

298
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,737
Don't throw it out either,
the snow gets yellow.

299
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,971
And in the wash basin the colour stains it,
you'll get caught.

300
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:15,312
And yes! If you find some other way.

301
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,924
Please tell Rehan.
Next time Rehan will do the same.

302
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:38,536
It really is poison.

303
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:55,427
"Come closer now,
I will not come back again and again"

304
00:36:56,932 --> 00:37:06,068
"Put your arms around me,
so I can cry again and again"

305
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,116
If only I was a roll of wool...
...wrapped around her fingers...

306
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:28,590
"Think we will never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed"

307
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:39,864
"Come into my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have the night's repose."

308
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:50,610
"Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed."

309
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,327
Thank you.

310
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,580
Yesterday I was very rude.

311
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:43,453
Actually, I'm not very good with children.

312
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:56,536
Am not very good with words either.
But I am good with a hammer.

313
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,778
Not everything can be done alone.

314
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,291
Rehan doesn't have a father...

315
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:18,522
...so he sometimes...
he won't trouble you again.

316
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:23,898
He's a good kid.

317
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:33,012
So have you forgiven me then?

318
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,714
Thing is, I spend so much time alone...

319
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,851
...that I don't know how to behave
in company any more.

320
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,991
Like this one time I went to my friend
Mihir Wohra's house for a party.

321
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,692
I asked his wife how she likes
being wife number 2.

322
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:58,902
Turns out she was wife number 1 and
had no idea there was a wife number 2.

323
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:07,911
After this I decided I would stick to
safe topics.

324
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:12,883
So I asked my Colonel how his son
was doing at school?

325
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,619
Now that's safe? Right?

326
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:19,155
Wrong. Just that day his son
had been thrown...

327
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,419
...out of school, for biting his teacher's bum.

328
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:27,134
And not just that.
He was sent back to apologise the...

329
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:29,599
...following day and he ended up
biting her other bum.

330
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,203
Close your eyes.

331
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:03,398
Rehan doesn't want to wash his hair.
Rehan will not wash his hair.

332
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:07,507
You have to wash your hair or you’ll get
such big, big insects in it.

333
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:11,941
Let them come Rehan will take the
insects for a walk every day.

334
00:42:12,147 --> 00:42:13,444
May I help?

335
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:15,778
Give it a try.

336
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,946
I'm not talking to you I'm talking to him.

337
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:28,184
He's such a sweet kid.
Why are you bothering him.

338
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,322
But he has to wash his hair.

339
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,398
He'll wash it when he feels like it.

340
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,575
Rehan! Look up.

341
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:52,842
You were right.
Everything can't be done alone.

342
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:07,094
Dead man is funny.

343
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:08,667
Don't call him dead man, son.

344
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,963
Rehan likes the dead man.

345
00:43:24,886 --> 00:43:26,649
Can I help you?

346
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:29,612
I'm fine. Thanks.

347
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,723
Everything can't be done alone.

348
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:46,137
You told us some good stories today.

349
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:53,008
Why have you stopped telling stories?

350
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,148
Your father talks a lot after a
couple of drinks.

351
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:10,486
Earlier I couldn't see. Now I've seen
too much to believe in stories.

352
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:18,035
Your family must be worried.
You've been missing for a few days.

353
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:24,343
I have no family, I never met my parents.
They died when I was 3.

354
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:28,747
I'm sorry you're so Lonely.

355
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:32,919
Not at all. Why do you say that?

356
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:37,556
Your smile doesn't reach your eyes.

357
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:45,957
A soldier's life is like that.

358
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:52,199
There must be someone else
hidden behind that soldier

359
00:44:55,376 --> 00:45:00,575
Perhaps. But, I don't think
I really understand him.

360
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:09,090
Sometimes to understand yourself, you need to
see yourself from someone else's eyes.

361
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,655
I could never get that close to anyone.

362
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:23,461
Why? You couldn't trust anyone?

363
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:27,140
I don't trust myself.

364
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,306
And then every time, a new mission, a new city.

365
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,816
I couldn't be in any one place for too long

366
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,020
Sometimes you seem very familiar.

367
00:46:35,777 --> 00:46:39,736
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief

368
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:44,008
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

369
00:46:48,356 --> 00:46:52,292
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

370
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:56,156
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

371
00:46:56,364 --> 00:47:00,698
A difficult song this is, can you sing it for me pure.

372
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:05,066
Moon blooms sugar sucking
creams the thieving thief.

373
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:09,209
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

374
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,540
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

375
00:47:30,465 --> 00:47:32,456
Surly Khadak Singh simmers
and stutter sputter go the shutters.

376
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,033
Stutter sputter go the shutters making
surly Khadak Singh simmer.

377
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:40,806
Surely Khadak Singh simmers
and stutter sputter go the shutters.

378
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:45,638
Stutter sputter go the shutters making
surly Khadak Singh simmer.

379
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,340
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

380
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:52,416
Stutter sputter go the shutters.

381
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,520
Surely Khadak Singh simmers more.

382
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:58,681
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

383
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:02,852
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

384
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:07,091
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

385
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:11,499
The silly ant sucks sugar,
illy sugar sucking ant for sure.

386
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,090
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree.

387
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:39,527
Tree ripe or ripe Papaya?

388
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,167
The ripe tree Pinkoo picks.

389
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:42,393
Pinkoo picks the ripe Papaya.

390
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:43,194
Say it.

391
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:48,399
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree
picks 'Pinkoo ripe kapda'.

392
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:49,303
Kapda? Cloth?

393
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:58,413
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree,
pick on tree or Papaya ripe?

394
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,486
Pinkoo picks the ripe tree,
pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe.

395
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:06,251
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

396
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,257
Pinkoo picks the ripe tree...

397
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,430
Pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe.

398
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:14,624
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

399
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:18,828
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

400
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,067
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
if fright freaks the thieving thief.

401
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:26,769
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

402
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:31,475
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

403
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:33,517
The moon booms blooms, balloons...

404
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,689
...of fright freaks the thieving thief.

405
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,849
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

406
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:44,293
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

407
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,380
Rehan will not call him dead man any more.

408
00:50:03,718 --> 00:50:05,151
You're my good son.

409
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:11,981
Can Rehan call dead man, papa? Please?

410
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,660
Close your eyes.

411
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:33,210
So tell me Captain Ranjeev,
have you ever loved...

412
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:38,643
...a woman so deeply that
her smile made you breathless?

413
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:40,785
I...

414
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:45,091
I loved my Nafisa like that. She was...

415
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:46,385
Heavenly!

416
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:49,358
Papa, you've started again. I've told you...

417
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,690
...not to drink in front of mama's photograph.

418
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:57,363
"Let me sit and drink on the Mosque ground...

419
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:01,406
...or show me a place where God is not found"

420
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:03,873
Fantastic! Superb!

421
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:12,185
"In this life without you I have no...

422
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:14,377
Complaint."

423
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:24,054
No complaint, I have no complaint.

424
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:27,027
Enough papa, enough.

425
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,827
What are you doing?
We're having such a nice time.

426
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:31,197
Let's go, papa.

427
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:41,576
Let me finish this drink. "In this life
without you I have no complaint.

428
00:51:50,791 --> 00:52:00,860
But this life without you is no life anyway..."

429
00:52:01,068 --> 00:52:05,767
"I wish I could bury my head in
your veil and cry, just cry..."

430
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:21,447
"Are you sure your eyes themselves
don't lack in tears, are dry, just dry?"

431
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:24,616
The letter 'H'

432
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:36,395
"How do you do, dear one?
How do you think, dear one?

433
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,472
I'm just happy oh ho ho.

434
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,802
So, you've slipped then aa ha ha."

435
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:53,712
"What if I let my heart live in your eyes?

436
00:52:54,488 --> 00:53:00,290
What if I close my eyes,
and punish your heart?"

437
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:08,126
"What can I say in praise of
the one who made you?"

438
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:17,307
"These nights, this clime,
this river side, this playful breeze"

439
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:23,213
"Time has given us such beautiful pain.

440
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:28,849
...I am not me anymore and
you are not the same.

441
00:53:35,095 --> 00:53:39,896
Our hearts tremble now as they meet.

442
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:46,669
Like they were never apart for even a beat.

443
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:56,007
But you got lost and so did I.

444
00:53:57,685 --> 00:53:59,812
After our travel together..."

445
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,341
Now you're scared.

446
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:33,785
Who are you? How do you know all this?

447
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:43,996
You can't know. What's happening to me?

448
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:53,437
I hear him in your voice,
your breath, it's all the same.

449
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:10,389
It's me. Rehan.

450
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:21,290
Your Rehan.

451
00:55:34,882 --> 00:55:39,581
What I did to you.
I've never forgiven myself for it.

452
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:46,519
I promised myself I'd stay away from you.

453
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:51,424
I didn't want to cause you more pain.

454
00:55:57,204 --> 00:56:02,699
Perhaps it was God's justice that
I had to die at your doorstep.

455
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:13,813
But you kept me alive.
And now I want to live.

456
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:20,626
I want to live for you, for our son.

457
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:29,598
Rehan... You are Rehan?

458
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:39,210
My real name is Rehan Qadri.

459
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,311
Kashmiri?

460
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:43,577
Yes.

461
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,315
Go on.

462
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:49,048
When I met Zooni I was on a mission.

463
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:52,515
And that's why you fell in love
with my daughter?

464
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:56,624
Promised her marriage?
Was that all a part of your mission?

465
00:56:58,098 --> 00:57:03,832
That was my weakness.
I was not free to love.

466
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:09,337
I am deeply sorry and ashamed
about my selfish love.

467
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,006
And you've come back to
repeat that mistake?

468
00:57:15,716 --> 00:57:19,812
My mission is not complete yet.
After this storm, it will be.

469
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:24,218
Then I will stay with Zooni
for the rest of my life.

470
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:26,586
Mission! Mission!
What is this great mission...

471
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:30,025
Because of which you're
playing with all our lives?

472
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:31,730
I can't say.

473
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:32,557
What?

474
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:37,297
I know my silence can go against me.

475
00:57:38,572 --> 00:57:42,406
But I do not want to lie and
I cannot tell you the truth.

476
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:48,606
All I can say in my defence
is that my love is true.

477
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:01,353
I have given you a lot of pain,
still I am asking you to fill my wounds.

478
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:05,495
I know I'm not worthy of your forgiveness...

479
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:15,003
...but I stand before you with the hope
that you will forgive me.

480
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:30,150
I would not have left my Nafisa for anything.

481
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:34,926
God came in the way otherwise
I would've still been with her.

482
00:58:36,697 --> 00:58:42,158
There is no reason to believe him,
but there is also no reason not to.

483
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,602
It was your decision then Zooni
and it's your decision now.

484
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:22,965
7 years! 7 years I have lived with the guilt
that I sent you to your death.

485
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:31,814
Every day I curse my self for
sending you there.

486
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,752
Do you know what it's like to live with that?

487
00:59:43,597 --> 00:59:44,291
Look at this!

488
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:49,300
When you were off being a great soldier...

489
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,195
...on your missions this is what I was doing.

490
00:59:54,374 --> 01:00:01,610
I was taking parts of all these faces,
trying to make one face. Your face.

491
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:06,785
So I could have something to cry in front of,
something to show my son.

492
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:08,386
To tell him this is your father.

493
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:21,261
And now you say all those tears,
all that pain was for nothing? No!

494
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:28,001
Why should I open myself to pain again Rehan?
Why should I take you back?

495
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:39,375
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't believe you are still dead.

496
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,450
Give me one good reason.

497
01:00:50,597 --> 01:01:02,771
I don't have a single good reason.
They are all bad. Each and every one.

498
01:01:38,879 --> 01:01:42,747
I was taking parts of all these faces,
trying to make one face.

499
01:02:12,112 --> 01:02:13,704
Why are you going?

500
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,787
Because I can't play cricket like Rahul Dravid.

501
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,761
Don't worry. Rehan will teach you.

502
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:41,673
I am not dependiddle either.
I can't be trusted.

503
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:48,474
No you are dependable for Rehan.
See Rehan has learned how to say dependable.

504
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:52,214
Rehan will never trouble you again.

505
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:57,045
He won't call you dead man.
He will have a bath himself.

506
01:02:57,257 --> 01:03:01,853
He will not give you milk and turmeric,
but please don't go.

507
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:19,605
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

508
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:49,440
Sit properly!

509
01:03:51,778 --> 01:03:52,403
Eat!

510
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,742
Why are you venting your anger on him?

511
01:03:56,316 --> 01:03:59,979
The one who deserves it has left
without saying a word.

512
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:06,018
He must be in his room.
Go tell him breakfast is ready.

513
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:08,660
I'm not going to stand around
in the kitchen all day for him.

514
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,921
He's gone. He said goodbye to Rehan.
Not to you.

515
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:28,576
No, he can't go. He can't go.

516
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,408
How dare you leave me again.
How dare you?

517
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:09,618
Your life is mine now, do you hear?
You can never leave me and go. Never!

518
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,080
Papa!

519
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:45,122
When I have your hands in mine.

520
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:50,285
I have with me the heavens divine.

521
01:05:50,497 --> 01:05:55,400
When I have your hands in mine.

522
01:05:55,602 --> 01:06:00,562
I have with me the heavens divine.

523
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:05,744
When you're close, this world is naught.

524
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:10,713
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

525
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:15,786
When I have your hands in mine.

526
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:20,983
I have with me the heavens divine.

527
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:26,063
When you're close this world is naught.

528
01:06:26,266 --> 01:06:31,169
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

529
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:36,240
When I have your hands in mine.

530
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:41,676
I have with me the heavens divine.

531
01:07:04,371 --> 01:07:07,169
May my life's-breath find refuge in your heart.

532
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,505
Destroyed in your love may my life depart.

533
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:17,181
As close as fragrances are to breath.

534
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:22,253
As close as songs are to lips.

535
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:27,392
As close as sleepless nights to memories.

536
01:07:27,594 --> 01:07:31,997
As close as arms are to embraces.

537
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:37,729
As close, as close as dreams to eyes.

538
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:41,873
Be that close to me, oh love of mine.

539
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:47,877
When you're close this world is naught.

540
01:07:48,081 --> 01:07:52,848
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

541
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,022
When I have your hands in mine.

542
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:03,457
I have with me the heavens divine.

543
01:08:24,784 --> 01:08:29,084
Let my eyes swell with tears, let me cry today.

544
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,984
Take me in your arms, get drenched today.

545
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:38,957
The sea of pain trapped in my heart will explode.

546
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:43,830
I have so much pain your veil will be drenched.

547
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,230
As close as secrets are to heartbeats.

548
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:54,209
As close as raindrops are to clouds.

549
01:08:54,414 --> 01:08:59,317
As close as the moon is to night.

550
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:04,013
As close as kohl is to eyes.

551
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:09,788
As close, as close as waves to the ocean.

552
01:09:09,996 --> 01:09:14,695
Be that close to me, oh love of mine.

553
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:19,904
When you're close this world is naught.

554
01:09:20,106 --> 01:09:24,805
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

555
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:30,139
When I have your hands in mine.

556
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:35,219
I have with me the heavens divine.

557
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:41,817
My breath was incomplete, heartbeat incomplete,
incomplete was I.

558
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:47,489
But now the moon is full, complete in the sky,
and now with you complete am I...

559
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,016
Give us some good news Aakash.
Can we go any further?

560
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:15,353
Sorry ma'am, we'll have to wait
another 2 or 3 days.

561
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:19,692
But we have to do something Aakash.
We can't just stand around.

562
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:26,534
No. Not the press. We can't talk to the
media about the bomb yet.

563
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,873
The order's come directly from Delhi.

564
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:33,375
We can't talk about the bomb
but we can talk about him.

565
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:39,541
Aakash! Inform the press.
Newspaper, Radio, TV.

566
01:10:40,086 --> 01:10:43,055
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

567
01:10:43,256 --> 01:10:47,215
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

568
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,554
He is also carrying an electronic part.

569
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:54,392
If you have any information
on this man please...

570
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:57,570
...contact your nearest police station immediately.

571
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,741
Come on Rehan, drink your milk.

572
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:10,244
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

573
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:16,749
No, I love Rehan much more than that
and he has to drink this milk.

574
01:11:16,956 --> 01:11:17,923
And what about this Rehan?

575
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,597
At this time?

576
01:11:30,637 --> 01:11:32,434
Colonel? At this time?
What's the matter?

577
01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:36,268
I have risked life and come here
for a very important reason.

578
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,139
I've run out of rum!

579
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:47,780
The games destiny plays with us.
And if one is in the army their...

580
01:11:48,655 --> 01:11:51,123
...destiny is not in their hands anyway. Cheers!

581
01:11:55,995 --> 01:12:01,297
Rehan, if you like you can come
to my house and radio your unit.

582
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:03,295
You have a radio transmitter?

583
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,470
Meet the man who lives
in the middle of nowhere...

584
01:12:06,673 --> 01:12:09,471
...and keeps a radio to keep in touch with people.

585
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:12,975
Always wonder why he lives out here.

586
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,979
It's late today. It'll be dark
by the time you return.

587
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:17,979
It's dark already.

588
01:12:18,184 --> 01:12:19,811
Ok, so it's night already.
Come tomorrow. The weather...

589
01:12:20,019 --> 01:12:23,318
...should be clearer as well.
Come and radio your unit then.

590
01:12:23,523 --> 01:12:24,990
There's no need for that.

591
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:25,987
Why not?

592
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:26,988
He has just returned after 7 years.
I don't want...

593
01:12:27,193 --> 01:12:28,990
...him to disappear for another 7.

594
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:34,332
You are trying to guard a soldier is it?
Rehan, do you want me to radio them?

595
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:36,498
No, I'll have to do it myself.

596
01:12:37,537 --> 01:12:38,333
Of course, of course.

597
01:12:38,538 --> 01:12:40,665
Let him give his status report then you...

598
01:12:40,873 --> 01:12:44,832
...can keep him imprisoned here
forever, right Rehan?

599
01:12:45,378 --> 01:12:47,846
Fine, now no more discussion.
What do they say in Punjabi?

600
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,843
Let's have a whopper of a drink.

601
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:29,384
Where's your father?
He was to take me to colonels' house.

602
01:13:31,591 --> 01:13:32,888
Do you really have to go?

603
01:13:35,595 --> 01:13:37,062
Just this last bit of work.

604
01:13:39,599 --> 01:13:44,059
Papa takes a while to get ready.
He'll be down soon. Papa!

605
01:13:56,616 --> 01:14:00,575
Once upon a time there was a prince,
and a princess who was blind.

606
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:02,414
Mom, you are telling a story?

607
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:07,585
One day the princess
met an ordinary man who...

608
01:14:07,794 --> 01:14:11,753
...followed different monuments
in different cities.

609
01:14:12,632 --> 01:14:16,932
But the princess saw the prince
hidden in that ordinary man.

610
01:14:17,804 --> 01:14:19,601
What was the prince's name?

611
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:21,098
Rehan.

612
01:14:31,317 --> 01:14:35,276
The prince saved the princess
from a huge, scary dragon.

613
01:14:36,155 --> 01:14:41,115
The dragon had a big, red face.
Every time he opened his mouth...

614
01:14:41,327 --> 01:14:43,955
...gigantic balls of fire would come out of it.

615
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:45,630
What was the dragon's name?

616
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:48,964
Grandpa!

617
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:56,802
Come on Rehan, let's go to the
Colonel's and radio your unit.

618
01:14:57,844 --> 01:15:00,472
The search is on for a terrorist hiding
in the outskirts of Srinagar.

619
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,978
This terrorist is wearing an army uniform.

620
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:05,150
He is also carrying an electronic part.

621
01:15:10,857 --> 01:15:14,315
Grandpa, Rehan loves you very much.

622
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:32,834
I will have to go for a couple of days
to hand in my resignation.

623
01:15:33,713 --> 01:15:38,514
Whether or not you're on this mission,
the IKF will definitely loose.

624
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:41,186
Terrorists can never win.

625
01:15:41,888 --> 01:15:45,688
That's the thing. These people are not terrorists.
They are fighting for their independence.

626
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:49,527
And who will run this country of theirs?
The IKF?

627
01:15:49,896 --> 01:15:54,526
No. Whoever the people of Kashmir elect.
In fair elections.

628
01:15:55,568 --> 01:16:00,028
It seems you're not against the IKF,
you're for of them.

629
01:16:24,931 --> 01:16:28,560
You are a traitor.
You may be my daughter's husband,

630
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:31,403
...but I'll gladly kill you.

631
01:16:31,938 --> 01:16:36,568
I was doubtful when I saw the news on the TV,
but by then it was too late.

632
01:16:38,778 --> 01:16:42,908
I had my doubts. But today I was certain...

633
01:16:43,115 --> 01:16:46,915
...when I found this trigger in your pocket.

634
01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:52,746
You can't do anything now.
I am going to radio the...

635
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:58,261
...military and hand you over.
Colonel! Colonel!

636
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,268
Please sir, give me that trigger.
All this will be over in a couple of days.

637
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:06,597
Then I can stay with Zooni
and Rehan forever.

638
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:09,604
I'd rather they be dead.
I'll never give you this. Never.

639
01:17:21,988 --> 01:17:23,956
Don't you dare, Rehan!

640
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:26,958
No!!

641
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:36,965
No!!

642
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:05,494
My son. Rehan!
God be praised a million times.

643
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:10,158
You're alive! Do you have what I want?

644
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:13,338
Yes, I have it with me.

645
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:14,664
What's the matter?

646
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:20,001
I'm tired that's all.
I just want all this to end.

647
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:20,678
Look here...

648
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,010
I know what I have to do.
Come here and take what it is you want.

649
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:32,180
The coordinates here are loc rep 34,74...

650
01:18:33,726 --> 01:18:36,194
...mount 2730, 500 house.

651
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:42,530
That was him. Thank God
he hasn't reached his people yet.

652
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:45,533
There is very heavy fog right now. We'll try and be...

653
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:51,034
...there tomorrow morning.
God be with you.

654
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:07,048
Sorry ma'am he gave his location in code.
We'll need some time to break it.

655
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,053
Give Ranade the code to break.

656
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:12,730
Keep the ground search going.

657
01:19:12,932 --> 01:19:16,732
And continue monitoring the
frequency he called from.

658
01:19:16,936 --> 01:19:20,565
We only have till tomorrow morning.
Contact the base camp.

659
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:22,900
Are they ready with the sketch of the
impostor of Captain Ranjeev?

660
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:46,261
Papa!!

661
01:19:52,138 --> 01:19:55,266
Papa! Someone help us please!

662
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:05,617
Mom, what's happened?

663
01:20:10,156 --> 01:20:13,614
Papa! Papa!

664
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:34,309
Mom! What happened?

665
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:39,643
Nothing, go watch some TV.

666
01:20:42,855 --> 01:20:44,823
Rehan. Papa...

667
01:20:45,024 --> 01:20:48,824
I've just left him at Colonel uncle's.
They're both drinking rum.

668
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:54,166
He said he'll stay there tonight.

669
01:20:57,203 --> 01:21:01,003
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

670
01:21:01,207 --> 01:21:05,507
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

671
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:08,680
He went missing 8 days ago.

672
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:11,008
He has an electronic part with him.

673
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:13,845
This is a sketch of him provided by the army.

674
01:21:14,053 --> 01:21:17,682
If you see this man anywhere
please don't try and catch him your self.

675
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:19,016
He is armed and dangerous.

676
01:21:19,225 --> 01:21:21,693
Please contact your nearest police...

677
01:21:21,894 --> 01:21:24,192
...station immediately.
Or call this number.

678
01:23:43,535 --> 01:23:47,164
Hello! Hello! Can someone hear me?

679
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:49,666
Ma'am someone is sending an
SOS from the same frequency.

680
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:52,002
Hello. Hello. Yes we read you.

681
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:56,272
Hello, can someone hear me?

682
01:23:56,482 --> 01:23:57,744
Hello, yes, we can hear you.

683
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:02,546
I am Malini Tyagi from the
anti terrorist special forces. Who is this?

684
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:11,356
I am Zooni Ali Beg. My husband.
I thought he was dead.

685
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:17,826
But he came back 9 days ago.
I think he's the one you are looking for.

686
01:24:19,905 --> 01:24:24,865
He may have killed my father
and my uncle. Or not.

687
01:24:25,778 --> 01:24:33,412
I don't know. Just please help us.
I am alone. It's just me and my son.

688
01:24:33,619 --> 01:24:37,453
Zooni, Zooni don't panic.
And listen to me carefully.

689
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:41,287
Does your husband have
some sort of an electronic part?

690
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:50,162
Yes, I saw it on TV. It's with me.

691
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:57,902
It's him. Your husband is the one
we are looking for. He is the terrorist.

692
01:25:03,148 --> 01:25:07,482
Listen to me carefully Zooni.
I am going to tell you the most...

693
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,519
...important thing you will ever hear.
If he leaves with that trigger,

694
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:13,283
...if he joins his comrades they will...

695
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:18,026
...use a nuclear bomb over our country.

696
01:25:18,297 --> 01:25:20,561
Millions of Indians will die.

697
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:27,029
One of them can be my daughter.
Another can be your son.

698
01:25:28,474 --> 01:25:29,964
There will be complete destruction...

699
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:35,612
...and the only one who can
stop it Zooni, is you!

700
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:41,713
But, he is my husband.

701
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,286
Tell me you will help us Zooni.

702
01:25:45,691 --> 01:25:50,355
Tell me you will stop him.
Whatever it takes.

703
01:25:53,265 --> 01:25:53,959
Yes.

704
01:25:56,001 --> 01:25:58,970
We have your location now Zooni.

705
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,603
We know where you are...

706
01:26:01,273 --> 01:26:02,968
...we'll be there tomorrow morning.

707
01:26:03,175 --> 01:26:04,073
Ok.

708
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:07,567
Who are you running away from?
From me? From your Rehan?

709
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:12,933
I have only one Rehan. My son.

710
01:27:16,348 --> 01:27:18,475
Papa? What happened?

711
01:27:20,519 --> 01:27:23,044
Nothing son. Everything is fine.

712
01:27:29,194 --> 01:27:33,221
What's the point?
You'll kill him as well.

713
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:37,024
I'd rather die first.

714
01:27:37,603 --> 01:27:39,798
You killed Papa quite easily.

715
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:49,909
I didn't kill him.
It was an accident.

716
01:27:53,318 --> 01:27:54,615
And Colonel Uncle?

717
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:08,059
Give me the trigger Zooni.

718
01:28:09,134 --> 01:28:10,032
No.

719
01:28:14,806 --> 01:28:16,205
Give me that trigger!

720
01:28:18,143 --> 01:28:22,978
What will you do?
Kill me as well? Kill me.

721
01:28:23,582 --> 01:28:27,985
I've already died once because of you,
why not once again.

722
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:34,018
Zooni, despite all my lies.

723
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,457
Despite all the pain I have given you.

724
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:43,895
Do you believe that I love you?

725
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,668
Then for the sake of that love.

726
01:28:49,942 --> 01:28:54,709
You have to do what I say.
If you don't give me that trigger...

727
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,077
...then they will torture and
kill Rehan right in front of us.

728
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:02,211
Then they'll kill you in front of me.

729
01:29:03,455 --> 01:29:07,323
Then if they have any mercy,
then they will kill me too

730
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,729
And the person to do all this
will be no stranger.

731
01:29:12,798 --> 01:29:17,701
My own grandfather will destroy
his family with his own hands.

732
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,295
I don't care about myself Zooni,

733
01:29:22,407 --> 01:29:25,137
but I am not willing to
sacrifice Rehan or you.

734
01:29:28,714 --> 01:29:39,613
This is the only way we'll be able to
live our lives in peace again.

735
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:46,662
And what about the lives of those millions
that will die from the bomb?

736
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:52,160
No one will use the bomb. It's just a threat.
The governments...

737
01:29:52,371 --> 01:29:54,635
...of India and Pakistan will have
no other choice, but to give in.

738
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:06,379
After all your lies, how can I believe you now?

739
01:30:11,256 --> 01:30:12,382
Grandfather

740
01:30:14,459 --> 01:30:18,759
Or the Indian army whom I called.

741
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,874
No. Grandfather.

742
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:39,248
You can't leave.

743
01:30:44,623 --> 01:30:51,358
Take care of Rehan and yourself.
I'll be back tomorrow.

744
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:19,513
Rehan! Please for our son's sake. Stop!

745
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,735
Why Rehan? Why?

746
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:30,417
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

747
01:33:30,655 --> 01:33:34,921
Don't say that. Please don't.

748
01:33:45,303 --> 01:33:49,797
Now I'm not scared.

749
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:22,571
When I have your hands in mine

750
01:34:22,774 --> 01:34:27,711
I have with me heavens divine

751
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:32,849
When I have your hands in mine

752
01:34:33,051 --> 01:34:37,954
I have with me heavens divine

753
01:34:38,156 --> 01:34:43,093
When you're close this world is naught

754
01:34:43,295 --> 01:34:47,994
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought

755
01:34:48,867 --> 01:34:52,166
It's easy to choose
between right and wrong.

756
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:55,767
But to choose the greater of two goods...

757
01:34:55,974 --> 01:35:02,379
...or the lesser of two evils.
Those are the choices of our life.

758
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,252
Rehan loves you very much

759
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:18,487
And Zooni loves Rehan very much.
