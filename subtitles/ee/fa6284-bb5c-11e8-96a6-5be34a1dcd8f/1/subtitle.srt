00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,324
You know,
I noticed a shelter outside.

5
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,793
Then you go, idiot!

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,524
Shit, I'd be better off
going back to the army.

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,168
Damn it.

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,185
What a pitiful sight.

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,355
I told you all not to
drink here, didn't I?

10
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,791
Didn't I?

11
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,229
Hey, you.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,632
You're new here, huh?

13
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,467
Yes.

14
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,669
Get up.

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,933
Get up now!

16
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,307
Let me see your ID.

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,247
Right, you wouldn't have one.

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,816
Because you're filth.

19
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,451
Pardon?

20
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,619
Human filth.

21
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,558
All of you are trash
that disgust ordinary citizens.

22
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,761
Damn it,
how old are you?

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,731
I got a presidential plaque
when you were breast-fed.

24
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,234
You disrespectful prick.

25
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,104
You all are in big trouble.

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,141
You two come with me.

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,976
What?

28
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:55,415
Seems like filth
carry around IDs now.

29
00:01:55,415 --> 00:02:00,353
Han Min-wook...

30
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,820
Nice.

31
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,454
What?

32
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,820
Mr. President!

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,685
Salute!

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,691
President?

35
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,693
President, my ass!

36
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,764

I'm Kim Jong-il.

37
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,493

Are you deaf?

53
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,254
Where's an empty seat?

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,669
Here...

55
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,227
Thanks.

56
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm Eun-soo, Choi Eun-soo.

57
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,808
Nice to meet you.

58
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:51,090
Hey, aren't you supposed
to introduce yourselves, too?

59
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,396
Right, I'm Jin-ah.

60
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,131
Cho Jin-ah.

61
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,766
I'm Sun-mi.

62
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,631
Are you a transfer student?

63
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,471
What's our
homeroom teacher like?

64
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,607
Is he cute?

65
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,543
We have a new teacher
coming today.

66
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,567
Hey.

67
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,649
Who's the boss of this class?

68
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,219
Boss?

69
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,255
Her.

70
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,052
Min-sook.

71
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,428
I see.

72
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,996
And the pushover?

73
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,432
The one in front, Bang-shil.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,071
I see.

75
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:44,374
Hey, then who's the rebel?

76
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,479
Han Young-hee.

77
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,936
Students, settle down.

78
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,879
I said be quiet!

79
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:29,655
Had it hard without a homeroom
teacher for two weeks, right?

80
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:34,327
Well let me introduce
your new teacher.

81
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,319
Come in, Miss Choi!

82
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,294
Hey.

83
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,568
What?

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,417
Hello everyone.

85
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm your new homeroom teacher
starting today.

86
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,619
You know my name, right?

87
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,267
Study hard
with your new teacher.

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,869
And make a fresh new start.

89
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,605
Just do it!

90
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,266
Excuse me.

91
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,281
I don't know what
your previous teacher was like,

92
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,052
but I can never forgive anyone

93
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:40,159
who ostracizes or harasses
other students.

94
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,661
Understand?

95
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,298
When class ends, Min-sook and
Bang-shil come to the office.

96
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,788
Okay?

97
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,508
So you're Young-hee, right?

98
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,426
Don't you hear me?

99
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,724
Please don't bother me.

100
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,639
Young-hee,
feeling sick anywhere?

101
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm not sick.

102
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,734
Just don't act like you care.

103
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,780
What?

104
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,084
Don't act like I care?

105
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,850
I'm your teacher,
so how can I not care?

106
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,124
This sucks.

107
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,233
Young-hee,
stop where you are!

108
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,894
Stop right there!

109
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,313
Speak.

110
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,453
We met for
the first time today.

111
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,722
But are you mad at me
for something?

112
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,056
I'm not,
so don't bother me.

113
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,299
I guess it's no use
talking to you.

114
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,901
I'll have to
meet your parents.

115
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,199
My parents?

116
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,640
Then ask to
meet them yourself.

117
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,382
Fine!

118
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,719
What's their number?

119
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,155
It's 016-200-0001.

120
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,901
This is the President's office.

121
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,502
What?

122
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,766
The President's office?

123
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,974
Through reality-based policies,

124
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,211
President Han has improved
the lives of the less fortunate.

125
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,780
He's been single for ten years,

126
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,818
and had a piano concert for
the first time for any president.

127
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,387
With the "Piano President"
as his nickname,

128
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,423
he's very popular
among the youth and women.

129
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,661
But his support from elders
has considerably fallen.

130
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,797
With the local elections
two months away,

131
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,368
this will be a test to the
President's political ability.

132
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,269
Mr. President.

133
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,238
I think Young-hee
is in trouble at school.

134
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,210
Look here, Miss Choi.

135
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,381
How can you put me
in a tight position like this?

136
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,585
What are you trying to
accomplish with the President?

137
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:57,022
As a teacher,
I thought it was necessary.

138
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:04,764
I can forgive you for not knowing
that her father was the President.

139
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,134
But you shouldn't have
called him if you knew later!

140
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:14,403
Did you think the President
would call you to apologize?

141
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,477
Yes, this is the
principal speaking.

142
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,412
This is Han Min-wook,
Young-hee's father.

143
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,015
Mr. President!

144
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,151
I'm sorry I couldn't...

145
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,821
Mr. President, what is the
reason for your gracious call?

146
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,557
My secretary had
received an urgent call.

147
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:36,696
I was wondering if I could
speak to Miss Choi Eun-soo.

148
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,130
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,033
Thank you, Mr. President.

150
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:48,874
I know you're extremely busy,
but please hold for one moment.

151
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,808
Thank you.

152
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,776
Answer it!

153
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,360
Yes, this is Choi Eun-soo.

154
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,299
I'm sorry I had
called you so suddenly.

155
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:18,804
However, 35 students have been
waiting for me for 25 minutes.

156
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,007
If you'd like to talk,
please call me after class.

157
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,998
Have a nice day.

158
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,681
Look here, Miss Choi!

159
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,719
Hello?

160
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,387
Hello?

161
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,922
Mr. President!

162
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,049
Mr. President!

163
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,053
Mr. President!

164
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,390
That doll is cute, huh?

165
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,626
Right?

166
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,761
Yeah, it's cute.

167
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,396
Steal it for me.

168
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,193
Huh?

169
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:26,172
Why? You don't want to?

170
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,370
But...

171
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,140
Welcome.

172
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,182
Hey, kid.

173
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,444
Hey, kid!

174
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,953
Damn it!

175
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,148
Hey you,
stop where you are!

176
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,457
Stop!

177
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,936
"I envy those orioles
who look so much in love."

178
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:37,671
"My lonely heart would
like to return to my beloved."

179
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,705
Now who'd like to read it
in Chinese characters?

180
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:51,455
Pyunpyun... Hwangjo...
Jawoong... Sangee...

181
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,623
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Hello.

182
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,393
Thank you for coming.

183
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,352
Young-hee's classroom
is over there, sir.

184
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,609
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,844
I should've
visited you sooner.

186
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,678
But today's my first day.

187
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,689
So what happened
with Young-hee today?

188
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,390
Right!

189
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,693
In your last press conference,

190
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,595
you highlighted equal education
and teachers' authorities.

191
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,665
But one student used
her father's special status

192
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,201
to directly challenge
a teacher's authority.

193
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,571
In order to stop
this act from repeating,

194
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,542
and as parents are legally
held for a minor's crime,

195
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,639
I'd like for you to accept
Young-hee's punishment.

196
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,356
Wait.

197
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,425
So you're saying that
I be punished instead?

198
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,290
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,607
Miss Choi...

200
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,511
So I want you to write
"The Oriole Song" 100 times.

201
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,313
In Chinese by tomorrow!

202
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,304
I have to go to class now.

203
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,463
I bet the principal didn't sleep,
thinking he might get fired.

204
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,332
I wish I could've seen
the President's face.

205
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:53,794
Giving the President homework
is history in the making.

206
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,110
Think he'll really do it?

207
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,246
Are you on drugs?

208
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,578
Think the President will do it?

209
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,161
Mr. President,
let me do it instead.

210
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,832
How much do I have
before school ends?

211
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,334
If you speed it up,

212
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,565
we can arrive
before after-school class.

213
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,944
Damn, it would be
better drawing it instead.

214
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,749
Teacher!

215
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,950
Can't I get my dad
to do it, too?

216
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,328
Just bring it to the
office when you're done.

217
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,353
Understand?

218
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,538
Why couldn't
my dad be president?

219
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,871
That's why you have
to have the right parents.

220
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,614
97, 98, 99...

221
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,748
100!

222
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,351
You've done it,
Mr. President.

223
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,751
Congratulations!

224
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,856
I won't be tardy, right?

225
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,391
No, sir.

226
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,095
The school is
right over the bridge.

227
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,824
I'm exhausted.

228
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:31,170
But sir,
what does this song mean?

229
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,732
Anyone who went to
high school should know.

230
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:41,538
I was very into sports,
so I missed a lot of classes.

231
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:46,285
The King of Koguryu
wrote it for his beloved.

232
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,856
"I envy those orioles
who look so much in love."

233
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,919
"My lonely heart would
like to return to my beloved."

234
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,347
Mr. President!

235
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,802
I did my homework,
but as I crossed the bridge...

236
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,072
In other words,
the wind blew...

237
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,008
Well, I left the window open.

238
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,043
- And then the wind...
- Mr. President.

239
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,913
Just say that
you were too busy

240
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,949
or that you
didn't want to do it.

241
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,543
You don't need
to lie so blatantly.

242
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,989
Lying?

243
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,491
That's nonsense.

244
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,161
I did my homework,
and then right on the bridge...

245
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,329
That's enough!

246
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,798
I'll take your word for it.

247
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,701
I have class,
so I'm hanging up now.

248
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,840
Mr. President.

249
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,677
I'll order the coast guard
to find your homework, sir.

250
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,942
Don't talk nonsense,
and just get me some paper.

251
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,595
Choi Eun-soo passed
her teaching exam in 1997.

252
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,565
She started teaching Korean
at Jamshil H.S. In 1998,

253
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,667
and transferred to
Songpa H.S. In September,

254
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,368
Junghwa H.S. In June 1999,

255
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,103
Jangchoong H.S.
In September 2000,

256
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,972
Youngbok H.S. In March 2001,

257
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,410
Mijoo H.S. In March 2002,
and then finally to Hanil High.

258
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,179
She only taught for
six months at each school.

259
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,807
Only six months, I see.

260
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:07,089
Everyone, I have a
surprising announcement.

261
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,564
Our new teacher,
Ms. Choi Eun-soo

262
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,001
will represent
our nation's teachers

263
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,734
and have lunch
with the president.

264
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,779
Ms. Choi,
I hope you do well.

265
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,547
Yes.

266
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,378
Applause!

267
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,577
She's the pride of our school.

268
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,279
What am I gonna do?

269
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:05,283
When the President appears,
rise up and greet him politely.

270
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,419
Excuse me.

271
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,856
We're only having lunch, right?

272
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:15,627
I won't be dragged to
anywhere else, right?

273
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,859
Just relax while
you talk over lunch.

274
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,841
Hello?

275
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,376
Did you meet
my sweety Min-wook?

276
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,778
Did you mention me?

277
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,370
Hang up!

278
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,617
Rotten girl.

279
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,109
She thinks
she's a big shot now.

280
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,058
Miss Ha-rin!

281
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:51,396
Does a Mr. Shin Kwang-bae
live with you by any chance?

282
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,990
There's a letter for him.

283
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,527
I don't know who he is!

284
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,775
No.

285
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,643
I'm positive
a man lives there.

286
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,749
I said I'm coming,
so stop calling!

287
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,342
Here it is,
Mr. President.

288
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,585
Mr. President!

289
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,382
Please relax.

290
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,321
"The Oriole Song"
written 100 times.

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,071
I'd like to repeat that I did
do my homework yesterday.

292
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,606
It's not a lie.

293
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:46,211
And I stayed up
all last night doing this.

294
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,271
Please take back
that it was a lie.

295
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,775
You've written
each character very well.

296
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,927
Excellent work.

297
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:24,249
I feel like a elementary school student
all over again.

298
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,585
Shall we have lunch now?

299
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,386
Despite one mistake,

300
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,089
I gave you a perfect grade
for your sincerity.

301
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,857
A mistake?

302
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,759
Where?

303
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,161
Here.

304
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,898
On the third line, it's not
the "Ji" character for "earth."

305
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,733
But it's the particle "Gi".

306
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,102
You're wrong.

307
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,439
That line means
"a lonely me on the earth."

308
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,375
It's not "Gi",
but "Ji" for "earth."

309
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,743
Come on, Mr. President.

310
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:56,281
"Gi" is a particle that
connects the other characters,

311
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,783
so that line
means "a lonely me."

312
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:04,255
I won all the calligraphy
competitions with this song.

313
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,025
It's "Ji" not "Gi."

314
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,462
I am a language teacher.

315
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,399
I've taught this 100 times
a year, so I should know.

316
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,135
It's "Gi" not "Ji".

317
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,603
You're being stubborn!

318
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,705
Stubborn?

319
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,229
Want to bet on it?

320
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,411
I'm the President.

321
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,879
You're also
my student's parent.

322
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,013
Fine!

323
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,420
Minister of Education,
this is the President.

324
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,123
Yes, sir.

325
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,492
I just want to inquire
about something trivial.

326
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,727
It's about "The Oriole Song".

327
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,895
In the third line,

328
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:49,134
it's the particle "Gi"
not "Ji" for "earth", right?

329
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,669
It's "Gi", right?

330
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,570
Of course it's "Gi".

331
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,206
What fool said it was "Ji"?

332
00:27:55,206 --> 00:28:01,012
You finished college long ago,
so you might be confused.

333
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,481
"Ji" should be right.

334
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,850
No, I'm sure that it's "Gi".

335
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,520
My doctorate was
on "The Oriole Song".

336
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,354
Your doctorate?

337
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,358
Should I bring you
my thesis now, sir?

338
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,125
Have a nice day.

339
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,261
He said "Gi", right?

340
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,928
I bet you're hungry.

341
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:35,346
You look so marvelous
playing the piano.

342
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:40,251
And a bit lonely, too.

343
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:44,122
I really wanted
to tell you that.

344
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,790
Thank you.

345
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,459
But I can't play too well.

346
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,293
Oh yeah!

347
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,030
Do you know
the theme song for

348
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,232
Love is a
Many-Splendored Thing?

349
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,735
Of course I do.

350
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,271
The movie with William Holden
and Jennifer Jones, right?

351
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,208
It's Andy Williams' song,
"Love is..."

352
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,710
Can you play that song?

353
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,845
Pardon?

354
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,979
That?

355
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,416
Well, I had a good time
thanks to you.

356
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:17,355
Please teach our students
to their full potential.

357
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,289
I was just thinking, sir.

358
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,698
Try pulling down
your bangs a little.

359
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:30,335
And don't wear ties
with stripes all the time.

360
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,638
Try on ones with pok-a-dots.

361
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:37,597
Then you'll look
ten years younger.

362
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,126
Hi Eun-soo!

363
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,206
Did you meet
my sweety Min-wook?

364
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,175
He's so incredible.

365
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,977
And don't call
the President sweety.

366
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,379
Did you tell him about me?

367
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,815
That there's a girl
who loves him?

368
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,248
Nope.

369
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,586
Hey, is there a law where
I can't become his wife?

370
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,687
Shin Kwang-bae.

371
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,679
Ha-rin, you've got
reserve forces training.

372
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,071
Sir, here's the location
for you to examine tonight.

373
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,480
How about if we
do this instead?

374
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,927
Did you know that I was
also an outcast in high school?

375
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,062
You, too?

376
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,763
This is a secret,

377
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,467
but I'm an outcast
among the teachers, too.

378
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,804
Don't stay home
this weekend.

379
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,275
Go out and meet
your friends, okay?

380
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,777
- Yes, teacher.
- Go Bang-shil!

381
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,880
- Go Miss Choi!
- Bye.

382
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,948
Here's Andy Williams' song,

383
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:29,511
"Love is a
Many-Splendored Thing."

384
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:46,537
"Love is a
Many splendored thing."

385
00:31:46,537 --> 00:32:00,251
"It's the April rose that
only grows in the early spring."

386
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:14,632
"Love is nature's way
of giving a reason to be living,"

387
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:27,478
"The golden crown
that makes a man a king."

388
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:40,358
"Once, on a high and windy hill,"

389
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,494
"In the moonlight mist,"

390
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,731
If I stopped, then hurry
and give me a ticket.

391
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,724
Now they're having
their fun with people.

392
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,534
How are you?

393
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,367
Remember him?

394
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,942
It's good to see you again.

395
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:37,541
It's good to
see you doing well.

396
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,359
I'd like to make a proposal.

397
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,529
For the citizens who
have worked hard today,

398
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:59,170
I will bring all of you home
on the President's limousine.

399
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,606
How about it Mr. President?

400
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,198
Great!

401
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,378
Cheers for
President Han Min-wook!

402
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:17,049
"Yes, true love's a many splendored thing."

403
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:22,427
Frankly, I've given up
a lot on Young-hee.

404
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,931
But after meeting you,
I've mustered some hope.

405
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:32,733
That maybe you could guide
her into the right direction.

406
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,340
But lately I don't know

407
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,912
whether straightening up
a student is really right.

408
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,049
After going through
their own rebellious stage,

409
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:50,146
I think maybe they could
naturally heal themselves.

410
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:56,889
The bigger problem is that
she doesn't have a dream.

411
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:02,530
It's been so long
since I've seen her smile.

412
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:08,172
Perhaps when
she was six years old.

413
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:14,236
When I fell flat down on ice,
she smiled and laughed.

414
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,244
I really miss that smile.

415
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:25,056
Then how about we try
to find Young-hee's smile?

416
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,325
I'm not that confident, but...

417
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,361
Just do it!

418
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,953
Just do it!

419
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,173
Oh yeah!

420
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,799
Thanks for the cake.

421
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,922
I don't like them.

422
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,253
What?

423
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,833
I wanna be rained on.

424
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,198
Rain?

425
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,786
Please don't worry,
everything is fine now.

426
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,469
Young-hee, let's talk.

427
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,770
No.

428
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,305
Young-hee!

429
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,673
Let's talk first.

430
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,198
No, let go!

431
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,019
Why'd you hit me?

432
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,511
My dad doesn't even hit me,
so what gives you the right?

433
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,417
Follow me.

434
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,442
Do you want that?

435
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,842
Want me to steal it?

436
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,282
Why? Think I can't?

437
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,979
If I get caught,
I'll say I was menstruating.

438
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,805
Here!

439
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,522
Mister,
she told me to steal it.

440
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,863
Not again.

441
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,097
Hey!

442
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,265
Hey!

443
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,668
Hey!

444
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,829
Hey you!

445
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,213
Hey you!

446
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,306
Stop!

447
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,920
Smile whenever you
wanna smile, dummy.

448
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,619
It's worse holding
in a smile than pooing.

449
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,927
You're in high school,
but do you still like dolls?

450
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,910
That was the first time
I stole something.

451
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,140
It's easier than I thought.

452
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:36,287
Why did you stare
at the doll before?

453
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,723
I was talking to it.

454
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,393
Talking?

455
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,128
When I was young,

456
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,065
I fell asleep after
waiting for my parents.

457
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,468
When I wake up,
parents have already left.

458
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:55,105
And I'd find a doll in front of me.

459
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,776
And then I'd throw it away.

460
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:05,349
Afterwards,
there'd be another doll.

461
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,876
And I'd throw it away again.

462
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:15,987
Maybe it's some curse,
but the dolls talk to me.

463
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,131
About what?

464
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,000
About anything.

465
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,434
Common day stuff.

466
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,200
You made that up, huh?

467
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,745
How'd you know?

468
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,283
There are ways to find out.

469
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,553
But others believed me.

470
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,581
Teacher, you take it.

471
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,495
Hey!

472
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,559
Young-hee.

473
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:02,072
I stole it for you.

474
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,132
It talks too much,
so I don't want it.

475
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,410
Hey!

476
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,087
What should we do?

477
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,256
It looks good to me.

478
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,350
Leave it there so it
can ramble on by itself.

479
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,053
Think we should?

480
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:41,045
Prices are too high I tell you.

481
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,849
So you mean that taxi fares
are too high as well, right?

482
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,649
No way,
taxi fares need to go up.

483
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,325
I was valedictorian,
and I didn't get in.

484
00:44:55,325 --> 00:45:00,130
But tall and pretty Ji-hyun
who doesn't study gets in.

485
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,332
Mister,
does this make sense?

486
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,268
Does this make sense?

487
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,260
I said does this make sense?

488
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,424
Sorry to keep you waiting.

489
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,517
No, that's okay.

490
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,529
Do I look strange?

491
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,056
No, you look good in jeans.

492
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:39,536
Please come this way.

493
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,798
Yes, sir.

494
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,851
So where shall we go?

495
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,446
I have an idea.

496
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,725
Young-hee really smiled?

497
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,093
Yes, sir.

498
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:08,599
It would've been nice if you
had saw it, Mr. President.

499
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,502
Please don't call me
Mr. President.

500
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,472
Just call me Mr. Han.

501
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:20,210
Or Min-wook perhaps.

502
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,407
Yes, Min-wook.

503
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,283
Why are you so late?

504
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,585
Man, it was damn hard.

505
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,789
That's why I told you
to go on time.

506
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,424
How'd you get
so much dirt on you?

507
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,984
She and I live together.

508
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,532
She?

509
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:46,570
In high school, we were
in the same movie club.

510
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,542
He was so handsome
all the girls liked him.

511
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:55,376
But after serving in the army,
he came back as a girl.

512
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,782
I see.

513
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,160
Hey Eun-soo.

514
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,229
Why'd your reserve training
end so late?

515
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:16,325
I had to make up for missing
out on the last session.

516
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,038
It's you, right?

517
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,404
Right?

518
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,909
Pleased to meet you.

519
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,878
It's a tremendous honor, sir.

520
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,815
You look a lot handsomer
in person than on TV.

521
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,917
Am I dreaming or what?

522
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,620
This isn't a dream, right?

523
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:43,026
Ha-rin, aren't you going to
change into something prettier?

524
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,162
Oh my, where's my head?

525
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,897
I'm going to
change very quickly,

526
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,999
so please wait a moment, sir.

527
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,933
I'll be right back.

528
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,505
I'll be right back.

529
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,305
- Let's drink.
- Sure.

530
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:14,358
Mr. President,
I mean Min-wook.

531
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,363
Have you ever been
without your bodyguards?

532
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,165
No, I've never had the chance.

533
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:26,103
Don't you want to try once?

534
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,094
Well...

535
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,810
It won't be that easy.

536
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,940
The bathroom has a back door.

537
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,580
See you soon.

538
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,764
Hurry.

539
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,587
Out of shape?

540
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,504
It's locked.

541
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,605
Let's jump over.

542
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,322
Are you okay?

543
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,056
Where did he go?

544
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,580
Let's look for him again.

545
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,340
Noodles and a soju bottle
for table three.

546
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,680
What's this?

547
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:16,325
This is a tavern, right?

548
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:30,180
Actually, these huge guys
dressed in black suits outside.

549
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,149
I know, I know.

550
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,917
You're fugitives, right?

551
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:34,885
Yes.

552
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,420
Trying to hide, right?

553
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,922
Yes.

554
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:39,823
Follow me.

555
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,291
- Thank you.
- Hurry and go upstairs.

556
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,962
Don't worry about big men.

557
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,199
I used to be a Marine.

558
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,032
Oh my, isn't that him?

559
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,661
Just finish your food.

560
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,451
They're coming.

561
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,094
What do you want?

562
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,964
Was the President here
by any chance?

563
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,465
The President?

564
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,900
Of course.

565
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,135
Really?

566
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,803
Yeah, 30 years ago.

567
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,507
President Park
came to my Marine unit.

568
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,134
Pardon?

569
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,513
Bastard didn't know
what a real Marine can do.

570
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,149
I knocked him out,
so you can relax and drink.

571
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:14,138
Follow me.

572
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,455
Sit, sit.

573
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,889
Sit over here.

574
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,461
It's nice sitting together, huh?

575
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,396
So what drink
can I get for you?

576
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:30,662
Since we were drinking

577
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,770
Something newer?

578
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,206
I told you there's
no one like that here.

579
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,341
No, a customer that just left

580
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,311
said there's someone who
looks just like the President.

581
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,313
I'm sorry,
but I'll have to look upstairs.

582
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,414
You can't.

583
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,515
Ma'am, you can't do this.

584
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,973
If you keep this up,
I'll call the police.

585
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,491
Big trouble.

586
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,026
They have guns.

587
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,794
Hurry and hide.

588
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,864
Hurry and go.

589
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,634
Go inside.

590
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,835
Hurry.

591
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,203
Go in.

592
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:13,209
Wait...

593
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,200
Do you want to get shot?

594
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:23,143
I was only a security guard.

595
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,502
Sorry to interrupt.

596
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,952
Salute!

597
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,388
Everything's clear,
Mr. President.

598
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:46,669
I think we've put them
through too much,

599
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,036
so how about we quit?

600
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,184
What a beautiful morning!

601
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:53,258
Oh my,
Young-hee's here early today.

602
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,501
What a great day it is.

603
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,105
Life is happy and beautiful.

604
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:06,643
We're going to study
hard today, okay?

605
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,304
Just do it!

606
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:24,527
Teacher, please have some.
It'll help start your great day.

607
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,428
Thank you!

608
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,787
Well, see you in Korean class!

609
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,721
Just do it!

610
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,490
Teacher!

611
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,299
Teacher, are you all right?

612
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,436
I'm fine.

613
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,871
Vinegar is a good
beauty treatment.

614
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,640
Just do it!

615
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,141
Sorry, teacher.

616
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:15,445
It's okay.

617
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,847
Hey, it tasted better
than soy sauce.

618
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:21,078
We mixed it with
soap water, too.

619
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,854
It's okay.

620
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:27,880
We spit in it, too.

621
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,473
The files on the eastern front
you'll be visiting today, sir.

622
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,907
Yes, good work.

623
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,499
There are so many.

624
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,645
Here you go.

625
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,044
Mr. Chang.

626
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:55,181
It concerns
Young-hee's teacher.

627
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,224
Well, some place
people can't notice...

628
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:04,327
That is, a quiet place...

629
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,129
Well, for the two of us...

630
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,031
I understand very well.

631
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,666
I'll set the time
and place for you.

632
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,566
Thank you.

633
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,938
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

634
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,246
Hello?

635
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,514
Is this Miss Choi Eun-soo?

636
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,915
Yes, it's me.

637
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,785
This is Mr. Chang
from the President's office.

638
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:32,321
Yes, we've met before.

639
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:37,527
The President wants to meet
you at a quiet place tonight.

640
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,528
Yes.

641
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:43,199
The place is suite 2301
at the Hyatt Hotel.

642
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,903
The President
will arrive at 10 p.m.

643
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,239
It's suite 2301,
and please don't be late.

644
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:53,436
Hotel suite?

645
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,581
Our policy shouldn't
be superficial or formal,

646
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:04,220
but being full of hope for
the future is most important.

647
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,348
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

648
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:13,096
Oh yeah, what happened
to that favor I asked of you?

649
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,897
Right, sir.

650
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,535
The room has been reserved,
and security has been sent.

651
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:22,004
What? Reserve a room?

652
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:27,977
Yes, if you go to suite 2301
at the Hyatt Hotel at 10 p.m.,

653
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,480
Miss Choi will be
waiting for you.

654
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,184
It's the room President Clinton
slept in during his visit.

655
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,855
It's the best place for secrecy.

656
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,223
Look here, Mr. Chang.

657
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,259
I'm sorry, sir.

658
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,728
I should've mentioned it
when no one's around.

659
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,563
Look here, Mr. Chang.

660
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,633
Are you out of your mind?

661
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,634
Sir?

662
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,237
This is not what I wanted.

663
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,872
Cancel it right now.

664
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,339
Now!

665
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,601
What's wrong?

666
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,865
Something happened?

667
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,642
I want to get drunk.

668
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,644
Why?

669
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,213
What happened?

670
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:42,285
Which bastard did this to you?

671
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,810
The President bastard.

672
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,795
Hello?

673
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,900
Oh, right.

674
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,164
Hold on please.

675
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,776
Answer it.

676
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,811
Who is it?

677
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,713
The President bastard.

678
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:11,547
I don't want to.

679
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,317
Answer it,
he wants to talk to you.

680
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,582
Just tell him
what's on your mind.

681
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,012
Hurry.

682
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,397
Hello?

683
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,900
Eun-soo, it's me.

684
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,704
I'm sorry that
I'm not that kind of girl.

685
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,406
I'm not like that
so I'm very sorry.

686
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,964
Good-bye.

687
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,387
Yes, Mr. President.

688
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,082
Get the car ready.

689
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:01,662
I think I've fallen in love.

690
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,234
Okay.

691
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,036
Good luck with him.

692
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:12,508
Good luck with
that president guy.

693
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:16,212
It's all over now.

694
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,876
Don't ever talk about him
in front of me, okay?

695
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,889
Hey, Han Min-wook!

696
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,659
It's all over!

697
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:32,061
The end!

698
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,688
End!

699
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,694
But it's not about
my sweety Min-wook.

700
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,974
Hello.

701
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,644
She just left.

702
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,417
Where did she go?

703
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,750
Eun-soo!

704
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,927
Eun-soo,
I know you're very upset.

705
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,429
It's all my fault.

706
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:44,567
But I wish
you'd let me explain.

707
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:45,935
I'm sorry.

708
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,638
This may be rude of me,
but one thing is for sure.

709
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,698
I'm not that kind of girl.

710
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,019
Hello.

711
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:13,222
Nice to meet you.

712
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:18,125
It's the President!

713
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:32,141
It's an honor to meet you.

714
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:35,201
What a handsome fellow.

715
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:48,052
Hello.

716
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:54,085
You're so cute.

717
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,390
This guy who likes this girl
made a mistake.

718
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,492
It wasn't directly his fault,

719
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,762
but if he nonetheless
hurt her in the end,

720
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:31,200
I think he should apologize
and make up to her.

721
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,228
If you were her,
what would you do?

722
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,223
That girl was riding
in the subway.

723
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:58,527
She waited for him to come
closer and missed her stop.

724
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,062
So what would you do?

725
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:03,032
I'd have to take her
all the way home.

726
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,897
Let's get off at the next stop.

727
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:16,108
Seoul Night Club,
Waiter Han Min-wook

728
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,022
It's here.

729
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,591
I see.

730
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,889
It's a nice place.

731
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:37,900
I'm sorry and grateful
for today.

732
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,202
I had a good time.

733
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,500
I had a good time as well.

734
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:03,154
I wonder why people
find courage in the dark.

735
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:17,606
Feeling the hiccups
coming again?

736
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:59,443
President Han Gets Caught
On A Secret Date

737
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,287
In a recent newspaper,

738
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:10,192
President Han was found
embracing a woman.

739
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,127
Her name is Choi Eun-soo.

740
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,264
She's the President's
daughter's teacher.

741
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:20,035
But the thornier issue
is Choi Eun-soo's past.

742
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,137
In college,
she was suspected of

743
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,240
kidnapping the Unification
Minister's granddaughter,

744
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,110
and was being investigated.

745
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:32,247
My granddaughter
was taken hostage.

746
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:35,648
Is that a humane thing to do?

747
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,249
Hello.

748
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,108
Hey, did you guys hear?

749
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:03,579
Ms. Choi came to our school
to become the President's wife.

750
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,646
That sucks.

751
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,815
For that kidnapping,

752
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,452
she seduced these guys
and then betrayed them...

753
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:13,389
No wonder she tried
to manipulate Young-hee.

754
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,086
I heard she stole something
to get close to Young-hee.

755
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,549
Repeat what you all just said.

756
01:13:23,549 --> 01:13:24,751
What?

757
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:26,619
What did you just say?

758
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:29,388
Say it, you bitches!

759
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:33,256
Say it!

760
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:38,197
To be the President's wife,

761
01:13:38,197 --> 01:13:41,768
become a teacher and
transfer to different schools.

762
01:13:41,768 --> 01:13:44,370
Then go to the President's
daughter's school.

763
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,806
Afterwards,
be her homeroom teacher.

764
01:13:46,806 --> 01:13:48,708
Since there needs
to be an opening,

765
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:52,245
use any means
to kick out her old teacher.

766
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:54,247
I'd like to
point something out.

767
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:58,084
There's something very
important to be his wife.

768
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:59,652
What's that?

769
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:04,521
You must kidnap
a little child ten years ago.

770
01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:08,895
Our country has
gotten a lot better.

771
01:14:08,895 --> 01:14:12,398
In the old days,
he'd go to jail for saying that.

772
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:16,169
Who is he talking about?

773
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:18,371
Just keep eating!

774
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:23,209
A woman who dates the
President can become his wife.

775
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,211
Who is she?

776
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,480
The mother of our country.

777
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:33,452
But at the same time,
she lives with another man.

778
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:37,123
Does this make sense
in a civilized country?

779
01:14:37,123 --> 01:14:39,058
Look at this.

780
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:44,564
Shin Kwang-bae's ID
is 730728- 1052511.

781
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:49,802
Have you ever heard of a
woman called Kwang-bae?

782
01:14:49,802 --> 01:14:53,704
And ever seen a woman's ID
start with a male's number?

783
01:15:01,814 --> 01:15:05,341
Ha-Rin.

784
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:21,534
Our party's approval rate
has fallen by 35% this month.

785
01:15:21,534 --> 01:15:26,767
This will negatively affect
the local elections next month.

786
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:40,847
Sir, shall I catch you
on a better time?

787
01:15:42,154 --> 01:15:44,056
Are you really dating
the President?

788
01:15:44,056 --> 01:15:45,921
- When did you two meet?
- Is it true?

789
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,219
How do you feel now?

790
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,161
Please say something.

791
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,737
Mr. President, please allow me
to begin by addressing your

792
01:15:57,737 --> 01:16:01,474
alleged relationship with Miss Choi.

793
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,739
Is there any truth to this rumor?

794
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:08,748
She would like to first
ask you about the rumors

795
01:16:08,748 --> 01:16:12,878
that is troubling you at the moment.

796
01:16:15,254 --> 01:16:19,091
To protest his objection to the
North-South student summit,

797
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:21,060
we stopped the Minister's car.

798
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:28,334
But he had mistakenly left his
granddaughter and drove off.

799
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:32,171
So we're not kidnappers.

800
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:38,644
Choi Eun-soo is simply
my daughter's teacher.

801
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:42,581
We had no time to develop
feelings for each other.

802
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:50,511
All I did was hear her advice
on Young-hee's education.

803
01:16:50,756 --> 01:16:56,126
And I'd really like
to point out something here.

804
01:16:56,595 --> 01:17:00,533
Shin Kwang-bae
had a sex change,

805
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:04,270
but she's not treated
legally as a woman.

806
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:09,875
She's my best friend
and is like a sister to me.

807
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:15,548
I'd like for you all
not to hurt her any longer.

808
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,350
As our country's President,

809
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:23,122
I deeply regret that
I've confused the people.

810
01:17:23,122 --> 01:17:27,326
From now on,
I'll restrain from these acts.

811
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:29,195
Is your relationship
with the President true?

812
01:17:29,195 --> 01:17:31,097
Please tell the truth.

813
01:17:31,097 --> 01:17:33,132
Yes, it's true.

814
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:36,533
I had feelings
for the President.

815
01:17:37,303 --> 01:17:44,243
So I did what I could
to get close to him.

816
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:49,515
By doing this wrongful act,

817
01:17:49,515 --> 01:17:55,654
I've brought trouble
to the honorable President,

818
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:58,424
so I'm deeply sorry.

819
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:02,028
Didn't the President realize
you intentions?

820
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:05,623
Will you keep teaching
at his daughter's school?

821
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:29,914
Miss Choi.

822
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,627
Don't be too upset.

823
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:41,795
The President has no choice
but to be a politician.

824
01:19:06,926 --> 01:19:09,195
Why are you up there?

825
01:19:09,195 --> 01:19:10,787
Just because.

826
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:17,636
I'm really sorry.

827
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:21,307
For what?

828
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:22,968
Just because.

829
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:30,316
I bet it's nice to
quit this dumb school.

830
01:19:30,316 --> 01:19:32,284
Envious, huh?

831
01:19:32,651 --> 01:19:35,848
I'm going very far away
to the countryside.

832
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:41,552
Did you really like my dad?

833
01:19:46,465 --> 01:19:48,262
Yep!

834
01:19:49,068 --> 01:19:51,969
But you're giving up?

835
01:19:55,241 --> 01:19:56,572
Yep!

836
01:19:56,942 --> 01:19:58,239
Why?

837
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,535
Just because!

838
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:09,613
When are you coming down?

839
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:12,253
After you leave.

840
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:15,050
Okay!

841
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:21,462
I'm done having fun,
so I'm going home.

842
01:20:22,935 --> 01:20:27,473
You're the first person
to hit me.

843
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:30,203
And the last, of course.

844
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:33,669
You need to be hit more.

845
01:20:37,616 --> 01:20:40,414
Teacher!

846
01:21:26,232 --> 01:21:38,736
Excellent work

847
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:28,994
Mr. President.

848
01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:32,191
You're 35 minutes
behind schedule, sir.

849
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:38,570
This year,
there are many paintings

850
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:42,165
that entail fantasies
of a cyber-future.

851
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:44,310
When I was young,

852
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,846
I'd paint landscapes
of my dreams.

853
01:22:47,846 --> 01:22:51,373
Kids today
are surely different.

854
01:22:57,456 --> 01:22:59,992
Who's the person
standing there?

855
01:22:59,992 --> 01:23:01,360
It's me, sir.

856
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,730
Your dream must be
to become president.

857
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:05,698
Yes, sir.

858
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:06,999
When I grow up,

859
01:23:06,999 --> 01:23:10,402
I want to be a great
president for the people.

860
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:15,772
An honest and great
president like President Han.

861
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:14,633
At a countryside school
in Youngwol Town,

862
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:19,671
a elementary school student dreamed
of becoming president.

863
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:26,912
This boy painted a picture
of his dreams and ambitions.

864
01:24:26,912 --> 01:24:31,183
It was rough
yet sincerely made.

865
01:24:31,183 --> 01:24:34,219
And into the far future,

866
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:39,224
this boy became president.

867
01:24:39,224 --> 01:24:45,197
But this president lied to
the people who elected him.

868
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:51,069
And terribly broke
this woman's heart.

869
01:24:51,069 --> 01:24:54,339
My beloved citizens.

870
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,875
Today,
in front of all of you,

871
01:24:56,875 --> 01:25:02,281
I'd like to confess
something to you.

872
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:08,187
Frankly,
I don't play the piano well.

873
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:13,926
For the last election,
I practiced to artificially create

874
01:25:13,926 --> 01:25:19,264
this image of a
piano-playing president.

875
01:25:19,264 --> 01:25:22,968
You voted for
a person like this.

876
01:25:22,968 --> 01:25:26,472
And I was elected president
thanks to you.

877
01:25:26,472 --> 01:25:31,844
But I can't lie
to myself any longer.

878
01:25:31,844 --> 01:25:40,919
I'm very embarrassed
for lying to you all until now.

879
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:46,258
My beloved citizens,
I'm very sorry.

880
01:25:46,258 --> 01:25:53,432
But I'm not going to
disappoint you any longer.

881
01:25:53,432 --> 01:25:57,302
I...

882
01:25:57,302 --> 01:26:02,774
I love Miss Choi Eun-soo.

883
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:12,684
She helped me
find myself again.

884
01:26:12,684 --> 01:26:14,786
Ladies and gentlemen.

885
01:26:14,786 --> 01:26:19,485
If I don't hold on to her,
I'll never get married.

886
01:26:57,162 --> 01:26:59,027
Teacher!

887
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:03,228
Hi.

888
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,838
Which one is prettier?

889
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:08,073
This one is, right?

890
01:27:08,073 --> 01:27:10,309
No, this one's prettier.

891
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,677
Mine's prettier.

892
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:14,112
No, both of them are.

893
01:27:14,112 --> 01:27:17,149
Teacher, you take them.

894
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,379
Thank you.

895
01:28:56,715 --> 01:29:04,222
A man who loves this woman
made an unforgivable mistake.

896
01:29:04,222 --> 01:29:08,427
But this man desperately
wants her to forgive him.

897
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:11,794
If you were her,
what would you do?

898
01:29:19,838 --> 01:29:25,243
Can I answer in a poem?

899
01:29:25,243 --> 01:29:27,905
