1
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,834
It was him!
He did it.

2
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,337
<i>Then his hog got
in my corn again.</i>

3
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,925
<i>He had no fence that would hold it,
so I put it in my pen.</i>

4
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,804
I told him he could have his hog back
when he paid me a dollar pound fee.

5
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:05,432
- What did he say to that?
- "He didn't say nothin'."

6
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:08,935
But yesterday
I got his answer, all right.

7
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,979
My barn burned!

8
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:14,649
<i>A barn burner is the meanest,
lowest creature there is.</i>

9
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:18,153
I can't find against you,
Quick. There's no proof.

10
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,530
But I can give you
some advice.

11
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,658
<i>Leave this county
and don't come back to it.</i>

12
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:25,702
You're the judge.

13
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:29,706
That'll do. Take your belongings
and get out before dark.

14
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,869
<i>The long</i>

15
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:11,123
<i>Hot summer</i>

16
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:14,126
<i>Seems to know every time</i>

17
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,129
<i>You're near</i>

18
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:20,298
<i>And the touch of a breeze</i>

19
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,719
<i>Gently stirs all the trees</i>

20
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:26,221
<i>And a bird wants to please</i>

21
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:29,725
<i>My ear</i>

22
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,894
<i>The long</i>

23
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,814
<i>Hot summer</i>

24
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:38,984
<i>Seems to know what a flirt</i>

25
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,486
<i>You are</i>

26
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,740
<i>Seems to know your caress</i>

27
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:48,160
<i>Isn't mine to possess</i>

28
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,996
<i>How could someone possess</i>

29
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>A star</i>

30
00:02:55,083 --> 00:03:00,630
<i>But you may long for me</i>

31
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:06,344
<i>Long before the fall</i>

32
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:11,725
<i>Long before
the winds announce</i>

33
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:16,855
<i>That winter's come to call</i>

34
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,691
<i>And meanwhile</i>

35
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:23,070
<i>I'll court you</i>

36
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,280
<i>And meanwhile</i>

37
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:29,368
<i>I'll kiss you</i>

38
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:33,830
<i>Meanwhile
my lonely arms</i>

39
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,958
<i>Will hold you</i>

40
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,879
<i>Strong</i>

41
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:45,884
<i>And meanwhile</i>

42
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,388
<i>The long</i>

43
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:53,058
<i>Hot summer</i>

44
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:58,313
<i>Slowly moves along</i>

45
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,482
<i>Oh, so slowly</i>

46
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:05,487
<i>Moves along</i>

47
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:10,450
<i>Moves along</i>

48
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,446
You like a lift
to town?

49
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,449
Never walk
when I can ride.

50
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:37,871
- Just push 'em out of your way.
- Thank you, ma'am.

51
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,129
I went shopping in those Memphis stores
this morning and just went wild.

52
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,132
Alligator bag, figured print,
summer shoes.

53
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,968
Which is all a laugh considering
we live in Frenchman's Bend...

54
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,305
and nobody's gonna see 'em but
redneck farmers and immediate family.

55
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,308
I don't care though.
I got my morale to keep up.

56
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,768
- Are you two country girls?
- Country?

57
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,144
- Are you two country girls?
- Country?

58
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,272
Our little town's the most nowhere place
in the state of Mississippi.

59
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:07,651
You can believe me when I tell you
it laces you in tight as a corset.

60
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,904
And as far as social amusements
are concerned, there are none.

61
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,949
Well, that's all right.
I'm a quiet-livin' man myself.

62
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,576
I only know one reason
for living quiet.

63
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,121
That's if you're too old
to live any other way.

64
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:22,791
In other words, you two girls just
take your fun where you can find it?

65
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,293
Don't jump to any conclusions,
young man.

66
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,339
- We're giving you a ride, that's all.
- Where are you headed?

67
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,508
I go as far as you go,
ma'am.

68
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,303
You sound free as a bird.
Doesn't he sound free as a bird, Clara?

69
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,140
Clara's wondering what kind of a bird,
aren't you, Clara?

70
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,183
If you aren't
a mind reader.

71
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,770
Clara here's a schoolteacher
and mighty finicky about her reputation.

72
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,772
She didn't want
to pick you up.

73
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,525
I said, "Why not?
There's two of us and one of him."

74
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,319
She said, "'Cause he
looks mean and dirty."

75
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:55,991
I'd say that lady is
a real fine judge of character.

76
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,326
You've got no regard
for the safety of your person...

77
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,996
the way you drive this Lincoln car.

78
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,417
I'm getting a fallen kidney joltin'
around this countryside with you.

79
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,462
<i>Looks like Varner's
the man to see around here.</i>

80
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:54,132
You can find him over at our house
most any time.

81
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,468
You two girls
belong to Varner?

82
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,930
We two girls most particularly
belong to Varner.

83
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:37,134
How does a man make a living
around here?

84
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:40,762
- Honest or dishonest?
- Let me hear what's open.

85
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:44,015
Now, a fella that's hardworkin'
and clean-livin'...

86
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,518
can plant cotton
in the bottomland...

87
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,854
corn along the edge
of the hills.

88
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:51,898
If he ain't particular, he can
make whiskey in a homemade still.

89
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:55,444
<i>And what he don't drink,
he can sell.</i>

90
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,363
Well, what happens
if a federal man comes by?

91
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,116
Ooh, they've been known
to come by.

92
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,243
Also been known
to disappear.

93
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,579
Hey, um, not entirely.

94
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:08,123
No, not entirely.

95
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:11,334
Missing man's shoes might show up,
or his hat...

96
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,545
maybe even
his suspenders.

97
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:18,300
'Course somebody else
is wearing them.

98
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,511
<i>You a federal man?</i>

99
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,767
Well, let's say
I'm a farmer, Dad.

100
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,604
Uh-huh.
Let's just say so.

101
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:33,440
If you was to follow that road over
there, you'd come to a tenant farm.

102
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,942
You could work
if you have a mind to.

103
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,570
Belongs to a fellow
named Varner.

104
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,989
What doesn't?

105
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,158
<i>What's your name, boy?</i>

106
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,285
Quick. Ben Quick.

107
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,373
Quick?

108
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,001
Sure now.
So that's him?

109
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,143
Heavenly days!
There's Agnes Stewart.

110
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:13,146
She called up all nervous and fluttery
this morning to say she was comin' over.

111
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,650
<i>I forgot to tell you about it.
Jody.!</i>

112
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,075
Jody, I'm home!
And I spent all your money!

113
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,828
Well, looks like you sure
had a busy day, honey.

114
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,497
Just wait till you see
what I have for you.

115
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,625
Bought you a red-and-white pure silk tie
and a box of brown sugar pralines...

116
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,877
<i>and some maroon felt
bedroom slippers.</i>

117
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:39,131
I bought you
all kinds of other things too.

118
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:41,174
Whole bunch of new records
and some sport shirts.

119
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:45,637
- All sorts of things!
- Honey, it ain't my birthday.

120
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:49,433
I just wanted you to know you was
in my thoughts up there in Memphis.

121
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,978
You just sit down and close your eyes.
I'm gonna model my purchases.

122
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,188
You wanna know something,
honey?

123
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:59,025
- I hate this house when you're not in it.
- Well, I'm in it now.

124
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,279
And I'm gorgeous!

125
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,281
Wait till you see
this new dress!

126
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,950
They show the same one
in theJune "Vogue" magazine...

127
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,619
only without these
little bows in the back.

128
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,122
Salesgirl said to me,
"Miss Varner...

129
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,624
that dress was made
in heaven for you."

130
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,044
On account of
I'm so long waisted.

131
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,629
She said five customers
had that dress on...

132
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,090
and I was the only one
did anything for it.

133
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,759
You like it?

134
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,887
What I like is you,
honey.

135
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,681
- "There's more."
- There sure is.

136
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:33,226
<i>And all of it
mighty pretty.!</i>

137
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,396
Ooh! Oh, now.

138
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,649
- You come to your daddy. Come on now.
- No!

139
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,027
Come to your daddy! I got you!

140
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,029
- I got you!
- Jody!

141
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,907
What in the world's
going on up there?

142
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,785
We don't go in much
for stately quiet around here.

143
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,996
<i>Where did you get
so much energy on a day like this?</i>

144
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,832
That party has been going on
since Papa left for the hospital.

145
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,169
I don't see how you can stand all that
hootin' and hollerin' and carryin' on.

146
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,632
- It would turn me into a nervous wreck.
- They're young and in love.

147
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,634
"They're young."

148
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:09,513
For your information, we're still
on the green side of 25 ourselves...

149
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,515
for all the good
it does us.

150
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,977
<i>Oh, Clara, that baby brother of yours
is like a five-year-old kid.</i>

151
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,855
You know what we were doing in there?
Having a pillow fight.

152
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,401
I hit him so hard, I knocked
the wind smack out of him.

153
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,861
- Hello, Agnes sweetie.
- Hello, Eula.

154
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,823
<i>You sure do look calm and collected
on this hot day.</i>

155
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:30,200
Well, I'm not.
I'm damp and cranky.

156
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:34,496
I know what you mean. I'm going
straight into a bubble bath myself.

157
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:38,166
Agnes, you bring a beau by one of these
nights, and we'll cook up a party.

158
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,168
<i>Hey, Eula?</i>

159
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,505
Oh, if I'm not mistaken,
that's my master's voice.

160
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:47,008
"Bring a beau by."

161
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,011
My phone rang
just one time last week.

162
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,013
Just one time.

163
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,684
And this man with a deep,
beautiful voice says...

164
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:59,354
"Can I interest you in
the "Encyclopaedia Britannica?"

165
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:02,691
Let's go upstairs, and I'll give you
a permanent. That'll cheer you up.

166
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:05,610
Clara, you've given me three permanents
in the last six months.

167
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:07,779
All my ends are splittin'.

168
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:12,576
<i>Oh, Clara, it's unnervin'
havin'all this time on my hands.</i>

169
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,080
I wanna rush home and fix supper
for some big, handsome man...

170
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:21,084
and put kids in a bathtub
and broil steak and crank ice cream...

171
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:24,588
and... think about
what the night's gonna bring.

172
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,383
Why aren't there enough men
to go around?

173
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:31,219
There's no shortage.
Just of the right kind.

174
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:35,223
- Ooh, I'm not fussy on that subject.
- Neither am I.

175
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:39,895
Tell me just one thing. Have you ever,
in your life, been proposed to?

176
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,481
- "I have."
- And you let him go?

177
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:46,026
No, I didn't let him go.
I watched him get scared off.

178
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:50,155
Hmm, he came to call on me,
and then he met my father.

179
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,908
Then he didn't come calling
on me anymore.

180
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:58,580
Speaking of your father, when's
that august personage coming home?

181
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,416
Tomorrow,
and the forecast...

182
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,752
<i>is storm and thunder.</i>

183
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:07,422
Well, you come on over
to my house for supper.

184
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:09,424
Alan's been askin'
about you.

185
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,427
He's sick in bed,
bein' fed milk puddin'...

186
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,846
all dreamy with temperature.

187
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,766
Thoroughly enjoying himself.

188
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:23,397
I'd give something to know what goes on
in my brother's temperature dreams.

189
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,274
I know what goes on
in mine.

190
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:33,198
Uh, don't swivel around.

191
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:36,702
There's someone comin'.
Someone young.

192
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:40,455
It's probably
a sewing machine salesman.

193
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:44,793
Yes, well, even if it is, don't say no
right off. Let's at least talk.

194
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:52,259
Morning, ladies.
Fine, warm day, isn't it?

195
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:55,137
Yes, indeed.
Pretty as a picture.

196
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,974
My, my. You all look like
two butterflies lit out on the grass.

197
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,976
Hello again, Miss Clara.

198
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,438
If it's work you're looking for,
you can see the foreman at the gin.

199
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:07,524
If it's food, they'll take care of you
'round the back door.

200
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,110
Well, now, you hadn't
hit on it yet, lady.

201
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:12,696
What I'd like to see now
is the man of the house.

202
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:17,159
Lucius?

203
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,041
<i>What is it, Miss Clara?</i>

204
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:28,336
Would you tell Mr. Jody there's a person
waiting to see him, please?

205
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:31,089
You could have said
"gentleman."

206
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,675
Same amount of wind.

207
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,808
Where did you find him?

208
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,686
Out on the road.
I gave him a lift this mornin'.

209
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,481
Why did you have to go
and be so unfriendly?

210
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,067
Agnes, the last, desperate
resort is strangers.

211
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,028
- We haven't come to that yet.
- Oh, haven't we just.

212
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,573
Clara, you want to hear
a cold, clinical fact?

213
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,159
Every single girl we went
to normal school with...

214
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:02,746
is married and pregnant
or about to be...

215
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,374
while I'm residing
with my mother and brother...

216
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:09,920
and you're still occupyin' the bedroom
you had when you was 13.

217
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,005
I don't know
about you, Clara.

218
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:14,841
I know what's
making me nervous.

219
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:17,594
Well, don't throw in
the towel yet, Agnes dear.

220
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,931
Those tranquilizers
may see us through yet.

221
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,434
- You Varner?
- Yeah, I'm one Varner.

222
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:28,480
Hey, turn that thing off, Eula!

223
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,441
What can I do for you?

224
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:35,445
My name's Quick.
I heard you had a farm to rent.

225
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,827
Hey, Eula. Do you hear me? I'm gonna
come up there and kick that thing in!

226
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,331
I'll tell you.

227
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:50,335
- How much family you got, boy?
- You're looking at it.

228
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:53,130
Well, a man usually puts six,
seven hands in the field.

229
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,465
Well, one's all
you'll get from me.

230
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,802
<i>Jody, you've got the store
to talk business in.</i>

231
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,346
For heaven's sakes!
It's our passenger!

232
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,390
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Hello yourself.

233
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,809
- Here now. You two know each other?
- Uh-huh.

234
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,811
How come?

235
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,481
The how come is Clara and I obliged him
with a ride when his car broke down.

236
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:15,569
Well, we're talkin' business.
Come on now. Come on now!

237
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,116
How much rent
you able to pay, boy?

238
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:25,996
- How much rent you aimin' to rent for?
- Oh, half your crop.

239
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,666
You furnish out
of my store.

240
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,668
No cash?

241
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,920
Mm-hmm.

242
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:37,924
That's food and tobacco at your prices.
That makes a dollar worth about six bits.

243
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,010
Take it or leave it.

244
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,181
I'll take it.

245
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:59,029
"Jody.!"

246
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:13,877
Mister, you sure do leave
your calling card.

247
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:37,109
Summertime,
when the livin' is easy.

248
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:39,528
No, thank you.

249
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,531
When are you gonna
start workin'?

250
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,742
Lady, I never move
and work in the same day.

251
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,621
Mr. Quick, my daddy's
coming home tomorrow.

252
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:53,542
He sets quite a store by this rug.
You tracked it, you clean it.

253
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,294
That's a lot of fuss to be makin'
about a rug, lady.

254
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:58,714
If it's the rug
that's botherin' ya.

255
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,091
What else would it be?

256
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:07,973
You correct me if I'm wrong,
but I have the feeling I rile you.

257
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,600
I mean, me being so mean
and dirty and all.

258
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:14,604
You're being personal with me.
I'll be personal with you.

259
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,691
I've spent my whole life around men
who push and shove and shout...

260
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,569
and think they can make anything
happen just by bein' aggressive.

261
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,113
I'm not anxious to have
another one around the place.

262
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:27,784
Miss Clara, you slam a door in a man's
face 'fore he even knocks on it.

263
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,997
Would you have the rug
at the house by 6:00, please?

264
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:39,755
Thank you.

265
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,758
Don't swallow
the seeds.

266
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:59,566
Ernest! Sam! Orville! Marty!
You behavin' yourself?

267
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,194
"I'm back.!"

268
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,002
- Varner's home.
- He don't look very peaked.

269
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,381
Anybody know what they cut
out of him in that hospital?

270
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,133
You all can bet
it wasn't his pocketbook.

271
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:35,519
- Is that you, Will Varner?
- "Come closer if you got any doubts."

272
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,355
This is more
like the land of the livin'!

273
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,982
I'm glad you made it home,
you old piece of beef!

274
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,860
You're gettin' a little fatter, Minnie,
and a little blonder.

275
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,488
And how 'bout you? I understand
they cut and stitched you up.

276
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:48,990
Is there anything left
of you worth havin'?

277
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:52,994
Put 18 cans of beer on ice and wait
and see. I'm comin' back, Minnie.

278
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,789
Later.

279
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:02,337
- My white hairs kinda had you fooled, huh?
- Yes, sir.

280
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:06,258
Drive on!

281
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,148
Welcome, Mr. Will.

282
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,316
- Yeah!
- Welcome to your home.

283
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:26,153
Here I am, back in your
capable hands again, Lucius.

284
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:28,822
- Back where I belong.
- Hi, Daddy Varner!

285
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:32,868
- Eula gal, ain't you dressed up to beat hell!
- In honor of you.

286
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,454
That's good.

287
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:40,208
Three months I ain't smelled nothin'
but the starch of nurses' uniforms.

288
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,210
That's what I like.

289
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:46,256
There's bones there, but the bones
is covered up with plenty of real woman.

290
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,842
I was hopin' there'd be
a little more of you.

291
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,720
Isn't it about time you was fixin'
yourself maternity dresses, Eula gal?

292
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:54,181
<i>You're embarrassin'me,
Daddy Varner.</i>

293
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,183
Hello, Papa.

294
00:21:56,224 --> 00:22:00,687
<i>Well, well, well. There's a fulsome
greeting. There's a hallelujah chorus.</i>

295
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,731
Not dancin' in the streets...

296
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:06,943
not an only son exactly pining
his heart away for his daddy...

297
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,945
but simple and direct.

298
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,947
He said hello, didn't he?

299
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,742
Suppose we could get through the
opening ceremonies without civil war?

300
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:17,245
- I'll be coming to you later, sister.
- I know you will, Papa.

301
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,123
Jody's been an absolute livin' doll
while you've been gone.

302
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,125
I'd call that
a fine recommendation...

303
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,128
'cept I already had me a look
around town before I come here.

304
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:28,382
What's happened? We gone
out of business, huh? We retired?

305
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,675
We livin'
off of income?

306
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,428
What do I see in town? Two
dead-asleep clerks watchin' the store.

307
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,430
And no gin goin'
at all!

308
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,100
Things may have slacked off
a little bit today, Papa...

309
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,435
because I was home
seein' to your arrival.

310
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,605
<i>But we done all right.
You can look at the books if you'd like.</i>

311
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:47,484
Well, now...
I intend to.

312
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,571
I'm gonna crawl over them books
like an old fly over flypaper.

313
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:54,157
You better bring me
another, Lucius.

314
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:56,368
Yes, sir,
I'm my old self again.

315
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:59,621
Them doctors down atJefferson,
they gutted me...

316
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:02,624
and took away just about every organ
they thought I could spare.

317
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,876
They didn't pare my spirit
down none.

318
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,923
Thank you, Jody, for your
kindly inquiries as to my health.

319
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,136
Next!

320
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,972
All right, sister.

321
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:19,683
You're on.

322
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,227
What do you want
to know, Papa?

323
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,479
You still fixin'
to get yourself known...

324
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:27,858
as the best-lookin', richest old maid
in the county...

325
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,860
or you seen
any young people lately?

326
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,862
Any young people
seen you?

327
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,489
Been to any parties, picnics,
barbecues, church bazaars?

328
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,533
Have you mingled?
Have you mixed?

329
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,911
Or have you kept yourself up in that room
all this time readin' them poetry books?

330
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:43,165
I hope this doesn't come as a shock
to your nervous system, Papa...

331
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,584
but when you're away,
I do what I please.

332
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,503
Well, I'm back!

333
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,547
Welcome home.

334
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:55,385
Lucius!

335
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:32,297
When are you gonna give me
my due respect in front of my wife?

336
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:34,257
I've got a business too,
Jody.

337
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,552
I've got a little respect
for that.

338
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:39,554
I know you wasn't...

339
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:42,682
You and me just don't
talk the same language.

340
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,020
That's what gives us
our aches and our pains.

341
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,023
<i>"Now me"..."all the time"
I was in the hospital...</i>

342
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:53,652
I didn't just lay there.
I was busy.

343
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:58,198
Yes, I wheeled and dealed.
That's what I done, boy. What about you?

344
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,617
- May wasn't so good.
- Oh.

345
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,828
ButJune and July
made up for it.

346
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,830
That's to be expected.

347
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,749
- I moved all our heavy farm equipment.
- Oh, yeah?

348
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,085
We're fresh out
of inventory.

349
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:12,587
- Including that old tractor?
- That's right.

350
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:15,173
- The one that don't go uphill?
- Includin' that.

351
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:17,175
Good.

352
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,928
<i>I rented off that tenant farm
nobody 'round here would have.</i>

353
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,682
And a fella come down here
from Boston, Massachusetts.

354
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:27,602
He bought a lot of land
and built this big fence around it...

355
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:29,604
and started a goat ranch.

356
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:32,315
Only he plumb ran out of goats...

357
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,317
and it went bust.

358
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,319
- "Yeah?"
- Yeah.

359
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:40,365
<i>So, Papa, now you got 2,000 acres more
of good grassland.</i>

360
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:45,287
Well, seems like you ain't been sittin'
on your spine altogether.

361
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:48,373
- How'd you rent that farm off?
- On shares.

362
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:51,960
- "Profitable?"
- I had a little trouble with the man.

363
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:54,963
What's the name
of this poor unfortunate?

364
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,132
A fellow name of Quick.

365
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:02,679
Quick? Ben Quick?

366
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,182
Yeah, yeah,
from out west.

367
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,185
You knucklehead fool!

368
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,146
You empty-headed yokel!

369
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:14,566
- What are you calling me names for?
- "Quick.!"

370
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,277
Don't you keep abreast
of anything except Eula?

371
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,406
Don't you know what Quick means
in this county? Hellfire!

372
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,784
Ashes and char!

373
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:27,204
Flame follows that man
around like a dog!

374
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,539
He's a barn burner.

375
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:33,126
- I never do anything right. Do I?
- Not to my immediate recollection!

376
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,837
You want to hear something?
I sweat around you.

377
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:39,174
All those months you were away
in the hospital, I was dry.

378
00:26:39,216 --> 00:26:41,176
Now I'm sweatin' again.

379
00:26:41,218 --> 00:26:43,929
I ain't got time
for your personal troubles.

380
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:48,058
You started something with
Mr. Ben Quick, and I got to finish it...

381
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:51,019
before this house of mine
goes up in smoke!

382
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:08,495
I'm Varner.

383
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,831
Yeah, I already met
one Varner.

384
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:12,874
I'm the other.

385
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:17,379
Just driving by. Thought I'd stop
and see if you got any plans.

386
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:20,090
That cabin ain't fit for hogs...

387
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,759
but I can get along with it.

388
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,220
<i>Well, we can
talk that over.</i>

389
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:29,266
Way I hear it, you're a boy that gets
into trouble with your landlords.

390
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,310
The kind of trouble that might need
the help of the fire department.

391
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:37,065
If you scared of me, mister, why don't
you just come right out and say so?

392
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:39,067
Huh!

393
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:41,778
Son, why should I
be scared of you?

394
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:47,534
'Cause I got a reputation
for being a dangerous man.

395
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,996
Hmm.

396
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,790
You're a young,
dangerous man.

397
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:58,170
I'm an old one.

398
00:27:58,253 --> 00:28:01,131
You don't know who I am.
I better introduce myself.

399
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:05,010
I'm the big landowner
and chief moneylender in these parts.

400
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:08,638
I'm commissioner of elections
and veterinarian.

401
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:11,099
<i>I own the store
and the cotton gin...</i>

402
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:13,435
<i>and the grist mill,
the blacksmith shop.</i>

403
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:16,688
<i>It's considered unlucky for a man
to do his tradin'or gin his cotton...</i>

404
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:20,776
or grind his meal or shoe his stock...
anywhere else.

405
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,861
Now, that's who I am.

406
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,072
You talk a lot.

407
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:27,491
Yes, I do, son.

408
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,659
But I'm done
talkin' to you...

409
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,704
except for passing you on
this piece of information.

410
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:36,375
I built me a new jail
in my courthouse this year...

411
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,920
<i>and if during the course of your stay
here something, anything at all...</i>

412
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,963
<i>should happen to catch fire...</i>

413
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:45,550
I think you oughta know
that in my jail...

414
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:49,554
we never heard of the words
"habeas corpus."

415
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,640
You'd rot.

416
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:56,812
Well, a smart man,
he'd give me a job.

417
00:28:56,895 --> 00:29:00,649
- You're already working for me.
- None of this weed-scratching.

418
00:29:00,732 --> 00:29:04,861
I'm talkin' about a job
that'll give me a white shirt...

419
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,656
and a black tie
and three squares.

420
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:11,576
You've got a place in your store and
several other spots where you could use me.

421
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,122
You'd be writing yourself a fire
insurance policy into the bargain.

422
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,165
I'll give it some thought.

423
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,876
Yes or no, mister.
Ain't no in-between.

424
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,672
- You're mighty bushy-tailed for
a beginner. - "I'm in a hurry."

425
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:27,843
You're wasting your time.
The job at the top's already taken.

426
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:32,180
- But like you said, you're an old man.
- I am that.

427
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:34,266
You bear that in mind.

428
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,935
Be respectful.

429
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:40,689
Yes, sir, Mr. Varner.
Now, just who do I have to kill?

430
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:45,694
Well, we won't start
right off with murder.

431
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:49,948
Happens I just got handed me
30 Texas horses on a foreclosure.

432
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,617
You get rid of them for me
at a reasonable profit...

433
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,661
and we're in business.

434
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:12,471
Well, there's a cool breeze
from the river, Alan.

435
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,182
Everything nice comes
with you, Clara...

436
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:18,977
hot broth, cool breeze
from the river.

437
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,979
How's your school?

438
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:24,024
You mean that free-for-all
I run in town?

439
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:27,652
Those 35 hellions who are making
their last stand against me?

440
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:31,281
- I wouldn't say it was
a summer on the Riviera.

441
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,159
Well, it's unnatural to keep kids
in school in the summertime.

442
00:30:34,242 --> 00:30:36,661
In the winter they gotta
help work on the crops.

443
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,206
Somewhere along the line,
they gotta learn to read and write.

444
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,208
Besides, who knows?

445
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:46,088
I don't have much hope, but maybe I have
a young painter or poet cooped up there.

446
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:51,009
Oh, Alan,
I love this place.

447
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:55,764
Grace, dignity,
beautiful things left undisturbed.

448
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:58,517
Just the way they were
a hundred years ago.

449
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,437
Most people say
I'm fighting the 20th century.

450
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,981
I suppose I oughta
sell this place...

451
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,901
put it to corn and cotton,
go get a job like everybody else...

452
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:09,986
but I wouldn't be
any good at it.

453
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,823
- I'd hate it and make a mess of it.
- Then don't do it.

454
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,909
There are enough hustlers around here
as is. You stand for something.

455
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:20,580
- You hold on to it.
- Your father refers to me as decayed gentry.

456
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:24,459
That's because
he is pea green with envy.

457
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:28,797
You listen here. He would
give anything to have what you have.

458
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,883
Wouldn't he just love to have
your shine and polish?

459
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:36,012
He can put up all those billboards
and neon signs and fillin' stations...

460
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:38,974
but quality is one thing
he can't buy, and he knows it.

461
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:40,976
He has quality, Clara...

462
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:42,978
in you.

463
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:49,192
That's what I came through
this dusty summer day to hear.

464
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:51,611
I want you to be hale
and hearty again.

465
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:55,991
I want you to be your courtly, gallant
self again and come callin' on me.

466
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,702
- Very soon, ma'am.
- Well, you better.

467
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:01,788
Girls get all fidgety and looked at
sideways and talked about...

468
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,791
- when they don't have
their gentlemen callers.

469
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,669
Besides, I've missed you.

470
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,840
That boy's temperature
has been a-hoverin'...

471
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:13,925
between 100 and 100 and two-tenths
for three days...

472
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,803
so none of that now.

473
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:19,890
- I just brought over some of Lucius's broth.
- Oh!

474
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,601
He won't eat a bite
I don't cook.

475
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:27,105
I'm gonna hustle you right along,
'cause it's way past son's nap time.

476
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:32,903
All right, Miss Stewart.
I'll give up the field for now.

477
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:36,823
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Alan.

478
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,825
Good-bye, Clara.

479
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:55,675
- Why, you old crook, you.
- Hmm.

480
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:58,720
- Them's horses out of hell.
- That's right.

481
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:02,307
Them ponies never had a rope on 'em.
You didn't tell me they was wild.

482
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:04,518
Well, you knowin' that,
uh...

483
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,021
kinda gives you the edge
over everybody else, huh?

484
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:27,457
<i>Minnie Littlejohn...</i>

485
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,210
I'm gettin' thirsty
again.

486
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:33,130
Since when you been
in the horseflesh business?

487
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:38,135
Ain't no kind of business. What you're
watching is a plain old-fashioned swindle.

488
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:41,596
So, of course,
I ain't involved in it directly.

489
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,975
- You hired that boy to fleece 'em?
- I hired that boy...

490
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:48,687
Tell you the truth, I don't know why
I hired him, but I aim to find out.

491
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,356
Okay, come on now.
Let's gather 'round in here, folks.

492
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,860
Come on. Let's move in here.
John, come on now.

493
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:57,446
<i>Bring your whole family down.
I don't wanna strain my tonsils.</i>

494
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,531
<i>Let's go. We gonna get goin'.</i>

495
00:33:59,614 --> 00:34:02,284
Mr. Armistead, I heard what you
had to say about them horses.

496
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:05,871
I wouldn't hesitate to put my own sister
on one of'em if I had a sister.

497
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:07,873
You there.
Now, Miss Clara?

498
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:12,127
<i>How'd you like to be the proud owner
of one of them handsome-lookin'horses?</i>

499
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,213
I can see you've got "no" written
all over your face, but wait.

500
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:17,799
You stop and think a minute.

501
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:22,512
You can pack yourself a picnic basket
and follow some woodsy trail.

502
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:26,808
<i>You can ride off steam and bad temper
if you happen to be afflicted that way.</i>

503
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,811
If you see a young fellow along the way
who happens to take your eye...

504
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:33,648
- you can put him behind you
and ride double.

505
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:37,486
<i>Uh, what's your answer,
Miss Clara?</i>

506
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:41,531
You were right the first time.
I got "no" written all over my face.

507
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:44,493
That don't bother me none at all.

508
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:48,622
- A lot of women say "no" when they mean "yes."
- That's for sure!

509
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:50,665
I ain't foolin'
about these horses.

510
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:54,753
The man that buys one of these will get the
best horseflesh he ever drove for the money.

511
00:34:54,836 --> 00:34:58,340
Naturally they got spirit. I ain't sellin'
no crow bait. Who's gonna start with a bid?

512
00:34:58,423 --> 00:35:02,427
Tell you what I'll do. I'll give you
ten dollars for that there fiddlehead.

513
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:06,765
Ten dollars? You couldn't buy
that much dynamite for ten dollars!

514
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:09,601
There isn't a horse in there
can't run a mile in three minutes.

515
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:12,229
You put 'em out to pasture,
they're gonna board themselves.

516
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:15,107
Work 'em all day long,
and every time you think about it.

517
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,859
Pretty soon every one of them
gonna be so tame...

518
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:20,946
you'll have to put 'em out of the house
at night like a cat.

519
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:26,201
<i>- Buzz!
- " Who's gonna" start it off with a bid?</i>

520
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,913
- Minnie, what are you doin'?
- Buzz!

521
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:33,458
I got a hum in my blood,
and I feel as if I'd swallowed a bee.

522
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,295
You swallowed five bottles of beer in
the hot sun. That's what you swallowed.

523
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:40,882
- Who's gonna give me $40 for that horse?
- Ten dollars, take it or leave it.

524
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:42,884
- Eleven.
- That's the way, Pa.

525
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:44,886
- Shut up, son.
- " Thirteen."

526
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,140
- Wait a minute. What are you doin'?
- Fifteen.

527
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:51,601
Fifteen dollars. I got fifteen dollars
bid on that fiddlehead horse.

528
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,603
Who's gonna make it 20?

529
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,981
Kiss me, Will.

530
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,818
I got a number
of friends...

531
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,571
and, uh,
associates here.

532
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:05,574
I'm your friend. I'm your associate.
I have been for ten years.

533
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:07,576
Then what's the matter?

534
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:11,121
Will, all this time,
this summer...

535
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:14,958
all I've done is put up
22 jars of piccalilli...

536
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:18,420
and I put down a corn beef
in a crock.

537
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:20,547
And I say to myself...

538
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,592
"Minnie, where is it all
gonna end?"

539
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:27,763
It's gonna end with me eatin'
a corn beef. You know I'm partial to it.

540
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:32,100
At midnight suppers after you've
come sneakin' up the back stairs.

541
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:35,479
I want to serve it to you
right here at 6:00.

542
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:37,773
- Minnie.
- "Forty dollars."

543
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:40,275
What are you tryin'
to say?

544
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,778
I made plans, Will.

545
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:44,362
Matrimonial plans.

546
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:45,906
Matrimonial plans.

547
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:50,452
Now, you ain't ever heard me
say the word..."matrimony."

548
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:53,413
<i>Now, I'm willin'
to overlook that.</i>

549
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:56,291
- You know my married sister
in Tallahassee? - "Uh-huh."

550
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,628
Well, she's makin' me up
some hand-crocheted sheets.

551
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,882
And I've sent away for some flatware
with the initial "V" on it.

552
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:07,010
Minnie...

553
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:10,764
I'm 61 years old.

554
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:15,727
Look, honey, it's no good
you tryin' to tell me you're too old.

555
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:19,231
I happen to be in a position
to deny it.

556
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,984
Hmm.

557
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:26,405
Just hand it over here. Thank you,
thank you. Twenty-two dollars from you.

558
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:29,282
Twenty-five from you. Thirty-two
from you, and thirty from you.

559
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:31,284
Thank you,
gentlemen.

560
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:35,288
Don't forget 'bout bangin' them horses
over the head till they get used to you.

561
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:38,333
- They won't give you any trouble.
- That's all there is to it?

562
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,335
- That's it.
- They belong to us now?

563
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:45,048
Yeah. Get yourself a rope and go on in
there and take the horse that belongs to you.

564
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,968
All right, we'll need some rope.
Come on, Joe.

565
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:55,475
You're not much of a prospect,
Miss Clara.

566
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:58,645
You don't need my money.
You've got everybody else's.

567
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,106
Yeah, but it's the holdout
that challenges me.

568
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,108
I'll tell you, Mr. Quick.

569
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:06,778
The last time I parted with my money
to a pitchman, I was 12 years old.

570
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:09,614
- And nobody's ever taken you since.
- Nope.

571
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:11,616
Nobody ever will.

572
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,828
Well, life's very long
and full of salesmanship, Miss Clara.

573
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:17,622
You might
buy somethin' yet.

574
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:27,382
Here they come!
Look out!

575
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,607
Oh!

576
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,236
That's a musical horse.

577
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:53,700
Here, don't you bring
your filthy feet in here!

578
00:38:57,037 --> 00:39:00,707
They'll go on all night
tryin' to catch them rabbits.

579
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:06,171
Boy, you got something
belongs to me.

580
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:08,924
You ain't no better
than a crook.

581
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,511
Well, you ain't nothin' better
than a con man.

582
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:14,554
You sell
my crooked merchandise.

583
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:18,058
Never mind the name-calling.
Now, where's my share?

584
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,602
I got somethin'
for you, boy.

585
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:23,855
Come on.

586
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:30,237
- Whoa, you!
- Head 'em off! Head 'em off!

587
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:35,951
Whoa!

588
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:39,079
<i>Ah, you wild-eyed
stallion, you.!</i>

589
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:57,973
The man that built this place,
his name's forgotten.

590
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:02,978
This was his dream
and his pride.

591
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:06,314
Now it's dust.

592
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,650
Must be a moral
there somewhere.

593
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:11,153
- Looks like that's about all there is.
- I don't know.

594
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:13,155
They got a legend
about this place.

595
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:16,158
They do say there's money buried
around here on the grounds...

596
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:19,161
at the time Grant overrun the country
on the way to Vicksburg.

597
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:22,164
- What's that got to do with me?
- I been watching you.

598
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:25,000
I like your push.

599
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:28,795
Yes, I like your style.
I like your brass.

600
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,840
It ain't too dissimilar
from the way I operate.

601
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:34,676
You've been here a few days,
you've gone up an inch.

602
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:36,678
That's 'cause you
listen to me.

603
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,307
You go on listenin' to me, and someday,
in a wild burst of generosity...

604
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,185
I might just make you a present
of this place.

605
00:40:43,226 --> 00:40:45,687
Thank you for nothing.
It's falling apart.

606
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:48,690
You're a shrewd boy.

607
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:51,526
You'll find a way
of gettin' some good out of it.

608
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:55,781
Mister. You've been makin' me
a lot of promises.

609
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:58,200
- One of these days I'm gonna collect on 'em.
- Surely.

610
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,702
I just ain't passin'
the time of day with you.

611
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:03,288
I'm aware of that.

612
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,836
Come to supper with me, boy,
at the big house.

613
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,341
You ornery critter!

614
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:19,805
There goes another one
on the creek bridge.

615
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:22,849
Could be, you know,
them poor unfortunates...

616
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:25,602
could come out ahead
on the deal after all...

617
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:28,313
get their money's worth
in health and outdoor exercise.

618
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:32,734
A night like this is good for him.
It stimulates his liver.

619
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:35,904
<i>Oh, they'll catch
those horses, Mr. Varner.</i>

620
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,448
They'll catch them and make
good work teams out of them.

621
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:42,619
You figure you know them redneck farmers
better than me, huh?

622
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:48,291
Suppose that's 'cause
the, uh, Stewart family's...

623
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,877
<i>been in these parts a little longer
than the Varners.</i>

624
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,921
About 200 years.

625
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:55,090
That's a long time
to live in one place.

626
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:57,759
You don't believe
in living in one place, Mr. Quick?

627
00:41:57,843 --> 00:42:00,679
Well, my family moved.
Not that they wanted to.

628
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:03,348
They was encouraged
by the local citizens.

629
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:07,561
- You a hunted man or somethin'?
- Somethin', Miss Eula.

630
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:11,023
I'd like to hear
a yes or no answer to that, boy.

631
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:13,275
<i>Well, ifhe's hunted...</i>

632
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,277
<i>he ain't caught.</i>

633
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,947
Lucius, pass the drinks. Who's for
drinkin' some of my fine brandy, huh?

634
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:21,575
Alan, you're partial
to my brandy.

635
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:24,953
Let's see. How many years
you been drinkin' it now, huh?

636
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,955
Five? Six?

637
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,958
- I've enjoyed your hospitality
a long time, Mr. Varner.

638
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,587
I sometimes ask myself, do we get
the major part of your attention...

639
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:37,007
or are you brightenin' up
other parlors around the county?

640
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,093
That's Alan's
personal business, Papa.

641
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:42,137
Don't get yourself fussed,
sister.

642
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,182
Alan knows a friendly inquiry
when he hears it, don't you, Alan?

643
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:47,893
- When I hear one.
- Sure, sure!

644
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:51,104
A friendly inquiry
never bothered nobody.

645
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:54,232
As I understand it,
when you ain't here with us...

646
00:42:54,316 --> 00:42:58,195
you keep pretty close to your house,
uh, with your mother.

647
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,781
Papa, I can't stand this.

648
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:03,825
<i>I think you've forgotten, Mr. Varner,
that my mother is a widow.</i>

649
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,661
- She relies strongly on me.
- Widow?

650
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:09,790
Your old man ain't dead.
He just disappeared.

651
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:12,584
Just wandered off.

652
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,462
- The end result is the same. She's alone.
- No, she ain't, Alan.

653
00:43:15,504 --> 00:43:17,547
She's got you.

654
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,716
She sure has you.

655
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,677
- I do my best.
- Not around here, you don't!

656
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:29,518
<i>Jody, you seem to enjoy
my conversation tonight.</i>

657
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:32,187
- Guess I'll direct a little bit at you.
- "I didn't say nothin'."

658
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,189
You see Ben Quick here?

659
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:37,776
<i>He's goin'to work tomorrow in the store
as a clerk right alongside of you.</i>

660
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:42,072
<i>He's going to receive the same
identical wages, the same benefits.</i>

661
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:46,702
That don't seem to strike you
as quite so funny.

662
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:50,455
It don't.

663
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:53,333
What I mean to say is, Jody,
with Ben around...

664
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,544
you can sleep late mornings.

665
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:58,130
That is, as late as you figure
you can afford to.

666
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:04,094
Outside, everybody!

667
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:07,139
Take the evenin' air.

668
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:25,407
Alan, I apologize
for what we are.

669
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,534
Don't, Clara.
It isn't necessary.

670
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:30,120
I wouldn't blame you
if you left right now.

671
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,622
Other young men have
with much less cause than this.

672
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:36,168
My people have stood off Indians,
Yankees, carpetbaggers.

673
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:40,505
The least they could expect of me
is to stand up to a Varner.

674
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:44,217
All right then.
Let's go have some more.

675
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,973
"Eula.! Eu-ooh-la.!"

676
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:51,975
Oh, listen to that.

677
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:56,104
If those boys don't sound like
a bunch of tomcats yowling at the moon.

678
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:58,857
<i>Eula.! Eula.!</i>

679
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,985
Isn't it terrible the way they come
prowlin' around here every night?

680
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,905
It's like that in town too.
They follow me wherever I go.

681
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:07,866
- Don't go anywhere then. You stay put.
- Oh, now.

682
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:10,369
- You stay right close to home.
- Jody, they're harmless.

683
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:13,580
- They're only 16, 17 years old.
- You call that harmless?

684
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:17,501
- "Eula.!"
- "Hey, Eula.!"

685
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:21,046
You quit it out there,
or I'll pass among you with a shotgun!

686
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:23,632
"Hey, Eula, come out.!"

687
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:26,426
- "Eula.! Come on out.!"
- "Come on out, Eula.!"

688
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:29,304
- Come on, Eula. Get out of the light!
- Oh!

689
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:33,141
They don't have to see her.
They can smell her.

690
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:35,477
- "Eula.!"
- "Eula.!"

691
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,397
Tom Shortly, V.K. Bookwright,
John Fischer!

692
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,816
Now, I know it's you out there!
Now, quit it!

693
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:44,027
- "Eula.!"
- Would somebody please make them stop?

694
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:47,239
- Just wait. I'll stop 'em.
- "Eula.! Eula.!"

695
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:49,241
It's a madhouse
around here.

696
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:54,371
They're just young boys.
Healthy, young animals.

697
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:57,916
How come they don't come to anybody else's
house, hide in anybody else's garden?

698
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:01,878
- It's just us that gets singled out.
- We're the ones that got Eula.

699
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,214
It's not her fault.
It's yours.

700
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:07,759
They come here 'cause they know you're
gonna laugh, you're gonna think it's funny...

701
00:46:07,843 --> 00:46:10,178
no matter how crude
and how vulgar!

702
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,306
I was young myself once.

703
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:18,061
I used to hide in the greenery
and hoot and bellow.

704
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:22,232
I'll bet you did. I'll bet you
stayed longest and yelled loudest.

705
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:25,736
Your mama listened.

706
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,959
Blackjack!

707
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,548
All right.

708
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,551
Now let's deal 'em
off the top.

709
00:46:49,593 --> 00:46:51,762
Huh.

710
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:57,392
Is that the way you acquired your
fortune? The way you're acquiring mine?

711
00:47:07,235 --> 00:47:11,406
Those boys sure do make
their desires plain, don't they?

712
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,078
Callin' and callin', just like they thought
Eula was gonna get up and follow 'em.

713
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:18,580
Wonder what would happen
if she did.

714
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:21,083
I imagine there'd
be quite a romp.

715
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:25,045
Now, why did I make
such a fuss about it?

716
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:27,881
Because
it offended you?

717
00:47:27,923 --> 00:47:30,050
No, it didn't.

718
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:33,095
Now that's the plain,
unvarnished truth at last.

719
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:37,265
No, Alan, there's no sense in pretendin'
that girls don't think about sex.

720
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:39,309
They do.

721
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:42,270
You oughta hear some of the
conversations between Agnes and me.

722
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:44,272
Uh, I'd like to.

723
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:48,777
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being anxious about your love life.

724
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,862
I am about mine.

725
00:47:56,702 --> 00:48:01,123
This is certainly not the way I expected
this conversation to be going.

726
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:05,085
I thought we were gonna sit here on the front
porch and let the moon shine down on us...

727
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:08,630
and, just like those boys in the bushes,
let nature take its course.

728
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:11,883
Why, Clara, nature
is taking its course.

729
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:16,513
You're not the kind of girl to be howled at
and dragged off the porch into the bushes.

730
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:19,474
You're a nice, quiet,
self-contained girl.

731
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:23,478
You'll see. Everything you want's
gonna happen to you.

732
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:32,404
Oh, evening, Alice.

733
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:34,990
You want to see me?

734
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:37,784
Miss Minnie Littlejohn
say, "Where are you?"

735
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:39,828
Oh.

736
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,164
- Where I am, huh?
- Yes, sir.

737
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:46,293
She say if you're not there in half an hour,
the place'll be triple locked against you.

738
00:48:46,376 --> 00:48:49,129
Triple locked, huh?

739
00:48:49,171 --> 00:48:52,507
You tell Miss Minnie Littlejohn
I'll be there...

740
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:54,509
when I'm there.

741
00:48:54,593 --> 00:48:56,595
I'll tell her.

742
00:48:57,846 --> 00:49:01,183
It appears
I have a late date.

743
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:05,395
Are you married?
You got a woman somewhere?

744
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,106
I live single.

745
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,150
Hmm.

746
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:12,194
You've known a few
though, huh?

747
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,655
Yeah. My fair share.

748
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:17,741
Deal.

749
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,704
Well, your friend left early,
without even firing a shot.

750
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:06,123
I was kissed good night,
Mr. Quick.

751
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,126
Kissed and left. That'd been me,
I'd have stayed till sunup.

752
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:11,128
- Aren't you reckless.
- Aren't you?

753
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:14,131
No, I'm just skittish, Mr. Quick.
Just plain skittish.

754
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:16,133
I have an answer for that.

755
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:19,845
Let's go get in that old Lincoln car
of yours and go plow up the countryside.

756
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:22,305
Let's go holler off a bridge
good and loud.

757
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:26,518
- There's been enough commotion tonight.
- You want quiet?

758
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:28,979
Let's go find us
a needle in a haystack.

759
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:31,481
Mr. Quick, those are all
lovely, colorful suggestions...

760
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:34,067
but I'm afraid if I
started out to follow you...

761
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:36,862
I would hear the starch
in my petticoat begin to rustle...

762
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:38,864
and I'd know
I was out of character.

763
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:41,283
Get out of character, lady.
Come on. Get way out.

764
00:50:41,366 --> 00:50:43,368
Sudden changes
are not in my line.

765
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,370
You'll never know
till you try.

766
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:48,999
There's a volume ofJane Austen
upstairs by my bed...

767
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:51,460
and a glass of hot milk
that's getting cold.

768
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:54,463
You mean your friend would not like it
if we went off together.

769
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:57,174
The idea of you and me
just wouldn't go down, would it?

770
00:50:57,257 --> 00:51:00,218
- I don't wish to discuss him with you.
- Why not? I respect him.

771
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:03,638
I admire his manners
and I admire the speeches he makes.

772
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:06,350
And I admire
the big house he lives in.

773
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,102
But if you're savin' it
all for him, honey...

774
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:12,439
you've got your account
in the wrong bank.

775
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:16,109
You can leave
any time now!

776
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:18,487
Don't ask me twice.

777
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:30,345
Sister?

778
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:37,756
Oh, you are out here.
Alone, huh?

779
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,426
When did Alan leave?

780
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,137
- About 10:00.
- Early.

781
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:46,181
Well, he's been ill.

782
00:51:46,223 --> 00:51:49,810
Yeah? You look
a little pale yourself.

783
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,396
Well, it's hot.
I haven't been sleeping very well.

784
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:54,481
How old are you,
sister?

785
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:56,525
Don't you know?

786
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:59,027
I keep a lot of figures
in my head.

787
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:01,029
Well, add these.
I'm 23.

788
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,365
Huh.

789
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:07,703
Your mama was 18 when I married her.
Just turned.

790
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:10,831
- Papa, are we gonna talk about that again?
- We are.

791
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:14,960
You know,
you never look at me.

792
00:52:15,043 --> 00:52:18,797
My life comes and goes,
my birthdays come and go.

793
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,967
Do you know I'm really quite a lively,
intelligent girl?

794
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,469
Sometimes I even
make people laugh.

795
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:27,597
Yet you and I never seem to have
any other conversation but this one.

796
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:30,934
- You're unmarried.
- You have pointed that out before.

797
00:52:31,018 --> 00:52:34,187
What do you do out here,
you and Alan, huh?

798
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:39,401
- We talk.
- What gets said? Anything important?

799
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:43,739
He thinks I'm a nice, quiet,
self-contained girl.

800
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:48,160
Well, that ain't
damn near enough!

801
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:52,122
Thousands of acres out there, millions
of seeds put down in the ground.

802
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:54,875
Every year
the seeds come up again.

803
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:58,003
Life goes on.

804
00:52:58,086 --> 00:53:00,380
Where's "my" crop, huh?

805
00:53:00,422 --> 00:53:02,424
What follows me?

806
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:04,676
<i>What happens
when I'm dead?</i>

807
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,180
You'll probably have the biggest funeral
in the state of Mississippi.

808
00:53:08,263 --> 00:53:11,391
That don't scare me, so long as
there's plenty of Varners to mourn me.

809
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:13,435
Jody and I will be there.

810
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:16,438
<i>You and Jody, and Jody's kids,
and yours, and their kids.!</i>

811
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:18,440
My descendants, sister.
A line.

812
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:22,194
A long line with my face stamped on 'em,
my blood flowing in their veins.

813
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:25,322
All of that
from the two of us?

814
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:28,075
You think I'm joking.

815
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:32,245
You listen here to me,
sister.

816
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:35,374
If your blood is so frail
and so delicate...

817
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:38,460
that it just calls out
for Alan Stewart...

818
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,962
amen, let it be him.

819
00:53:41,004 --> 00:53:44,216
I'll give you a big weddin'.
I'll build a house for you.

820
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:47,678
I'll put money in Alan's account
atJefferson First Trust Bank.

821
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,263
But it's gonna be "now,"
missy!

822
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:52,808
No more pussyfootin',
no more holdin' hands...

823
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:56,144
and squeakin' that front porch swing
back and forth.

824
00:53:56,228 --> 00:53:58,689
Six years that's all I've heard
is squeakin'.

825
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:02,693
Well, you can go and tell his mama...
to let go.

826
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:06,488
You tell her you're taking over
'cause your daddy said so.

827
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:10,617
If you should get "no" for an answer,
let me tell you, sister...

828
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:12,786
it's gonna be that other.

829
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:14,830
Which other?

830
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:18,041
That prize
blue-ribbon bull...

831
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:22,212
that hand-grown, handpicked,
hand-selected-by-me fellow name of Quick.

832
00:54:22,295 --> 00:54:24,381
- You can't mean "him."
- Can't I?

833
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:27,300
Listen, I'm gonna get me
some men in the Varner family.

834
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:29,386
Some good, strong,
strapping men.

835
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,471
Varners!
That's what I want. Varners.

836
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:33,640
And more Varners.
And more Varners still.

837
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:36,143
Enough Varners
to infest the countryside.

838
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:38,645
I'm gonna see that happen,
sister, before I die.

839
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:40,981
I'm gonna accomplish that.
Yes, ma'am.

840
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:45,736
By means of that Quick,
that big stud horse.

841
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:48,363
You mean you'd sell me away
like that?

842
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,365
- I'm not sellin' you.
- Yes, sell me!

843
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:53,869
Without caring what I feel
or what I think or what I am!

844
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,622
- I'm trying to save you.
- Is that what you call it?

845
00:54:57,706 --> 00:55:00,333
Sister...

846
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:03,378
you're gonna
give me grandsons...

847
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:07,632
by way of Alan...

848
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:10,093
or Quick.

849
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:14,056
But you're gonna do it,
Clara Ann Varner. Hear me now.

850
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,310
You'll get that ring
on your finger.

851
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:53,887
Here comes Jody.

852
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:01,645
What's goin' on?
Huh?

853
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,855
They ain't come
to do much buyin'.

854
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:07,067
Penny worth of candy,
two cents worth of nails, maybe.

855
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,361
Oh, they just come
to look.

856
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:11,363
What at?

857
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:13,532
We ain't runnin'
no sideshow.

858
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:16,076
They come to look
at the new man.

859
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:18,829
Three days ago,
never even knew his name.

860
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:21,748
But from now on, they're gonna
have to be dealing with him...

861
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,750
for all the necessaries
of livin'.

862
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:27,129
Oh, no. They're gonna
deal with me...

863
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:29,214
like always.

864
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:37,264
Good morning, Jody.

865
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,438
Mr. Jody?

866
00:56:44,479 --> 00:56:46,606
Mr. Jody.

867
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,527
My little chaps at home
never even had shoes last winter.

868
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,448
We ain't got corn
to feed the stock.

869
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:58,368
<i>Them $30 my husband paid
for that horse yesterday...</i>

870
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,455
which he ain't even seen
since then...

871
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,999
I earned myself...

872
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:06,960
sewing at night
and baking cakes.

873
00:57:07,002 --> 00:57:12,549
If that ain't the limit. You get greased
and fleeced, and then you lay it at my door?

874
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:15,135
The trouble is
we got an outsider here!

875
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:21,558
He don't know nothin', and he don't care
nothin' about you and your worries.

876
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,560
No, sir.

877
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:26,355
He don't care about anything
except advancin' himself.

878
00:57:28,315 --> 00:57:31,193
Lot of harsh things
being said about me.

879
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:34,696
And if I was to answer
each and every one of'em...

880
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:37,324
why, that'd take up
too much of your time.

881
00:57:37,407 --> 00:57:40,869
All I can say, missus, is you took
your complaint to the wrong department.

882
00:57:40,952 --> 00:57:44,998
Now, we're under new management.
You got a $30 problem?

883
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,547
It's solved.

884
00:57:58,428 --> 00:58:00,764
Goodwill. Ain't nothin'
in the world like it.

885
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:05,560
<i>You think you got
a cozy nest here, don't ya?</i>

886
00:58:05,644 --> 00:58:07,979
Well, you ain't gonna
take over from me, boy!

887
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:11,692
<i>"Off with the old,"
on with the new.</i>

888
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:14,111
<i>Same old store,
same stand.</i>

889
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:17,906
- "All we got is a new broom. Mornin'."
- "Hi, Will."

890
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:21,410
You can't teach an old dog
new tricks. Mornin'.

891
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:24,871
But you sure can teach a young
willin' puppy just about anything.

892
00:58:24,913 --> 00:58:27,874
Ben Quick,
fetch me a Coke!

893
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:31,920
Give him time. A penny on the waters
pays interest when the flood turns.

894
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:40,721
Thank you for your encouragement
and kind support.

895
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:53,859
Jody, aren't you ever
goin' to work again?

896
00:58:53,942 --> 00:58:56,194
You always gonna be
hangin' round?

897
00:58:56,278 --> 00:59:00,657
I can't do my nails or fix my hair
without havin' you hangin' round.

898
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:02,743
Now, you take
that Ben Quick.

899
00:59:02,784 --> 00:59:05,537
He's down at that store
workin', sweatin'.

900
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,539
He's where you ought to be.

901
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:09,750
Who are you
to tell me to work?

902
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:12,586
You ain't never
outta a chair.

903
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,838
Only time I seen you break cover...

904
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:19,676
is when they're sweepin', cleanin' the
house, callin' you to the dinner table.

905
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,679
Now, you got no call
to be insultin'.

906
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:25,807
As your wife, I just don't wanna see you
get passed by that boy.

907
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:36,610
- Now, Jody.
- Come on.

908
00:59:36,693 --> 00:59:38,945
- No, Jody.
- Come on.

909
00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:42,657
I'm gonna... I'm gonna busy myself
elsewheres, that's what I'm gonna do.

910
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:45,452
I'm gonna remove myself.
I know what I'll do.

911
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:47,496
- I'll get me an education.
- Come on.

912
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:51,625
Clara's been after me for months and
months, sayin' it's never too late to learn.

913
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:54,586
No, Jody. No!

914
00:59:54,669 --> 00:59:58,131
I sure do wish you'd find yourself
some other form of recreation.

915
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:18,754
Well, it's a little late
to be keepin' store, isn't it?

916
01:01:18,795 --> 01:01:22,132
No, I'm just, uh, movin' these
cotton dresses down in front...

917
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:24,426
<i>so the ladies can see 'em
when they first come in.</i>

918
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:26,428
You seem to know
a lot about women.

919
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,014
<i>Well, I know what makes 'em
spend their money.</i>

920
01:01:30,682 --> 01:01:34,269
You come in to buy somethin',
Miss Clara, or you just shoppin' around?

921
01:01:34,353 --> 01:01:37,397
I was just passin'.

922
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:40,609
Well, it's a warm night. I've been
drinkin' some beer. You want some?

923
01:01:40,692 --> 01:01:43,904
- No, thank you.
- You got a sweet tooth?

924
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:47,866
I can offer you, uh, rock candy
and licorice whips.

925
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:50,660
Jawbreakers.
Do a big business in jawbreakers.

926
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:54,331
Outgrew 'em, huh?

927
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:01,588
Well...
sunbonnets?

928
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:05,884
Or hand lotion?
Lilac water? Freckle remover?

929
01:02:07,344 --> 01:02:09,388
Spotted dimity?

930
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:13,684
Just can't sell you,
can I?

931
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,688
Well, do you have an aspirin?
I have a headache.

932
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:20,065
Oh, sure.

933
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:23,652
We got all kinds
of nostrums and remedies.

934
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:26,863
'Course, I don't
have headaches myself.

935
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:31,034
- 'Cause I don't have any problems.
- Or scruples.

936
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:34,496
Nope, not those either.

937
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:37,290
Well, I have both.

938
01:02:41,336 --> 01:02:43,547
You got a thin skin
is what you got.

939
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,426
But the world belongs
to the meat eaters, Miss Clara...

940
01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:50,637
and if you have to take it raw,
take it raw.

941
01:02:52,347 --> 01:02:54,641
I couldn't live
that way.

942
01:02:56,018 --> 01:02:59,229
Well, let's just examine
the way you do live, Miss Clara.

943
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:03,275
You drive around in that old Lincoln
car of yours like it had wings...

944
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:06,319
and you teach school,
and, uh...

945
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:10,866
you sit on your front porch with your
skinny little friend drinkin' lemonade.

946
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:13,535
Now, what is all that,
when you see the rest of the world...

947
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:15,620
passing you by
paired up?

948
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:19,207
You're, what, 23?

949
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,002
Yeah, thems are
golden years...

950
01:03:22,085 --> 01:03:24,588
and you're bein' asked
to play a waitin' game.

951
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,674
Why wait?

952
01:03:31,678 --> 01:03:33,680
Aw, school is out,
Miss Clara.

953
01:03:35,515 --> 01:03:37,809
Them blinds are drawn,
night's fallen.

954
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:41,313
Nobody here to see
if you make a mistake.

955
01:03:44,274 --> 01:03:47,361
You put them things down,
Miss Clara, 'cause I'm gonna kiss you.

956
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:51,573
I'm gonna show you
how simple it is.

957
01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:53,700
You please me,
and I'll please you.

958
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:59,956
Oh, I know
what's troublin' you.

959
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,752
It's all those boys
hollerin' for Eula every night.

960
01:04:03,835 --> 01:04:06,963
And Eula with her hair
hangin' down...

961
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:10,550
and Jody with his shirt off,
chasin' her.

962
01:04:10,592 --> 01:04:13,053
And your old man
at 60...

963
01:04:13,095 --> 01:04:15,347
and he's callin' on
his lady love.

964
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:44,751
All right. You proved it.
I'm human.

965
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:47,295
Yes, ma'am,
you're human all right.

966
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:53,635
Barn burner!

967
01:04:58,974 --> 01:05:02,060
Well, you hit on it.

968
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:05,605
I can see my white shirt
and black tie and Sunday manners...

969
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:08,066
didn't fool you
for a minute.

970
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,695
Well, that's right, ma'am.
I'm a menace to the countryside.

971
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:16,700
All a man's gotta do is just look at me
sideways, and his house goes up in fire.

972
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:20,787
And here I am, livin' right here in the
middle of your peaceable little town.

973
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:23,457
Right in your backyard,
you might say.

974
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,668
<i>Guess that oughta
keep you awake at night.</i>

975
01:05:40,682 --> 01:05:45,312
Anything you break,
you gotta pay for. Heh.

976
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:47,731
- What are you doin' here?
- Takin' the air.

977
01:05:47,814 --> 01:05:51,568
You hired me to tend your store. Now, I'm
tendin' it. That don't need no supervision.

978
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:54,112
You and my daughter
had some words, huh?

979
01:05:54,196 --> 01:05:57,115
- Yeah, a few.
- She don't cotton to you much, does she?

980
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,788
- Ain't no love lost.
- That don't need to slow you down none.

981
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:05,332
I put you forth
as a candidate.

982
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:09,336
Oh, yeah? And just what office
you got me runnin' for?

983
01:06:09,378 --> 01:06:13,507
I opened a lot of doors for you,
Ben Quick. Ever ask yourself why?

984
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:16,677
<i>Am I
a senile old man?</i>

985
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,221
Am I a sentimental old fool?

986
01:06:20,555 --> 01:06:23,600
- I am not.
- So?

987
01:06:23,684 --> 01:06:26,186
<i>I'm a man
with a purpose.</i>

988
01:06:26,228 --> 01:06:28,855
Well, we all got
some mission in life.

989
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:31,692
Care to hear yours?

990
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:35,737
Just what do you think
you'd like me to do...

991
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:37,739
if you was able
to make me do it?

992
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:39,908
Get married.

993
01:06:41,118 --> 01:06:43,578
Have sons.

994
01:06:45,497 --> 01:06:48,625
- Well, I'll be damned.
- More than probable you will be...

995
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:51,712
but first you're goin' to church
and get married, ya hear?

996
01:06:52,963 --> 01:06:55,340
To my daughter.

997
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:09,271
That's the one you
didn't figure, ain't it?

998
01:07:10,605 --> 01:07:13,191
Yeah, that's the one.

999
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:15,235
Well?

1000
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:18,947
What about it?

1001
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,117
Well, I'd say it's
a mighty interestin' notion.

1002
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,453
"Notion"? Notion?

1003
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:27,914
I'm talkin' about the survival
of my family name.

1004
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:31,209
I'm talkin' about the establishment
of my immortality.

1005
01:07:32,586 --> 01:07:34,755
You, you wanna
put down roots?

1006
01:07:34,796 --> 01:07:38,800
Move to my house. Live with us.
Sleep under clean sheets.

1007
01:07:38,884 --> 01:07:41,094
Study that skinny gal.

1008
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:46,475
Well, now,
what's in it for me?

1009
01:07:48,018 --> 01:07:50,228
Well, there's lands
and moneys...

1010
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:52,356
on the day
of the weddin'.

1011
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:56,485
- More to come.
- What lands...

1012
01:07:56,568 --> 01:07:59,154
what moneys,
and how much more?

1013
01:07:59,237 --> 01:08:03,158
We'll have a meetin' with my banker
and my lawyer. You'll see for yourself.

1014
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,286
I'll take that old Frenchman's ruin
for a starter.

1015
01:08:06,328 --> 01:08:11,041
- Well.
- Yeah. Right now. Tonight.

1016
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:15,045
- I'll give it to you in writin'.
- Yeah, you do that.

1017
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:18,548
Who says I picked the wrong man?

1018
01:08:18,632 --> 01:08:21,176
You and me
got a deal, Ben Quick.

1019
01:08:21,259 --> 01:08:24,096
And who says marriages
are made in heaven?

1020
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:26,390
All of hell wouldn't
have this one!

1021
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,392
Now, make no mistake
about that gal.

1022
01:08:28,475 --> 01:08:32,896
She's, uh, delicate, but in other ways
she's smart, like her mother before her.

1023
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:36,233
She has quality. Quality.

1024
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:40,320
It's as close as you and me
will ever get to it.

1025
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:58,880
Move right in, boy. It's all yours.

1026
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:01,008
I'm movin' up
in the world.

1027
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,191
Miss Clara's room is in
the back of the house.

1028
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:22,529
Mr. Jody
and Miss Eula.

1029
01:09:22,571 --> 01:09:25,699
- And here's your room.
- And the old man?

1030
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,410
Never know where he is.
Don't sleep so good no more.

1031
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:31,830
Just roves around from room to room,
sometimes three in a night.

1032
01:09:45,302 --> 01:09:49,514
I had five sisters
and a brother...

1033
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:51,892
and a mother and a father
and an old maid aunt.

1034
01:09:53,268 --> 01:09:56,229
And all together,
we slept in a room about...

1035
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:58,273
half this size.

1036
01:09:58,315 --> 01:10:00,567
Same as my family.

1037
01:10:00,609 --> 01:10:02,569
And look at us now,
Lucius.

1038
01:10:02,611 --> 01:10:05,989
Big rooms, small rooms...
all the same size to the Lord.

1039
01:10:06,073 --> 01:10:08,075
Bathroom's
end of the hall.

1040
01:10:37,604 --> 01:10:40,023
Well, just so we don't
crowd each other...

1041
01:10:40,107 --> 01:10:42,234
I shave nights
and shower mornings.

1042
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:21,732
You bringin' him here?
Into the house?

1043
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:24,151
Big house.
Room for one more.

1044
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:27,320
But he don't belong here.
He's hired help.

1045
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:32,492
- He's more than that.
- How much more than that?

1046
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:35,579
Well, he's gonna be
kind of brotherly, Jody.

1047
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:38,498
I brought you home a big brother.

1048
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,751
So look out for him.
Boy's clever.

1049
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:43,712
He'll be up when you're sleepin',
and he's gonna be where you ain't.

1050
01:11:43,754 --> 01:11:48,884
Look alive, Jody. You're a couple
of racehorses startin' out even.

1051
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:52,179
Well, we'll see who is the fastest
and who is the smartest.

1052
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,141
It's not exactly even,
considerin' I'm your blood son!

1053
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:59,311
- Don't open that can of beans.
- Well, I am openin' it!

1054
01:12:01,396 --> 01:12:04,274
Well, then eat
what you got.

1055
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:06,318
Exactly nothin'.

1056
01:12:15,744 --> 01:12:17,913
Am I your son...

1057
01:12:17,996 --> 01:12:20,040
or ain't I your son?

1058
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:24,252
You was born to me.

1059
01:12:24,294 --> 01:12:27,547
Ain't you got any affection for me...
or regard for me?

1060
01:12:27,589 --> 01:12:31,176
- Just tell me that.
- You're just tryin' to make yourself miserable.

1061
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:34,763
"Miserable"? Seems like I walked
around in misery all my life.

1062
01:12:34,846 --> 01:12:37,599
You ain't never
been a papa.

1063
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:41,061
No! 'Cept to tell me
to stand up straight.

1064
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:43,939
You push, reach,
stretch yourself.

1065
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:46,400
I put down
a big footprint.

1066
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:52,114
I said, "Here.
Step in. Fill it."

1067
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,158
- You never did.
- Well, I tried.

1068
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:58,578
I tried to be what you wanted,
but I ain't got it in me.

1069
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,415
Where do ya go lookin' for it
if you ain't got it in you?

1070
01:13:01,498 --> 01:13:04,000
You find a way,
or you don't.

1071
01:13:06,461 --> 01:13:08,797
Papa, please.

1072
01:13:12,718 --> 01:13:15,512
You have Lucius dig you up
some worms, Jody.

1073
01:13:19,057 --> 01:13:21,184
You go fishin', boy.

1074
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:06,063
Jody?

1075
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:12,027
Don't you lie there with your face
in the pillow, Jody Varner.

1076
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:14,321
That's exactly what
he expects you to be doing.

1077
01:14:16,531 --> 01:14:20,494
Jody.
You had spunk once.

1078
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:23,372
Remember, you used to throw
brown paper bags full of water...

1079
01:14:23,455 --> 01:14:25,707
on his head
from this very window.

1080
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:28,418
Remember? I'd fill 'em up,
and you'd throw 'em?

1081
01:14:28,502 --> 01:14:30,962
You were only seven years old then,
and you were wonderful.

1082
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,048
You weren't
afraid then.

1083
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:36,134
Jody?

1084
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:38,720
Jody, you remember
John Wesley Pritchard?

1085
01:14:38,762 --> 01:14:40,889
You remember how he stood out
in the school yard...

1086
01:14:40,972 --> 01:14:43,725
and said, "Clara Varner
has front teeth like a horse,"

1087
01:14:43,809 --> 01:14:46,895
and I cried and said, "I'm gonna get
my big brotherJody Varner...

1088
01:14:46,978 --> 01:14:49,523
<i>to punch you in the nose, "
and you did?</i>

1089
01:14:51,942 --> 01:14:54,027
Jody?

1090
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:58,323
I wouldn't have gotten through my
girlhood alive if it hadn't been for you.

1091
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:00,325
All of which makes you
very dear to me...

1092
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:03,829
and I don't care what he did
or said to you downstairs.

1093
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:50,292
You look mighty pretty
with them readin' glasses on.

1094
01:15:53,253 --> 01:15:55,339
You look pretty
with them off.

1095
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,551
You look mighty young there,
Miss Clara...

1096
01:15:59,634 --> 01:16:01,553
all curled up
in your bed...

1097
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,805
like you just washed your hands
and brushed your teeth...

1098
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:05,807
and said your prayers
like a little girl.

1099
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:09,061
<i>I'll bet you was
a mighty appealin'little girl.</i>

1100
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:11,855
<i>I'll bet your hair hung
in a tangle down your back.</i>

1101
01:16:11,938 --> 01:16:15,984
I'll bet you knew where to look
for robins' eggs and blackberries.

1102
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:20,989
I'll bet you had
a doll with no head on it.

1103
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:23,575
There's a church bazaar
comin' up next week.

1104
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:27,412
Now, you wear a white dress
and a ribbon in your hair...

1105
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:29,790
and I'll waltz you
around under the moon.

1106
01:16:35,754 --> 01:16:38,256
Clara?

1107
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,637
Clara.

1108
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:49,226
Clara

1109
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:57,776
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

1110
01:16:57,859 --> 01:17:01,279
<i>Wake unto me</i>

1111
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:06,827
<i>Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee</i>

1112
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:09,246
<i>Okay, folks,
"this is the old-fashioned"...</i>

1113
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:12,708
Sounds of the rude world

1114
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:15,544
Heard in the day

1115
01:17:15,627 --> 01:17:19,423
Lulled by the moonlight

1116
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:23,885
Have all passed away

1117
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:29,182
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

1118
01:17:29,266 --> 01:17:32,894
<i>Queen of my song</i>

1119
01:17:32,978 --> 01:17:37,024
List while I woo thee"

1120
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:41,403
- Hi, Will.
- Hi, Sam.

1121
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:56,126
<i>Come on over. I'll give you a whole
grocery store for a dime over here.</i>

1122
01:18:00,005 --> 01:18:03,216
That Ben Quick,
he sure is a comer.

1123
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,386
Yep. Name suits him,
all right.

1124
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:09,431
First into that farm,
then into the store...

1125
01:18:09,473 --> 01:18:11,433
now in the house.

1126
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:14,269
And all he started with
was a book of matches.

1127
01:18:14,353 --> 01:18:16,938
I wish I was
Ben Quick.

1128
01:18:17,022 --> 01:18:20,901
He's got this here whole state
of Mississippi to graze on.

1129
01:18:20,942 --> 01:18:24,946
Yeah, but if you should happen to go out
to see him on business, go out naked.

1130
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,074
That way you won't feel
the cold comin' back.

1131
01:18:27,157 --> 01:18:30,786
"It's ten cents"...

1132
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:33,663
- Hi, Jody.
- Hi.

1133
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:36,583
- Can I sell you somethin'?
- Uh, yeah. Wedge of pie.

1134
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,585
- Apple pie?
- All right.

1135
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:40,671
Fifteen cents.

1136
01:18:42,255 --> 01:18:44,216
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1137
01:18:54,142 --> 01:18:55,769
Jody?

1138
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:58,105
- You got a pencil, Will?
- What for?

1139
01:18:58,188 --> 01:19:00,273
- I want you to write somethin' down.
- What?

1140
01:19:00,357 --> 01:19:02,734
- September 30. That's the day.
- What day?

1141
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:05,570
A six-layer vanilla cake
is comin' from Mayville...

1142
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:08,281
suitably decorated
in boiled white frostin'.

1143
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:12,202
A hundred and four handwritten invitations
have gone out. No children under six years.

1144
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:15,247
Women have got to take care
of themselves. That's what I done.

1145
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,500
- What have you done, Minnie Littlejohn?
- It's all arranged.

1146
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:21,336
All but the license and the blood
tests... and the weddin' rings.

1147
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,965
Weddin'? Minnie.

1148
01:19:25,007 --> 01:19:28,719
You take that six-layer,
white boiled frostin' vanilla cake...

1149
01:19:28,802 --> 01:19:30,721
and you cut it up
in 104 pieces...

1150
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:33,223
and you send it out
with your regrets.

1151
01:19:33,306 --> 01:19:35,976
All right, Will.

1152
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:38,270
Well, now,
Minnie, honey...

1153
01:19:39,938 --> 01:19:41,940
how'd you like a...

1154
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:46,194
yellow Thunderbird
automobile, huh?

1155
01:19:46,278 --> 01:19:49,072
No, thank you, Will.

1156
01:19:49,156 --> 01:19:51,616
Well, how'd you like
a brand-new super sewin' machine...

1157
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,786
- with all them fancy attachments?
- No, thank you, Will.

1158
01:20:01,877 --> 01:20:03,837
Well...

1159
01:20:05,672 --> 01:20:09,009
how'd you like a...
plain gold ring?

1160
01:20:14,765 --> 01:20:17,100
<i>Folks? Folks, can I
have your attention?</i>

1161
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:19,770
Y'all come on
and gather round, ya hear?

1162
01:20:19,853 --> 01:20:22,939
'Cause this is the moment all you
young fellas have been waitin' for.

1163
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:25,192
Each of these
young ladies here...

1164
01:20:25,233 --> 01:20:27,277
has packed
two boxed suppers...

1165
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:30,906
and the high bidder wins
not only the delicious vittles...

1166
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:33,075
but also the privilege
of eatin' 'em...

1167
01:20:33,158 --> 01:20:35,660
with the fair young maiden
who prepared 'em...

1168
01:20:35,744 --> 01:20:38,038
with her own
lily-white hands.

1169
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:43,460
Now, I'm gonna start this off with the
daughter of one of our first citizens...

1170
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,462
Miss Clara Varner!

1171
01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:48,298
Hooray!

1172
01:20:48,382 --> 01:20:52,135
All right now, folks. What am I offered
for Miss Clara Varner's boxed supper?

1173
01:20:52,219 --> 01:20:54,179
- Ten dollars.
- Ten dollars is bid.

1174
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,223
Come on, folks.
Anybody gonna hike that sum?

1175
01:20:56,264 --> 01:20:58,225
I'll make it 11.

1176
01:20:58,266 --> 01:21:00,811
Well, now, Mr. Quick
is interested in competin'.

1177
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:03,730
It's now eleven, folks.
Eleven dollars.

1178
01:21:03,814 --> 01:21:06,400
- "Any advance on $ 11?"
- Twelve dollars.

1179
01:21:06,483 --> 01:21:08,568
- Thirteen.
- Fourteen.

1180
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,904
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen dollars.

1181
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:13,240
Any advance on 15?
Do I hear 16 anywhere?

1182
01:21:13,281 --> 01:21:15,575
You hear $16.

1183
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:18,245
- Alan...
- Okay.

1184
01:21:18,286 --> 01:21:21,748
Mr. Stewart has bid $16.
Any advance on 16, folks?

1185
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:24,584
Fifty.

1186
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:28,463
- Fifty dollars.
- In a very fine cause.

1187
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:30,966
<i>Mr. Quick bids $50.
You hear that, folks?</i>

1188
01:21:31,008 --> 01:21:32,968
<i>Fifty dollars once.</i>

1189
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,178
Fifty dollars twice.

1190
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:38,598
Sold to Mr. Ben Quick
for $50.

1191
01:21:41,351 --> 01:21:44,813
This is gonna be about the most expensive
chicken supper you ever et, boy...

1192
01:21:44,855 --> 01:21:46,815
but worth
every cent of it...

1193
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:49,860
considerin' the charmin' company
you're gonna be eatin' it in.

1194
01:21:49,943 --> 01:21:54,448
I, uh... I hope you're gonna give him
dessert for that price, Clara?

1195
01:21:54,531 --> 01:21:56,992
He'll get his just desserts,
all right.

1196
01:21:58,869 --> 01:22:03,373
All right, folks. Now, I know
this young lady's a good cook...

1197
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,459
'cause I'm her daddy.

1198
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:08,420
What'll I get for drumsticks
and chocolate brownies?

1199
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:12,924
- This all right?
- Nope. I like my picnics in the woods.

1200
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:15,427
- Two dollars.
- Three dollars.

1201
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:46,667
Well, come on now.

1202
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,794
Either we eat it,
or the ants will.

1203
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,049
That was quite a gesture
you made back there.

1204
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:56,885
What do you expect to live on
for the rest of the month?

1205
01:22:56,968 --> 01:22:59,471
I have prospects.

1206
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:03,141
Well, now.
Look what we have here.

1207
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,478
Uh, little
fancy napkins.

1208
01:23:08,772 --> 01:23:10,816
Little frosted cakes.

1209
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:15,737
And little dainty sandwiches
with the crusts cut off.

1210
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:18,156
You got a bigger appetite
than that, haven't you?

1211
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,284
- Hogwash.
- Well, well.

1212
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,286
You heard me.
I said, "Hogwash."

1213
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:25,580
That's strong language,
Miss Clara.

1214
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:28,125
You got some foolish ideas
about me, Mr. Quick.

1215
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:31,253
I am no tremblin' little rabbit full
of smolderin', unsatisfied desires.

1216
01:23:31,336 --> 01:23:33,296
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

1217
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,340
I'm a woman, full-grown,
very smart...

1218
01:23:35,424 --> 01:23:37,384
- and not at all bad to look at.
- Amen.

1219
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:39,886
I expect to live at the top of my bent
with no help from you.

1220
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:41,930
You're a real fire-eater,
you are.

1221
01:23:42,014 --> 01:23:43,932
You are barkin' up the wrong girl,
Mr. Quick...

1222
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,018
because it will
never be you.

1223
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:50,981
Never say never.

1224
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:54,443
I don't know what arrangement
you think you have with my father...

1225
01:23:54,526 --> 01:23:56,695
but you'll find you have
no bargain with me.

1226
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:59,364
Now, we gonna be married,
Miss Clara. Haven't you heard?

1227
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:01,408
You have been hoodwinked,
Mr. Quick.

1228
01:24:01,491 --> 01:24:03,660
For once in your crafty life,
you have been had.

1229
01:24:03,744 --> 01:24:07,664
You mean you're turnin' me down,
refusin' my hand and my heart?

1230
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:11,960
You're too much like my father to
suit me, and I'm an authority on him.

1231
01:24:12,044 --> 01:24:15,339
- He's a wonderful old man.
- One wolf recognizes another.

1232
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:17,883
- Tame us. Make pets out of us. You could.
- I'm not interested.

1233
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,968
<i>I gave up on him
when I was nine...</i>

1234
01:24:20,052 --> 01:24:24,222
and I gave up on you the first time
I ever looked into those cold blue eyes.

1235
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:27,601
- You got the color right.
- I've got everything right, Mr. Quick.

1236
01:24:27,684 --> 01:24:31,229
Well, I can see you don't like me,
but you're gonna have me.

1237
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:33,774
It's gonna be you and me.

1238
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:37,152
- Not the longest day I live.
- "Yes, sir."

1239
01:24:37,235 --> 01:24:39,821
They're gonna say, "There goes
that poor old Clara Varner...

1240
01:24:39,905 --> 01:24:42,866
"whose father married her off
to a dirt-scratchin', shiftless...

1241
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:44,993
no-good farmer
who just happened by."

1242
01:24:45,077 --> 01:24:47,329
Well, let 'em talk.
I'll tell you one thing.

1243
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:49,665
You gonna wake up
in the mornin' smilin'.

1244
01:24:49,748 --> 01:24:52,209
<i>That's not enough.
Do you understand me?</i>

1245
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:55,545
That is not nearly enough.

1246
01:24:55,629 --> 01:24:59,841
Mr. Quick, I am a human being.
Do you know what that means?

1247
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:03,845
It means I set a price on myself,
a high, high price.

1248
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,848
You may be surprised
to know it...

1249
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:08,934
but I've got
quite a lot to give.

1250
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:12,145
I've got things I have been
savin' up my whole life...

1251
01:25:12,187 --> 01:25:14,898
things like love
and understanding and...

1252
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:18,735
and jokes and good times
and good cooking.

1253
01:25:18,819 --> 01:25:21,780
I'm prepared to be the queen
of Sheba for some lucky man...

1254
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:25,784
or at the very least, the best wife
that any man could hope for.

1255
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,911
Now, that's my human history...

1256
01:25:27,994 --> 01:25:29,913
and it's not gonna be
bought and sold...

1257
01:25:29,996 --> 01:25:33,500
and it's certainly not gonna be
given away to any passin' stranger.

1258
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:37,379
All right. Then run, lady.
And you keep on runnin'!

1259
01:25:37,462 --> 01:25:39,423
Buy yourself a bus ticket
and disappear.

1260
01:25:39,506 --> 01:25:41,758
Change your name,
dye your hair, get lost!

1261
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:45,762
And then maybe... just maybe...
you're gonna be safe from me.

1262
01:25:45,846 --> 01:25:48,098
Clara?

1263
01:25:48,181 --> 01:25:51,977
You, uh,
finished here, Clara?

1264
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,563
- Yes. Thank you, Alan.
- Well, now, I'll walk you back.

1265
01:25:55,647 --> 01:25:57,858
With your permission,
Mr. Quick.

1266
01:26:13,915 --> 01:26:16,043
- Do I look very flustered?
- Nope.

1267
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:20,172
Well, I am.
Alan, let's stop a minute.

1268
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:26,094
Well, uh,
what's wrong, Clara?

1269
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:29,348
Wanna tell me?

1270
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:35,103
Alan, this is the hardest thing
I ever had to do in my life.

1271
01:26:35,187 --> 01:26:38,398
Well, tell me about it, and we'll
see if we can make it easier.

1272
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:45,906
Alan, I have told people you love me,
and I have told myself you love me.

1273
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:48,950
Now, I've done this
for five years...

1274
01:26:49,034 --> 01:26:51,495
but I have never
heard you say it.

1275
01:26:52,704 --> 01:26:55,123
And now I've gotta know.

1276
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:59,795
Well, I guess I'd better say it then,
Clara. I do love you.

1277
01:26:59,878 --> 01:27:03,924
But do you want me
the way a man wants a woman?

1278
01:27:04,007 --> 01:27:06,927
What I want
is to help you, Clara.

1279
01:27:06,968 --> 01:27:11,431
But, Alan, that's such
a pitiful answer.

1280
01:27:12,724 --> 01:27:16,269
That's such a good,
kind, pitiful answer.

1281
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:19,356
It's the only kind of answer
I can make you, Clara.

1282
01:27:21,149 --> 01:27:23,652
I didn't mean to waste
your young years like this...

1283
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:27,906
but... you're so sweet,
so graceful, so intelligent...

1284
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:29,950
and you never made
any demands.

1285
01:27:30,033 --> 01:27:32,077
Well, I wanted to.

1286
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:37,249
Oh, I came very close
a couple of times.

1287
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:42,129
There were all sorts of feminine wiles
I was gonna try out on you.

1288
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:45,298
'Course, I don't guess
it would've done me any good.

1289
01:27:45,382 --> 01:27:47,551
Your mama has
a long head start on me...

1290
01:27:47,634 --> 01:27:50,554
and I don't think anybody's
gonna overtake her.

1291
01:27:53,598 --> 01:27:56,184
How... awful
that must have been for you.

1292
01:27:57,978 --> 01:28:01,940
All those Friday evenings with my
dreadful father snippin' at your heels...

1293
01:28:02,024 --> 01:28:05,569
and me moonin'
and dreamin' over you.

1294
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:07,612
Must've been very embarrassin'.

1295
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:16,496
I'm so ashamed.
I'm so...

1296
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:27,424
What are you doin'?
You lookin' for me, Jody?

1297
01:28:27,507 --> 01:28:30,969
I'm lookin' for ya.
I found ya.

1298
01:28:32,429 --> 01:28:35,015
Well, all right now.
We got that much clear. What next?

1299
01:28:35,098 --> 01:28:37,351
From the minute
you strayed in here...

1300
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:39,394
everything's gone wrong
in my life.

1301
01:28:39,478 --> 01:28:41,480
I been cut down
to nothin'.

1302
01:28:41,563 --> 01:28:43,982
I lost me my store,
my wife's respect...

1303
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:48,820
and my old man,
he hates me, worse than ever.

1304
01:28:48,904 --> 01:28:51,823
All that's over now, boy. They're gonna
find you downstream tomorrow.

1305
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:55,243
And I'm gonna have my place
back in the world. Do you hear me?

1306
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:58,246
Oh, Jody, you aimin'
to kill me?

1307
01:28:58,288 --> 01:29:02,250
Yeah, that's right.
What, do you think I'm jokin'? Huh?

1308
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,838
Now, w-wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Jody.

1309
01:29:07,923 --> 01:29:10,467
Now, I'll tell you
what I'll do.

1310
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:14,596
I'll make it up to you. Yeah, I'll pay you
back for everything you think I've taken.

1311
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,973
I don't wanna
hear about it!

1312
01:29:17,057 --> 01:29:19,643
Now, wait a minute.
Now, look at that, Jody.

1313
01:29:22,646 --> 01:29:25,232
Yeah? So you got
five dollars.

1314
01:29:25,315 --> 01:29:29,069
- Who cares, boy?
- No, sir. Not no ordinary five dollars.

1315
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:32,072
Now, this ain't wages, Jody.
It ain't spendin' money.

1316
01:29:32,114 --> 01:29:34,199
Jody,
this is treasure.

1317
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:39,037
- From where?
- From right outta my front lawn.

1318
01:29:40,122 --> 01:29:42,082
- You kiddin' me? Huh?
- No, sir.

1319
01:29:42,124 --> 01:29:44,209
That old Frenchman's place
your daddy give me?

1320
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:48,463
Hey, look, boy.
That's nothin' but a heap o' bricks.

1321
01:29:48,505 --> 01:29:51,425
- An old haunted house now.
- That's what it appears to be.

1322
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:54,511
Now look, boy.

1323
01:29:56,054 --> 01:29:58,056
I ain't the kind
to be taken in...

1324
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,100
by a bunch
of hokey stories...

1325
01:30:00,142 --> 01:30:03,145
old men tell while they sit around
the shed spittin' tobacco juice.

1326
01:30:03,228 --> 01:30:05,480
Jody, I'll tell you,
I felt the same way too.

1327
01:30:05,564 --> 01:30:07,607
That is till
idle curiosity...

1328
01:30:07,691 --> 01:30:11,111
led me to do a little pokin' around,
and I'll tell ya...

1329
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:14,781
when this turned up,
I was struck dumb.

1330
01:30:14,823 --> 01:30:19,453
But there it is, Jody, just like people
have said it was for a hundred years.

1331
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:28,211
Boy, you-you-you...
you tryin' to gull me?

1332
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:30,380
Jody, you just put
your mind at ease.

1333
01:30:31,798 --> 01:30:34,551
Look, I know better than
to try to trade you blind...

1334
01:30:34,634 --> 01:30:37,179
especially when it's my life
I'm dickerin' for.

1335
01:30:37,262 --> 01:30:39,389
It's your life,
all right.

1336
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:42,934
Show me.

1337
01:30:43,018 --> 01:30:45,020
<i>Come on.</i>

1338
01:31:36,863 --> 01:31:39,116
You and
your treasure.

1339
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,369
We've been workin' an hour.
Now, where is it?

1340
01:31:42,452 --> 01:31:45,205
- Huh?
- Well, you never can tell.

1341
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,669
It might be in
the next shovel load.

1342
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:24,953
We got it!

1343
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,584
Yeah.

1344
01:32:32,711 --> 01:32:34,796
I got it, Pa!

1345
01:33:00,572 --> 01:33:03,116
<i>Jody. What are you
doin'out here?</i>

1346
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:08,455
- Have you gone out of your mind, boy?
- Get away from me.

1347
01:33:08,538 --> 01:33:12,668
Your wife's gettin'
kind of anxious about you, boy.

1348
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:18,340
Get outta that hole.
Come on home with me.

1349
01:33:18,423 --> 01:33:20,884
I said get away from me.

1350
01:33:20,967 --> 01:33:23,303
Jody, I ain't goin'
without ya.

1351
01:33:29,935 --> 01:33:32,646
Go on. Go on.

1352
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:35,315
You keep on thinkin'
I'm crazy.

1353
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:37,359
I'm about as crazy
as a fox.

1354
01:33:37,401 --> 01:33:39,903
<i>I'm out from under
your thumb, Papa.</i>

1355
01:33:39,986 --> 01:33:42,155
<i>I paid that Ben Quick
friend of yours...</i>

1356
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,866
<i>one thousand dollars
for the rights to this land...</i>

1357
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,993
and everything
I find here is mine!

1358
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:53,667
<i>Who knows? I may be openin'a store
right across the street from yours.</i>

1359
01:33:53,709 --> 01:33:56,294
- "Who knows?"
- Boy...

1360
01:33:56,378 --> 01:33:58,839
just what you think
you're gonna find out here?

1361
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:07,347
More of that.
"Buckets" of that.

1362
01:34:11,393 --> 01:34:14,980
Yeah, bite on it.
It's real, all right.

1363
01:34:18,608 --> 01:34:22,612
Is this the money that the folks hid
when they thought Grant was comin'?

1364
01:34:26,658 --> 01:34:30,078
Is this the money that's supposed to have
been layin' out here all these years...

1365
01:34:30,162 --> 01:34:32,539
since the War
Between the States?

1366
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,082
That's right.

1367
01:34:37,336 --> 01:34:40,380
This piece
was minted in 1910.

1368
01:34:46,094 --> 01:34:48,930
Ben Quick.

1369
01:34:49,014 --> 01:34:51,808
<i>He salted this place.</i>

1370
01:34:56,563 --> 01:34:59,608
<i>Just took a couple of
hatfuls of silver dollars...</i>

1371
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:03,070
buried out here one night
in an old canvas bag...

1372
01:35:03,153 --> 01:35:05,322
<i>to catch
a sucker like you.</i>

1373
01:35:29,429 --> 01:35:33,475
Someday I'll kill ya.
I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

1374
01:35:35,143 --> 01:35:37,229
Jody.

1375
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,166
Good night.

1376
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,509
Sister...

1377
01:36:07,592 --> 01:36:09,594
come and have
a nightcap with me.

1378
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:29,114
Everything settled
with Alan? Huh?

1379
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:33,076
Yes, it's all settled.

1380
01:36:35,704 --> 01:36:38,040
<i>You mean that?</i>

1381
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:41,084
Well, I'll drink to that!

1382
01:36:41,168 --> 01:36:43,587
To your weddin'.
It's gonna be a great big one.

1383
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:47,549
<i>I kinda thought it might be Ben,
but Stewart's more your dish.</i>

1384
01:36:47,632 --> 01:36:51,511
Oh, well. Good name.
Good old family.

1385
01:36:51,553 --> 01:36:55,682
He's kinda weak, though.
We'll bolster him up, though.

1386
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:58,060
Papa, I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

1387
01:36:58,143 --> 01:37:00,187
Oh, no. Not just yet.

1388
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:04,733
This is a time for father and daughter
to have a little... little talk.

1389
01:37:06,068 --> 01:37:09,321
Finally?

1390
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:12,449
I know.

1391
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:15,911
I know.

1392
01:37:15,952 --> 01:37:20,457
There's been a long,
hard silence between us.

1393
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,879
Now's a time
for openin' our hearts.

1394
01:37:28,965 --> 01:37:32,052
I got one, ya know.

1395
01:37:32,135 --> 01:37:35,639
<i>- Have you, Papa?
- "Honey, I've been eatin'" the bread of sorrow.</i>

1396
01:37:35,722 --> 01:37:38,433
You made me happy
tonight, but...

1397
01:37:38,517 --> 01:37:42,729
I walked around with a bitterness
chokin' me.

1398
01:37:45,607 --> 01:37:48,402
Parents and children.

1399
01:37:48,485 --> 01:37:53,740
I asked myself, "What are children for?
Why do we have 'em?"

1400
01:37:53,824 --> 01:37:55,867
Well, tonight I know.

1401
01:37:57,077 --> 01:37:59,621
- Now I know.
- Do ya?

1402
01:38:00,914 --> 01:38:03,458
Oh, I know
I been hard on ya...

1403
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:08,463
but... don't feel
you been pushed.

1404
01:38:08,547 --> 01:38:11,466
You're goin'
in the right direction.

1405
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:15,012
Woman's only half a thing
without a man.

1406
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:19,891
What do you know
about women, Papa?

1407
01:38:22,144 --> 01:38:24,146
I had the best.

1408
01:38:27,107 --> 01:38:29,651
Your mother and I
were just...

1409
01:38:29,735 --> 01:38:32,446
about as close as...

1410
01:38:32,487 --> 01:38:34,614
two people
ever get together.

1411
01:38:38,535 --> 01:38:41,204
I wanted to be with that woman
all the time...

1412
01:38:42,956 --> 01:38:45,083
look at her,
listen to her...

1413
01:38:46,668 --> 01:38:48,670
touch her.

1414
01:38:51,214 --> 01:38:53,550
She lit up
the whole world for me.

1415
01:38:56,094 --> 01:38:58,180
I'll tell you
somethin' remarkable.

1416
01:38:58,263 --> 01:39:02,434
That woman loved me.
She did, Clara.

1417
01:39:02,517 --> 01:39:04,978
You find that hard
to believe about me?

1418
01:39:06,563 --> 01:39:09,775
A ugly, fat
old redneck like me?

1419
01:39:14,112 --> 01:39:16,114
Now, tell me, baby.

1420
01:39:18,033 --> 01:39:20,494
Have I done wrong
with you?

1421
01:39:20,535 --> 01:39:23,372
I mean...

1422
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:26,833
imposin' my will on you...

1423
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,461
shovin' you
this way and the other?

1424
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,092
Sometimes the strong
just roll over the weak.

1425
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:40,722
Sometimes, Papa.

1426
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:14,047
Good mornin', Will Varner.
What brings you our way?

1427
01:40:14,089 --> 01:40:16,883
- Ahh!
- What's come over you, you old fool?

1428
01:40:16,925 --> 01:40:18,927
Don't let it trouble you,
Elizabeth Stewart.

1429
01:40:18,969 --> 01:40:21,972
Give me some coffee, Alan.
It's all in the family, Mother.

1430
01:40:22,055 --> 01:40:23,974
Make it
a half a cup.

1431
01:40:24,057 --> 01:40:27,310
We gotta get an early start if I'm
gonna show you all you're gonna get.

1432
01:40:27,394 --> 01:40:29,730
- That's gonna take us most of the day.
- All I'm gonna get?

1433
01:40:29,771 --> 01:40:33,108
Sure. You don't think I'm gonna send
Clara to you without a stitch, huh?

1434
01:40:33,191 --> 01:40:37,320
I take care of my own. I'm gonna see to it
that you got the means to take care of Clara.

1435
01:40:37,404 --> 01:40:40,866
- Mr. Varner. You're makin' a mistake.
- Hmm?

1436
01:40:43,702 --> 01:40:46,580
- A mistake?
- Yes, sir. A mistake.

1437
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:52,961
You mean...

1438
01:40:53,045 --> 01:40:55,505
there ain't no engagement
between you two?

1439
01:40:55,589 --> 01:40:57,758
None at all.

1440
01:40:57,799 --> 01:41:01,345
That girl lied!
She lied!

1441
01:41:01,428 --> 01:41:03,764
- Have you lost your mind?
- Will you shut up!

1442
01:41:03,847 --> 01:41:07,309
- I'm talkin' to your sissy son!
- If you'll just quiet down a minute...

1443
01:41:07,392 --> 01:41:09,394
<i>I'll tell ya
somethin'.</i>

1444
01:41:09,478 --> 01:41:13,190
<i>I'm no good for your daughter.
I never was. I never will be.</i>

1445
01:41:13,273 --> 01:41:17,027
My boy doesn't need any to do
with your family, Will Varner.

1446
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:19,363
He never wanted it.
Your girl pushed it on him.

1447
01:41:19,446 --> 01:41:21,823
That's not true.
You just keep out of this.

1448
01:41:21,907 --> 01:41:23,992
You shut up!

1449
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,289
I don't want the whole county
to find out that...

1450
01:41:29,373 --> 01:41:31,708
my daughter was jilted
by anybody like you!

1451
01:41:32,793 --> 01:41:35,587
We're not given
to gossip!

1452
01:41:35,671 --> 01:41:37,756
You keep a tight lip, boy...

1453
01:41:37,839 --> 01:41:40,258
or I'll come after you
with my bare hands!

1454
01:41:40,342 --> 01:41:42,427
Hear?

1455
01:41:48,266 --> 01:41:52,354
<i>"Are you"
going to be home all day, son?</i>

1456
01:42:16,753 --> 01:42:18,839
<i>Ben Quick.!</i>

1457
01:42:21,842 --> 01:42:23,802
I'll be back
in a minute.

1458
01:42:27,723 --> 01:42:31,184
You got yourself a blue suit?
Get it cleaned!

1459
01:42:31,268 --> 01:42:33,395
You got some black shoes?
Have 'em polished?

1460
01:42:33,478 --> 01:42:36,690
Get yourself a haircut!
You're gonna be married!

1461
01:42:44,948 --> 01:42:46,908
You'll find him at the store, sister!

1462
01:42:48,076 --> 01:42:50,704
<i>Get yourself
down there. Now.</i>

1463
01:42:50,746 --> 01:42:53,248
Just say one word: Yes.

1464
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:17,314
- "Mr. Will.! Mr. Will.!"
- Yeah?

1465
01:43:17,397 --> 01:43:20,442
- The mare foaled.
- "What? When?"

1466
01:43:20,525 --> 01:43:24,488
'Bout half hour ago,
and he is a beauty.

1467
01:43:24,571 --> 01:43:26,531
Well, I better
go have a look.

1468
01:43:43,048 --> 01:43:45,967
I'm glad somethin' around here
is gettin' born.

1469
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:13,620
Jody?

1470
01:44:24,715 --> 01:44:26,967
Well, now, Jody.

1471
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:29,011
I know that's you out there.

1472
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:32,139
Jody!

1473
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:34,141
I'm not sorry.

1474
01:44:34,182 --> 01:44:37,728
I'm not sorry! I'm not sorry!

1475
01:44:37,811 --> 01:44:40,772
Jody, at least
let the horses out!

1476
01:44:40,856 --> 01:44:43,525
- I'm not sorry!
- "Jody.!"

1477
01:44:43,608 --> 01:44:45,986
Jody!

1478
01:44:53,577 --> 01:44:56,079
"Jody.! Jody.!"

1479
01:45:01,376 --> 01:45:03,295
Are you all right, Papa?

1480
01:45:03,378 --> 01:45:07,299
Are you hurt any, Papa?
Papa, are you hurt any?

1481
01:45:07,382 --> 01:45:12,095
You got hellfire and damnation
in you, Jody Varner.

1482
01:45:13,722 --> 01:45:15,682
But you got
redemption too.

1483
01:45:18,101 --> 01:45:22,105
When I think of the hate that put me
in there and locked the door...

1484
01:45:24,483 --> 01:45:26,443
and set fire to it...

1485
01:45:26,526 --> 01:45:29,696
When I think of the love
that wouldn't let me go...

1486
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:32,240
I got me a son again!

1487
01:45:32,282 --> 01:45:35,243
I got me
a good right arm...

1488
01:45:36,536 --> 01:45:39,706
and a left!

1489
01:46:04,272 --> 01:46:09,069
Wait a minute. Only one man in this town
settles his accounts by fire.

1490
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:11,071
You see this rope?

1491
01:46:11,113 --> 01:46:15,909
I was supposed to catch me a horse with
this rope... a horse I never seen since.

1492
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:18,453
Maybe I got
a better use for it now.

1493
01:46:18,495 --> 01:46:20,497
Story of my life.

1494
01:46:21,957 --> 01:46:24,918
Why doesn't anyone ever want
to consult with me peaceable?

1495
01:46:25,002 --> 01:46:28,088
I wouldn't fool with them folks, boy.
I'd light out.

1496
01:46:29,297 --> 01:46:31,591
I'm just not in
a runnin' mood.

1497
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:51,319
Get in.

1498
01:46:51,403 --> 01:46:54,781
What's it to you whether I do
or whether I don't, Miss Clara?

1499
01:46:54,823 --> 01:46:56,616
Get in.

1500
01:47:34,613 --> 01:47:36,531
That's it.
When you got it, use it!

1501
01:47:36,615 --> 01:47:39,826
- Papa, are you all right?
- 'Course. Now, don't you fuss, honey.

1502
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:43,080
- I was scared you...
- We got the thing licked.

1503
01:47:43,163 --> 01:47:45,123
There. See?

1504
01:47:49,878 --> 01:47:52,756
Get on over there!
In the back!

1505
01:48:02,766 --> 01:48:04,351
Ben?

1506
01:48:04,393 --> 01:48:06,436
<i>Ben.</i>

1507
01:48:10,857 --> 01:48:13,026
I'm sick of that sight.

1508
01:48:14,111 --> 01:48:16,113
I seen about
50 fires like that...

1509
01:48:16,196 --> 01:48:18,865
or maybe
a hundred of'em.

1510
01:48:18,907 --> 01:48:20,909
I seen men
with their shirts on fire...

1511
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:24,413
smelled horses cookin'.

1512
01:48:26,623 --> 01:48:29,876
I was raised on that smell
of gasoline around me...

1513
01:48:29,918 --> 01:48:32,212
coal oil, kerosene,
anything that'd burn.

1514
01:48:33,422 --> 01:48:35,716
My old man used to
keep 'em around the house...

1515
01:48:35,757 --> 01:48:38,468
in case he had a grudge
he wanted to settle.

1516
01:48:38,552 --> 01:48:40,512
My old man.

1517
01:48:44,224 --> 01:48:46,476
My old man.

1518
01:48:47,728 --> 01:48:50,480
<i>Last time I seen him,
I was about 10 years old...</i>

1519
01:48:52,315 --> 01:48:54,860
lyin' in a ditch,
cryin' my eyes out...

1520
01:48:56,278 --> 01:48:58,572
just prayin' that God
would strike me dead.

1521
01:49:01,783 --> 01:49:06,163
That was the night that I run ahead
to tell on him, turn him in.

1522
01:49:06,246 --> 01:49:09,207
Warned this farmer that he
was comin' with his torch.

1523
01:49:12,377 --> 01:49:14,379
I remember...

1524
01:49:15,464 --> 01:49:18,216
just lyin' there...

1525
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,302
chokin' on my own tears.

1526
01:49:23,388 --> 01:49:26,933
I remember that house burnin' and these
men on horseback and the sound of shots.

1527
01:49:26,975 --> 01:49:29,061
My old man was runnin'.

1528
01:49:32,272 --> 01:49:34,316
Maybe one of them shots
killed him.

1529
01:49:35,817 --> 01:49:38,695
Or maybe he died
in one of them fires he set.

1530
01:49:40,489 --> 01:49:42,532
<i>I don't know.</i>

1531
01:49:42,616 --> 01:49:44,576
<i>I never
seen him again.</i>

1532
01:49:45,786 --> 01:49:48,246
How terrible
that must have been.

1533
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:51,333
No, it wasn't.
The terrible part come later.

1534
01:49:52,834 --> 01:49:55,295
Knockin' around
this whole countryside...

1535
01:49:55,337 --> 01:49:57,464
floatin' around
from town to town...

1536
01:49:59,007 --> 01:50:02,052
Iookin' in on other people's kitchen
windows from the outside.

1537
01:50:03,845 --> 01:50:06,223
Boy, that man sure left
his mark on me.

1538
01:50:06,306 --> 01:50:09,059
I got his name,
and I can't run away from that.

1539
01:50:09,142 --> 01:50:11,978
Yes, you can.

1540
01:50:12,062 --> 01:50:15,190
People are kinder than you think
if you just tell 'em.

1541
01:50:17,484 --> 01:50:19,903
Well, I wouldn't
give 'em that satisfaction.

1542
01:50:19,986 --> 01:50:21,947
I wouldn't tell 'em
anything anytime.

1543
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:24,825
All right. Then change your name.
Get rid of it.

1544
01:50:24,908 --> 01:50:27,077
I'm a proud man,
Miss Clara.

1545
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,997
My name is Quick,
no matter how much people hate it.

1546
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:35,627
I was one of'em.
I hated it too.

1547
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:39,214
No, you didn't.

1548
01:50:41,591 --> 01:50:43,593
You hated me.

1549
01:50:47,014 --> 01:50:49,182
I guess I did.

1550
01:50:51,935 --> 01:50:55,522
You're a hardheaded,
softhearted woman, Miss Clara...

1551
01:50:55,605 --> 01:50:57,566
and I like you a lot.

1552
01:50:57,607 --> 01:51:02,029
- You do, do you?
- Yes, I do. All of a sudden, I do.

1553
01:51:04,489 --> 01:51:10,078
And if you can save my life, I guess I
can return the favor. I can let you go.

1554
01:51:12,164 --> 01:51:14,082
Ain't nothin' to it.

1555
01:51:14,166 --> 01:51:17,544
All I gotta do is pack that old
straw suitcase of mine and...

1556
01:51:17,627 --> 01:51:19,755
say good-bye
to millions.

1557
01:51:19,838 --> 01:51:21,757
I won't even feel sorry
for myself...

1558
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,968
till I get about one mile and a half
outta Frenchman's Bend.

1559
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:27,971
Well...

1560
01:51:28,055 --> 01:51:31,933
you couldn't "tame" me,
but you "taught" me.

1561
01:51:57,501 --> 01:52:00,087
Now, hold it.

1562
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:02,255
Now, hold on,
ya hear?

1563
01:52:02,297 --> 01:52:04,800
Will, we can't let that firebug
get away with this!

1564
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:06,927
- We gotta catch him!
- The fire is out.

1565
01:52:06,968 --> 01:52:10,138
- Thanks to you-all.
- Yeah, well, what about Ben Quick?

1566
01:52:10,222 --> 01:52:12,516
- The fire's out.
- Yeah, but who started it?

1567
01:52:13,934 --> 01:52:16,395
Old jackass
name of Will Varner.

1568
01:52:16,478 --> 01:52:19,815
That's who started it.
I dropped my cigar in the hay.

1569
01:52:21,149 --> 01:52:24,528
- Ain't that right, Jody?
- That's right, Papa.

1570
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:28,323
- What do you know?
- Well, I guess our work's done, men.

1571
01:52:28,407 --> 01:52:31,994
You-all come out here Sunday, and we'll
open some kegs of beer and have a party.

1572
01:52:32,077 --> 01:52:34,579
- You're gonna have company Sunday, Will!
- Thanks, Will!

1573
01:52:34,663 --> 01:52:38,250
Thank you. Man's got friends like you,
he ain't got no trouble!

1574
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:40,752
Are you all right?
I heard you was in that barn!

1575
01:52:40,836 --> 01:52:43,714
Yeah, in and out.
Now, simmer down, Minnie.

1576
01:52:43,797 --> 01:52:45,757
You ain't
a rich widow yet.

1577
01:52:48,427 --> 01:52:51,513
If you got a minute, Will,
I'll be sayin' good-bye.

1578
01:52:51,596 --> 01:52:54,766
- You'll be doin' what?
- Yeah, I'm leavin', soon as I get my things together.

1579
01:52:54,850 --> 01:52:56,476
Don't the room and
board here suit ya?

1580
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,564
- No, I got no complaints about that.
- What is it then?

1581
01:53:00,647 --> 01:53:03,442
Will, you and me, we been in business
only a little while...

1582
01:53:03,525 --> 01:53:06,945
just one hot summer.

1583
01:53:09,031 --> 01:53:11,283
We started off on that horseflesh game,
remember?

1584
01:53:11,366 --> 01:53:14,202
- Get to the point.
- We sort of left off horses.

1585
01:53:14,286 --> 01:53:16,788
We got started on people.
Now, that's somethin' different.

1586
01:53:16,872 --> 01:53:19,333
- Which people you talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about Clara...

1587
01:53:19,374 --> 01:53:21,335
that daughter
to Will Varner.

1588
01:53:21,376 --> 01:53:23,378
You wanna stay
and hear this?

1589
01:53:23,462 --> 01:53:28,258
Papa, wild horses wouldn't
drag me off this front porch.

1590
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:31,261
Will, ya know, in all this schemin'
we been doin'...

1591
01:53:31,345 --> 01:53:33,263
we forgot somethin',
you and me.

1592
01:53:33,347 --> 01:53:35,474
- I get preached to on Sunday!
- Yeah, I know...

1593
01:53:35,557 --> 01:53:38,810
and you don't listen...
and neither did I.

1594
01:53:38,894 --> 01:53:40,812
I didn't take too easy
to the idea.

1595
01:53:40,896 --> 01:53:43,732
In fact, I've been a little long
comin' around to it, but...

1596
01:53:43,815 --> 01:53:45,817
Well, life's
a pretty valuable thing...

1597
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:48,612
and it ought to be treated
with a certain amount of respect.

1598
01:53:48,695 --> 01:53:52,032
You're old enough to know that,
and I'm young enough to learn it.

1599
01:53:52,074 --> 01:53:54,534
Well, isn't that the truth.

1600
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:58,080
So I'll be
seein' you around, Will.

1601
01:53:58,163 --> 01:54:01,083
First off, nobody give you permission to
call me by my front name!

1602
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:03,085
Will, that shoutin'
ain't becomin' to you.

1603
01:54:03,168 --> 01:54:05,212
And second,
don't tell me what life is like!

1604
01:54:05,295 --> 01:54:07,547
Life around here
is what I say it is!

1605
01:54:07,631 --> 01:54:09,633
You can't always have it
your way, Will.

1606
01:54:09,716 --> 01:54:13,136
I got influence. I'll dog you
wherever you go. I'll break you.

1607
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:16,973
No, you won't.
You'll miss me.

1608
01:54:21,603 --> 01:54:24,523
What are you grinnin' about?

1609
01:54:24,606 --> 01:54:28,068
Huh? Now there's
your gratitude.

1610
01:54:28,151 --> 01:54:31,905
There's your thanks! I put that boy where
there was fast, easy money just layin' there.

1611
01:54:31,989 --> 01:54:34,950
I put him in the Garden of Eden,
let him dip his bread in honey...

1612
01:54:34,992 --> 01:54:38,328
and he's got the all-out gall
to tell me no!

1613
01:54:41,081 --> 01:54:43,375
I gotcha!

1614
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:46,461
Mmm.

1615
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:55,804
So you run, and you
keep on runnin'...

1616
01:54:55,887 --> 01:54:59,516
and you buy yourself a bus ticket
and you disappear.

1617
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:03,437
And you change your name
and you dye your hair...

1618
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,441
and maybe...
just maybe...
