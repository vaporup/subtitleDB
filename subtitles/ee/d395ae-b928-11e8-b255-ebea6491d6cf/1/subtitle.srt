1
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,645
When I was a child...

2
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,989
I remember seeing

3
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,220
a big rainbow over the river

4
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,766
Go away!

5
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,504
At that time my mother told me

6
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,675
"A rainbow is the door to heaven

7
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:09,551
When people die
they go to heaven through that door"

8
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,559
When I was a child my father passed away

9
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,221
And my mother went abroad

10
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:20,756
I wanted my mom to remarry
but she didn't want to

11
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,434
My name is Ji-hae
and my blood type is O

12
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,771
And since I was seven
I learned taekwondo

13
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,291
Are you okay?

14
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:18,147
This box contains
my parents' letters and diaries

15
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,896
Every time my mother
read the letters, she wept

16
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:29,458
The refined letters and
the scent of the past...

17
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,839
My mom's first love is in here

18
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,812
Hello?

19
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,882
Ji-hae?
It's me, Soo-gyung

20
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,823
Why are you calling so early?

21
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,763
Wanna go to the art museum
and a play with me and Sang-min?

22
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,857
Hey, are you making me tag along?

23
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,594
No, dummy! Sang-min asked you to come

24
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,972
Really?

25
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,408
- I'm serious
- I got to know

26
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,273
Sang-min through Soo-gyung

27
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:50,883
She one day asked me to write e-mails to Sang-min

28
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,553
For two months, I wrote
letters to him for Soo-gyung

29
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,349
Today, I saw you reading a book by the bench

30
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,053
It looked like a picture in a postcard

31
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,624
That's childish

32
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,859
Rewrite it?

33
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,667
No, I like it

34
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,932
I like it being childish

35
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,942
If you still want to marry

36
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,714
I'll give you a curse for a dowry

37
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,650
Sang-min, I sent you a letter
without missing a day

38
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,649
Afterwards, Soo-gyung signed up for theater

39
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,160
So that she could get close to him

40
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,934
Good-bye
If you still want to marry

41
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,636
marry an idiot instead

42
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:47,800
The night stained with
pain kept me awake...

43
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,208
The gloomy moonlight has

44
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:54,180
unexpectedly made your shadow suspend

45
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,248
on my window

46
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,648
No, that's not it!

47
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,985
The gloomy moonlight has

48
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,656
unexpectedly made your shadow suspend

49
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,224
on my window

50
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,285
Jordan is touched when Emily comes back to see him

51
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,695
You have to feel both
happy and heartbroken

52
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,667
Do it with more feeling!

53
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,770
When I look at him I feel breathless

54
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,616
But he never once looked at me

55
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,121
I'll put a spell on him

56
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,922
Look back! Look back! Look back!
Hey!

57
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,830
Music

58
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,003
When I saw you for the first time

59
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,606
you already stole my heart

60
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,874
But now that you came to me

61
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,552
I feel like we'll be together forever

62
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,746
Good

63
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,980
My heart is yours forever

64
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,392
He doesn't make a lot of gesture

65
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,495
Isn't Sang-min fantastic?

66
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,827
I love guys who are into their work

67
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,093
Saw him?

68
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,495
"No, that's not it!"

69
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,002
The gloomy moonlight has

70
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,909
unexpectedly made your shadow suspend

71
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,070
on my window

72
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,638
Talking about me?

73
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,849
It's nothing, Sang-min

74
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,607
You know Ji-hae, right?

75
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,582
She was with me when I first came here

76
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,614
Right, it's been a while

77
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:52,254
Yes...
Hello

78
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,901
A lot of girls like him

79
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:02,208
Not just Soo-gyung

80
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,733
Even the woman working at the student's hall likes him

81
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,506
Sung Joo-hee

82
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,316
Yoon Tae-soo

83
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,890
Oh Joon-ha?

84
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:54,952
"When I opened the window this morning
the romantic breeze signaled autumn coming

85
00:10:55,187 --> 00:11:00,716
I'll put that wind
in the letter and send it to you"

86
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,522
Romantic breeze?

87
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,760
That's so cliche

88
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,136
I guess I'll look at it as a classic

89
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,666
Oh Joon-ha!

90
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,641
Tae-soo came to me all of sudden
whom I've never talked to

91
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,375
Please write me a letter

92
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,745
He heard the rumor that I write for others

93
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,195
Tae-soo is a friend who grew no less than
36 centimeters during the winter vacation

94
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,196
To who?

95
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,960
To my fiancee

96
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,131
Fiancee?

97
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,202
She's my dad's friend's daughter

98
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,543
They set us up on their own

99
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,908
You're lucky

100
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,673
You don't have to ask girls out on dates

101
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,307
I'm sick of it

102
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,352
I'm not the type to date one girl

103
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,344
If she mails me he wants to check it

104
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,886
He wants to know everything

105
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,791
He acts just like a FBI agent

106
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,391
Oh no

107
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,673
She's pretty, huh?

108
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:32,701
But since she's a congressman's daughter
she'll be shallow

109
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,949
Drive! Drive!

110
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,925
You let them slip out between your legs

111
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,131
City boys are slow

112
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,766
Suwon isn't a city, Seoul is

113
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,428
Oh Suwon...
But we have a city hall

114
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,705
You catch them and I'll draw them

115
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,730
Look carefully, idiot
Let's go

116
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,756
What are you doing?

117
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:26,322
She's Old SUNG's granddaughter
I heard she's from Suwon

118
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,296
- Wait, you're from Suwon, right?
- Yeah

119
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:36,039
We can never dream of having her
Old SUNG's son is a congressman

120
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,576
So she's a congressman's daughter

121
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,276
Then is she a congressman's son, idiot?

122
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,857
- Oh...
She's...

123
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:52,958
- She's waving
- Let's wave back!

124
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,326
Hey, wave!

125
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,625
- Hello!
- Hi!

126
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,062
I found one!

127
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,891
Let me see!

128
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,695
Let's see

129
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,430
It stinks

130
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,172
I got one

131
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,042
It's a big one

132
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,584
It sure ate a lot of cow shit

133
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,650
It's a beetle

134
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,392
A beetle?

135
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,260
But I've never seen one

136
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,396
Do you want this?

137
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,581
You wanna bet?

138
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,119
It's cow shit, it's dirty

139
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,635
Have you seen the haunted house across the river?

140
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,602
What?

141
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,635
Yes

142
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,939
Can you take me there?

143
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,572
Yes

144
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,645
Do you know how to row?

145
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,144
Sure

146
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,452
Then let's meet at the ferry at twelve tomorrow, okay?

147
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,937
- What did you say to her?
- She said something...

148
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,872
City boys are surely different

149
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,311
Hey, teach me how to row!

150
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,179
You'll teach me, right?

151
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,983
Grandpa told me a lot about it
but forbid me to go

152
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,989
It's strict where ever I go

153
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,267
I really wanted to go,
but I had no one to take me

154
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:57,166
If I ask the people here
then they'll tell my Grandpa right away

155
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:08,921
But the boat isn't moving

156
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,354
Gosh!

157
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:19,225
To be honest this is my first time rowing

158
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,968
My name is Oh Joon-ha

159
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:37,745
Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself
I'm Sung Joo-hee

160
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,274
You're from Suwon?

161
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,487
Yes

162
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,617
I'm from Suwon, too
I came here to visit my Uncle

163
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:50,822
Really?
What a coincidence

164
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,322
Or maybe fate?

165
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,960
- Pardon?
- Oh, nothing

166
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,998
Is there...
really a ghost?

167
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,482
Have you seen...
a ghost before?

168
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,576
Of course
Every day

169
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:47,844
What?

170
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,085
In the mirror

171
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:59,222
Actually, I'm a ghost

172
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,460
Stop it

173
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,061
- Are you okay?
- Yes

174
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,064
I think I sprained my ankle

175
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,398
Get on my back

176
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,172
Hurry and get on my back

177
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,472
It's a shower
It'll stop soon

178
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,354
Dry yourself with this

179
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,906
When the rain stops we'll go along the river

180
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,775
Then we'll reach the ferry
Although it's a bit far

181
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,424
I'm heavy, huh?

182
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,693
Nope
You're not heavy at all

183
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,207
But I weigh a lot
And I eat a lot, too

184
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,142
Don't worry

185
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:15,340
I can carry you on my back and go anywhere!

186
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,948
You're lying

187
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,183
I'm not lying

188
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,184
Yes, you are

189
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,175
No, I'm not

190
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,216
I caught it

191
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,935
Open your hands

192
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,436
Hold the firefly for a moment

193
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,480
You gave me a firefly and carried me

194
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,909
But this is all that I can give you in return

195
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,799
Please give me the firefly

196
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,370
Thanks for today

197
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,605
She was sick for a few days

198
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,707
and left for a big hospital in Seoul

199
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,876
After her mother died she got really sick

200
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,144
But when she came back from the countryside

201
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,246
I heard she got healthier and looked happier

202
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,655
It's done

203
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,587
Let me see

204
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:41,097
It was painful to write the letters for Tae-soo

205
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,573
Because of her

206
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,836
I had a lot to tell her myself

207
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,841
It's great

208
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,547
Can I thank you by showing you my specialty?

209
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,711
Yes

210
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,629
Wait a sec
You have to open your mouth

211
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,622
When we close our mouths
people will think we faked it

212
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,601
Watch carefully

213
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,813
Know what song this is?

214
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,807
"Moonlight of Shilla"?

215
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,054
You punks!

216
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,715
Why haven't you finished your chores?

217
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,553
Are you bastards playing hookie?

218
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,125
I'll check later
so make it spotless!

219
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:42,565
And what's this smell?
Did someone take a shit here?

220
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,329
Joon-ha!

221
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,500
Oh Joon-ha!

222
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,063
Oh Joon-ha!

223
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,243
Joon-ha!
Oh Joon-ha!

224
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,779
Are you crazy to scream in a library?

225
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,248
Look, it's an invitation

226
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,020
Is everyone here Oh Joon-ha?

227
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,822
Nosey bastards

228
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,311
Thank you

229
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,815
Next is sophomore
Sung Joo-hee

230
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,843
She will play Beethoven's Sonata 8 on the piano

231
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,583
Welcome with warm applause

232
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,906
Joo-hee, you must be hungry

233
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,965
I bet you're hungry

234
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,097
- Thank you
- Congratulations

235
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,335
Is your ankle better?

236
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,500
Yes

237
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,840
And your cold?

238
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,583
Yes

239
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,813
I was very worried about you

240
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:34,052
And I enjoyed your performance

241
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,387
I have to practice more

242
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,394
Everyone's waiting

243
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,830
I snuck out

244
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,878
I still have the firefly

245
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,580
It's in good health, like me

246
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,862
Hi

247
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,058
Sorry, I'm late

248
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:23,890
Mmm...

249
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,702
Hi, Ji-hae

250
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:32,109
Sang-min, I won
We made a bet

251
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:36,876
I bet you'd come and Sang-min bet you wouldn't

252
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,808
You have to treat dinner

253
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,712
Okay, I will

254
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,922
What are you looking at?

255
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,879
I have to go

256
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,852
Why are you going so early?

257
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,252
Sang-min is treating us to dinner

258
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,290
Three's a crowd

259
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,249
You bad girl
You're too smart

260
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,553
Sang-min!
Ji-hae said she's leaving

261
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,169
But you should eat with us

262
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,704
And we can talk about the play, too

263
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,571
Ji-hae never changes her mind

264
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,608
Right, Ji-hae?

265
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,611
Right

266
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,976
See?

267
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,638
That's too bad
It would've been nice if you came

268
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,383
Ever seen Sang-min treat
anyone like this?

269
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:01,116
He's doing this because you're my friend

270
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,092
He's just being nice so you can go, It's okay

271
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,133
Wait!

272
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,345
I bought presents today

273
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,784
I also got you one,
so you wouldn't feel alone

274
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:37,158
I bet you won't be able to sleep tonight
This isn't like Sang-min

275
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,129
It's because you're a good friend

276
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,292
If it wasn't for me you'd never get this

277
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,932
Pick one

278
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,435
Ji-hae!

279
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,147
Ji-hae...

280
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,883
I like your present better

281
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,181
It's okay to switch, right?

282
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,717
Bye!

283
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,738
"When the sun shines
on the sea, I think of you

284
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,748
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you"

285
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,252
Really?
Is that what it says?

286
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,787
Gee!

287
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,086
Oh my gosh
Sang-min must really like me a lot

288
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,193
You have to give it
to me tomorrow, okay?

289
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,251
Okay

290
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,031
I have no reason to see him anymore

291
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,564
He wants to be with Soo-gyung now

292
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,668
When the sun shines on the sea...

293
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,911
When the dim moonlight is on the spring...

294
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,577
Are you done?

295
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,922
Wait a little longer

296
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,428
Hand in your manure

297
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,964
in an envelope after lunch

298
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,134
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

299
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,837
Those who didn't bring it hurry and go take a shit!

300
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,737
Got it?

301
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,043
Let's get together!

302
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,022
One! Two!

303
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,457
One! Two!

304
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,758
One! Two!

305
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,588
Joon-ha

306
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:33,220
I'll close my eyes and run so you guide me, okay?

307
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,531
I'm really closing them

308
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,964
Okay

309
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,461
Joon-ha

310
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:42,129
Wanna come with me to learn the folk dance after class?

311
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,907
folk?

312
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,841
I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there

313
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,179
It's my dad and his friend's idea

314
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,815
They want us to meet at a healthy recreation

315
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,841
A lot of girls will be there
so you pick one up

316
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,352
- Gonna come, right?
- I don't know

317
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,584
Tae-soo!

318
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,069
Joo-hee, this is my friend Oh Joon-ha

319
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,679
She's the one I told you about

320
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,943
I'm Oh Joon-ha
Nice to meet you

321
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,386
Hello
Are you two friends?

322
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,995
Know each other?

323
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,596
No, we don't

324
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,559
He's my best friend

325
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:56,610
This is my friend, Na-hee

326
00:46:56,847 --> 00:47:00,248
Hi, I'm Na Na-hee

327
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,753
- I'm YOON Tae-soo
- I'm Oh Joon-ha

328
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,755
Everyone please have a seat

329
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,416
Come on!

330
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,884
Anywhere is fine

331
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:29,580
Today I will teach you the folk dance

332
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,673
- Sounds fun, right?
- Yes

333
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,774
Folk Dance is...

334
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,979
I missed you

335
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,352
Me, too

336
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,634
I didn't know you were Tae-soo's friend

337
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,731
I want to be a woman anchor

338
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,770
So I always practice my speech

339
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,411
Can you do this?

340
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:20,606
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

341
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,244
Did I do okay?
I can do it faster

342
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,717
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

343
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,490
Shall I do it faster?

344
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,960
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

345
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,156
Give it a try

346
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:42,299
Peter Piper a pecked
of peppers pickled...

347
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,844
You'll need a lot of practice
Repeat precisely after me

348
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:54,249
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

349
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,680
We should split up now

350
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:05,826
I'll take Joo-hee home
so you take care of Na-hee

351
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,090
Okay?
See you later

352
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:13,393
I had fun
Good night

353
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,494
Bye, Joo-hee

354
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,663
Good night

355
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,128
What are you doing?
Let's get going

356
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,205
Joon-ha

357
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:54,067
then try something easier

358
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,572
Try this

359
00:51:55,812 --> 00:52:01,079
She sells seashells by the seashore

360
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,915
Easy, huh?
Give it a try

361
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,189
Pardon?

362
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,089
I said give it a try

363
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,887
Give what a try?

364
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:16,133
She sells seashells by the seashore

365
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,567
Give this a try

366
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,196
I can't
Please don't ask me to

367
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,863
You can't do this?

368
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:29,246
She sells seashells by the seashore

369
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,614
It's easy

370
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:36,246
She sells seashells by the seashore

371
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,000
- Have a good...
- Yes...

372
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,934
Good-bye

373
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,029
The card

374
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,701
I should've known there'd be a card for me

375
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,030
Ji-hae?

376
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,039
Oh, hello

377
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,114
Where are you headed?

378
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,914
To the library

379
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,625
That far?

380
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,429
It's not far

381
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:11,896
I won't get so wet if I stop at each building

382
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,440
Then I'll take you there

383
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,408
With my special umbrella

384
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:32,483
Think of that building as a shed and run

385
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,323
One, Two, Three!

386
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:25,966
How are you?

387
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,071
Thanks so much

388
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,507
But you're soaked

389
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,944
I was going to get wet anyway

390
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:50,260
I should be going
Thanks again

391
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,728
- Okay, I'll see you later
- OK!

392
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,776
I didn't think we'd meet again

393
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,752
But why does the library have to be so close?

394
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,809
She hasn't mailed me back yet

395
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,215
- Joo-hee?
- Yeah

396
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,761
- Why not?
- I don't know

397
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,831
I'm not the type to fall in love with one girl

398
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,533
But I must really like her

399
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:10,569
Tae-soo!

400
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:11,605
Tae-soo!

401
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,747
Tae-soo?

402
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,544
Hi

403
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,256
What are you doing here?

404
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,355
I was waiting for you

405
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,496
Please take these flowers

406
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:42,871
I like you, Joo-hee

407
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,038
Please write to me

408
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,289
It's so strange
Is it because I'm too tall?

409
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:07,492
Why do I keep fainting?

410
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,604
I'm out of breath

411
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,644
It's because of Tae-soo, right?

412
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,918
What do you think I should do?

413
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,018
Tell me

414
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,598
Tae-soo is a rotten bastard

415
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,098
No, Tae-soo is nice

416
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:27,274
He's a rotten bastard because he's too nice

417
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:34,481
Tae-soo is waiting for your letter

418
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,615
There's no hope

419
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,790
There's nothing we can do for us

420
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:53,099
Don't say that

421
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,067
There's a way

422
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,337
No, there's nothing more we can do

423
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,240
Nothing

424
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,617
We'll only get hurt

425
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,194
It'll work out

426
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:37,903
I won't see neither you nor Tae-soo anymore

427
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,739
I'm serious

428
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,547
I won't see anyone

429
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,477
Hey, limousine boy!

430
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,280
Come here

431
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,913
Limousine boy!
Forgot to bow?

432
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:24,353
So you don't wanna bow
is that it?

433
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:30,121
If you have a chauffeur you don't have to bow, huh?

434
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,834
Your badge is upside down and your shirt's unbuttoned

435
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:40,404
Fine, today I'll give you the worst beating ever

436
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:52,177
I'm gonna beat you all starting from the left

437
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,813
The first one gets hit once the second one gets hit twice

438
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,929
From the third shout out your turn

439
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,831
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

440
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:05,392
- You sissies, I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

441
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,362
Seven

442
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,797
Stay still!

443
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,009
- Ouch, my back
- Stay still, or I'll break your arm

444
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,659
You get one more beating
Get into position!

445
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,758
Listen to what I said and get into position!
