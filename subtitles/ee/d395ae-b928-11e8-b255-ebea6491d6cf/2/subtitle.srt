1
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,905
What's the count?

2
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:14,902
I said what's the count?

3
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:19,408
Then I'll tell you
You're nineteen

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,819
One

5
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:25,351
Two

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,849
Three!

7
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:34,188
Hey, get up!
Get up!

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,640
Hey, Hey!
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,904
It's about Joo-hee

10
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,812
I don't think she likes me

11
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:53,278
I gave her flowers and even kissed her

12
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:55,319
but there's no response

13
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,452
You kissed her?

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,723
Yeah

15
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,562
When the sun shines on the sea
I think of you

16
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,963
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you

17
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:03,362
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

18
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,126
Dummy

19
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,834
Do you want to get electrocuted?

20
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,766
You're crazy

21
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,664
I don't want to split up like this

22
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,232
Let's talk just for a moment

23
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,641
Nothing can change

24
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,941
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

25
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,369
Here's your letter

26
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,308
I don't want it anymore

27
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:58,838
Why?

28
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,881
There's no response and because of my conscience

29
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,619
I'll write it myself from now on

30
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,115
And tell her the truth

31
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,257
It's a golden opportunity

32
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:16,522
I heard she's very sick from the rain

33
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,191
So she's in the hospital

34
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:24,039
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

35
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,631
Yeah

36
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,768
I'm going to see her

37
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:33,170
If I visit her when she's sick then I can score

38
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:38,986
I'll confess to her that I didn't write the letters

39
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,888
I won't tell her it was you

40
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:46,726
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

41
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:50,930
but I really like her

42
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,099
Oh Joon-ha!

43
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,298
Oh Joon-ha!

44
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,004
He's calling you

45
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,206
Yes?

46
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:03,371
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

47
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,548
I have to eat all this?

48
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:08,016
Look at this

49
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,853
Mawworms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

50
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:15,152
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

51
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,191
Because of you our class has the most parasites

52
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,695
But sir it wasn't my manure

53
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:22,390
Then whose was it?

54
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:27,566
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

55
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,285
YOON Tae-soo

56
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,015
Eat three

57
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,728
But it's the same manure

58
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:58,495
Yeah, but some spots have more parasites and some don't

59
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,817
How'd you know I was here?

60
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:21,957
Why are you covering your face?

61
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:26,928
Stop it, I haven't washed my face, and it's dirty

62
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:28,555
But you're still pretty

63
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,891
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

64
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,966
Why are you laughing?

65
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:41,271
I heard you ate 32 worm-killing pills

66
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,912
Tae-soo, that bastard has a big mouth

67
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:50,079
Did he say anything else?

68
00:07:55,991 --> 00:08:04,558
After being silent for a while that's all he said and left

69
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,027
- Really?
- Yeah

70
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:09,733
He's so odd

71
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:16,066
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

72
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm sorry

73
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:24,816
I must be really stupid

74
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:30,523
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

75
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,787
No, there's a lot you're good at

76
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:40,095
Like getting drenched and eating worm pills

77
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:45,231
Don't laugh
This is serious

78
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:51,107
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

79
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,912
Then we can clear our conscience

80
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,589
See you later

81
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,318
Is this her room?

82
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,027
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

83
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:14,867
No, lie down

84
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:21,109
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

85
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,645
So, are you eating well?

86
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:28,344
You should eat well to recover

87
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:35,789
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

88
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,903
Wrong room

89
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,617
Clench your fists

90
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,721
Raise them like this

91
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,172
Now hit me

92
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:26,341
Why should I hit you?

93
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,638
Hurry and hit me!

94
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:32,174
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

95
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,882
My dad hit me too many times

96
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,543
I like Joo-hee

97
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:41,244
Actually, she gave me this necklace last summer

98
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,789
Are you okay?

99
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:50,789
Damn it
I've fallen again

100
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,329
Don't worry

101
00:10:54,969 --> 00:11:00,202
And don't let my dad see that necklace

102
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,273
He'll get furious

103
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:08,644
That necklace was a gift from my dad

104
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,614
To Joo-hee

105
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:21,084
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

106
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,927
Later on, we went on school break

107
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:30,338
And I thought I couldn't see her again

108
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:32,238
I miss you

109
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,668
I miss you so much I'll die

110
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:40,878
And I'm curious how much our river has changed

111
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:47,978
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

112
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:52,583
Say that I miss them and that I'm doing okay

113
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:58,492
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me with your Uncle's address

114
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,533
He also confessed a shocking thing to me

115
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:08,899
That you were the one who wrote the letters to me

116
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:12,442
How could you hide that from me?

117
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,410
Anyway, it's okay

118
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:21,656
I almost threw away those letters

119
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,887
but now I can read them again and think of you

120
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:29,793
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

121
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:35,197
That you put Tae-soo's name on the letters you send me

122
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,899
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

123
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,445
Look outside the window

124
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,445
If the branches swing gently in the wind

125
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:53,213
then the one you love is loving you, too

126
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:58,390
Right now it's snowing outside

127
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,727
When it first snows

128
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:04,096
they say you should stroll with your beloved

129
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:06,960
But I'm just writing a letter

130
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,593
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

131
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:14,798
I'm going to get permission to go to Grandpa's house

132
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:19,077
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

133
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,114
Open your ears

134
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,513
If you hear your heartbeat

135
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:28,212
then the person you love is loving you, too

136
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,181
Close your eyes

137
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,723
If there's a smile on your lips

138
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:37,561
then the person you love is loving you, too

139
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,586
I want to send a telegraph

140
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:06,027
Then please sign up here

141
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,426
Okay

142
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:20,870
But fate must not be on my side

143
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,173
One of my letters

144
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,080
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

145
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,107
Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha

146
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:37,185
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

147
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:44,556
Both of them really love each other

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,596
So that's why I gave up

149
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,164
Two people in love should be together

150
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:59,278
It's okay with me

151
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,441
No, I love her, too

152
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,182
I won't give up

153
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:14,328
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

154
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:21,867
So your parents mean nothing to you?

155
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:26,737
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

156
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,976
Know what that means, you punk?

157
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,847
You deserve to die

158
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:39,619
You can't even hold on to a girl

159
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,699
It was the end of a winter break?

160
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:02,536
I had hoped so much for

161
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,402
Know what this is?

162
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,073
A belt?

163
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:35,565
No, it's a whip

164
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:38,207
This bastard hits me

165
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:43,883
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

166
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:52,957
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

167
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,326
The death penalty

168
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,566
That's exactly what I thought

169
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:09,971
Kill it slowly and painfully?

170
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:17,148
Or starve it slowly to death?

171
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:21,222
Or give it sleeping pills?

172
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,122
Strangle it to death

173
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,355
Good idea

174
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,166
Joon-ha

175
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:42,273
Take good care of Joo-hee

176
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,351
Tae-soo!

177
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:08,522
Somebody help!

178
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:11,829
A person's dying!

179
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,234
Tae-soo, you bastard!

180
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,503
Tae-soo, you bastard!

181
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:18,206
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

182
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:23,377
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

183
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:27,211
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

184
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:34,649
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

185
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:40,357
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

186
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:48,666
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

187
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:52,173
Breathe! Breathe!

188
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:56,906
Breathe, you bastard!

189
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:50,527
Go inside

190
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:07,110
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

191
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,717
Hurry

192
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,936
Wait here for me

193
00:21:55,563 --> 00:22:01,695
Hurry and get well

194
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,632
Ji-hae, know what this is?

195
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,205
An umbrella?

196
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,681
A very special umbrella

197
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,809
They're all the same

198
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:09,755
It's special because Sang-min gave it to me

199
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:14,395
He must know that I like him

200
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:19,389
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

201
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,770
Go give this to Sang-min

202
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,507
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

203
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,065
Why not?

204
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:31,041
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

205
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,512
Remember when it suddenly rained that day?

206
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,719
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

207
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:46,550
He was looking out of the window

208
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:51,360
then suddenly turned to me and said

209
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:57,500
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

210
00:25:57,838 --> 00:26:02,741
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

211
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:08,846
He placed his umbrella here

212
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,079
and said
"You can have it"

213
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:16,351
He said he was okay to get wet

214
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:20,425
And then he ran off in the rain

215
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,362
Did you bring an umbrella?

216
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:40,012
You can have it.

217
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:49,790
It's raining a lot outside

218
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,489
Sang-min might be getting soaked without an umbrella

219
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:15,880
This is a really special umbrella

220
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:21,053
I'll give it back to him

221
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:30,955
Did you bring an umbrella?

222
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,766
Of course, I did

223
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:34,199
Really?

224
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,497
But still, take mine

225
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,400
Is she crazy?

226
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:07,084
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

227
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:11,889
It's not mine

228
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,566
I came to return it to you

229
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:17,931
You left it at the store

230
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:27,137
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

231
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,951
Don't go

232
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:48,664
You already know...

233
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:51,296
my feelings

234
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:57,206
Now, you know it all

235
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,677
Yeah

236
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:09,884
when I saw you run without an umbrella

237
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:14,327
I left my umbrella behind

238
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:20,926
Even on the day of the play

239
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,365
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

240
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,543
And if fate was on my side

241
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:39,585
I thought you'd pick the gift with the card in it

242
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:44,352
I thought we'd grow distant

243
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:48,087
if I confessed my feelings

244
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:52,894
I wanted to say that I liked you,
but I couldn't

245
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:57,436
I'll come see the play

246
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:11,311
Look
I cut my wrists

247
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,616
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

248
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:20,291
Do you really love her?

249
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,429
Is it really so?

250
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:24,624
I'm working out my feelings

251
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:28,463
My eyes were looking straight

252
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:30,626
but my heart was confused

253
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:33,865
Can I trust those words?

254
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,903
Can I think of it as a promise?

255
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,771
Yes

256
00:31:41,949 --> 00:31:45,282
There's only one that I love

257
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:49,089
That one is me, right?

258
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:50,681
Yes, I love you

259
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:52,759
I swear that I love you

260
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:55,329
I love you, too

261
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,331
Sang-min
I love you so much

262
00:31:57,331 --> 00:31:58,764
Sang-min!

263
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:21,380
What the hell are you doing?

264
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:24,852
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

265
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:26,660
You can't just change your lines like that

266
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,261
You ruined everything!

267
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:31,865
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

268
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,800
I love you
Love is more important than a play

269
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,960
I love you

270
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,865
After the play Sang-min and I went on a date

271
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,161
We decided to go to the river

272
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:14,639
where my mother's memories lay

273
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,443
Joo-hee?

274
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:31,958
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

275
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,823
Is that so?

276
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,218
I must've made a mistake

277
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,656
But you look so much like your mom

278
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:45,439
I delivered a lot of your mom's letters

279
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,736
Thank you, sir

280
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:13,027
I know well what happened to my parents afterwards

281
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,204
Students and citizens!

282
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:24,441
This is illegal demonstrations!

283
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:28,381
Eliminate corruption and establish a new state!
A new state!

284
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,350
Down with dictatorship and the military regime!

285
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,944
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

286
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:15,321
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

287
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:21,126
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

288
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:24,127
Put on toothpaste

289
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:59,733
It's been a long time

290
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:03,572
It has

291
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:12,974
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

292
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,865
Joon-ha!

293
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:38,668
Joon-ha!

294
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:41,506
Joon-ha!

295
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,918
Joon-ha!

296
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,114
Joon-ha!

297
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:01,955
Joon-ha!

298
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:11,393
Joon-ha
come back alive!

299
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:19,678
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

300
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,907
Joon-ha!

301
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:26,915
Joon-ha
answer me!

302
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:28,882
Joon-ha!

303
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:40,361
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

304
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:47,601
Joon-ha
come back alive!

305
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:51,703
Joon-ha!

306
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:02,811
Joon-ha!

307
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:05,489
Joon-ha!

308
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,525
Joon-ha!

309
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,594
Joon-ha!

310
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:13,760
Joon-ha!

311
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:18,097
Joon-ha!

312
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,403
Joo-hee!

313
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:30,444
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

314
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:34,421
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

315
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:35,479
Tae-soo!

316
00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:37,019
Joon-ha!

317
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,888
Joon-ha!

318
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:46,331
Joon-ha!

319
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,706
You have to come back alive!

320
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,298
Joon-ha!

321
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:59,439
Joon-ha
come back alive!

322
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:03,109
You have to come back alive!

323
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,178
Got it?

324
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,630
Medic! Medic!

325
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:10,470
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

326
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:12,576
Stop it!

327
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:15,443
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

328
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,178
Joon-ha, you bastard!

329
00:43:21,514 --> 00:43:24,483
Where are you going?

330
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,943
Come back!
Corporal OH!

331
00:47:32,431 --> 00:47:38,131
You haven't changed at all

332
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,599
Just like in the past

333
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:44,867
you're still pretty

334
00:47:48,314 --> 00:47:52,512
I've aged a lot

335
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:09,326
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

336
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:20,669
How's Tae-soo doing?

337
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,381
I guess he's doing alright

338
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:40,828
Why didn't you get married?

339
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:50,033
Well, I did

340
00:48:58,551 --> 00:49:01,714
I heard

341
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:10,057
I had so much to tell you

342
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:15,758
But now that we've met
I can't remember

343
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:33,708
It's a piano doll

344
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:36,515
We have one at my home, too

345
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:44,563
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

346
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:55,000
It looks so much like you back then

347
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:58,136
Doesn't it?

348
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:16,487
We were so innocent back then

349
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:19,554
But the past has gone now

350
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:26,072
I think our feelings took the best of us

351
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:31,533
We cried and laughed at the smallest things

352
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:04,509
How do I look right now?

353
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:09,276
You look healthy

354
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:17,683
But I'd like to see you look happier

355
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:29,200
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

356
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:42,144
Why did you hide that you couldn't see?

357
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,657
It's late

358
00:51:54,827 --> 00:51:57,455
Sorry, I have an appointment

359
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,723
I have to go

360
00:52:52,852 --> 00:52:54,547
I'm sorry

361
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:59,818
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

362
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:05,827
I even came here last night to practice

363
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:11,059
You almost fooled me

364
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:18,709
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

365
00:53:19,712 --> 00:53:21,907
Also...

366
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:31,949
I risked my life to return this necklace to you

367
00:53:40,232 --> 00:53:42,291
Please don't

368
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:48,432
This necklace is yours

369
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:55,338
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

370
00:54:57,443 --> 00:55:01,004
Then a few years later...

371
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:40,652
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

372
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:52,429
Joon-ha's last wish

373
00:55:54,867 --> 00:56:01,966
was for you to spread his dust in this river

374
00:56:06,345 --> 00:56:08,245
Actually

375
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:11,149
Joon-ha

376
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:17,854
got married right after you did

377
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:27,098
Poor guy had a son, too

378
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:55,656
And Joon-ha

379
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:59,523
wanted you to have this

380
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,624
Mommy, it's a rainbow

381
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:14,969
I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day

382
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,568
Until I finished telling this story

383
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:22,753
Open your hands
