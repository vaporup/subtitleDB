1
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,913
Oh, my God...
            Freedom.

2
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,250
         I feel like my
       mascara's running,
     is my mascara running?

3
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,886
It looks good.
         Like the cover
   of Courtney Love's album.

4
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,320
You just need a crown.

5
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,755
There's a crown.

6
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,091
Hey, Noel, Noel,
   can we borrow your crown?

7
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,093
        We just need it
       for like a second.

8
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,194
Wow.

9
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,662
We just got the royal finger.

10
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,731
       I never liked her.

11
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,004
          What did we
        just go through?

12
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:16,575
     I mean, what was that,
    a prom or a Celine Dion
        listening party?

13
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,845
     Don't shoot this part.

14
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,447
   Okay, what is this place?
           Tell us...

15
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,714
 You'll see when we get there.

16
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,683
             Okay,
   we're doing 20 questions.

17
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,418
      What is this place?

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,653
      <i> Do they have food?</i>

19
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,089
    <i> Not have 20 questions.</i>

20
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,623
What,
 you can't just ask a question?

21
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,459
         Aren't we just
      going to the hotel?
       I'm very confused.

22
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,228
<i> I just want to say,</i>
     <i> "Hey, what's up?" to</i>

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,063
       all of the future
     versions of ourselves

24
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,565
   <i> watching this right now.</i>

25
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,434
<i> I hope that</i>
     <i> we all learn to be as</i>

26
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,237
      happy and beautiful
    as these two right here

27
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,808
    'cause they are going to
    have the best prom night
         of any of us.

28
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,444
Hold on, let me get this.

29
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,746
   Tonight could've bit ass.

30
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,951
        Except it didn't
   because we were together.

31
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,254
       Don't make me cry.
     My mascara is already
   fucked up enough as it is.

32
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,722
        You look pretty!

33
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,791
    Guys, I love our group.

34
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,895
   <i> Guys, what are we doing?</i>

35
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,365
 Chill out, just live a little.

36
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,234
 We're not going to get caught.

37
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,735
       This is not legal.
       This is not legal.

38
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,405
<i>Danielle, you're going to love</i>
  <i> that you did this later on.</i>

39
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,074
And Savannah's getting naked.

40
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,143
Oh, no. No, no, no.

41
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,614
         No, Danielle.

42
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,782
If we get a rare disease
        from this water,

43
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,351
         at least we'll
       all die together.

44
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,785
<i> I'm not leaving my dress</i>
      <i> on the wet ground.</i>

45
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,923
      It's dry-clean-only
    and my mom will kill me.

46
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,592
<i> On the count of Celine Dion.</i>

47
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,795
One, two,
          Celine Dion!

48
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,217
No, no, no.

49
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,820
     You can no longer work
    on your taxes from 1998.

50
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,257
      Yeah, I cannot amend
      your '98 return. No.

51
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,662
            Hi, Dad.

52
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,298
      No, no, no, I'm not
  laughing at your situation.

53
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:26,572
             Yeah.
      No, there's a strict
    statute of limitations.

54
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,714
           So sorry,
         I'm so sorry.

55
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,516
        I didn't realize
        my dad wanted me
      to work until 6:00.

56
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,353
        I can't believe
    you're still filling in
 for your dad's old sign girl.

57
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,121
        Yeah, you know,
         I'm just still
      trying to figure out

58
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,090
    what kind of counseling
        I'm going to do.

59
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,392
- Okay, Al, it's show time.
- Let's see it already.

60
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,428
     The decorator just put
     the finishing touches
        on it yesterday.

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,830
After you!

62
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,232
          Oh, my God.

63
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,301
             Sorry.
          That's okay.

64
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,471
Whoa!

65
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,206
Oh, my God.
   You have outdone yourself.

66
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,210
      This is impressive.
       I thought you were
 gonna have, like, a fish tank.

67
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:43,448
Look at the nipples
          on this guy.

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,951
    Oh, my God, we're going
  to be so popular, Savannah.

69
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,686
    That is the VIP section.

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,288
     We can come any night
          of the week

71
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,323
          and have our
       own special space.

72
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:56,061
         It is so sexy.
 I love that we get to be VIP!
 Okay, girls, getting ready...

73
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,496
 Let's get this party started.

74
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,997
         My God... No!

75
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,866
- Last one, grab your penis.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,368
Turn them on like this.

77
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,770
           I love it.

78
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,673
         Hey, no, look,
    my balls won't light up.

79
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,909
Oh, my God,
     that hat is too much.

80
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,211
 I mean it truly is the tiniest
      hat I've ever seen.

81
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,747
        It is, it's like
     suitable for a mouse.

82
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,783
        You need to wear
      it to your wedding.
    I can't, I have a veil.

83
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,117
             Okay,
  games, games, games, games.

84
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,419
           All right,
    the way this game works

85
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,721
     is you write a caption
       for what you think

86
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,990
    the woman in this scene
   is saying to her husband.

87
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,959
    But here is the thing...
       Look, look, look.

88
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,496
        Look, look. Yes,
   you have to make it dirty.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,467
  It'll be fun, it'll be fun,
     so, all right. Ready?

90
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,536
            Set, go.

91
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,943
        All right, stop.

92
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,347
       Stop, stop, stop,
         pencils down.
        I will go first.

93
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,048
         He said he had
       a package for me.

94
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,486
      All right, Danielle,
            you go.

95
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:59,891
      I love getting mail.
   But I spelled it m-a-l-e.

96
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,626
Oh, wow.

97
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,795
    It's perfect. All right,
     Meg, Meg, Meg, you go.

98
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,864
           All right.
         So, I wrote...

99
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,368
           Hi, Matt,
    this is to certify that

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,104
        this is the big
      fat cock I ordered.

101
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,479
      Wait, why would you
     put Matt's name in it?

102
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,181
     Well, this is supposed
    to be about you, right?

103
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:27,185
  No, they're about marriage,
 they're not about my marriage.

104
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,422
    Right, but it's a joke,
     like everyone else's.

105
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,158
         Well, it's not
     like everybody else's.

106
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,262
         It was a joke.
    It wasn't a prediction.
           You know.

107
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,297
            A joke.

108
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,701
How about we do another one?

109
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,470
       And why would you
       tweak the nipples
         on the Buddha?

110
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,773
          That seemed,
      like, disrespectful.

111
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:52,077
 Disrespectful to who? To you?
  Did you convert to Buddhism?

112
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,047
     No, that's disgusting.
       I'm not Buddhist.

113
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,584
     It's... That's Buddha.
         That's Buddha!

114
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,455
   Right, right. But you know
 that was a joke about nipples.
             Right?

115
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,757
       And not Buddhism.

116
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,861
     Yeah, Buddha is sacred
      to a lot of people,
         but that is...

117
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,799
      This is a party, so
  let's just forget about it.

118
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,500
   Okay, yeah, no, forgotten.

119
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,169
Um, I mean,
           we can do
     another one of these.

120
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,804
              Yes.

121
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:23,275
So this lady has a plunger
   and there's a butt crack.

122
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,490
              Hey.

123
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:43,462
       Hey, sleepy head.
         Good morning.

124
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,063
            Oh, wow.

125
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,666
I shot these on Tuesday.

126
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,302
         They were such
       an amazing couple.

127
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,305
       They were so open
      to all of my ideas.

128
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,640
     Great. Where is that?

129
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,509
        Over in Seattle.
       We had to go near
      the shipyards though

130
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,344
        so we could get
 something a little more edgy.

131
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,913
         'Cause I mean,
       look at that wall.

132
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,048
Yeah.

133
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,350
              Hey,
   weren't you supposed to go

134
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,619
         to that career
        counselor today?

135
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,988
             Yeah.

136
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,124
      Yeah? You should...

137
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:17,162
       Yeah. Yeah, okay.
       I'll go get ready.

138
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,231
             Good.

139
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,349
Hello, is somebody there?

140
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,985
            It's me,
  you don't have to come out.

141
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,721
          What's this?

142
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,890
          What's what?
 I'm just gonna watch some TV.

143
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,926
      Megan, I don't think
     I like this new habit.

144
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,427
     I spoke with Anthony,

145
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,930
      and he said you were
        meeting with the
    career counselor today.

146
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,132
     My God, I know exactly
    what she's going to say.

147
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,800
   It's just a waste of time.

148
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,236
         Megan, honey,
    I don't want to see you
   throw away your education.

149
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,638
  You have an advanced degree.

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,805
            I know.
  And your father should have

151
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,841
        never given you
        that stupid job
         because now...

152
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,075
        Is that my girl?

153
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,677
 Hey, what are you doing home?

154
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,078
         It's his home.

155
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,446
      Taking the day off.

156
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,781
       Yeah, me too. Hmm.

157
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,149
     Wanna stay for dinner?

158
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,751
             Yeah.
              Ed.

159
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,686
           Hey, is it
     "make your own pizza"
             night?

160
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,221
       Sure, great idea.
          Great idea.

161
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,290
             Yeah.

162
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,047
<i> I promise to love you,</i>
<i>to cherish you and to hold you</i>

163
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,918
       and to be the rock
      in our relationship
   for the rest of our days.

164
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,488
        <i> I promise to be</i>
      <i> your baby's breath</i>
  <i> when we wake each morning.</i>

165
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,856
  <i> And to be your evening rose</i>

166
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,925
         <i> at day's end.</i>

167
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,028
<i> And I promise</i>
    <i> to be your safe harbor</i>

168
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,332
    when the boat is rocking
   and when it's not rocking.

169
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:05,737
<i> I give you</i>
   <i> the bride and the groom,</i>
    <i> Mr. and Mrs. Wanamaker!</i>

170
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,846
       <i> And here they are</i>

171
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,182
      dancing to the song
        Mrs. Wannamaker

172
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,517
      has picked for their
      first dance together

173
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,653
       <i> as man and wife.</i>

174
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,682
         My dad used to
      make yipping sounds

175
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,583
          when I first
    started to take you out

176
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,385
        because he said
       it was puppy love.

177
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,787
            I know.
          I remember.

178
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,723
     Yeah, well, you know,
   but it wasn't puppy love.

179
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:36,428
         No... I mean,
    unless we stayed puppies
   for a seriously long time.

180
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,398
           Listen...

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,833
             What?

182
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,668
            Look...

183
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,406
      I know it's taken me
       a really long time
          to get here.

184
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,442
  What are you talking about?

185
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,677
    Okay, well, you know how
       I took that guy's
      seminar last month?

186
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,945
             Right.

187
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,647
             Well,
   I took a personality test.

188
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,683
     And the test came back
   and the type that I am...

189
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,752
      Is a procrastinator.
        Anth, I mean...

190
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,554
   Who makes up those tests?
            Come on.

191
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,988
            Experts.
             Right.

192
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,957
  Like really smart people...

193
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,392
   But that's not important.

194
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:12,630
    What's important is that
   I've been such a bonehead

195
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:16,901
     in waiting to do this
          for so long.

196
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,071
            No, no!
     Whoa, get up, get up!

197
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,239
             Okay.
           Get up...

198
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,942
         Okay, I'm up,
       and listen, I know

199
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,611
    we have had our trouble
          in the past

200
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,348
 with recognizing our moments,
        but this is it.

201
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,783
      This is our moment.

202
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,017
   No, this isn't our moment,

203
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,019
   this is Allison's moment,
      this is her wedding.

204
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,722
            I know,
     and it's totally cool.

205
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,891
   When I first had the idea,
        I ran it by her

206
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,995
          and she was
        so happy for us.

207
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,630
      And today, at lunch,

208
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,933
     I got a fortune cookie
    that said, "Carpe diem."

209
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,668
          Carpe diem?
              Yes.

210
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,872
  Hey, hey, guys, hey. Megan,
      can you find my mom?

211
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,440
        She has the next
        dance with Matt.

212
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,708
       I think I saw her
       out in the garden.

213
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,144
      Yeah, I'm... I'm...
    I'm gonna come... I'm...

214
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,812
      I'm just a second...
             Right.

215
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,981
       Sorry but she has
        to find my mom.

216
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,049
         No, it's fine.
             Okay.

217
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,319
           It's fine.

218
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,401
      Uh, I'm going to go
    and put the rose petals
      in the bridal suite.

219
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,336
       Right this second?
             Yeah.

220
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,506
       Don't you do that
    just before they leave?

221
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,441
            No, no,
      it's cool right now.

222
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,110
         Okay, I'll...
      Later right? Later.

223
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,713
              Meg?

224
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,782
             Meg...

225
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,419
Hey, excuse me.

226
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,588
             Yeah?

227
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,624
    You look like you party.

228
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,428
    I guess I'm technically
        coming from one.

229
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,997
          Cool. So...

230
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,267
  We can hardly believe this,
  but we all forgot our ID's.

231
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,969
          And I mean,
     normally we would just
 go buy some beer ourselves...

232
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:09,407
 But I guess we look under 21.
     Which is crazy, right?

233
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,743
       I know. Um, so...

234
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,078
      If we gave you some
      money or something,

235
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,180
       would you help us
        straighten this
       whole problem out

236
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,317
        and just buy us
    a six-pack or something?

237
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,319
            Oh, God.

238
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,256
         Um, you could
    totally keep the change.

239
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,927
             Okay.

240
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,962
    Someone did this for me
      when I was your age,

241
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,864
          so I'm going
       to do it for you.

242
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,099
        It's like a rite
       of passage, right?

243
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,935
             Yeah.

244
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,638
        Yeah, I... I had
   a good feeling about you.

245
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,707
     That makes one of us.

246
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,777
Hey, yo,
  can we get some coolers too?

247
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,378
       And some red wine.

248
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,149
        And can you get
     some white wine also?
           Thank you.

249
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:55,386
     You don't have to get
      all that. Thank you.

250
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,557
             Yeah!

251
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,973
          Here you go.
       Drink responsibly.

252
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,408
             Sweet.

253
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,578
     Okay, I'm out of here.
      Goodnight, you guys.

254
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,715
       I'm really sorry.
       Can I have a look
     at that for a second?

255
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,184
        Yeah go for it.

256
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,785
             Okay.

257
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,488
            Almost.

258
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,557
    God, I haven't done this
  since I was in eighth grade.

259
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,693
   Okay, okay, one more time
      and then I'm going.

260
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,065
        Okay, all right,
       thank you so much.

261
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,633
            Come on,
      where are you going?

262
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,168
      Hang out some more.

263
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,237
Come on, stay.

264
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,208
            I mean,
    maybe I've got an hour.

265
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,276
Yeah.

266
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,413
      What are you up to?

267
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:00,451
- Guys, I'm really impressed.
- This is truly art.

268
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,087
              Oh.

269
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,188
           Oh. Okay.

270
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,823
Come on, Megan.

271
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,092
Go right now, go.

272
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,561
Shit.

273
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,399
             Shit.

274
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,406
       You know when you
      go to a party drunk,
  and everybody else is sober.

275
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,775
     Or no. Or maybe like,

276
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,612
   maybe you're the sober one
  and everybody else is drunk.

277
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:31,115
 God, you'd think that somebody
  who you've known for forever

278
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,284
        would have known
 what you meant about nipples,

279
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,819
    and it's like, hey, hey,

280
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:39,524
    maybe like, using Buddha
   as a restaurant decoration

281
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,592
   is the bigger joke, right?

282
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,098
          Or maybe...

283
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,868
         Maybe actually
        they're the ones
   that are telling the jokes

284
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,238
        and I'm the one
      that's missing them.
           You know?

285
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,445
     It makes me really sad
      what you're saying.

286
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,979
          It's sad...

287
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,616
       I don't even know
      what you're talking
       about but still...

288
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,685
              Oh.

289
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,088
     Don't get sad, Misty.

290
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,589
      I'm fine. I'm fine.

291
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,691
         No, no, like,
       you shouldn't get
       drunk and get sad.

292
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,893
            I mean,
        look at Patrick.

293
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,397
         Patrick's sad
       and he hasn't even
       touched his wine.

294
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,632
  His folks are splitting up.

295
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,403
        His dad's being
         a massive dick
        in the divorce.

296
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,704
              Oh.

297
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,573
 That's why we TP'd his house.

298
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,707
      That was his house?

299
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,242
             Yeah.

300
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,277
              Huh?

301
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,214
       So you don't want
       to go out together

302
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,282
        as friends then?

303
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,619
    Just take the sophomore.

304
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,122
           You know,
     just take a real date.

305
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,492
  All right, whatever Annika.
       Whatever you want.

306
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,999
      I'm sorry. I just...
     I totally interrupted.

307
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,303
      What, me and Junior?

308
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:05,176
        No, we were just
    talking about the prom.
    You know, stupid stuff.

309
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,016
       I saw my dad cheat
       on my mom tonight.

310
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,653
            Really?

311
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,657
         I think he was
    about to get a hand job.

312
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,695
          Yeah, my...

313
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,466
   My mom left my dad and I,
   like, seven years ago now.

314
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,802
     It was out of nowhere.

315
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,938
 We don't know why she did it.

316
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,341
 You know why your dad did it?

317
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,345
            I don't.

318
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,182
            Well...

319
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,450
   If you ever want to talk,

320
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,852
            call me.

321
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,520
   You're giving me a phone?

322
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,788
    I have a bunch of them.

323
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,456
    Misty's dad sells them.

324
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,227
       I just pretty much
       just use that one
   to hide stuff from my dad.

325
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,329
            Thanks.

326
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,031
       God, I don't even
     know what time it is.

327
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,832
        How do I, um...
           Oh, no...

328
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,900
           This one?

329
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,236
           Oh, shit.

330
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,338
    Shit, shit, shit, shit.

331
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,349
              Bye,
  thanks for the awesome time.

332
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,898
  Megan, what happened to you?
      Where have you been?

333
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,033
         I'm so sorry.
         I'm so sorry.

334
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,135
         I, uh... I...

335
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,338
              I...
  You know, I was more wasted

336
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,506
      leaving the wedding
         than I knew...

337
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,408
             Okay.
        And by the time
      I got to the store,

338
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,876
     I realized I shouldn't
        even be driving.

339
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,180
      And then I got sick
        and I was puking
        in some bushes,

340
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,015
  and then my dress got dirty,

341
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,986
       and then I had to
      leave the car there
      and take a cab here.

342
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,054
       And now I'm back.

343
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,026
           I thought
      you got upset about,

344
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,195
  we'll call it the kneeling,

345
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,530
      and that you didn't
     come back on purpose,

346
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,566
        but that didn't
         seem like you.

347
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,502
       No, no, I'm sorry.

348
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,239
           I'm sorry.
    I got scared, I'm sorry.

349
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,841
           I just...
         I don't know.

350
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,410
            Oh, God,
  I'm a mess right now, look,

351
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,480
     can we... Can we talk
      about this tomorrow?

352
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,083
            Well...

353
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,052
       Well, baby, no...

354
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,121
              No?
              No.

355
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,160
           We can't.
             Right.

356
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:40,631
        Because we have
     wasted so much time...

357
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,900
         We should have
     just made it official

358
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,503
      and our time is now.

359
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,344
  I know why you're hesitant.

360
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,314
              Why?

361
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,950
       It's the planning
        and the pressure

362
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,054
     and all the trappings
          of all that.

363
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,555
       But we don't have
       to do it that way.

364
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,956
              No?

365
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,126
       No, because we...

366
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,663
         We can elope.

367
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,165
        I was thinking.

368
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,367
        We don't have to
       tell our parents,

369
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,569
        we don't have to
       tell our friends.

370
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,304
Really?

371
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,006
         We could go to
       a beach or Vegas.

372
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,008
      I was thinking Vegas

373
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,877
      'cause we could just
      check that step off

374
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,680
        and we could be
       married tomorrow.

375
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,582
       Would you do that?
       Would you do that?

376
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,417
     Yes. I would do that.

377
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,486
             Okay.
        I would do that.

378
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,826
          Wow, we have
       Matt and Allison's
        brunch tomorrow.

379
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,295
        But we can do it
         the day after.

380
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,697
           We can go
    the day after tomorrow.

381
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,471
Yeah.

382
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,173
  I can't the day after that.

383
00:22:56,175 --> 00:23:00,378
       What do you mean,
           why? Why?

384
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,448
My God,
     I really wanted to...

385
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,285
         To go to that
 personal development seminar.

386
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,322
         Wait, really?
             Yeah.

387
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,023
           On Orcas?

388
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,092
          Yeah, right.

389
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,562
    Ah, because, you know...

390
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,633
      I'm twirling a sign
          for my dad,

391
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:30,207
     and I don't know what
     to do with my future.

392
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,509
      That's awesome, Meg.

393
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,810
             Yeah.

394
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,612
      I'm so all for that.

395
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,848
        That's amazing.
          You know...

396
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,652
       They do this thing
      where they give you
     an animal to help you

397
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,588
         visualize new
      behavioral patterns.

398
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,157
     And mine was a shark.

399
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,059
   And it helped to remind me
         that I need to
       keep progressing,

400
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,495
   otherwise I'll just sink.

401
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,733
          Yeah, so...

402
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:59,637
       After your seminar
          on Orcas...

403
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,839
             Uh...

404
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,908
          Will you...

405
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,978
         Megan Burch...

406
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,948
   Run off to Vegas with me?

407
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,654
          Yes, I will.

408
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,857
           You will.

409
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,926
         There it goes.

410
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,432
          I love you.

411
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,500
          I love you.

412
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,735
            Mmm-hmm.

413
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,970
      I love you so much.

414
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,039
I love you so much.

415
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,923
      What happened to you
          last night?

416
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,292
         I'm so sorry.
          I got sick.

417
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,295
             Sick?

418
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:02,433
 She had a few too many drinks
          and ended up
   vomiting in a parking lot.

419
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:03,834
           I'm sorry.

420
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,769
         Why would you
   possibly drink that much?

421
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,606
     Now you are not in any
     of the table pictures.

422
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,407
        You are missing
        from the video.

423
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,243
     Megan Ashley Burch...

424
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,578
        You had everyone
        scared to death.
 Where the hell have you been?

425
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,247
          I got sick.

426
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,315
              Oh.
     She said she got sick.

427
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,553
         I just, uh...

428
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,956
       I just need to...
         I've got to go
       and do something.

429
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,025
        It's okay, baby.

430
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,807
Hon.

431
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,609
      I was just leaving.
            Wait...

432
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,977
   What's going on with you?

433
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,547
    What's going on with me?
             Yeah.

434
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,615
           I saw you.

435
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,651
           I saw you.

436
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:57,621
      So right now I don't
   even want to look at you.

437
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,991
    Let's just quietly talk
    about this for a second.

438
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,927
        Talk about what?
  I'm sorry, talk about what?

439
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,195
         I don't know.

440
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:10,000
     People grow together,
        they grow apart.
     It's always shifting.

441
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:14,071
           Oh, right.
   Three decades of marriage
             to Mom

442
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:18,842
  and you're going to describe
    what I saw as shifting?

443
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,911
             Wait.

444
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,449
         Hey. You okay?

445
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,517
             Yeah.

446
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,918
    Okay. Savannah and Theo

447
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,420
      want to talk to us.
          About what?

448
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,322
    I don't know. Come here.
             Okay.

449
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,524
Oh, good,
      there you are. So...

450
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,593
        Theo and I have
      been talking it over

451
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:38,596
        and even though
        you guys aren't
     technically married...

452
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:42,032
     You know, you're doing
  the whole Goldie Hawn thing.

453
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,934
     You know, you've been
      together the longest

454
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,235
       and you are young

455
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,371
       and you are fun...
            So fun.

456
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,374
         And, you know,
  if we're being responsible,
         you're stable.

457
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,409
       And what we wanted
        to ask you is...

458
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,510
             Is...
             Ready?

459
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,281
        Would you be our
       baby's godparents?

460
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,416
             Whoa!

461
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,452
- Are you kidding?
- No.

462
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,120
            Sure...
        Yeah, we would.

463
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,190
We would be honored.

464
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,992
        See, I told you.
        Is it official?

465
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,694
       You are looking at
     Juppiter's godparents.

466
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,630
        There they are.
           Juppiter?

467
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,697
             Yeah,
     nobody has that name.

468
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:14,765
            No one.
             Oddly.

469
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:15,966
           I bet not.

470
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,269
        Like the planet.
  Except two "P's," two "P's."

471
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,387
       You know, I think
      this is going to be
      really good for me.

472
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,088
            Me too.

473
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,092
    It's like you're having
    your bachelorette party
       but at a seminar.

474
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,161
             Yeah.

475
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,407
 Maybe you'll get a shark too.

476
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:57,808
             Maybe.

477
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,877
        All right, bye.

478
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,047
          Drive safe.

479
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,184
              Bye.
              Bye.

480
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,510
             Hello?

481
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,245
         Hey, what up?
          It's Annika.

482
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,013
      Uh, huge emergency,

483
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,316
         could you come
       down to my school
   and pretend to be my mom?

484
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:13,751
          Whoa, what?

485
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,786
     Yeah, I'm supposed to
    have this parent/teacher
       conference today,

486
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,254
   but I threw the note out.

487
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,989
      So my counselor said
    she's gonna call my dad,

488
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,159
   but he will be super pissy
          if he has to
      come sit down here.

489
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,627
        <i> So I told them</i>
 <i> my mom already knew about it</i>

490
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,498
   so basically my point is,
 could you just come down here

491
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,967
  and pretend to care about me
     for like ten minutes?

492
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,268
         <i> I'll owe you,</i>

493
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,403
      and I know I already
     owe you for the beer,

494
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,640
       but I will really,
        really owe you.

495
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,610
        But, but I don't
      look related to you.

496
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,347
      <i> Maybe I'm adopted.</i>
 <i> What the fuck does she know?</i>

497
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,249
       Probably not much.

498
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,317
       So will you come?

499
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,403
              Hi.

500
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,905
            My God,
   you actually came through.

501
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,174
          And you have
     the fake wedding ring.

502
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,209
          Nice touch.

503
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,378
          Mrs. Hunter?

504
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,446
              Hey.

505
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,916
             Hello.

506
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,989
              So,
  I'm becoming concerned that

507
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,993
      Annika is not taking
   steps towards her future.

508
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,461
            Got it.

509
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:36,233
             Well,
  I'll be sure to talk to her
       about it at home.

510
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,336
      So, we're good here?

511
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:43,407
     Mrs. Hunter, I realize
         you must have
    a very busy life. But...

512
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,844
       I was hoping that
      we could all come up
       with a plan today.

513
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,982
      Okay, sure. A plan.
        Do you have one?

514
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,686
           Oh, uh...

515
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,422
    I don't know. I mean...

516
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,091
           It kind of
      seems stupid to plan
      that far in advance

517
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,727
     when you're just gonna
        change your mind
         anyway, right?

518
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,964
   I mean, say you had a kid,

519
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,433
      and then you realize
           you didn't
      really want the kid.

520
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:10,901
     Was there a pregnancy?

521
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:14,972
       No, she's talking
       about her mom. Me.

522
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,740
            Her mom.

523
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,744
        And as her mom,
        I'd say that...

524
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,280
        I'm sure it does
      seem kind of stupid

525
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:27,317
          to make some
       sort of rigid plan
     for the future. But...

526
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,922
      It's stupider not to
     start paying attention
         to who you are

527
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,991
   and what makes you happy.

528
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,494
   Otherwise, you just float.

529
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,099
             So...

530
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,002
 There's the start of her plan.

531
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:49,139
  Good meeting, Mrs. Halpsky.
        You've given us
     a lot to think about.

532
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,742
       Yes, well... Yes.

533
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,845
       So this is kind of
         an interesting
       job to have, huh?

534
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,947
     What kind of licensing
         does it take?

535
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,216
      Are you questioning
       my qualifications?

536
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,786
    No. No. Never mind. I...

537
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:05,422
      I was just curious.
            Come on.

538
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:14,398
      You worked her over.

539
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,303
       You can take that
    stuff off now, you know.
     She totally bought it.

540
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:22,706
   Remember half an hour ago
         when you said
      you'd really owe me?

541
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,142
  Holy shit. You collect fast.

542
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:28,912
 I need to lay low for a week.
     Your dad works, right?

543
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,888
       So, my dad usually
    comes home around 7:00,

544
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,993
  but he's going to some lame,
        divorcee mixer,
       so he'll be late.

545
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,062
    This is the living room.

546
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,397
          And this...

547
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,701
       Ooh, this is Lynn.

548
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,736
         Jesus Christ.
            Yeah...

549
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,504
       My mom bought her
   when she saw<i> Finding Nemo</i>

550
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,074
    'cause she thought that
    turtle was cute, but...

551
00:32:57,076 --> 00:33:00,243
     Then she realized that
    this kind doesn't swim.

552
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:03,246
    So she ditched you, too,
       didn't she, Lynn?

553
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,082
     You don't really have
    to do anything for her.

554
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,718
    Just don't step on her.
  She likes to hide back here.

555
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,519
     Do I need to feed her?

556
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:14,191
        Um, you can try,
     but we're pretty sure
       she's an anorexic.

557
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,794
           Cool pet.

558
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,764
    So, this is the kitchen.
       You can basically
     eat whatever you want.

559
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:24,167
  But this is his box of wine.

560
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,069
      So if you have some,
         use the funnel

561
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,238
      with the Tupperware
      and fill it up with
     a little bit of water.

562
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,275
        It's what we do.
         I don't think
       he really notices.

563
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:36,146
   And tonight, this guy Dan
  has invited some people over

564
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,547
       'cause his parents
        are out of town.

565
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,915
   So if you want to do that,
         we can do it.

566
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,384
      And then we'll just
       sneak you back in.

567
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,452
             Okay.

568
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:48,125
     <i> And I'm using Humid.</i>
 <i> It's a really gorgeous green.</i>

569
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,063
Under.
 Yeah, on the edge. All right.

570
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,431
           You ready?
             Yeah.

571
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,299
       You know, I always
   wanted to try a smoky eye.

572
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,801
        But I thought it
    might be too much on me.

573
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,770
    I don't know. I like it.

574
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:01,671
              Hey!

575
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,707
             Whoa!
   You're supposed to knock.

576
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,309
        Write a letter.
       I don't know you.

577
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,111
             Megan.
             Craig.

578
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,179
      She's a new friend.

579
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,281
       You're supposed to
       be at that mixer.

580
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:15,385
          Yeah, well,
     I came home to change
 so I don't look like a lawyer.

581
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,686
              Wow.

582
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,522
      High school students
          are looking

583
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,257
      rougher and rougher
          these days.

584
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,491
        Just graduated.

585
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,326
God,
   you can be rude sometimes.

586
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,728
             Look,
   she's a new friend, okay?

587
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,096
        We're just gonna
       go to the movies.

588
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:29,466
    Right well, let me know
      if the teen vampire
         gets the girl.

589
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:34,638
       And be home by 10.
        I know I'll be.

590
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,310
           You know,
  why doesn't he just stay out
 if he wants to be less lonely?

591
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,379
     I don't know. Come on.

592
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,963
        Is this turning
     into a college party?

593
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,532
   Where's the fucking beer?
           This way?

594
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,070
Junior!

595
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,872
           What's up?
              Hey.

596
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,408
        Long time no see
          since Econ.

597
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,078
       Yeah, that goes on
     around him all night.

598
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,414
Yo. Yo, Annika!

599
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,082
              Hey.
              Hey.

600
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,384
           Oh, yeah,
         let's do this!

601
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,186
        It's not a party
         till we start.

602
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,755
      Who's gonna help me
        get this going!

603
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,726
             Here.

604
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,963
         Yeah. This is
 definitely having people over.

605
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,307
           Oh, yeah.
 I've always loved Neil Young.

606
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,376
     I just discovered him.

607
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,284
Okay,
  I'm gonna put the ice cube.

608
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,585
      It's gonna be good.

609
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,922
  Okay, on the count of three.
             One...

610
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,158
Two!

611
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,425
          Okay, girls.
       We need the hoop.

612
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:05,595
     Come on. Hand it over.
        Yeah, thank you.

613
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:24,080
       Hey, I think it's
       past your curfew,
   so we should probably go.

614
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,718
        This is my mom.

615
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,254
     Wow, that's your mom?

616
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:34,591
        Yeah, she models
       for catalogs now.

617
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:40,597
 I've come across them before.
       I don't even know
      who she is anymore.

618
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,098
       You don't see her?

619
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,501
 We did phone calls for a bit.

620
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,504
     It didn't really last.

621
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,907
   Do you know where she is?

622
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:55,812
      There's an address.
   On the child support check
       she sends my dad.

623
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:59,015
     He puts them in a box
     labeled, "No, thanks."

624
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,753
        God, I'm sorry.

625
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,956
           I'm really
       emotional tonight.

626
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,725
      I was already upset
         about Junior,

627
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,561
    and then I came in here,
         and I saw her.

628
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,531
       You like him, huh?

629
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,600
             Yeah.

630
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,836
        I might even be
       in love with him.

631
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,137
              Wow.

632
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:25,141
    Well, are you sure that
   he doesn't like you, too?

633
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,778
   Sure he does. As a friend.

634
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,847
           Oh, right.

635
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,821
           You know,
         he's probably
        checking her tag

636
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,356
       to see what cycle
         to wash it in.

637
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,790
             Yeah.

638
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,859
            Mmm-hmm.

639
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,963
    Uh, Megan, can I borrow
  your car keys for a second?

640
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,732
       I think I left my
     sweatshirt out there.

641
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,834
       Yeah. Sweatshirt's
      a really good idea.

642
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,203
            Thanks.

643
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:54,504
          You know...

644
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,772
   When I was in high school,

645
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,374
      there was a guy that
    everyone said liked me.

646
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,843
    It was all I heard about
        from my friends.

647
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:03,546
   But he never acted on it,
   so I kept getting unsure.

648
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,781
       Well, did he ever
     do anything about it?

649
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,915
             Yeah.

650
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,717
        Sophomore year,
       he asked me to be

651
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,786
         his girlfriend
     in front of everyone.

652
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,855
  Oh... And did you like him?

653
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,824
       Yeah. He was cute.
         Kind of artsy.

654
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,526
    He noticed these details
        about the world

655
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:19,429
 and talked about them in a way
         that no other
     high school guy would.

656
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,531
      And he was always...

657
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:25,001
         He was always
     taking pictures and...

658
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:30,407
 Pulling quotes out of nowhere
        which I thought
        was pretty deep.

659
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:33,276
     But, but maybe it was
      the start of a habit

660
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:37,113
  of waiting for other people
   to make decisions for me.

661
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,182
           You know?

662
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,154
Okay.

663
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,225
           Ooh, okay.

664
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,860
        Okay. He's going
      to be waiting inside

665
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,729
    to do a whole deposition
             on me.

666
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,564
      So just go straight
           to my room
     and wait for me there.

667
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,334
       You don't have to
      take your shoes off.

668
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,538
Hey. Where you been?

669
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,941
           Whoo! God!
    That movie was so long.

670
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,479
Hi.
              Hey.

671
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,082
          Did you find
     everything you needed?
             Yeah.

672
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:14,150
     Yeah? All right, cool.

673
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,455
      Are you in trouble?

674
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,658
  No. He just made me tell him
 the plot to the movie we saw.

675
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,426
        And then he read
         the same plot
       to me back online

676
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,928
     to see if it matched.

677
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,329
      But I just told him
         a movie I saw

678
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,764
           last week
     when I ditched school.

679
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,833
             Ah-ha!

680
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:34,604
      Yeah. I didn't think
            you had
 an interest in ventriloquism.

681
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:38,842
        You. Downstairs.
        We need to talk.

682
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,110
           I'm sorry.

683
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:42,078
      It's not your fault.

684
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,659
          Who are you?

685
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,963
         Megan. Burch.

686
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,132
            Mmm-hmm.

687
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,933
         And I get that
     this can sometimes be

688
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,802
     sensitive information
          for a woman,

689
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,837
      but how old are you?

690
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,773
         I'm in my 20s.

691
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,441
            Uh-huh.

692
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:14,677
        And why are you
   sleeping over at my house?

693
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,312
           Or I guess
    the larger question is,

694
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,983
    why are you hanging out
       with my daughter?

695
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,451
 It's kind of hard to explain.

696
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,919
             I bet.

697
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,989
          No, I mean,
  I've never really tried to.
      Not even to myself.

698
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:29,492
  I like hearing things better
  when they're not rehearsed.

699
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,661
        All right, uh...

700
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,997
     I grew up around here.

701
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,932
      Well, no, I didn't,
       I mean, you know,

702
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,067
        across the lake
       on the east side.

703
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,502
             Uh...

704
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,641
      I got "best couple"
       with my boyfriend
        in high school.

705
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:48,344
         And I started
   an alternative dance team
        with my friends

706
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,879
          meaning that
           we danced
        to Beastie Boys

707
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:53,049
       instead of top 40.
      It was kind of cool.

708
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,386
    After college, I worked
       some random jobs,
         time went by.

709
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,687
      I'm gonna skip to...

710
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,122
      Okay, I went back to

711
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:03,193
 grad school to get my marriage
  and family therapist degree

712
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,762
       because I thought
        I wanted to have

713
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:08,364
      honest conversations
          with people.

714
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,132
            Mmm-hmm.

715
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,036
         But... But...

716
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,206
      I did my internship
            and I...

717
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:19,476
       I couldn't relate
     to any of my clients.

718
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,978
   I felt like a total fraud.

719
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,049
         So, you know,
     I kind of found myself
     in this place. Like...

720
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:30,353
       This kind of weird
       in-between place,
    you could say, you know?

721
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:34,157
       And, I don't know,
    I was kind of floating.

722
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,726
   And, and then I met Annika
     at the grocery store,

723
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,228
       and I skateboarded
     with her for a minute.

724
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,597
        And, and it was
     really fun, you know.

725
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,899
     I liked skateboarding.
          I missed it.

726
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,001
    I think it was just nice
   to hang out with somebody

727
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,770
     that cut me some slack
         for a change.

728
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,308
     I'm sorry. This isn't
     gonna make any sense.
           This is...

729
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,310
    You know, this isn't...

730
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:58,548
 It's not gonna make any sense,
    so just fucking sue me.

731
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,717
     I'm sorry, that wasn't
   meant to be a lawyer joke.

732
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,919
        It's not a joke
     if it's not insulting.

733
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,721
         I don't think
    I know any lawyer jokes.

734
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,689
      Oh, no, wait, I do.
   I've got one from my dad.

735
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,025
        What do you call
       5,000 dead lawyers
   at the bottom of the sea?

736
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,293
         A good start.

737
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,861
   Hey, did you hear the one
     about the grown woman

738
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,930
    who started hanging out
        with a bunch of
        pubescent kids?

739
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,331
           No, what?

740
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,268
      No, I'd never heard
      of it before either.

741
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,341
            Come on,
     you gotta help me out.
 So what... What were you like?

742
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,444
          Uh, well...

743
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,247
       Senior year, I was
   voted "best gorgeousness,"

744
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,349
  and most likely to pump gas

745
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,218
when I get older.

746
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,954
      And then I realized
    it would be fairly easy
        for me to argue

747
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,590
    for a living if I wasn't
   doing it on my own behalf.

748
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:46,095
       And then there was
         this intensely
       poufy white dress.

749
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:50,767
 It gets a little hazy because
  of all the tulle or taffeta.

750
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:55,572
   And then there was a kid,
      and then the taffeta
     floated out the door.

751
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:58,241
 And that brings us to tonight.

752
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:00,910
            Tonight.

753
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,879
      What a cluster fuck.

754
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,681
  You talking about the mixer?

755
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,382
             Yeah.
              Mmm.

756
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:09,185
        At these things,
        women insist on
     touching your forearm

757
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,887
          in this very
       deliberate manner.

758
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,455
       These touches are
      meant to communicate

759
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:15,024
     gold-star level skills
        in listening...

760
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,693
       In connectedness.
           Oh, yeah.

761
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:17,860
       Do you know about
     this kind of gesture?

762
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,963
    Yeah. You mean this one?

763
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,098
         Yes. Do go on.

764
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,232
           Do go on.
             Right?

765
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,634
             Yeah.
           That's it.

766
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:26,402
Um...

767
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,471
        Dad, you do know
     you can't lecture her
       all night, right?

768
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,639
        She's not a kid.

769
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,007
          Oh, really?

770
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,076
     You snuck your friend
         into my house,

771
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,111
         I think you're
      lacking say-so here.

772
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,747
      If you let her spend
  the night in your locker...

773
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,682
 No, that's school's property.

774
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:44,387
         If you let her
    spend the night in your
  backpack. Yes. No, that's...

775
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,456
        Actually I paid
       for the backpack.
             Okay.

776
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,825
 So I guess that's my property.
         I don't know.

777
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:51,828
       Why don't you put
        a case together.
         And come back.

778
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,396
           All right.
 When you got something solid.

779
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,497
      I'm gonna go to bed.

780
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,633
           You sure?
  We can talk about this more.

781
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,034
         Okay, goodbye.

782
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:00,069
       Good night, honey.

783
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,909
     The property argument
          is inelegant
  but it ends things quickly.

784
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,254
          Uh, listen,
 I deal with a lot of scumbags
       on a daily basis.

785
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,891
       So I've developed
      a real appreciation
         for the truth.

786
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,193
        I've gotta think
    that if you were lying,

787
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:28,598
    you'd make up an excuse
   that's less fucking weird.

788
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,668
      You do realize that
  reverting to a teenage life

789
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,337
   and sneaking into my house
       is weird, correct?

790
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,272
             Right.

791
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:38,975
        And why were you
      trying to sleepover?

792
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,611
             Uh...

793
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,446
        The lease on my
       apartment ran out,

794
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:46,082
      and I can't get into
    my new place for a week.

795
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,251
     And my, my friends...

796
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,055
            I just,
    I didn't want to, uh...

797
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,258
        I didn't want to
  involve them or my parents.

798
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,764
        All right, um...

799
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,500
            Fuck it.
   I'm not gonna kick you out
    at 1:00 in the morning.

800
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,835
         Oh, thank you.

801
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,271
     You're not sleeping on
 the floor of my kid's bedroom.

802
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,807
        I'm putting you
       in the guest room.

803
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,249
    Got enough pillows here?

804
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,652
     Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

805
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:26,823
 Please don't let this decision
      become bad parenting
          on my part.

806
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:31,027
      I won't. I really...
        I really won't.

807
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,969
     Wait. He let you stay?

808
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,370
  Yeah. I'm in the guest room.

809
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,773
      I'm gonna let you do
     something too, Annika.

810
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,843
       I'm gonna let you
      do additional chores
         for two weeks.

811
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,378
       Oh, no, hey, look,
         it's my fault
      she got in trouble.

812
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,147
         She's the one
     who made the decision.

813
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,849
       Hey, throw another
         tart in there
       for me, will you?

814
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:54,517
        It's your house.

815
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,619
   It is my house. You know,
       I think I'm gonna
      work from home today

816
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,989
     because I really have
  no good reason to trust you.

817
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,657
          No offense.
          None taken.

818
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,161
     Yo, your ride is here.

819
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,462
Patrick.

820
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:08,397
   What happened to us, man?
    You don't write anymore.

821
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,867
     That's a great shirt.
            Listen.

822
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,502
        I know you want
       to kill your dad.

823
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:15,071
      Sometimes I do, too,
     but I'm doing my best

824
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,073
    to keep this case civil
          on his end,

825
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:20,576
      and toilet papering
       isn't gonna help.

826
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:24,547
     So if you want to take
      some aggression out
     on a father figure...

827
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,549
    Let's get scrappy, man.

828
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,017
      So you can move on.

829
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,086
            Whoosh!

830
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,289
    You're a divorce lawyer?

831
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,424
      Yeah, he's my dad's.

832
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,493
  Wait, do you live here now?

833
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,563
           All right.

834
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:41,731
             Yeah,
    we should go to school.

835
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:44,433
      Dad, stop. Just go.

836
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,402
     Thanks for the banana,
          Mr. Hunter.

837
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,806
      Seriously, Patrick.
       Help me out, okay?

838
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:51,374
           I'm not...
   I'm not kidding actually.

839
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,182
           Mmm. Good.

840
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,587
       I think I cracked
      her eating disorder.

841
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,256
            Really.

842
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,458
         She is feeling
          so confident
        about her body.

843
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,428
     Yeah. I can see that.

844
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,166
   Did you see the mail come?

845
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,235
          No, not yet.

846
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,038
       Show me something.
       What have you got?

847
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,976
          Well, okay,
     I'm working on a flip.

848
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,812
  So you flip it around and...
             Whoa!

849
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,915
      And then you get on.
         You wanna go?

850
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,083
            Come on.

851
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,217
        I'm middle-aged.

852
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:13,022
      No, look. Have a go.
       Come on. Come on.

853
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,223
             Okay.

854
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,093
 Just sort of like stand there.

855
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,662
      You want to stand to
  make it go, like, this way.

856
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,764
             Okay.

857
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:25,835
           Oh, geez.
    That almost hit my dick.
     Okay. That's not good.

858
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:29,272
      Maybe we should get
  the training wheels for me.

859
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,627
   Have a good day, you guys.

860
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,196
        Can I trust you?

861
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:55,898
         Yes, you can.

862
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,868
  Okay, if you need anything,

863
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,469
          key's under
      the stone tortoise.

864
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,804
        All right. Bye.

865
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,873
              Bye.

866
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,435
              Hey.

867
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,636
             <i> Hey!</i>

868
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,972
           I was just
     retouching some guy's

869
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,474
        back zits out of
        his baby shots.

870
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,910
      That sounds lovely.

871
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:43,946
      Oh, it was amazing.
        It was amazing.

872
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:46,015
      <i> How's the seminar?</i>

873
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,254
   It's so weird being away.

874
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:56,792
 <i> I mean, with you being gone,</i>
        <i> I've just been</i>
   <i> holed up working, and...</i>

875
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,361
  <i> I'm afraid to see everyone.</i>

876
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,862
         'Cause I feel
       like if I see them

877
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,664
         I'm just gonna
      crack and tell them.

878
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,835
   I've just been pretending
   to be some complete loner.

879
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:08,404
          When really
      I'm a secret fiancé.

880
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,942
      <i> So are you getting</i>
      <i> a lot out of this?</i>

881
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:15,811
  Yeah. Yeah, you know, uh...

882
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:19,148
    My animal's a tortoise.
           Go figure.

883
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,618
<i> A tortoise?</i>
   <i> That's sweet.</i>

884
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,022
          <i> I miss you.</i>

885
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,958
          I miss you.

886
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,359
           <i> Oh, hey,</i>

887
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,130
       your dad has left
       like three million
       voicemail messages

888
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:35,898
         so you should
       probably call him.

889
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,400
      'Cause I'm assuming
        he doesn't know
        you're on Orcas.

890
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:42,471
     Oh, yeah, no, I was...
          I was being
      a secret seminarian.

891
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:43,739
         <i> Makes sense.</i>
             Yeah.

892
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:44,840
         <i> Wise choice.</i>

893
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,375
     Thanks. I thought so.

894
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,412
      Look, I've gotta go.
          I gotta go.

895
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,913
          Okay, right.
           All right.

896
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:52,581
          I love you.
      <i> Glad I caught you.</i>

897
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,717
   <i> Love you, too. Bye, baby.</i>
              Bye.

898
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,303
           Oh... Hey.

899
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,008
      Will you go with me
         to see my mom?

900
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,913
             Sure.

901
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,041
           All right.

902
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,660
            My God.

903
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,997
         What is this?

904
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,700
             Um...

905
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,002
      I don't know. It...

906
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,574
      It just kind of felt
  like something I should do.

907
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,450
God.
      She's been in there

908
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,519
      making lemonade for,
       like, 20 minutes.

909
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,888
         I don't think
       she's coming out.

910
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:55,037
       Just take her and
       put her in the car
    and tell her I'm sorry.

911
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,439
       And whatever else
          you need to.

912
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,213
          What could I
       possibly tell her?

913
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,584
       That I thought I'd
     be the really cool mom

914
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:13,389
   that took her to concerts,
       and she'd want to
        borrow my boots?

915
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:18,027
  But then one day I realized
     there's no such thing
         as a cool mom.

916
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:21,697
      That the cool mom is
    really just the bad mom,

917
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,099
           or the mom
     who has become a joke.

918
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:31,040
  Are you Craig's girlfriend?
          Is that why
     you're here with her?

919
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,409
    No. I'm just her friend.

920
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,681
     What does she expect?

921
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,386
 That you serve some lemonade,

922
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:49,658
        and you ask her
      five to 10 questions
        about her life.

923
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,265
           You treat
     somebody badly enough,

924
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:59,702
        you just assume
        they'll be happy
         to let you go.

925
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,175
      She had... Said she
     had to get something.

926
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,287
         So, after I...

927
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,590
          You know...

928
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,559
     I started doing a lot
      of catalog modeling,

929
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,628
         and I ended up
    doing a lot of lingerie.

930
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,597
         Yeah, I know,
    I've seen your pictures.

931
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,100
              Oh.

932
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,402
             Well.

933
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,137
            Anyway,

934
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:39,041
 they send me home with so many
       things from these
      stupid photo shoots.

935
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:41,877
       And I just thought
     that since, you know,

936
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:45,147
        obviously, well,
   you're a growing woman...

937
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:50,419
           And, well,
      maybe there might be
 some things you like in here.

938
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,488
             Um...

939
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,658
     Do you like this one?

940
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,726
    Yeah, it's really nice.

941
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,928
  I think that's about right.

942
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,132
   I mean, do you like black?
   Is black a color you like?

943
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,401
             Sure.
             Great.

944
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,469
      Great, I have more.

945
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,904
      What about florals?

946
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:11,173
            I mean,
 do you wear nightgowns? Or...

947
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,676
         I have thongs.
   Are you into thongs or no?

948
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,011
 I like that one with the bows.

949
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,514
          Great. Yeah.

950
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,719
          That's cute.

951
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,867
       Got room for that?
             Yeah.

952
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,777
       You know, I really
    needed a strapless bra.

953
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,245
            You did?

954
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:53,182
    Yeah. For my prom dress.

955
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,184
   It's actually really good
     that she gave me one.

956
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:58,520
        Yeah. Yeah, no,
       it's really good.

957
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,693
        You should come.

958
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,829
             Where?
          To the prom.

959
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:09,164
        Saturday night.
       It's on this boat
         in Lake Union.

960
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,768
            Oh, no,
  I've gotta go home Saturday,
           remember?

961
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,504
    You know, I've gotta get
       into my new place
    and sort everything out.

962
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:16,872
      I mean, I can't just
     float around forever.

963
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,173
              No.

964
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,676
            Come on.
   You belong there with us.

965
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,618
        Hi. I'm so sorry
      to keep you waiting.
     Can I take your order?

966
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,654
        Can we have two
        mondo chococinos

967
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:35,691
            and two
    boysenberry muffin tops.
       We're celebrating.

968
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:38,060
         10.50, please.

969
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,362
         There you go.
           Thank you.

970
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,269
             Megan?

971
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,320
       Hey. Coinky-dink.

972
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:09,391
      Anthony told us that
  you were working on yourself
        on Orcas Island.

973
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:11,560
 And that you probably weren't
    checking your messages,

974
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,228
       so that's why you
    weren't calling us back.

975
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,463
       Oh, did you call?

976
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,698
           No, my...
      My phone's been off.

977
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,037
             Megan.
      You missed Savannah
        having her baby.

978
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,639
   And you are the godmother.

979
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,407
         The godmother!

980
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,542
           Juppiter?

981
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,643
           Yesterday!

982
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,345
       No, and they went
         with Callisto

983
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,815
        because someone
      at the hospital had
     a Juppiter last week.

984
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,149
              Oh.

985
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,150
        Callisto is one
      of Jupiter's moons.

986
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,718
   Oh, I only knew about Io.

987
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,654
 Yeah, I learned there are 64.

988
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:41,423
   Anyway, the baby is here.

989
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,991
         And you're not
      out of town at all.

990
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,493
      You're not immersed
        in some seminar

991
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:46,361
    trying to get your life
 moving in the right direction.

992
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:51,066
     You are driving around
   getting chococinos with...

993
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:55,604
     Who the hell is that?
 I don't even know who that is.

994
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,239
              Oh.

995
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:58,774
             Meg...
   Is that your drug dealer?

996
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,275
              No.

997
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:02,611
     No. I'm not on drugs.

998
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:07,583
 Okay, look, here's the thing.
         No, I'm not...
    I'm not on Orcas Island.

999
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:10,752
       But I am on Orcas,
    if you think about Orcas
       on a bigger level.

1000
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:12,821
       Like symbolically.

1001
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,259
      I just, you know...

1002
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,294
         I just needed
   a second of personal time.

1003
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:20,696
       You know, I mean,
          it's a week,

1004
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:21,997
    but in terms of my life,
         it's more like

1005
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,632
        just a second to
     get my shit together.

1006
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:28,737
          And then...
      Then I'm going home
   in a couple of days. Okay?

1007
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:33,342
      I feel like I should
      really tell Anthony
      that you never left.

1008
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,077
  What are you talking about?

1009
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,112
          Oh, my God.
        You're supposed
        to be my friend.

1010
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:39,014
   I mean, it was you and me
     and Savan and Danielle

1011
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,783
         before he ever
       even asked me out.

1012
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:44,119
 But I'm not going to tell him.

1013
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,687
            Thanks.

1014
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:50,425
   Because he bought a ring.
         And he's going
       to propose to you.

1015
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,160
  Yeah. That's right. He did.

1016
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:55,097
   I helped him pick it out,
  and it's, like, incredible.

1017
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,732
      So I bet that makes
     you think twice about

1018
00:58:56,734 --> 00:59:00,502
  how ridiculous you're being
  with this fake Orcas stuff.
             Meg...

1019
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:03,238
         I really want
     this wedding for you.

1020
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,741
 And it's not even the wedding.

1021
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:07,843
    It's that we're friends.

1022
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,512
    It's like how our prom,
    it wasn't just a dance,

1023
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:12,414
           it was us
    getting ready together.

1024
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,283
      And then how we all
   lied to our moms together.

1025
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,485
 And stayed at the cheap hotel,

1026
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:19,988
    and went swimming naked
      in that nasty pool.

1027
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,925
       And we all thought
        we were so cool.

1028
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,460
         But if you had
    stayed home that night,

1029
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,429
   then the stories wouldn't
    have made sense to you.

1030
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:30,198
     You wouldn't have been
      a part of everything
       that night meant.

1031
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,103
        And I just think
     now that we're adults,
  our lives are that times 10.

1032
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,774
      What are you saying?

1033
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:43,712
 I'm saying that I'm not going
   to mess things up for you.
            Just...

1034
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:46,048
       Don't mess them up
         for yourself.

1035
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:02,264
           All right.
    What was that all about?

1036
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,400
        Oh, she just had
     a message to give me.

1037
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:08,704
           Um, I need
      to get a baby gift.

1038
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,975
Hey.

1039
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,110
      Where you two been?

1040
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,912
             Um...

1041
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:20,215
        Megan took me to
       get some new bras.

1042
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,416
              Oh.

1043
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:24,486
         How was that?
         Was that fun?

1044
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,122
              Fun?

1045
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,491
        I'm gonna go and
     lie down for a while.
           All right.

1046
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:32,294
  Um, Misty is gonna come over
      and have a sleepover

1047
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,962
         'cause we have
      no school tomorrow.

1048
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,297
    No school, why is that?

1049
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,766
             Yeah,
 it's a staff development day.

1050
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:42,204
  Okay, well, keep Misty away
      from our valuables.

1051
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,973
         I was joking.
        That was a joke.

1052
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,042
         Yeah. I know.

1053
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,177
            Goodbye.

1054
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,246
     Want some poppy snaps?

1055
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,384
        I totally forgot
        about this guy.

1056
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:59,788
          Oh, my God.
       Herschel Thrasher.
      What was his mom on?

1057
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,423
        You really don't
     have a chance in life

1058
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,091
       if your mom wears
         a belly chain.

1059
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,961
Look at
       Tiffany Wilmington
      with her real teeth.

1060
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,029
Oh, my God.

1061
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,697
     Who is she dating now?

1062
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:13,969
  Uh, Kyle Stempano, I think.
         Is that right?

1063
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,071
    I really wouldn't know.

1064
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,839
        I'm gonna go get
       some snacks, okay?

1065
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,541
             Okay.

1066
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:21,376
              Bye.
             Later.

1067
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,512
             Peace!
             Peace!

1068
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,755
              Hey.
              Hey.

1069
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,157
            Come in.
             Yeah?

1070
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,258
      Thanks for knocking.

1071
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,493
           It's okay.
     Thought I'd be polite.

1072
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,328
       Them's the rules.
              Mmm.

1073
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,863
     Can I complain to you?

1074
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,265
        Sure, go ahead.

1075
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,568
         I'm so fucking
    stressed out right now,
     all I want is a drink.

1076
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,171
    I went for the box wine
         in the fridge,

1077
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:53,408
    and it's funny how much
          that vintage
     tastes like tap water.

1078
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:59,648
   Yeah, you know, I'm, yeah.
      The box stuff really
      is never very good.

1079
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,749
              Ah.

1080
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,517
  So, what are you working on?

1081
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,219
 A letter to opposing counsel.

1082
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,021
        During mediation
        my client agreed

1083
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,390
        to give back two
        of her handguns
        to her husband,

1084
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:11,660
     and now she's decided
           they were
   anniversary gifts to her.

1085
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,462
     Wow. That's romantic.

1086
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:15,030
       Are you gonna win?

1087
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,565
       I hope so because

1088
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,702
      it would kill me to
     see a mother separated
         from her guns.

1089
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,673
           Hey, um...

1090
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:28,810
        No, never mind.

1091
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,145
             What?

1092
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:33,215
        You want to come
      get a drink with me?

1093
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,417
              Now?
             Yeah.

1094
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,786
    Well, I'm supposed to be
 in the middle of a sleepover.

1095
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:39,921
              Oh,
  they're like little animals.
     They're like gerbils.

1096
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,057
       They have next to
       no sense of time.

1097
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:44,059
    Aren't you leaving soon?

1098
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:45,260
             Yeah.

1099
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,329
            One pop.

1100
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,907
            Careful.

1101
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,616
     Okay, we gotta hurry.

1102
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,489
          Don't slip.

1103
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,964
           Thank you.

1104
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,032
              Hey.
              Hey.

1105
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,101
    Anybody here? All right.

1106
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,036
         Waitress won't
        give it to 'em.

1107
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,171
             Right.

1108
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:31,239
       So he says, um...

1109
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,008
              Hey.

1110
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,109
      Hey, how you doing?

1111
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,877
      Just about closing.

1112
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:39,781
           Oh, well,
 that's perfect for our needs.
 We just want a round of shots.

1113
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:40,982
            Bourbon.

1114
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,217
         Bourbon. Hey.

1115
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,618
     Wow. Like your style.
           Thank you.

1116
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,187
Bourbon in
     a Mexican restaurant.

1117
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,189
     Can I get a Pacifico?
           Of course.

1118
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,491
       Uh, I think doing
       cheers is cheesy,

1119
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,494
       so if you need to
     touch glass to glass,
         use my watch.

1120
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,563
            So do I.

1121
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,398
              Mmm.

1122
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,833
You have time for another?

1123
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:58,900
              Yes.
             Yeah.

1124
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:00,035
           Thank you.

1125
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:02,470
Twist my arm.

1126
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,473
       So, uh, what's up
     with that Junior kid?

1127
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:08,176
     Is my daughter in love
   with that Rico Suave kid?

1128
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,912
          Whoa, that's
    friend-friend privilege.

1129
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,480
     Can't talk about that.

1130
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,549
       Not much going on
      between the ears on
      that one, is there?

1131
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,551
  Oh, you know, at the moment,
        she doesn't need
        him to be smart.

1132
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:17,752
           Thank you.

1133
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,155
   Yeah, I guess it's easier
       when you're young.

1134
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:24,292
   All you need from someone
 is to feel stupid around them.

1135
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,395
        What do you need
       when you're older?

1136
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,998
          You need to
      feel like you're on

1137
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,567
        the same side of
       what seems stupid.

1138
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,604
              Oh.

1139
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,873
        You really like
   hanging out with her, huh?

1140
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,040
             Yeah.

1141
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,942
       You genuinely like
     hanging out with her?

1142
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:44,246
       I genuinely think
       she's really cool.

1143
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,381
              Huh.

1144
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,618
    You know, good for her.
        I like that kid.

1145
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,953
    I do, I do. I love her.

1146
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:53,755
             Good.

1147
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:57,592
   I'm a little hard on her.
        Maybe I haven't
 been giving her enough credit.

1148
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,861
       She's a good kid.

1149
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,597
   At least she didn't end up
    paying attention to me.

1150
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:06,735
   You know. Could be worse.

1151
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:11,473
        I can't go back
         and fix my own
     fucked up head but...

1152
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:12,941
      She doesn't have to

1153
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,576
           get bitter
      in the first place,
           does she?

1154
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,411
              No.

1155
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,612
            I think
     we need another drink.

1156
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,281
      Let's have a drink.
      Let's have a drink.

1157
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:20,515
           No cheers.

1158
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,584
           No cheers.

1159
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,022
             Right?

1160
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,926
         You know, so,
   monks and priests, right?

1161
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:33,295
       They say they get
    their calling from God.

1162
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:36,998
   But that means that it was
    from something outside.

1163
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,333
         It wasn't from
    something inside, right?

1164
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,735
      And everybody thinks
    that that's just great.

1165
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,170
             Yeah.
             Right?

1166
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,505
     What the fuck, right?

1167
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:44,739
Sorry, guys.

1168
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:45,807
      You're gonna have to
      close your tab out.

1169
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:48,143
- Going home.
- Aw, man.

1170
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,945
           I... I...

1171
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:52,948
       This is your coat.
   So I don't have any money.

1172
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,616
          No, no, no.
       My responsibility.

1173
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:56,785
          Okay, good.
       I dragged you out.

1174
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,753
      Put your money away.

1175
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,755
       Here, it's on me.
           It's on...
          It's on you.

1176
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:04,059
      It's on Blockbuster.
         Gosh darn it.

1177
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,339
         That was fun.
             Yeah.

1178
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,281
        Yeah, I just...
        I just wanna...

1179
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,616
        I just wanna say
        thank you for...

1180
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,751
           For what?

1181
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,186
      For letting me stay.

1182
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:35,690
             Well,
 I loved having you, you know.

1183
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,793
      You're good people.

1184
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,732
           And uh...

1185
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:10,592
           Oh, wait,
   wait, wait, wait, wait...
       Wait, wait, wait.

1186
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,827
    I just... I just, uh...

1187
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,729
    I don't think we should
   finger-bang in the street.

1188
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:15,864
     Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1189
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,532
           You know?
           Of course.

1190
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,235
      No, no, no, no, no.
     We should go to my...
           The house.

1191
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:21,870
          House, yeah,
        yeah, the house.

1192
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:25,774
      Well, maybe we take
    Annika's tee-shirt off.

1193
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:27,776
             Yeah.
 Maybe that's a little creepy.

1194
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:29,611
             Yeah.

1195
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,485
       Yeah. That's hot.

1196
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:40,155
    Yeah, I'm just wearing,
 like, a little tee shirt with,

1197
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,824
   like, crotchless panties.

1198
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,692
     Who's she talking to?

1199
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,161
       Our math teacher.

1200
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:47,529
     Does he know it's her?

1201
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:50,231
              No.
          Okay, good.

1202
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,600
       I'm just gonna...
         I'm just gonna
     brush my teeth, okay?

1203
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,069
    Yeah, yeah, you're good.

1204
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,584
              Hey.
              Hey.

1205
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,652
              Hey.

1206
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,556
        Got a headache?

1207
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:50,758
             Yeah.

1208
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,429
         This is an old
  hangover cure from college.
         You want one?

1209
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,498
             Yeah.

1210
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,238
     It's very scientific.

1211
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,508
    I'm not messing around.

1212
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,576
              No.

1213
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,879
          You know...

1214
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:15,483
          You can stay
      here a little longer
        if you need to.

1215
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:19,487
        Yeah, you know,
      I've gotta get back
       into my new place.

1216
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,556
             So...

1217
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,893
             Okay.

1218
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:42,744
     All right. I'm calling
   Patrick and Junior again.

1219
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:44,812
            Laggies.

1220
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,422
           Do I have
     something on my face?

1221
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:58,092
     Yeah. My dad's saliva.

1222
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,596
           Oh, shit.
             Yeah.

1223
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:03,498
        How about that?

1224
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,834
  I think you're pretty but...

1225
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,036
         That's my dad.

1226
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:10,939
       I... Oh, God, I...
          Annika, I...

1227
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,441
  I don't know what happened,
      you know. I mean...

1228
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,677
         I was thinking
      the whole time like,
  "What are you doing, Megan?"

1229
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,047
        No, no, no, no.
  I really don't need details.

1230
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,987
             Look,
   I've had a couple of hours
       to think about it.

1231
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:30,191
    And I just keep thinking
  about how lonely he's been.

1232
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:33,494
     You know, and how hard
        he's been trying
        with me lately.

1233
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:36,464
        And as much shit
      I talk about him...

1234
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,366
          I love him.

1235
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,568
           You know,
  and I want him to be happy.

1236
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,537
  And I want you to be happy.

1237
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:45,940
    You know, so if you two
  are happy together, then...

1238
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:51,346
   It might be kind of cool.

1239
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:55,617
         And obviously,
     he can't come with us
     when we go out. But...

1240
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,221
           You know,
    if he wanted to take you
  to the movies, or whatever,

1241
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:02,090
      I've decided not to
     lose my shit over it.

1242
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,691
            Annika,
   I don't think that dating

1243
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,226
        is in the future
      for your dad and me.

1244
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,528
        Did I just hear
   you're boning Mr. Hunter?

1245
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,330
    No, it's not like that.

1246
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:11,399
           Ew. Gross.

1247
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,502
          Yo, finally.

1248
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:17,205
    Fucking drop it already,
        I'm here, okay?

1249
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:20,174
Oh, bad mood.

1250
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:21,909
       Hey, the tux place
      is at the other end.

1251
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:24,245
           All right,
    so we'll meet back here
        in like an hour?

1252
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:28,216
     Sure. If you can live
     without me that long.

1253
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,285
      I'm not sure I can.

1254
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,256
       You've gotta dance
    with him tomorrow night.

1255
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:38,092
     I mean, who's to say?

1256
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,364
 Okay, I'm trying this one on.

1257
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:44,799
           It's you.

1258
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,868
            I know.

1259
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:51,472
              No.
              No?

1260
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:55,243
     You wear white to your
     wedding. Not to prom.

1261
01:11:55,245 --> 01:11:57,545
      Shut up. I like it.

1262
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,114
          This is it.
          This is it!

1263
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,984
  I look so fucking good, man.

1264
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,385
       I don't even know
     why those other chicks

1265
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:06,554
         are even gonna
       bother to show up.

1266
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,156
       What do you think?

1267
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,991
     Oh, you look so cute.

1268
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,092
             Good?

1269
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,560
    You should buy it. Yeah.

1270
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:13,628
      Do you have any gum
          in your bag?

1271
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,263
          Right there.
        Little shorter.

1272
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,899
         You can't take
       it a little more.

1273
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,635
    Yeah, but like, shorter.

1274
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,570
      You want my ass out?
              No.

1275
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:24,706
     She wants my ass out.

1276
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,778
           "A and M.
     Best couple forever."

1277
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,915
      He had it engraved?

1278
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,053
        Are you married?

1279
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,357
       I'm only engaged.

1280
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,162
         Only engaged.

1281
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,465
          Who's the A?

1282
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,800
      You don't know him.

1283
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,869
     My dad know about him?

1284
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,406
              No.

1285
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,542
   Are you going back to him?

1286
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,414
              Yes.

1287
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,153
     God, you're even worse
          than my mom.

1288
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:14,188
           You know,
    at least when she pulled
   my dad into her bullshit,

1289
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:16,824
        she didn't know
      she was gonna leave.

1290
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,700
           Oh, shit.

1291
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:32,540
          God, Megan,
     don't even turn around
   and look at me right now.

1292
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,243
     I'll swear on whatever
    you want me to swear on.

1293
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,645
    I really like your dad.
      I wasn't faking it.

1294
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:39,480
  You're a huge fucking liar.

1295
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:41,249
      Even your fake ring
    was fake at being fake.

1296
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:43,317
      Who knows what else
        you're trying to
        lie to me about.

1297
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:45,186
   She's really hurt, Megan.

1298
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,255
      Oh, shut up, Junior.
      You pulled your own
    bullshit with her, too.

1299
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:49,357
     Oh, don't you even try
    to bring him into this.

1300
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:51,993
      Can you please stop
      the fucking yelling
       while I'm driving?

1301
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,095
     Who gives a fuck about
     your dad's love life?

1302
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,630
         He helps break
       up other people's
         relationships

1303
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:57,098
       every fucking day.

1304
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,199
Don't be a dick to Annika

1305
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,634
          just because
       your dad's a dick

1306
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,035
    and her dad's trying to
     bring home some cash.

1307
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:02,804
        Shut up, Misty!
        How does any...

1308
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,705
          I don't know
        what crawled up
       your ass today...

1309
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:08,176
        You want to hear
        what crawled up
        my ass, Annika?

1310
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,412
Oh, God!

1311
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,613
          Oh, my God.

1312
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:13,948
          Oh, my God.
         Are you okay?

1313
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,450
        Is anybody hurt?
         Are you okay?

1314
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,418
- Is your neck okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1315
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,487
             Okay.

1316
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,690
I'm drunk, Megan.

1317
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:30,631
       He's sending me to
   boarding school next year.

1318
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,267
         And she didn't
     even fight him on it.

1319
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,271
      I opened the bottle
     of wine you bought me,

1320
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:39,373
          and I put it
      in the OJ container.

1321
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:42,143
         I just didn't
     want to care anymore.

1322
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,247
             Okay.

1323
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:50,318
 Okay, everyone out of the car.
   Out of the car right now.

1324
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,555
    When the cops get here,
         I was driving.

1325
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:01,562
      The wheels slipped.
  I think my palms got sweaty.

1326
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:04,799
    Can you touch your nose
      with your left hand?

1327
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,868
            With...

1328
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,973
     Are you able to recite
    the alphabet backwards?

1329
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:13,407
             Uh...

1330
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:16,777
           Z-X-Y-V...

1331
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:20,448
    No, W, W, V... Oh, God.

1332
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,849
         I don't think
      that I could do that

1333
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,251
        even if I hadn't
         been drinking.

1334
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:24,785
    Have you been drinking?

1335
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,854
              No.

1336
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,025
  Please, stay here a moment.

1337
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,635
         I just wanted
          to say that

1338
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:42,537
       what you're doing
          for Patrick
        is pretty solid.

1339
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,672
      This officer thinks
    I've been driving drunk,

1340
01:15:44,674 --> 01:15:48,643
 and I might be legally drunk.
         I don't know.

1341
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:50,478
  I had some gin this morning.

1342
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,547
     What the fuck, Megan?

1343
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,651
          Miss Burch,
      I'm going to ask you
     to take a breath test.

1344
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:58,352
     Is that okay with you?

1345
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,654
              Yes.

1346
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:01,022
         I want you to
      blow into this tube.

1347
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:04,926
        Continue to blow
       until I say stop.
      Is that understood?

1348
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:11,999
      Keep blowing please.
         Keep blowing.

1349
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,734
          That's good.

1350
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,336
     Miss Burch, I'm gonna
     ask you to turn around

1351
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:17,972
       and put your hands
       behind your back.

1352
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,875
   Hold your hands together,
            please.

1353
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:22,343
        Wait, no, she...
    She didn't do anything.

1354
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:23,678
    No, chill out, Patrick.

1355
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,346
         Please, relax.

1356
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:26,814
        This way, ma'am.

1357
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,417
            Annika,
  can you please call your dad
        to come, please?

1358
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:30,685
    Watch your head, please.

1359
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:33,220
          Are you in?
             Yeah.

1360
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:35,289
     What are you gonna do?

1361
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,930
             Burch.

1362
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,767
       Your lawyer's here
          to see you.

1363
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,309
Thank you,
            Officer.

1364
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,881
             Well,
   I've planned your escape.

1365
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:02,583
           It's gonna
     involve a lot of soap.

1366
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,552
      We're gonna have to
   roofie this guy over here.

1367
01:17:04,554 --> 01:17:06,387
   But I think we can do it.

1368
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:07,955
    Annika didn't tell you.

1369
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,757
          She told me.

1370
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:14,295
  I know Patrick was driving.
           And I know
     what you did for him.

1371
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,263
          I think it's
    a really stand-up thing.

1372
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,332
            Craig...

1373
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,801
             Uh...

1374
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,871
            I've got
     something to tell you,
   and you're gonna hate me.

1375
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:25,172
         I doubt that.

1376
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:27,208
             Uh...

1377
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:33,447
        I am not waiting
      for a new apartment.

1378
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,916
         My boyfriend,
       the one that I got
      "best couple" with,

1379
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:37,885
          he proposed.

1380
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,521
    And I needed some time.

1381
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,158
   I'm engaged to be married.

1382
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,232
           So you...

1383
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,603
 So you didn't lose your lease?

1384
01:17:55,605 --> 01:17:57,138
         That's not why
   you've been staying over?

1385
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,473
         No. I just...

1386
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:03,744
        I needed to get
       my head together,
   and I gave myself a week.

1387
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,983
          When are you
        getting married?

1388
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,886
           Tomorrow.

1389
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,689
           You know,
  I mean, if I'm not in jail.

1390
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:18,959
     I, uh, we're eloping.
 I'm getting married tomorrow.

1391
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:20,094
    That's really something.

1392
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,163
             Yeah.

1393
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,665
         Tomorrow. Huh.

1394
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,835
        Congratulations.

1395
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:29,837
  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
         No, that's...

1396
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:33,507
   I'm such a shitty person.
        I really want to
      tell you everything.

1397
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:36,977
 The first time I met the kids,
     I bought them alcohol.

1398
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:38,145
    It never happened again,

1399
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,780
        but that's where
   Patrick got the wine from

1400
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:43,017
     and I went with Annika
        to see her mom.

1401
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,060
       So you met, uh...

1402
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:05,639
             Shit.
     I'm gonna stop there.

1403
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,843
  That's all the lies though.
        You know, the...

1404
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,812
       The rest is true.

1405
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:13,814
            However,
      I acted around you,
         that was true.

1406
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:15,850
 Whatever happened between us,
         that was true.

1407
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:18,085
        And I know that
        I shouldn't have
          kissed you.

1408
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,589
       I know I shouldn't
        have done that.
   It just got so confusing.

1409
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:26,093
   'Cause I had this feeling
       like I was already
       in love with you.

1410
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,236
         Say something.

1411
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:41,075
           The number
     you blew at the scene
        was borderline.

1412
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,576
      The number you blew
   at the station was under.

1413
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:44,712
 So they're gonna release you.

1414
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,181
        Something else?

1415
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:48,749
           Like what?

1416
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:51,952
 That I haven't felt connected
  to anyone I've flirted with

1417
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:55,055
   or casually seen or dated
    or slept with for years,

1418
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:57,057
   for I don't know how long.

1419
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:59,160
   That this was a rare deal.

1420
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:04,665
       That right now I'm
     aware looking at you,
    this could be it for me.

1421
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,409
      I never anticipated
          still having
        to find a place

1422
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,545
        where I'd fit in
       by the time I was
        an adult either.

1423
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:20,047
         I thought you
     automatically got one

1424
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:22,383
          once you had
      a job and a family.

1425
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,821
       But it's just you,
             alone.

1426
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,649
       Thanks for coming.

1427
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:59,887
        Hey, no problem.
         I'm happy to.

1428
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:01,622
         Do you want to
     tell me what happened?

1429
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:05,426
 No, nothing. It was a mix-up.
 They're not pressing charges.

1430
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:07,962
          Good. Good.

1431
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,830
        Listen, honey...

1432
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:11,232
         Dad, no, I...

1433
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:14,001
       I need you to know
     that I fucked up, too.

1434
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:17,905
     So I'm in no position
         to judge you.

1435
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,741
  What are you talking about?
   You can totally judge me.

1436
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:22,943
        I did something
         really stupid.

1437
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:25,446
         And it's gonna
        take a long time

1438
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,882
      before your mom can
    think well of me again.

1439
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,650
         You told her?

1440
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:32,486
             Yeah.
    I wasn't going anyplace.

1441
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:35,422
           I just had
   a moment in time where...

1442
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:40,394
           You know,
   I lost sight of who I was
 and what was important to me.

1443
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:43,163
  So you're staying together?

1444
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:47,067
 Yeah, we're gonna work on it.
    She wants to work on it.

1445
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,671
       Do you still think
    you were just shifting?

1446
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:55,476
       Well, that's what,
           you know,
  relationships are, you know?

1447
01:21:55,478 --> 01:22:00,014
     Not the cheating part,
      that was my problem.

1448
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:03,350
    But you know, you don't
       just get into one
      and then that's it.

1449
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:08,455
           It's work,
   and it's always changing.
     It's always changing.

1450
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:11,525
             Yeah,
 I think I know what you mean.

1451
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:16,297
     Look, I was just happy
       to hear from you.
   Even if it was from jail.

1452
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,605
              Hey.
              Hey.

1453
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,408
             Baby.

1454
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,280
         Welcome back.

1455
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:14,655
       So I, uh, checked
 the chapel's photographer out.

1456
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:18,525
          He's no me,
 but he's done some okay work.

1457
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,561
         I think we're
      gonna have to paste
   in the Caribbean behind us

1458
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:24,264
      so our parents think
      we went further away
   and couldn't invite them.

1459
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,002
          Who's that?

1460
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,069
         I don't know.
           I got it.

1461
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,138
           All right.

1462
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,009
             Hey-o.

1463
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:36,510
             Misty.

1464
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,413
  Uh, what are you doing here?

1465
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:42,216
   Well, I brought the stuff
        you left behind
        from the crash.

1466
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:44,351
             Here.
          Oh, thanks.

1467
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,020
      Oh, and by the way,

1468
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:48,288
    Patrick's dad wants you
   to pay for his car repairs
         out of pocket.

1469
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,523
           Out of...

1470
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,825
        Nobody does that
     unless it's a scratch.

1471
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:53,660
    Yeah, well, he's a dick.

1472
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:54,995
          Oh, my God.

1473
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,297
         Anywho, um...

1474
01:23:57,299 --> 01:24:01,368
   I'm also here to tell you
 that you need to come to prom.

1475
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,071
        Misty, I can't.

1476
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:05,406
            I know.

1477
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:07,708
   You and Annika are having
   a lot of issues right now.

1478
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,076
        But if you stop
   being friends after this,

1479
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,045
   she's gonna become, like,
  secretly tortured about it.

1480
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,980
       That's how she is.

1481
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:14,882
  I know she looks up to you.

1482
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:17,918
    That trip you got her to
  take to her mom's was huge.

1483
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,320
       And all this time
          you've been
   spending with us fucknuts.

1484
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,056
              Hey.
              Hi.

1485
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,991
          Who's this?

1486
01:24:23,993 --> 01:24:25,526
         Uh, I'm Misty.

1487
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:27,428
           Hi, Misty.
             Yeah.

1488
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,263
   Megan's been mentoring me.

1489
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:32,599
     Right. At the seminar,
 she was in the junior program.

1490
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:33,901
      The junior program.

1491
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:35,169
     Oh, wow, that's cool.

1492
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:37,237
     What was your animal?

1493
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,407
       I'm my own animal.

1494
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,376
              Ah.

1495
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:44,912
             Right.
          I like that.
        I respect that.

1496
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,380
             Okay.
       Nice meeting you.

1497
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:48,449
         Yeah, you too.

1498
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,951
           He's cute.

1499
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:52,886
            Thanks.

1500
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:56,323
      Well, we bought you
  a ticket as Patrick's date.

1501
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,994
           Just come.

1502
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,927
    <i> Attention, passengers.</i>

1503
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:37,698
     <i> Flight 514 has begun</i>
<i>general boarding to Las Vegas.</i>

1504
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,633
      <i> Please, line up to</i>
  <i> the right of the podium...</i>

1505
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:42,669
          Oh, my God.
          Oh, my God.
          Here we go.

1506
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:47,774
 Okay. Wait. Hold on a second.
       I know it's going
       to be bad quality.

1507
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:49,510
         But I need to
      capture this moment.
             Right.

1508
01:25:49,512 --> 01:25:51,578
           Of course.
           Of course.

1509
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,316
     All right. Just gonna
    send this to the group.

1510
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,286
 They're over at the soft open
      for the restaurant.

1511
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:01,822
          We've got to
   celebrate with those guys
    as soon as we get back.

1512
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,524
  Why do you need to do that?

1513
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:04,725
       I'm not gonna send
       it to our parents.

1514
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,828
         I know that's
  a whole other conversation.

1515
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,197
          And... Done.

1516
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,636
  Why did you need to do that?

1517
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:17,838
        Well, I figured
   'cause they can't be here,

1518
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,339
        it's our way of
     bringing them into it.

1519
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:23,143
           Oh, look,
  Allison already wrote back.

1520
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:25,412
  Oh, my God. I can't do this.

1521
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:28,849
             What?
    Oh, are you thinking...

1522
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,417
    You're thinking we need
    to have a real wedding.

1523
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:31,885
   I know, and you know what?

1524
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:34,388
  That would actually make me
    a whole lot more happy.

1525
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:39,092
      No. No, I mean that
     we can't be together.

1526
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,865
          Wait, what?

1527
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,767
         Oh, my God...

1528
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,236
     Oh, my God, I think...

1529
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:52,739
    I think I might throw up
  that I'm finally doing this.

1530
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:55,042
          Doing what?
      What are you doing?

1531
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:56,109
            Okay...

1532
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:57,544
             Um...

1533
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:00,948
         How am I gonna
  explain this to you, right?

1534
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,383
             Right,
    the animal thing, right?
    The animal thing, okay.

1535
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,786
         God, Anthony.
 That could never be my speed.

1536
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:09,022
   But... But if it helps you
         to understand
 what I'm trying to say to you,

1537
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:11,091
            then...

1538
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,295
       Anth, I'm a snake.

1539
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:19,633
          I'm a snake
      that's been dragging
   my old skin around with me

1540
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:24,171
       for way too long.
          I'm a snake.

1541
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,941
        No, you're not.
            No, no.

1542
01:27:27,943 --> 01:27:30,510
 You have to see this about me.

1543
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:36,149
       I'm dropping out.
 I'm dropping out of the group.

1544
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,823
   Okay, I mean, that's okay,
      'cause that's them,

1545
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:44,157
  and you can just cut down on

1546
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,826
       the amount of time
   you hang out with them...

1547
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:47,794
    'Cause that's just them.
         That's not us.

1548
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:50,631
              No.

1549
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:53,367
        No, you're still
       part of the group.

1550
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:56,470
      You and me, we're...

1551
01:27:56,472 --> 01:28:00,674
  We're somewhere back there.
  You know, we're in the past.

1552
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,617
        Holy shit, Meg.

1553
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,491
         All this time?

1554
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:19,626
        No, no, God, no.

1555
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,195
         Not all of it.

1556
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:24,231
      Well, however long.

1557
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,235
           Holy shit.

1558
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,709
          This is it.

1559
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:36,910
             Yeah.

1560
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:39,112
        This is what it
         comes down to.

1561
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,982
             Yeah.

1562
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,086
   Waking up in the morning,

1563
01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:48,989
      and never being able
      to see your face...

1564
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,124
          Ever again.

1565
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:54,094
      No, we can still be
     in each other's lives.

1566
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,163
      No, we can still...

1567
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,166
       We can still talk?

1568
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,968
             Yeah.

1569
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:04,037
          Yeah, right.

1570
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:08,508
             Sure.

1571
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:30,457
              Hey.

1572
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:34,094
         Hey. You came.

1573
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,365
   The smoky eye looks great.

1574
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,535
            Thanks.

1575
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:51,344
      Okay, what I did to
   your dad was wrong. But...

1576
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,715
         I just really,
      really fell for him.

1577
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:58,985
           Annika...

1578
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:01,421
         I broke it off
       with my boyfriend.

1579
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:08,295
         Yeah, well...

1580
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:10,330
    I guess I know what it's
    like to forget yourself

1581
01:31:10,332 --> 01:31:13,033
        when you really,
      really like someone.

1582
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,705
             Okay,
 I'm gonna tell you two things

1583
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:20,040
        that I've gotten
      some perspective on

1584
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,709
    after being out of high
    school for a while now.

1585
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:25,545
       The first is that
       a lot of the math
      they're teaching you

1586
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:28,348
        that they swear
           you'll use
    in your life, you won't.

1587
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,417
     You're never going to
     need to use parabolas

1588
01:31:30,419 --> 01:31:32,352
        and you really,
          really don't
      need to know shapes

1589
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:34,821
      that have more than
      eight fucking sides.

1590
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,890
         The second...

1591
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,326
          The second,

1592
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:45,098
    which I've only got some
    perspective on recently,
         but it's this.

1593
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,367
         You can't keep
  putting aside what you want

1594
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:49,603
   for some imaginary future.

1595
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:53,340
 You've just got to suck it up
     and go with your gut.

1596
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:55,709
<i> All right, guys.</i>
   <i> This is it.</i>

1597
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:58,178
     This is the last song
         of your prom.

1598
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,946
         <i> Make it good.</i>

1599
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:11,291
      You gonna sit here?

1600
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,730
           All right.

1601
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,699
            Fuck it.
        I'm gonna do it.

1602
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,768
             Good.

1603
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,273
              Hey.

1604
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:28,341
             Um...

1605
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:33,547
   I wanted to tell you, um,

1606
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:35,649
         I have serious
       feelings for you.

1607
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:38,118
          And I would
        like to cut in.

1608
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,186
          And also...

1609
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:44,624
      Junior, I'd like to
      be your girlfriend.

1610
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:49,296
     So you're saying that
        you want to try
        and be together?

1611
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:51,364
             Yeah.

1612
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,502
          Okay. Okay.

1613
01:32:55,504 --> 01:32:57,571
             Okay.

1614
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:47,247
             So...

1615
01:34:47,249 --> 01:34:48,815
      Did you hear the one
     about the grown woman

1616
01:34:48,817 --> 01:34:52,552
        who fell in love
        with the really
       pissed off lawyer?

1617
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,490
          Is it funny?

1618
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,559
       It's really funny.

1619
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,064
           Come here.

1620
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:08,034
        Close the door.
