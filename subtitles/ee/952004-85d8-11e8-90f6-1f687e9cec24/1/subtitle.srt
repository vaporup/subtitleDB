1
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,470
It's the greatest show time!

2
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,870
There's no doubt.

3
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,580
- He's here.
- Who?

4
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,630
Be careful. He's a traitor.

5
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,750
There's someone who keeps
looking at you. See?

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,300
It's okay, he's a friend.

7
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,560
Please turn your attention
to this gentleman!

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,890
Now, one, two, three!

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,740
There he is! Get him!

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,420
Grab my hand!

11
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,430
I let him get away again!

12
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,930
Aren't you the one who got away?

13
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,860
One more time!

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,820
Take that!

15
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
But what about the rest of it?

16
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,350
You were in my dream.

17
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,060
Everyone is startled at first.

18
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,850
The DC Mini.

19
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,070
It's the scientific key that allows us
to open the door to our dreams.

20
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,570
It can even do all this?

21
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,120
It really is a dream machine.

22
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,080
To tell you the truth,
the DC Mini is still incomplete.

23
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,580
Once complete, we'll be able to enter
your dream even while awake.

24
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,300
You said he was a friend.

25
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,930
We used to work together.

26
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,850
Why did he put you in a cage?

27
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,680
I don't know.

28
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,270
He's not the kind of person
who would trick me.

29
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,570
Why are they all me?

30
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,320
That was really disturbing.

31
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,740
This is Tarzan, right?

32
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,740
This is a scene from
a spy movie, perhaps?

33
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,580
The fighting was rather fun.

34
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,290
REM sleep that occurs later
during the sleep cycle...

35
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,130
...is longer and easier to analyze.

36
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,710
If earlier cycles are, say,
artsy film shorts...

37
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,970
...later cycles are like feature-length
blockbuster movies.

38
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,720
Then that makes you
a dream movie star.

39
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,690
Do you not like movies?

40
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,850
It's not that.

41
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,570
What is this?

42
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,530
The victim in the homicide case
I'm working on right now.

43
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,790
I haven't been able to catch the perp,
so maybe that's why I...

44
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,250
- Your anxiety neurosis.
- Do you think this is the source?

45
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,500
No need to rush.

46
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,420
The treatment's just getting started.

47
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,050
Take care, Captain Konakawa.

48
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,350
When can I see you again?

49
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm in a bind.

50
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,950
- I can see that.
- No, it's not that.

51
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,330
I was on my way to see you.

52
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,960
It's not that! The DC Mini!

53
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,380
It was stolen? The DC Mini?

54
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,010
We found out this morning.

55
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,890
Three samples in Dr. Tokita's
possession were stolen.

56
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,680
But why?

57
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,610
We'll worry about the reason later.
We need to find them now.

58
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,360
Do you think it's internal?

59
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,700
Unfortunately.

60
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,570
We'll talk about that later.

61
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,990
Foundation for
Psychiatric Research

62
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,700
Meet me in my office.
We'll figure out a plan...

63
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,080
...before the chairman finds out.

64
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes, we have to protect
the DC Mini.

65
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,550
It's too bad it was stolen, but all
we have to do is make another one.

66
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,430
You should know better than anyone
what can happen if it's misused.

67
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,810
You invented it.

68
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I make it, but how it's used
is your job, At-chan.

69
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,320
Don't call me At-chan.

70
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,080
There is one more problem.

71
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,910
Good grief.

72
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,710
I hadn't programmed the access
controls into the DC Mini yet.

73
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,840
Translate that for me.

74
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,970
It means that the person
who stole the DC Mini...

75
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,140
...can connect to a psychotherapy
machine at any time, from any place...

76
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,930
...and use it to intrude into the minds
connected to that machine.

77
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,770
Chief's Office

78
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,560
I see. We have to hurry.

79
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,370
It is man's responsibility
to control science and technology.

80
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,000
Chairman.

81
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
Sharing in another's dream.

82
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,090
It is quite literally
a technological dream...

83
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,510
...but, in time,
it can lead to violence.

84
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,260
It was an invention
that never should have been created.

85
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,640
This discussion again?

86
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,270
The DC Mini represents the hope...

87
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,400
...that shines on the new horizons
of psychiatric treatment.

88
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,280
It is taking control over dreams.

89
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,860
Your overconfidence
will bring weakness.

90
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,110
It is not about control.

91
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,410
We are simply pursuing
a deeper connection with our patients.

92
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,790
The terrorist who stole it
won't see it that way.

93
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,050
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

94
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,720
Thieves are not always wrong.

95
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,140
Paprika.

96
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,520
I hear there's a woman...

97
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,390
...who's been using the psychotherapy
machine for unapproved treatments.

98
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,650
Are you going to believe
such groundless rumors, chairman?

99
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,740
Discipline calls for a search of the
DC Mini rather than Paprika's bikini.

100
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,410
This is true happiness.

101
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,410
Discipline?

102
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,830
Even the five court ladies danced
in sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

103
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,920
The whirlwind of recycled paper
was a sight to see.

104
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,380
It was like computer graphics!

105
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,130
That I don't support Technicolor
parfaits and snobby petit bourgeois...

106
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,680
...is common knowledge in Oceania!

107
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,930
Now is the time to return home
to the blue sky!

108
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,520
The confetti will dance around
the shrine gates.

109
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,860
The mailbox and the refrigerator
will lead the way!

110
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,700
Anyone who cares
about expiration dates...

111
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,700
...will not get in the way
of the glory train!

112
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,410
They need to fully realize
the liver of the triangle rulers!

113
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,750
Now, this festival was decided
by the third-grade class...

114
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,590
...with the telephoto camera!

115
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,090
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate...

116
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,550
...governor!

117
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,590
Chief!

118
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,220
Now! Right now!

119
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,950
Take me in!

120
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,890
He has the dream of a patient
planted in his brain.

121
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,940
How's the chief doing?

122
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,440
His breathing and pulse are stable.

123
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,700
I guess it could've been worse.

124
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,120
Dr. Chiba, here are
the chief's medical records.

125
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,490
Thank you.

126
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,580
He was probably using the
therapy machine to treat a patient...

127
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,620
When someone used
a DC Mini to intrude.

128
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,460
And the dream was projected
into his subconscious...

129
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,800
...without him knowing.

130
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,720
But for that to happen...

131
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,470
The culprit has to be watching
this nightmare too.

132
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,600
What a desperate terrorist.

133
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,980
All terrorists are desperate.

134
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,560
The sun during midday
will light up the dark night.

135
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:28,570
Night dreams of day.
Light dreams of darkness.

136
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,530
But the ignorant sun...

137
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,280
...will chase away the darkness
and burn the shadows...

138
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,790
...eventually burning itself!

139
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,290
Himuro!

140
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,290
The shade of the tree
with the flowers that bloom at night...

141
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,760
...is where the residents
of darkness rest.

142
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,300
Why is Himuro in there?

143
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,590
The people of daytime
are not allowed!

144
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,930
Where is Himuro?

145
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,100
He's been out for the past few days,
but I didn't think too much of it.

146
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,320
Himuro tends to abandon
everything else...

147
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,610
...when he really gets
into something.

148
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,200
Like doctor, like assistant.

149
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,120
How could we not have seen this coming?

150
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,960
I thought he was my friend.

151
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,130
A genius produces a lot more
than he realizes.

152
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,800
More clearly, please.

153
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,220
Himuro was jealous of Dr. Tokita.

154
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,310
Even I feel bitter towards you
sometimes, Dr. Chiba.

155
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,810
No matter how hard I try,
I'm not as good as you.

156
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,980
I feel powerless.

157
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,330
It's open.

158
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,130
- You mean you opened it.
- This is illegal, you know.

159
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm not as bad as Himuro, though.

160
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,430
- Welcome home.
- Welcome back.

161
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,620
He can't be serious.

162
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,270
- This is dangerous.
- This isn't your cue.

163
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,810
Anaphylaxis?

164
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,110
Like an allergy?

165
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,330
I can't think of any other reason.

166
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,580
I got stung by a jellyfish
when I was a kid...

167
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,670
...and even now, I have
allergic reactions at the sight of one.

168
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,130
It didn't occur to me until now.

169
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Here you go.
Who had the udon set?

170
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,430
But the DC Mini uses
a transmission formula...

171
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,850
...within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

172
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,270
Who had the jumbo steak set?

173
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,780
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

174
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,900
And as a result, Dr. Chiba,
who has had the most exposure...

175
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,910
...was more susceptible
to invasion...

176
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,370
...even when she wasn't connected
to the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

177
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,210
Who had the paella?

178
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,880
I think you have a problem too.
Like overeating.

179
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,880
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

180
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,890
Fight?

181
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,890
Implanting dreams into
other people's heads is terrorism.

182
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,320
At-chan, you said
that Himuro and I were alike.

183
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,070
I think so too. All the more reason
this is unforgivable.

184
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,370
Hello?

185
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,630
We'll be there immediately.

186
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,140
Chief! Please, come back!

187
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,150
Wake up! Chief!

188
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,730
The delicious left brain
is getting older...

189
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,740
...and drifting to a faraway island.

190
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,910
Himuro, give him back!

191
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,210
I, who stand before you,
am the protector of your dreams.

192
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,630
I wonder what kind of punishment
will befall the ignorant commoner...

193
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,090
...who tries to enter
this sacred dream?

194
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,980
You're the feisty country girl
I saved some time ago.

195
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,940
How are you?

196
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,070
If he was not home
when I passed by around 7:30...

197
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,450
...then he probably disappeared
into the instant noodle soup.

198
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,780
Thank you for saving me.

199
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,910
I have come to show you
my appreciation.

200
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,250
Is it a square?

201
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,790
No.

202
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,550
It's round, like this.

203
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,300
I can feel it.

204
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,230
- Paprika.
- Do you remember me now?

205
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,730
I'm going to be a little rough.

206
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,400
Paprika, what are you doing?

207
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,240
Now, now, stop that.

208
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,540
Welcome back, Chief.

209
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,430
I wonder where
that parade was going?

210
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,930
A place of no return, most likely.

211
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,520
I felt like I was really close...

212
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,440
...to controlling the entire world.

213
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,650
That was a dream
of a severely delusional patient.

214
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,780
While you were in there, your
brain waves and body deteriorated...

215
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,570
...almost to the point of death.

216
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,330
That's why Paprika came.
Thank you.

217
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,620
You haven't changed...

218
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,130
...since the time you treated
my depression two years ago.

219
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,380
I'll let Paprika know.

220
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,800
But to think that that honest Himuro
was responsible.

221
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,390
What should I do now, Dr. Chiba?

222
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,350
- Please don't do anything.
- What?

223
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,440
The chairman will probably halt
the development of the DC Mini...

224
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,110
...as a result of this incident.

225
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,410
But with you, a board member,
in the hospital...

226
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,830
They can't have a meeting.

227
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,750
Hello? Oh, Konokawa.

228
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,300
How was the...? You know.

229
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,800
I would have asked sooner if I had
known that it would be this good.

230
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,890
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

231
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,270
I want to keep it a secret
all to myself.

232
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,520
Paprika's existence
cannot become public...

233
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,360
...until the psychotherapy machines
gain public approval.

234
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,610
She really is
a woman of your dreams.

235
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,620
Women of dreams
are busy these days.

236
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,160
You look tired.
Want me to look in on your dreams?

237
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,130
I haven't been seeing
any of my own lately.

238
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,990
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

239
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,340
Good evening.

240
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,970
What is this place?

241
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,310
A counseling room. A meeting place.
A date spot.

242
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,650
Don't you think dreams
and the Internet are similar?

243
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,820
They are both areas where
the repressed conscious mind vents.

244
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,490
Here you go.

245
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,080
Have you found anything?

246
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,880
In regards to my dreams?

247
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,840
You're so impatient.

248
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,310
Do you work
at the research foundation?

249
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,810
It was Shima who introduced me, after all.

250
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,430
Where do you know
Mr. Shima from?

251
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,940
He's a friend from college.

252
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,440
We got along pretty well,
so we always hung out.

253
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,700
Drinking and watching movies?

254
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,620
No, movies don't interest me.

255
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,660
I love them!

256
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,710
Paprika?

257
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,080
Put it on my tab.

258
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,040
Hey, Paprika!

259
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,440
Which one do you want to see?

260
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,190
I'm sorry,
but movies really aren't my thing.

261
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,530
Come on, hurry!

262
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,070
I don't like movies!

263
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,790
Hey, Tsumura, stop...

264
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,290
Breaking news!

265
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,090
The widow who tells fortunes
in the shade of roof tiles!

266
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,510
The response is sunny!

267
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,090
The sign of good fortune!

268
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,260
The ceiling fan brings a message
releasing epithets!

269
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,850
The maiden who sleeps under
the veranda has a pulse!

270
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,100
This is the way out!

271
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,270
The secret of this view is deep
within the 10-year loan payment!

272
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,860
They are new victims.

273
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,990
I am stopping development.

274
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,660
But the board meeting...

275
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,620
The culprit won't wait
for a board meeting to happen.

276
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:52,620
I am forbidding all use of DC Mini
and the psychotherapy machines.

277
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,290
This is retribution.

278
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,720
Science is nothing...

279
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,050
...but a piece of trash
before a profound dream.

280
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,820
Are you okay?

281
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,150
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

282
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,070
But that's an important piece
of equipment.

283
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll just have to make it again.

284
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,080
He's a genius.

285
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,170
He's a mysterious one, all right.

286
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,970
You're giving him too much credit.

287
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,300
He's just a kid inside.

288
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,690
DREAMLAND

289
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,650
It was a small theme park,
but I liked it as a kid.

290
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,070
I used to talk about it with Himuro.

291
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,850
Do you really think Himuro is here?

292
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,890
If I knew, I wouldn't be searching.

293
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
You're so cold, At-chan.

294
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,900
You should act more like Paprika.

295
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,230
I know, I know.

296
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,490
I have a feeling he's near.

297
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,320
Keep quiet, both of you.

298
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,650
Watch out!

299
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,370
Himuro?

300
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,460
- That's...
- A DC Mini.

301
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,350
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

302
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,440
The dense forest turns into
a shopping district.

303
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,820
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

304
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,570
So you're saying both of them were
attacked by way of the DC Mini...

305
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,620
...which broke their psyches.

306
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,660
And the culprit, Kei Himuro, was
also disturbed by the nightmare...

307
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,040
...and tried to commit suicide.
Is that right?

308
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,210
It's not because of the DC Mini!

309
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,800
It's just a little incomplete.
Himuro knew that.

310
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,720
I'm not refuting your invention.

311
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,650
She's the head of
the DC Mini development team.

312
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm Chiba.

313
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,780
This is Mr. Konakawa
from the police department.

314
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,910
Yes?

315
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Isn't it wonderful?

316
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,380
The ability to see a friend's dream
as if it were your own.

317
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,840
To share the same dream.

318
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,850
Yes, it probably would be
a wonderful experience.

319
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,970
You understand, right?

320
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,230
It came to me during
a brain scan I was doing...

321
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,610
...using a computer image processor.

322
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,610
And you can use it to treat illness.

323
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,910
That's exactly right!

324
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,370
The nonlinear waves created by
surges in the bioelectrical current...

325
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,250
...can be applied to create
new synapse connections...

326
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,290
...by adjusting the BTU output.

327
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,720
To use a person's body for energy
is a remarkable idea.

328
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,090
Exactly! And the reason
why I focused...

329
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,970
You are talking
with Dr. Tokita, right?

330
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,730
That's her, isn't it?

331
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,440
Paprika.

332
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,410
So what do you think
about this case?

333
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,490
Well, I think it's an accident.

334
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,750
It's hard to build a case
against a dream.

335
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,750
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

336
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,250
The bulky one.

337
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,550
To think such a silly thought
would lead to such an invention.

338
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,010
He's a kid trapped inside
the body of a genius.

339
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,940
It's an adult's responsibility to steer
that genius in the right direction.

340
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,730
Chairman.

341
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,360
There is always conceit
and negligence behind misconduct.

342
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,410
You have it hard too, I guess.

343
00:33:59,780 --> 00:33:59,820
Good grief.

344
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,710
Where did I go wrong
to end up here?

345
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,540
I want to go back
to our college days...

346
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,750
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

347
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,810
I want to go back
to our college days...

348
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,020
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

349
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,340
But what about the rest of it?

350
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,470
It's too dangerous!

351
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,190
Himuro went in
and he's not coming back.

352
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,860
If the same happens to you...

353
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,320
There are still two DC Minis
out there.

354
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,370
Our only lead is inside Himuro.
And besides...

355
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,620
The chairman has already prohibited
the use of the therapy machines.

356
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,750
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

357
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,590
Don't worry.
The genius boy is here for backup.

358
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,920
Dr. Tokita again?

359
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,180
I know that you two
established this field...

360
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,190
...so that's all the more reason for you
to place your trust in him...

361
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,440
...but his immaturity is the cause
of all these mishaps!

362
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,360
That's why we'll make him
take responsibility.

363
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,200
Besides, is there anyone else?

364
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,800
This isn't the time for that.

365
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,470
There are people in the world
that understand.

366
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,480
That cop.
He has a mind for science.

367
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,690
He doesn't seem
very smart, though.

368
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,860
Now all I have to do is set the filtering
program for external access and...

369
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,860
What was that for?

370
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,500
Do you really think it was Himuro?

371
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,000
He's your assistant, and he knew
the risks involved with the DC Mini.

372
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,840
He knew what would happen
if he exposed himself for too long.

373
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,010
What did he have to gain from it all?

374
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,560
He was jealous of me.
Even Osanai says so.

375
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,600
He might be a victim too.

376
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,650
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

377
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,530
If so, then it's still dangerous.
We need to confirm...

378
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,320
No more talk.

379
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,870
What I need to do is finish this.

380
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,710
You guys are really alike.

381
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,290
At-chan?

382
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,250
You and Himuro.

383
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
You get preoccupied
with what you want to do...

384
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,720
...and ignore what you have to do.

385
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,310
Don't you understand
that your irresponsibility cost lives?

386
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,850
Of course not.
Nothing can get through all that fat.

387
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,560
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful"?
"A mind for science"?

388
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,110
Don't make me laugh.

389
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,900
How can a mad scientist
know what a human mind is?

390
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,030
If you want to be king of geeks
with your bloated ego...

391
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,580
...then just keep up all this and
indulge in your freakish masturbation!

392
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,980
And where is Mr. Konakawa now?

393
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,280
At a hotel. It's all here.

394
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,950
I'm counting on you.

395
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,550
There's no doubt. He's here.

396
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,840
You've crossed the line of action.

397
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,930
Be careful. He's a traitor.

398
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,850
You need to narrow the exposure.
This is Panfocus.

399
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,990
Now, one, two, three!

400
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,160
There he is! Get him!

401
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,830
Welcome.

402
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,510
What floor?

403
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,010
The guy, I'm after him.

404
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,850
Of course. The 14th floor.

405
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,190
Fourteenth floor,
the adventure section.

406
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,410
Fifteenth floor,
the suspense section.

407
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,210
Sixteenth floor,
the romance section.

408
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,710
One more time!

409
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,510
Seventeenth floor,
the special section.

410
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,960
No!

411
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,720
I don't need to go there.

412
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,010
Encore!

413
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,470
I killed myself?

414
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,060
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

415
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,860
It was a rush job,
but I put an access function on it.

416
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,160
Morals, responsibilities...

417
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,910
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

418
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,540
But let's talk it over again.

419
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,540
We're friends, right?

420
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,190
Oh, jeez.

421
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,110
Was making them not enough?
You had to become a doll yourself?

422
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,200
Why did you steal it?

423
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,200
Do you hate me that much?

424
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:07,120
Or was it not you who did it?

425
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,460
Even with an access function...

426
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,630
...it's not one person's
dream anymore.

427
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,800
That's right!
The DC Mini was both our dreams!

428
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,260
The crossing of two dreams
creates many more dreams.

429
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,930
That's right! The entire development
team dreamt of its completion.

430
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,020
This is a foolish place to be...

431
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,640
...to inquire about
the master of this dream.

432
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,060
The conceit of the daytime residents
is what the nighttime residents want.

433
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:39,110
To come in carelessly
is like a moth to a flame.

434
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,950
You're not Himuro, are you?

435
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,040
What's the line of action
that clown was talking about?

436
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,790
It's an imaginary line...

437
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,420
...that connects the subjects
on camera.

438
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,340
If the camera crosses that line...

439
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,100
...the cut is awkward.

440
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,100
That's why it has to be like this.

441
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,520
I see. How about Panfocus?

442
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,270
It's a camera technique...

443
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,070
...where you narrow the angle
to get the entire screen in focus.

444
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,660
So you did like them.

445
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:22,660
Movies.

446
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,120
Are your dreams
in Panfocus now too?

447
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,500
Have you solved the mystery
of why you killed yourself?

448
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,250
I've never thought of suicide.

449
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,920
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

450
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,840
Like me?

451
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,390
Or another you.

452
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,940
Another me?

453
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,530
Paprika, is the inside of my head
this messed up?

454
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,870
The dreams are merging.

455
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,250
Tokita.

456
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,330
He got started without me!

457
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,210
- Wait! Tokita!
- Paprika!

458
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,800
Why are you here?

459
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:27,390
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse
is Paprika-brand milk fat!

460
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,220
Five percent is the norm.

461
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,060
Tokita! No!

462
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,400
The safety net of the ocean...

463
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,030
...is nonlinear,
even with what crabs dream of!

464
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,280
Let's go!

465
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:50,490
Wake up!

466
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,920
So you're saying...

467
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,470
...the dreams of Tokita and Himuro
merged into Konakawa's dream?

468
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,220
The anaphylaxis of the DC Mini
is expanding exponentially!

469
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,810
Just meet me at the lab.

470
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,360
They're not dreaming?

471
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,070
But they're in REM sleep.

472
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,620
It's as if their consciousness
itself has been taken away.

473
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,130
I guess this calls for Paprika.

474
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:52,430
I'll dive into Himuro's dream.
That's the only way to save Tokita.

475
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,410
Chief, can you hear me?

476
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

477
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,290
Any abnormalities?

478
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,860
This dream is very dangerous.

479
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,170
If anything happens to Atsuko,
use the awakening apparatus.

480
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,510
Of course. But is it really safe?

481
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,600
Tokita is gone because
he went into Himuro's dream.

482
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,700
Who do you think I am?

483
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:45,400
- I'm sorry to have doubted you.
- There they are!

484
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,130
Himuro isn't there.

485
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,500
But it's his dream.

486
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,760
Osanai?

487
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,400
- Be careful.
- Leave it to me.

488
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,360
Himuro.

489
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,510
Wake her up!

490
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,590
Chief! Hurry!

491
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,200
That's not
Himuro's dream anymore.

492
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:10,170
So he was a victim too.

493
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,880
He's an empty shell.

494
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,340
He was invaded
by a collective dream.

495
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,340
A collective dream?

496
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,180
With no access restrictions...

497
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,850
...the DC Mini can be used to invade
any psychotherapy machine.

498
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,020
Every dream it came in contact with
was eaten up...

499
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,730
...into one huge delusion.

500
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,070
And that delusion belongs to...

501
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:55,420
This breath seethes
in the joy of life.

502
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,920
I will not allow
arrogant scientific technology...

503
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,720
...to intrude in this holy ground.

504
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,770
Return Dr. Tokita to us.

505
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,480
The dreams are horrified...

506
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:19,480
...that their safe refuge is
destroyed by technology.

507
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,490
Are you going to punish him
like you did Himuro?

508
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,330
In a world of inhumane reality...

509
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:34,120
...it is the only
humane sanctuary left.

510
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,130
That is a dream.

511
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,800
That parade is full of refugees...

512
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,130
...who were unwillingly
chased out of reality.

513
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,300
You are collecting those
with stolen technology.

514
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,800
Do you plan to take over
the world of dreams?

515
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,970
I am protecting them.

516
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,020
I am the guardian of dreams.

517
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:59,940
My duty is to mete out justice
to terrorists like you, Paprika.

518
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,660
Don't make me get rough with you.

519
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,160
This is a dream too, huh?

520
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,710
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

521
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:22,920
Wake up, Chiba!

522
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,970
Chiba! Paprika!

523
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,530
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

524
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,290
An intelligent researcher by day...

525
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,040
...the chairman's humble servant
by night, is that it?

526
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,340
Shut up! I have many faces.
That makes me human!

527
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,890
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man
completely controlled by the chairman!

528
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,010
Shut up!

529
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,240
That's right, keep running.

530
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,200
There are no boundaries to dreams.

531
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,330
The spirit will be freed
from the constraints of the body...

532
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,580
...and gain limitless freedom.

533
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,750
Including me!

534
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,670
I will also be free!

535
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,560
The dream continues from here.

536
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,240
No! Paprika!

537
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,030
It's a trap!

538
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,570
Chief! Wake her up! Hurry!

539
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,120
What a lovely sight.

540
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:08,380
Osanai! What's this? Let me go!

541
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,800
But I finally caught you.

542
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,890
Where is Tokita?

543
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,220
I have no interest in such ugly things.

544
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:23,900
Of course, because you're not.
You were Himuro's idol after all.

545
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,310
Shut up! Just shut up!

546
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,070
You sold your body
for the DC Mini, didn't you?

547
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,360
Don't remind me!

548
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,450
- You coward!
- Stop it!

549
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,330
This is my sanctuary,
and you'll do as I say.

550
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:46,380
- I'm a special person.
- Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

551
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,130
Osanai, you used to be
smarter than that.

552
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,840
You don't know its true power!

553
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,510
The DC Mini was,
in a way, complete.

554
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,020
No, better than complete.

555
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,440
We can now go back and forth
between dreams and reality...

556
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,770
...even without the DC Mini,
while awake.

557
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,110
You were the one who set up Atsuko
at Himura's place.

558
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:17,450
It was just a friendly warning
to a terrorist threatening dreams.

559
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,450
You're just like an old baldy I know.

560
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:27,040
We are the chosen ones assigned
to protect the sanctuary...

561
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:32,210
...threatened by technology
that has lost its philosophy.

562
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,010
You're just twisted.

563
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,930
You should understand.

564
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,850
Dreams are so sacred
they cannot be controlled...

565
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,730
What would you know? You're just
a little man controlled by jealousy.

566
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,650
You really think
you can beat Tokita?

567
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,820
I warned you,
don't make me get rough.

568
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,880
You should call it a night.

569
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,880
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

570
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,890
The fact that I know I'm drunk
is proof that I'm sober.

571
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,350
This isn't a real bar...

572
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:25,980
...and this isn't real alcohol,
and you're not a real bartender.

573
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,480
Right?

574
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,610
I'm sober...

575
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:37,860
...even if odds and sods
go around in my head.

576
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,450
Paprika will come, right?

577
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,420
Do you not like the number 17?

578
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,260
The conspiratorial 17.

579
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:06,180
You're familiar with movies
as if you've made them before.

580
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:13,060
I did. Shot an independent
on an 8mm.

581
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,070
It was child's play.

582
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,740
When you were in high school?

583
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,110
When I was 17...

584
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,800
It's a silly cop story.

585
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,560
Two men
who used to be best friends...

586
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:50,730
...are now fugitive and cop
engaged in a chase.

587
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,110
They just keep running...

588
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,440
...and flashbacks of their past
play throughout.

589
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,450
Very experimental.

590
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,620
That guy...

591
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,870
How could I have forgotten
about him until now?

592
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,250
He was always one step
ahead of me.

593
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,880
He was smart and popular
with the girls.

594
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,390
I could never catch up with him.

595
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,770
I was frustrated at myself
for not being frustrated with him.

596
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,560
He really was a good guy.

597
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,150
We talked about
making movies together.

598
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:42,900
But I gave up.
I didn't have the confidence.

599
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,200
I left the unfinished movie
for him to deal with.

600
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,290
And that friend now?

601
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,450
He died.

602
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,550
He had just gotten accepted
to film school, but he was sick.

603
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:03,050
He didn't tell me.

604
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,970
I betrayed him.

605
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,470
I was his partner.
I was his counterpart.

606
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,430
He was the other...

607
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,600
The other me.

608
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,790
But what about the rest of it?!

609
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,150
Wait!

610
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,690
- Why do you dress like a girl?
- Paprika!

611
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,360
The real you is
more befitting of me.

612
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,320
Paprika!

613
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,160
Stop, please...

614
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:12,580
...you jealous, perverted prince!

615
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:17,000
You have a bad habit of trying
to manipulate people with your words.

616
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,290
And you think you can
manipulate people with power?

617
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,130
In here, yes.

618
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,990
I love you.

619
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,560
I love you as you are.

620
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,350
I will show no mercy
for those who defy me.

621
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,810
Chairman...

622
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,030
You cannot hide anything from me.

623
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,290
Chairman, not her. Not her!

624
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:39,330
Can you not control
even one sensual desire?

625
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,550
Please! Please spare her!

626
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:51,510
Why won't you obey me?
You are nothing without me!

627
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,770
But I love her.

628
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,360
Paprika!

629
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,030
Are you okay?

630
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,540
I knew you were Paprika.

631
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,000
What are you doing? You will obey!

632
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,220
Disgusting.

633
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,190
You fool.
Swayed by a mere woman.

634
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,620
I'm too anxious to dream!

635
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,500
Konakawa?

636
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,540
Shima? Is that you?

637
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:09,210
Konakawa.

638
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,010
- Why are you in Chiba's dream?
- Why are you a monkey?

639
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,390
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later. Just go!

640
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,100
Go where?

641
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,560
To your dream!

642
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,830
Don't get in the way of my dream!

643
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,750
This is my dream. You get out!

644
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:54,010
I am justice!

645
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,520
Freeze!

646
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,230
How's that for traumatic?

647
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,030
What about the rest of it?!

648
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,960
It's coming up right now!

649
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,960
This time, I'll end it!

650
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,550
That hurts.

651
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,390
It's over.

652
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,950
Chief.

653
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,990
Is this really the real world?

654
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,410
I think so.

655
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:48,120
See? It hurt a lot.

656
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,010
But why was Konakawa in your dream?

657
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:01,720
That's right, Paprika was saved
by Mr. Konakawa.

658
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:06,010
The chairman and Osanai...

659
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,100
Tokita! What about Tokita?

660
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,330
Osanai! What's wrong?

661
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,660
Osanai!

662
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,880
No! No! Osanai! You can't go!

663
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,630
That body is mine!
I will not allow you to act on your own!

664
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,510
My noble spirit needs that body!

665
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:48,810
When the two become one,
I will be complete!

666
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,940
Something's wrong.

667
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:59,230
Not just Tokita, but what
just happened with Osanai.

668
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:03,030
Don't worry.
We just need to get the mastermind.

669
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,070
A happy ending
is right around the corner.

670
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,290
But that mastermind
is lost in his own delusion.

671
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,460
No problem.

672
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,880
We have backup.

673
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,710
Mr. Konakawa.

674
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,550
The number you called for
assisting young children...

675
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:28,560
...is not available because of
crowded tires in the Pacific Ocean...

676
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,140
...starting at 7:63 a.m.

677
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,550
The battle has ended.

678
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:11,390
Now it's showtime!

679
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,750
Today's weather is dreamy...

680
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,460
...and will clear up after a sunny,
sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.

681
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:46,930
The dream I had yesterday
and today.

682
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,680
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

683
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:54,980
The dreams will grow and grow.
Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

684
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,600
It's most valuable
while it's still a bud.

685
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,730
That's right, so we shall preserve
the memory forever.

686
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,690
If there is no flower,
there will be no fruit.

687
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,490
If there's nothing,
then I won't do anything.

688
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:15,000
If you're unhappy,
please put a vote in this eyeball.

689
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,670
Who would give up this throne?

690
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:22,380
I am the emperor,
chosen by the lord himself!

691
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,500
- I didn't choose you!
- I didn't choose you!

692
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,920
God and Buddha
will change religions.

693
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:35,060
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

694
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,480
Am I still dreaming?

695
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,310
Yes, the whole world is.

696
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,570
You forgot this.

697
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,870
Thank you.

698
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,280
- Now, let's go.
- Where?

699
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,830
To clean up this mess.

700
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:09,170
Dreams and reality are merging?

701
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,840
Is this because of the DC Mini too?

702
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,270
Chief! Hold on!

703
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,580
Paprika?

704
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,710
No time for questions. Hurry up!

705
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,670
Why are you here?

706
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,930
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

707
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,930
Hurry! We have to get
the mastermind!

708
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,270
It's as if we're in a dream.

709
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,070
Hurry!

710
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:09,940
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Paprika!

711
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:16,070
Don't think you're always right.

712
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,270
Tokita.

713
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,820
- Let's go, Atsuko.
- I have to help Tokita.

714
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:54,360
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

715
01:14:55,990 --> 01:15:00,370
Why don't you listen?
You're a part of me!

716
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,750
Have you ever thought
that maybe you are a part of me?

717
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,210
Do as I say!

718
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,760
To think that you can control
yourself and others.

719
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,220
You're just like an old baldy I know.

720
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:23,890
Let's go. We need to stop
that old baldy and his excursions.

721
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,180
- Now!
- No!

722
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:28,950
I can't just leave Tokita because I...

723
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,190
Because what?

724
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,700
Chiba!

725
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:43,870
She's become true to herself,
hasn't she?

726
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,870
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

727
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,210
Go forward, superhero,
to anywhere you please!

728
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,880
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

729
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:57,550
The one I've been waiting for
since historic times!

730
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,260
Your flute's melody
is a sound for sore neurons!

731
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,930
Yes, try to remember.

732
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,520
Atsuko, the one you like!
It's me, At-chan!

733
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,900
A fragrant fat is a first-class lunch!

734
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:17,610
It needs a little more spice.

735
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,490
Maybe a little paprika?

736
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:44,100
What is this?

737
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,100
A big hole.

738
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,590
I can see that!

739
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,770
- It's connected.
- To the other world.

740
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:57,190
The other... You mean...?

741
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,280
What should we do?

742
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,950
- Run?
- You think so too?

743
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,460
Well-rounded achievement
is missing a spice.

744
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,380
Paprika found!

745
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,070
Paprika! Shima!
Are you two okay?

746
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,990
- Mr. Konakawa!
- Konakawa.

747
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,290
Chiba?

748
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,930
I'm in a bind.

749
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,140
I can see that.

750
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,810
It's not that!

751
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,540
Sorry.

752
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:38,590
You're such a slob.

753
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,550
I know.

754
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:45,260
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

755
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:51,560
It's not the outside that counts,
but there's a limit to that too.

756
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,390
Yeah.

757
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,520
To think, a food disposal like you
is the genius of the century.

758
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,280
I swallow everything.

759
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:08,200
I know. You're so much fun.

760
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,790
Atsuko is dreaming.

761
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,020
- What is that?
- Our chairman!

762
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,600
I feel great!

763
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:41,020
I am reborn!

764
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:50,370
Look! I am standing!
With my own legs!

765
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,790
I am perfect!

766
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:56,790
I can control the dreams,
and even death!

767
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,210
Now, to make
the cosmos complete...

768
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:05,720
...I shall heal all deficiencies!

769
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,760
Way to go, Lord of Darkness!

770
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:17,230
Light and dark. Reality and dreams.
Life and death. Man and...?

771
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,690
- Woman?
- Woman?

772
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,690
Then you add the missing spice.

773
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,730
- Paprika?
- Paprika?

774
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,860
Bingo.

775
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,740
Paprika!

776
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:40,170
The new cosmos begins with me!

777
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,430
Who is eating up my dream?

778
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,810
Is that Paprika?

779
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,060
Well, it's a girl.

780
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,530
Why won't you obey?

781
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,470
Have we awoken from the dream?

782
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,580
I just had the best dream.

783
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,590
I had a good dream too.
The first in a long time.

784
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:45,730
- I guess I've been dumped.
- You mean you were serious?

785
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:48,770
But Paprika is a woman
in your dreams.

786
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,360
That's true. I'll see her
in my dreams again some day.

787
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,530
How are your dreams going?

788
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,660
I almost forgot about it.

789
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,540
Did you find out
what was causing it?

790
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,540
The cause...

791
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,550
You didn't do anything wrong.

792
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,510
You just lived out our movie
in real life.

793
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,810
That's why you became a cop.

794
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:26,560
It's truth that came from fiction.
Always remember that.

795
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:30,900
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

796
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,390
Welcome.

797
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,920
I have a message for you
from Miss Paprika.

798
01:24:55,550 --> 01:25:00,470
I heard you caught the perpetrator in
that homicide case. Congratulations.

799
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,890
I also have an announcement:

800
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:08,440
Atsuko's last name
will change to Tokita.

801
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:11,690
P.S.

802
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:16,320
The movie Dreaming Kids
was very good. I recommend it.

803
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,330
Dreaming Kids

804
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:41,870
One adult, please.
