1
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,984
Please be seated, Star,
your hair's been ruffled.

2
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:06,789
Legs should be kept straight,
run quicker, somersault.

3
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,556
Yes... right...

4
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:14,731
You haven't put on your spectacles.

5
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:23,103
You guys look so bored.

6
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,617
Bored?
Let's ask Miss to take us out for a picnic.

7
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,484
Bring your girl-friends along.

8
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:34,417
With girls, we're fine.

9
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,050
Great, Miss.

10
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,458
Come on, help and light it.

11
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:42,754
It can't be lit.

12
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,427
Great...

13
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:49,528
You're too young to smoke. Throw it away!

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,434
I'll report to the police.
You're ruining your future.

15
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,598
Don't you smoke?

16
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:55,938
No, too expensive for me.

17
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:01,809
Don't believe me? Smell my mouth.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,118
Are you silly?

19
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,488
Look, my teeth are clean.

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,193
Well, aren't you too young to have wisdom teeth?

21
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,323
How old are you?

22
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,995
I'm... 18 years old.

23
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:19,801
18?

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,198
Going on 19.

25
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,607
But you look mature.

26
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,573
Indeed, I'm ripe and ready to eat.

27
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:33,515
All classmates have girl-friends,
where's yours?

28
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:34,942
I don't have any.

29
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:38,952
I'm against dating during study.

30
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,679
It's a waste of time.

31
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,891
- You're cunning.
- Right.

32
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:44,683
- Really?
- Really.

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,422
I've seen your boy friend.

34
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,791
He often waits outside the school.

35
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,431
How do you know he's my boy friend?

36
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,093
I can tell.

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,701
He's quite good to you.

38
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,473
You're nosy

39
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,247
but I think he's not my type.

40
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,113
Right, you can't be reluctant to love somebody!

41
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:20,394
He's a cop. I hate cops.

42
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:28,100
Me too, I don't like them much.

43
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,364
What?

44
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,070
Annie, do me a favor.

45
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,842
What?

46
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:37,978
Can I see your breast?

47
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:38,842
What?

48
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,642
One side will do.

49
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:41,784
Breast!

50
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,884
You lose nothing!

51
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,715
What a lousy Turtle!
You're dirty-mouthed.

52
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,113
Stay there!

53
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,689
Turtle Wong does look like a turtle.

54
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,420
Especially his head.
With a shell, he looks exactly like a turtle.

55
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:58,298
Turtle's result has dropped,

56
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,293
I must give him some tutorials.

57
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,499
But you're already my tutor.
You still have time?

58
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,599
You've progressed.

59
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,538
So, let me be his tutor.

60
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,613
I'm progressing. There should be no problem.

61
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,543
Can you manage?

62
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,383
Yes, as long as you're my tutor,

63
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:20,182
I can then manage to be his tutor. You see?

64
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:27,460
You see...

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,724
See?

66
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:33,903
This is my home, how's it?

67
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,869
Grandma, pour some tea.

68
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:38,635
Brother Star, make yourself at home.

69
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,373
Brother Star, which TV game you want to play?

70
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,774
PC or Nintendo?

71
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,108
Not now...

72
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,819
You're a nuisance. Pour some tea.

73
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:57,152
Have some tea.

74
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,658
Thanks, thanks.

75
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:01,427
You guys are classmates?

76
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:02,587
Yes.

77
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,528
Study together?

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,894
Yes.

79
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:06,196
Classmates?

80
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:08,098
Yes...

81
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:13,207
You guys are classmates?

82
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,239
Yes, how do you know?

83
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:18,605
Stop it, you get back there.

84
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,507
Stupid.

85
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:27,111
Your Maria?

86
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,151
My Grandma.

87
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,486
Grandma? Where're your parents?

88
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:31,853
They seldom come here.

89
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,995
Brother Star, some great things for you.

90
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:38,032
Wow... you've got a lot of great things.

91
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,827
I'm coming here to be your tutor.

92
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,035
Don't be silly.

93
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,981
Grandma, try this.

94
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,021
It's free. What's the harm of trying?

95
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,690
OK.

96
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,390
Is it fun?

97
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,631
Try backhand, it's some interesting.

98
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:15,428
Try backhand and hit it at 90 degree.

99
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:19,108
Hold, let the head go up first.
Ready... Go.

100
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,609
Very good! Good hit.

101
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,643
Try with both hands. It's much powerful.

102
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,978
Hit his head. There, right...

103
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:32,421
Wow... crueler than me.

104
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,820
What about the Open Day?
You're responsible for the games.

105
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,992
The theme of the games is about fairy tales.

106
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:40,491
Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
What do you think...

107
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,632
Snow White and the seven dwarfs...

108
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,824
are sleeping in the same bed.

109
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,628
Seven guys, they've...

110
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:49,772
Enough. You're going too far.

111
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:56,641
Miss, these may not be something we like.

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,245
Why don't you ask for our opinion?

113
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:00,406
Yes...

114
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,849
Just ask Eleven.
Eleven, what do you like to play?

115
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,045
Video games.

116
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:08,087
The same for me.

117
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,520
Right.

118
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,826
Should we find something...

119
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:15,658
more interesting and exciting?

120
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,325
What about popguns?

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,331
Great...

122
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:22,670
Popgun is too violent.

123
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:25,000
It's quite violent

124
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,268
but violence is better than porn.

125
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,504
- Have your supper...
- Thanks.

126
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,479
Stupid boy, why don't you give a hand?

127
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:36,810
What are you doing?

128
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,484
Miss, have some soup.

129
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,825
Have a piece of pork chop.

130
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:46,758
Thanks. Uncle Tat.

131
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,521
Dad, you try some.

132
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,164
- No need...
- What about you?

133
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,362
You got high score this time.

134
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,597
Thank you Miss for giving me tutorials.

135
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,337
But Turtle has higher score than you do.

136
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,169
Really?

137
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,470
Look.

138
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,170
Thanks to me who gives him tutorials.

139
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,441
I instruct him to study everyday.

140
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,778
Isn't it great
if every student behaves like you?

141
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:15,520
Well, it's even greater
if every Miss looks like you.

142
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,684
There you go again.

143
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:18,623
Scissors.

144
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:19,523
Stone.

145
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:21,493
Paper.

146
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:26,730
I even couldn't hold her hand. Damn me.

147
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,202
Where's my kid gone?

148
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,799
Grandma, I'm not coming home for dinner.
See you.

149
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:35,939
Mobile phone, cool.

150
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,302
Brother Turtle, for this month.

151
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,038
Today is the beginning of the month?

152
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,273
Yes, look after me.

153
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,883
You should thank Brother Star.

154
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,748
Be smart. Brother Star hates dumb guys.

155
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,016
A waste of time.

156
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:54,257
Brother Star loves this book,
I treat this for next month.

157
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,060
Brother Turtle, this is to thank you.

158
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,200
Smart boy!

159
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:01,098
Something great to show you.

160
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:03,766
Calling you, buddy.

161
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,205
Why are you so thievish? Stay there.

162
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:13,406
I can too.

163
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,519
Brother Star,
you are silly to find means doing so.

164
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:21,353
You son-of-a-bitch.

165
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:22,622
Go away.

166
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,193
Open your mouth.

167
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:27,590
Let me off, Brother Star.

168
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:29,527
You keep running despite my shouting at you?

169
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,666
I didn't mean it.

170
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:31,795
What's your name?

171
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:32,992
Turtle Wong.

172
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:34,298
Where do you live?

173
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,062
Kowloon Tong.

174
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:35,829
The whole of Kowloon Tong?

175
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:36,994
Next to Ideal Hotel.

176
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,140
Turn around.

177
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,235
Hands on the head.

178
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:44,745
Stop playing tricks.

179
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,211
What's this?

180
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,007
Your phone.

181
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:47,740
I know.

182
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:48,906
So, why did you ask?

183
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:50,186
Mind your manner to cop.

184
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:55,082
What are these?

185
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:55,986
HK dollars.

186
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,784
I know.

187
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,892
So, why did you ask?

188
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,722
Am I not qualified to ask you?

189
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,388
Am I not qualified?

190
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,088
You're qualified...

191
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,961
Tell me what are these?

192
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:05,829
HK dollars.

193
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:06,832
I know.

194
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,027
So, why did you ask?

195
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,262
Son of a bitch, tell me.

196
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,102
Or I'll kick your brains out
with my Scissors Legs.

197
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:15,208
Don't do that, Brother Star,
the money is yours.

198
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:16,171
What's that to do with me?

199
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:17,438
Protection fee.

200
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:18,838
What protection fee?

201
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,381
I collect $30 from each classmate.

202
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,019
We're the richest and most powerful gang.

203
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:27,917
Most powerful gang?

204
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,989
Right, the Star Gang.

205
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:33,286
Big brother.

206
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,963
Listen, I'm not your big brother.

207
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,136
Take your money back. Go at once.

208
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,202
He's calling me, not you.

209
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,364
Call him, Grandpa.

210
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:47,805
Grandpa.

211
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:49,669
Good boy.

212
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,780
Brother, just forget it.

213
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,180
Let's not turn our place into anarchy
or we both will be in trouble.

214
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,486
I'm looking after you.
Anybody gives troubles to you...

215
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,281
means giving trouble to me. Right?

216
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:02,481
Right.

217
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,416
Want to get up a branch in my sphere?
We aren't Seven-eleven.

218
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,992
Such an idiot! Know nothing.

219
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,062
He's silly and knows nothing.

220
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,527
Let me see how powerful he is.

221
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,427
Sir Chow, Teddy Big arrives.

222
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,706
Seems to come here for you. Watch out.

223
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:22,034
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

224
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:31,151
Grandpa, come over here.

225
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:34,514
Don't call me Grandpa again, you guys.

226
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,884
Brother Star, Teddy Big, is coming to see you.

227
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,686
Who wants to see me?

228
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:40,996
He said he wanted to see the head.
That's you.

229
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:45,032
That's you. You're the head recently.

230
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,364
So what?

231
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,338
Hey, kid, stop.

232
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:54,134
Are you the big brother?

233
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:55,802
How are you, brother?

234
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:59,281
So, you're the head of the Star Gang,
how cheeky.

235
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,773
What did you say?

236
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,110
You didn't even inform me when you set up a gang
in my sphere.

237
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,181
What's your rank?

238
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:11,159
I'm second in my family,
I've got an elder sister

239
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,489
but she married a long time ago.

240
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,357
She's trying to emigrate.

241
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,725
How dare you talk to my big brother like that?

242
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,224
Cops're coming.

243
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,265
Kid, you're lucky.

244
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,631
Watch your steps,
you'll be less fortunate next time.

245
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,481
What are you doing?

246
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,921
Are you still the tutor of Star Chow?

247
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:45,822
Yes, though his performance is not that great,

248
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,156
but he's progressing a lot.

249
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,057
Do you know there's a new triad gang
in your school?

250
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:55,404
Triads again? I've told you before.

251
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:57,367
I won't tell you my students' particulars.

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,667
I'm not asking for that, I want to tell you.

253
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,707
The new triad gang in your school is
the Star Gang.

254
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:04,608
The leader is your student, Star Chow.

255
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:09,481
That's ridiculous, listen!
He's my student,

256
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,113
not a triad leader.

257
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,584
But he's a bad element in the school.

258
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,085
I say again,
"no bad elements in my school".

259
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,318
We're responsible for leading students
onto the right track.

260
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,485
Fine, forget it.

261
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,824
I don't want him to ruin our love.

262
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,033
Can you stop being his tutor?

263
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm your boy-friend, I worry about you.

264
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:33,198
I teach students to trust those around him

265
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,535
and you ask me not to trust my students.

266
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:09,611
Hi.

267
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,280
Let's have our tutorial in the bedroom

268
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:21,389
because Dad's playing with bird
and I don't want to disturb him.

269
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,387
Are you alright, Miss?

270
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:26,627
Study in the bedroom.

271
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,195
Alright.

272
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,362
Having an affair?

273
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,164
What?

274
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:36,099
Have a walk outside.

275
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,170
Walk to where?

276
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,331
To Guangzhou if you like.

277
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,333
One for you, one for me.

278
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:44,176
You're wrong.

279
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,871
I'm right, yours is super thin.

280
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,277
- Really?
- Really.

281
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:53,088
I'm not the type you think and I'm not...

282
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:55,053
Hold it, she's a good girl.

283
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,522
Don't ruin her, 15 minutes will be enough.

284
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,927
Go, stop bullshitting.

285
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,056
Nuts.

286
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:06,759
Damn!
This is my home and you asked me to go out.

287
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,028
Are you father of Star Chow?

288
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,665
- Yes.
- He said Yes.

289
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:12,704
Hey, what are you doing?

290
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,886
It's only a gum. Chewing gum.

291
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:12,997
Start the lesson.

292
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,229
You think I'm an idiot?
I'm disappointed in you.

293
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:25,513
Help... help.

294
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,182
Uncle Tat. What's up?

295
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:33,887
How are you?

296
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:34,750
- Fine.
- Uncle Tat.

297
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:35,754
Stand aside.

298
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,507
Stop it, give me a chance.

299
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:01,745
Who asked you to come?

300
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,944
Teddy Big, please give me another chance.

301
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,686
Give you another chance to do what.

302
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:07,845
To go away.

303
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,048
Where you wanna go?

304
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:10,283
I don't know.

305
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:15,121
Go home and have a sleep. Your mom misses you.

306
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,623
You're no wonder the no. 1 in the SDU.

307
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,827
That's only basic skill.
Cops can't be as stupid as you.

308
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,070
You're right.

309
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:24,864
Dad, are you alright?

310
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,804
I'm fine, I'll rub some medicine oil...

311
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:28,773
- Let me rub...
- Good boy.

312
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:30,412
Stop pretending.

313
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,945
You're not a student and you're not his father.

314
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,350
We are indeed father and son.

315
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,781
Though I look younger than him,

316
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:39,546
he's my true son.

317
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:49,691
Actually, I can't tell you this

318
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,995
but I don't want to lie to you.

319
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,059
I'm a cop.

320
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:57,229
Sir Chow, everything's settled.

321
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:58,771
Do tell all.

322
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:06,947
I'm a cop and I'm in the school
to look into a case,

323
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:13,055
but I really want to help the kids.

324
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:17,124
I don't care and don't wanna know
what's between you,

325
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,887
but please stop fooling me, Sir Chow.

326
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:22,959
What are you doing?

327
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,497
Don't tell the others, OK?

328
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,766
Don't.

329
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,708
Will she tell the others?

330
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,843
She will, you go and kill her.

331
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,441
Yes, Sir!

332
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,082
Save your dirty words.

333
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,486
I should kill you first, save yourself!

334
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,887
OK...

335
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:56,762
Have I talk too much?

336
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,035
Do you believe I'll smash your head.

337
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:01,027
I do.

338
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:03,797
That's wonderful.

339
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:04,496
Yes...

340
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,505
You've been in the school for 2 months
and you've found nothing.

341
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,640
What have you done?

342
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,168
Tell me.

343
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:13,343
My way is like this.

344
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:16,280
First I have to communicate with
the students and teachers.

345
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:18,249
Yes, building a relationship.

346
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,888
No matter what.

347
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,149
Find out that pistol within a month

348
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:23,915
or both of you will be fired.

349
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:27,296
I don't care, I was born to be cheap,
I'm not ambitious.

350
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,794
I'll send you to work along the border.

351
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:30,397
Great... thanks a lot!

352
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:32,796
Don't be so rash.

353
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:35,436
You really scared us by your smash hands.

354
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:36,935
Yes, we're scared.

355
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:40,633
Please keep that smash hand away.
We are scared enough.

356
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,803
The students will do a good job
in the Open Day.

357
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,744
Great, last year was boring.

358
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:27,347
Alright.

359
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,759
Can you lend me your pager?

360
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,031
- What's for?
- Lend it to me.

361
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,158
The pager is mine...

362
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,425
Lend it to me.

363
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:43,134
The pager is...

364
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:45,899
I know, I'll return it to you afterwards Thanks.

365
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:04,021
If not for you,
I wouldn't have scored 80 in Geography.

366
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,857
If not for you,
the kids wouldn't have listened to me.

367
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:12,065
For you told me,
the goal of life shouldn't be for money.

368
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:14,428
Now I can tell you, my goal in life is you.

369
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:16,730
Sorry, for having lied to you in the past.

370
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:21,938
Sorry, because I'll always follow you,
Star Chow.

371
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:31,278
Hi.

372
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:33,949
Foolish! I'll keep the pager.

373
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,387
Hey, the pager is mine.

374
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:41,121
Why are you standing here?

375
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,228
Hey, the pager is mine.

376
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:43,763
Why are you standing here?

377
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,632
You're blocking my way by standing here.

378
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:47,564
But the pager is mine...

379
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,533
Can you excuse me?

380
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,271
Somebody's chasing after you, run!

381
00:21:58,347 --> 00:21:59,405
Turtle, go away.

382
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:02,842
Many against one?

383
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,516
- Sir, shall we start?
- Take a look first.

384
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,123
Don't go.

385
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:13,791
Damn!

386
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,465
Brother Star is in trouble.

387
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:20,502
Help him.

388
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:28,273
Let's start.

389
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:32,814
Cops, run away, the cops.

390
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:37,584
Brother Star, are you alright?

391
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:38,685
I'm fine, fine.

392
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:40,287
Sir, the fighting is in full swing over there.

393
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,756
What?

394
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:42,982
Report to us in the police station.

395
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,690
How are you? Are you alright?

396
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:49,623
I think I'm fine.

397
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:50,890
Take a rest.

398
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:52,764
Are you two alright?

399
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:53,526
Alright.

400
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:54,327
Have you seen Star Chow?

401
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,060
No.

402
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:56,636
No, go back and take a rest.

403
00:22:58,807 --> 00:22:59,569
Have you seen Star Chow?

404
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:00,868
No, Miss.

405
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,110
Talk everything to my lawyer.

406
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:06,178
Turtle.

407
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:07,607
Miss, it hurts!

408
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:08,909
Have you seen Star Chow?

409
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,583
No, I don't know where they've taken him.

410
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:13,321
Have you seen Sir Wong?

411
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,049
Sir Wong... he...

412
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:17,922
Hey.

413
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:18,991
I'm not obliged to say anything.

414
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:21,356
But whatever I say may be used as an evidence.

415
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,794
I have the right to call my lawyer
and to have some tea,

416
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,593
but you've got no right to hang me up.

417
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,670
- It stinks.
- Hands off.

418
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:40,310
Want to beat my sole?
Treat me as a new comer?

419
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,454
Good, come. Beat my head instead.

420
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:51,252
Let's see who gets the trouble, come on.

421
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,928
Right.

422
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,057
I can beat you this time.

423
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,427
Miss Ho, you can't go inside.

424
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,763
Hey.

425
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,700
Are you alright? What are you doing?

426
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:08,035
Beating your own man? Actually...

427
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:10,144
Why are you here?

428
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,571
Crazy! Beat one's your man.

429
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:15,841
I've got something important to tell you.

430
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:18,885
Let me finish. Actually he's a...

431
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:26,660
Stop it.

432
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,527
Star, are you alright?

433
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,897
Ask if his hand is alright.

434
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,704
Go back and rub some oil
or your bones will crack.

435
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:41,808
Are you leaving?

436
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:47,472
They beat anybody no matter what. Go...

437
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:09,496
It's fine now, go.

438
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,907
You've made a mess instead of looking for
the pistol.

439
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,106
You will never get a promotion.

440
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:17,744
Maybe you don't want promotion, too.

441
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:21,744
Go away, get back to square one.

442
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,475
- Give me one more chance.
- Chance?

443
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:26,382
I've given you chances. Still ask for more?

444
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:27,752
Didn't I give you any chance?

445
00:25:27,923 --> 00:25:29,356
I didn't say that.

446
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,321
We'll die together if you can't find the pistol.

447
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,798
Real Scissors Legs!?

448
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:50,237
No need to be that unhappy.

449
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,744
Very funny.

450
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,763
When is your birthday?

451
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:49,000
December 22, a party for me?

452
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,696
No, Mine is January 4.

453
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,632
Remember that my name is Tso Tat-Wah.

454
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:55,775
Giving a banquet?

455
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:59,675
No, this time it's either you or me.

456
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:02,282
There should be one who writes something
on the gravestone for the other.

457
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,816
Can you make it more explicit?

458
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:09,947
The arms?
I knew where Teddy Big put his arms.

459
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:11,493
Why didn't you say earlier?

460
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,218
I'm scared, big brother.

461
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,123
Call me Sir.

462
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:16,628
Attention.

463
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:17,693
Yes, Sir.

464
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,299
Do you know the consequence of not
telling the truth?

465
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:20,127
Yes, Sir.

466
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:21,166
So why didn't you tell?

467
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:22,701
- Afraid, Sir.
- I'm afraid too.

468
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:25,263
But we're the cops and must do our best.

469
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,236
Sorry, Sir.

470
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:27,875
Do you want to be an undercover forever?

471
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:29,010
Yes.

472
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:30,801
What?

473
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:42,313
It's interesting.
I'll accompany you when you die.

474
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:47,794
Stand straight and look at me.

475
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,095
Kiss you.

476
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:58,801
Son of a bitch.

477
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,056
It's this car park.

478
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:16,747
- It's here.
- Which car?

479
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:19,222
- How do I know?
- So?

480
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:20,892
Look into every car.

481
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:22,889
You're stupid.

482
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:31,539
Some noise outside. Go out and have a look.

483
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:36,368
Go in and have a look.

484
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:39,611
Anything?

485
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:40,770
Nothing.

486
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:42,109
So what's the noise?

487
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:43,373
Check around.

488
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,339
Great.

489
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:10,305
They're all long guns.

490
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:28,587
This one is short. This's cop's pistol.
Yes, this one...

491
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:30,688
What are you doing?

492
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:31,958
Bring them all to the police station.

493
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,632
The car will carry them. Put them down.

494
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:42,772
- Finished?
- Finished.

495
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:45,745
I haven't got into the car.

496
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:51,181
I'm here... hey...
I haven't got into the car.

497
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:01,819
Excuse me, what problem?

498
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:06,998
Everything's under control, don't worry, OK?

499
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:14,142
Boss, time to pee...

500
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,808
I'll show you something great afterwards.

501
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:22,183
You call me this early,
please show me something great.

502
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:23,283
Of course, something great.

503
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:24,510
Something great?

504
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:25,853
Keep it.

505
00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:31,791
I've never thought it'd be back, smart boy.

506
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:34,821
- Stop crying. More to come.
- More?

507
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:37,054
Wake up, hey.

508
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:42,970
Wow... where did you find it?

509
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:48,401
It's really great before my retirement.

510
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:50,534
I can be the governor if I don't retire.

511
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:53,974
Wait a few more seconds.

512
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,910
Smart Star Chow, you've moved my arms?

513
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,078
Want to hear your dad's voice?

514
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,415
Kid. I'm fine so far, but...

515
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:08,026
Listen, if you want to see your dad,

516
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,455
meet me at the back of the school
in half an hour.

517
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:12,628
Remember, no tricks.

518
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,765
Hey, the foreigner's getting impatient
for waiting half day.

519
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,370
I'm calling him. Be more patient.

520
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,564
Ask him to shut up.

521
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:21,641
He'll see the guns in half an hour.

522
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:23,777
Why are you so nervous?

523
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:27,209
The guns are with me.
Call the SDU if necessary.

524
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:28,576
They can manage.

525
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,547
Then Uncle Tat will be more dangerous.

526
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,214
Remember he's a cop and an undercover.

527
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,618
He should know. He's old to suffer.

528
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,617
Hey, I know what you wanna do,
wanna show off again?

529
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,863
Don't. I'd rather kill you myself than
letting others kill you.

530
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:46,097
Hey. This is a kind pistol.

531
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:48,600
Don't.
It hasn't been used for more than 30 years.

532
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,864
Don't take it away. What you doing?
Driving away?

533
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:55,402
Drive if you have the guts.

534
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,876
Don't come back if you have the guts.

535
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,247
Young guys nowadays are so brave.

536
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:32,102
Where are the guns?

537
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:38,710
The weapons are there.

538
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,054
Release my dad.

539
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:43,985
Follow me...

540
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:48,557
Star, I haven't...

541
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:50,162
Go ahead.

542
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,400
What smell? It's gasoline.

543
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:01,606
Burn the banknotes...

544
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:08,473
It can't be fired! Isn't it too kind?

545
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,480
Go away!

546
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:10,613
Catch him!

547
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:11,613
Why coming back to school?

548
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:13,276
Wanna let your classmates to be in danger?

549
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,284
Today is a public holiday.

550
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,818
Shit, nobody's there to help then.

551
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:22,122
Higher. Hey... what are you playing? Stop...

552
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,356
What? Popgun again? Give us a hand.

553
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,491
Hold it, help me.

554
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:30,299
You should help too. Hurry.

555
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:34,107
What happened to Brother Star?
He said he'd help us.

556
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:35,868
He still hasn't showed up.

557
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:39,510
Brother Star must have been arrested by police.

558
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:42,172
You're silly. Miss Ho's seen him.

559
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,578
Really?

560
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:47,417
Miss Ho! Is brother Star alright?

561
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:49,285
Alright.

562
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:51,785
I'm right. Stop bullshitting.

563
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,895
You look dull. Are you alright?

564
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:57,754
I'm fine.

565
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,727
So many people here.

566
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,492
Why are you here? Today's holiday.

567
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:01,863
Go away. It's dangerous.

568
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:03,402
Go quickly.

569
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,600
Uncle Tat can run that fast.

570
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:15,007
- Come closer.
- Wait.

571
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:18,575
Damn it.

572
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:21,985
Have you seen Star Chow?

573
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,125
- No.
- Inside The maze.

574
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,491
Why looking for him?

575
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,558
None of your business!

576
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,027
Stay away.

577
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:33,795
Keep an eye on the students. Come here!

578
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,235
Attention please, if trapped inside the maze

579
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:39,771
and cannot find the way out.

580
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,238
Please shout for help!

581
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:43,806
That way.

582
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,483
Hey... what do you want?

583
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,118
None of your business. Don't make a sound.

584
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:57,949
Babe, are you scared?

585
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,726
Then you won't be scared.

586
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:12,335
Finished.

587
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:14,600
Miss Leung, call the police. Hurry.

588
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:17,144
Let's go and save Brother Star.

589
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,069
Don't. They've got pistols.

590
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:20,770
I've got one too.

591
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,250
Don't go...

592
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:29,813
- What are You doing?
- Wanna die?

593
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:39,891
Follow me.

594
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:46,734
- Hey, wait.
- Quick!

595
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:50,977
You go first.

596
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,151
That's the entrance, genius.

597
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:06,655
How do I know? Every door looks the same.

598
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,796
So you have to follow me. Stupid.

599
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:18,971
Here we're.

600
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:23,010
Call the boss right away.

601
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:24,410
What about you?

602
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,442
A lot of kids are there. I must go back.

603
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:27,978
But the pistol can't work.

604
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:29,450
I can manage.

605
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:30,775
No, I must stay and help you.

606
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:33,182
Seek helpers! You're too old to help.

607
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:34,720
Hey...

608
00:36:42,364 --> 00:36:43,160
Have you seen him?

609
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,320
No.

610
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,131
You go that way. The rest follows me.

611
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:13,189
Turn left.

612
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,924
Keep on turn left, left.

613
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:21,432
Hands up. Don't move.

614
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:26,696
I've asked you not to move.

615
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,448
Go... quickly.

616
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,015
Kin's shot. Take him away.

617
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,151
Quickly. Damn it.

618
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:47,424
Go, wanna die?

619
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:50,064
Go... that way... that way.

620
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,825
Go... you kid...

621
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,427
Squat! Squat down!

622
00:37:57,238 --> 00:37:59,798
That way, go.

623
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,836
- Quicker.
- I'll kill you with a shot.

624
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,051
Move!

625
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:38,835
No again? You didn't leave me one?
You're cruel to me.

626
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:42,609
- Brother Star.
- Brother Star.

627
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:50,348
Star Chow, listen, the kids are in my hands.

628
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,449
I'll give you 5 minutes.

629
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:54,351
If you don't come out, I'll kill them all.

630
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:57,157
Brother Star, they mean it.

631
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:10,134
Stop it... Don't make sound. Stay calm.
Do you hear me?

632
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:15,911
What are you best at doing?

633
00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:17,642
We'll die this time.

634
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,787
Damn you. Shut up!

635
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,488
Listen. What are you best at doing?

636
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:28,529
Flirting.

637
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:31,922
What's besides flirting?

638
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,124
Nothing.

639
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:36,532
You're best at having fun.
You flirt because you want to have fun too,

640
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,433
Not because you want to marry.

641
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,238
OK, let's have fun with them,

642
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:44,806
And try to play a game
but we can't lose this game,

643
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:50,246
Or somebody will die.
Have you played such an exciting game?

644
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:51,109
No.

645
00:39:51,286 --> 00:39:53,686
But we'll by no means lose.

646
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,722
All we have to do is to cooperate.

647
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:58,322
I'm the supervisor and you two listen to me.

648
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,222
We are in a favorable situation.

649
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:05,162
We'll sure win. Must be confident.

650
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:11,696
Are you confident?

651
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,271
- Yes...
- Good! Start!

652
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:31,153
Six of them. Give me any weapons.

653
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:32,384
Popgun.

654
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:34,754
Not popgun. I said no popguns.

655
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:38,763
This is a real gun with 5 bullets.

656
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:40,961
Only 5 bullets?

657
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:43,433
Star Chow, come out quickly.

658
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,068
Let's bet. Mark the time.

659
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:50,206
Good. Do as we planned, clear?

660
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:55,149
Star Chow, come out!

661
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,615
You think I'm kidding?

662
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:04,223
You hear me? I'll kill them one by one.

663
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:06,219
20 seconds left.

664
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,124
Come out!

665
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:19,001
Come out... or I'll kill them one by one...

666
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:30,014
Come out

667
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:31,952
or I'll blow their brains off.

668
00:41:33,855 --> 00:41:34,844
Do you believe me?

669
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,157
So you don't believe me.

670
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:41,925
Good.

671
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,376
Run... quickly.

672
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:14,385
Fire... fire if you have the guts...

673
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:16,020
I'm afraid you don't have the guts.

674
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,495
She's the first to die.

675
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,232
Go ahead. That's none of my business.

676
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:23,196
Wanna cover you? You'll be shot anyway.

677
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:25,066
You know what will happen. Come.

678
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:28,303
You think I'll be scared?

679
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:29,843
I can kill you with only one shot.

680
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:31,205
Fire...

681
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:32,311
- I'll.
- Go ahead...

682
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,174
I count to 3 and let's fire together.

683
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:36,714
1,2,3... OK, sorry.

684
00:42:36,884 --> 00:42:37,646
It's my fault, sorry.

685
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,047
You're no match for me.

686
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:40,611
Why taking this so seriously?

687
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:41,755
Guns down.

688
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:47,658
Go back...

689
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:55,566
Where's the money?

690
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:56,601
Not with me.

691
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,966
Where's the money?

692
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,266
Here's the money.

693
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:01,901
Put the pistol down!

694
00:43:02,076 --> 00:43:03,008
Do you dare?

695
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:04,801
Or I'll burn all the banknotes

696
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:06,213
and we'll all have troubles.

697
00:43:07,014 --> 00:43:08,447
Got a lighter?

698
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:09,907
You don't have any?

699
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:11,244
No, how about you?

700
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:14,744
No.

701
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,485
Brother Teddy, can I borrow your lighter?

702
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:19,683
You asked for it!

703
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,361
Big Brother... watch out, go quickly.

704
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:33,165
So cool!

705
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:45,150
How dare you firing back at me?
Come out at once!

706
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,963
Wanna kill me? Come out...

707
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:04,601
Don't fire!

708
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:05,704
Guns down!

709
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:08,404
Boss.

710
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:19,353
Bingo!

711
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:30,794
Kid, I'm not the leader of the Star Gang.

712
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,930
I'm one of the Royal HK Police Force
also known as Scissors Legs.

713
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:37,402
Remember that!

714
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:42,132
Boss.

715
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,908
You'll leave scars on my pistol if you throw it.

716
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:49,414
I have no choice... Your pistol can't work!

717
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:52,717
I've told you this is a kind pistol.

718
00:44:52,954 --> 00:44:55,582
You want to use it to kill? How dare you?

719
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:57,519
But you're so smart
to shot him quite accurately,

720
00:44:57,725 --> 00:44:59,590
and maintain the police's reputation.

721
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,786
School of Police hasn't taught me this.
I learnt it in this school.

722
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:08,427
The men're coming. I'm leaving.
Don't tell them I've been here.

723
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,264
Thanks for arresting them.
Chief Inspector Chow.

724
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:12,800
- What?
- Chief Inspector?

725
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,236
When I say you are, you are.

726
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:17,202
Shouldn't I be the Chief Superintendent?

727
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,172
Brother Star.

728
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:59,081
Do come and have tea some time.

729
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:16,769
Pass this mobile to you, do call me.

730
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:19,836
I'll come back right after it rings.

731
00:46:20,274 --> 00:46:22,265
- Take care.
- Take care.

732
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,510
Brother Star, how lucky you are!

733
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:33,214
Yes...

734
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:34,979
What are you waiting for!?
