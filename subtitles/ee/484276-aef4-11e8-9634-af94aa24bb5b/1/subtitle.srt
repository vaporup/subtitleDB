1
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,885
Understand?!

2
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,901
What are you doing?

3
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:35,836
Don't know.

4
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,773
Don't know? I've made it clear.

5
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,713
Scatter, scatter.

6
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,030
Help, help.

7
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,804
You're smart, why are you so smart?

8
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,608
Don't go too close.

9
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,246
Hey.

10
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,311
Dead?

11
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,178
Yes, dead already.

12
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,988
Sir.

13
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,249
Sir.

14
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,486
The Mission has been completed smoothly.

15
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,291
Star Chow, where're your men?

16
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,873
All dead!?

17
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,211
We want a supervisor, we want team work.

18
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,241
Not going alone like Rambo.

19
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,174
The hostages have been rescued.

20
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,716
Rescuing is just an item in this exam.

21
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,853
What matters most is the safety of your juniors

22
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,153
and your leadership but I can't see anything!

23
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,671
Sir, give me a chance.

24
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,067
What are you doing?

25
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,338
What are you doing?

26
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,840
Don't!

27
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,137
Sir, could you please reconsider?

28
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,307
Who is it?

29
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,119
Yes.

30
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,588
Yes, Sir. The boss wants to see you.

31
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,424
Yes, Sir.

32
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,135
Good morning, Sir, I'm Star Chow.

33
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,917
Damn it, that adorable!

34
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,818
Turn a round for me,
don't be shy, come on!

35
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,400
Irresistible, I'm sorry.

36
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,630
Wanna get a promotion?

37
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,395
I don't want to be a gigolo, Sir.

38
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,240
I asked if you want a promotion.

39
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,137
I won't be gigolo, Sir.

40
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,711
That's nonsense!
I asked if you want a promotion.

41
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,250
Yes, but not at the cost of my chastity.

42
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,556
Who wants your chastity?
I want your youth.

43
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,628
Youth and chastity are equally important
to me.

44
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,162
Fine, fine, I see. Let me finish my words.

45
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,332
This matter is such,

46
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,797
one day, some students visited
our police station.

47
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,542
A pistol was lost afterwards.

48
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,845
Sir, we lose pistols very often.

49
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,848
But that pistol is mine!

50
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,614
I can share your heartbreaking feeling.

51
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,319
Yes, that pistol has followed me
for 30 years.

52
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,191
I've never shot it. It's for scratching itches.

53
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,557
Speaking of the itch and here comes.
Scratch me.

54
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,100
- The back?
- Yes.

55
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,937
It's a kind pistol.

56
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,502
Can pistol be kind?

57
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:18,077
It's got a kind nature.
If it falls in the hands of bad students,

58
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,851
tragedies will follow.

59
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,214
Don't worry, Sir.

60
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,756
I'll search the whole school

61
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,757
for your pistol.

62
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,662
If I can manage, I don't have to ask you.

63
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,532
I'm retiring, but I've lost my pistol.

64
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,828
I'll lose my face if others know.

65
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,073
So I want you to enter that school as a spy.

66
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,542
I'm not sure if I can teach.

67
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,409
Who ask you to teach? To be a student!

68
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,914
Student?

69
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,446
I joined the police force
because I hated studying.

70
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:01,958
I can't be a student. Sir, if you do so...

71
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,757
you're bringing me to a volcano
with lots of wild animals

72
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,858
and paying no attention to my wailing.

73
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,766
And are just kicking me cruelly...

74
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,101
into the exploding volcano.

75
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,713
How can you be so cruel?

76
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,008
You can live and die excitingly then.

77
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,483
Stop, no way escaping.

78
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,287
Here's a pager watch, put it on.

79
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,517
666 means I call you.

80
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,327
Say to me, "Good morning, sir".

81
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:48,429
Good... morning... sir.

82
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,034
Very good.

83
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,870
Don't let others know
or both you and I'll be in trouble.

84
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,433
I'll see if you guys will be late again.

85
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,206
What are you staring at?

86
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,288
School Discipline

87
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,463
You'll learn it by heart later.

88
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:30,934
That's the fresh boy.

89
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,634
Big stupid guy, from which class?

90
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,471
Could it be ours?

91
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,806
I don't think so.

92
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:05,733
Star Chow, I'm the Head of Discipline
of this school. My name is Lam.

93
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,591
A mosquito.

94
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,462
You transferred from England College?

95
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,469
Students from that school are rubbish.

96
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,575
I don't care what's between your family
and the school committee.

97
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,477
Edinburgh College is a prestigious school
and teach the best students.

98
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,342
I can't stand a single bad element

99
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,182
or I'll kick you out of here,

100
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,579
clear?

101
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,050
Yes, Sir!

102
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,318
You think that's interesting?
Bring him to the classroom.

103
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,591
Come with me to the classroom.

104
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,471
Around 1987,

105
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,881
an observation from the sky
above the South Pole...

106
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,277
revealed that there's hole
at the ozonosphere up above there.

107
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,550
Strong ultraviolet ray is harmful
to living organisms.

108
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,425
A less serious situation will affect the genes.

109
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,060
The worst case will kill the cells.

110
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,531
Plants will die as a result.

111
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,530
Ultraviolet ray can penetrate into the sea.

112
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:57,479
I lose freedom,
my heart's breaking my tears' flowing.

113
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:09,862
I've lost my way and gone astray.
My heart is breaking.

114
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:14,662
Who's attacking the police?

115
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,001
Attacking what?

116
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,170
You! Take the duster out.

117
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,989
I don't care you're new in here.

118
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,221
What are you dreaming? What?

119
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,331
Miss has got her pride.
The lesson restarts!

120
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,429
Let's start with the atmosphere layer.

121
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,340
The atmosphere is made up of several layers.

122
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,269
Calm down, everything will go very smoothly.

123
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,635
Step aside, everything can be as boundless as
the sea and sky

124
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,676
The layer nearest to the earth is called
the troposphere.

125
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:59,040
It's 15,000 to 50,000 feet above the earth.

126
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,615
It contains cloud and weather systems.

127
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,215
Ming Dynasty - Punishment

128
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,013
The Ming Dynasty particularly
stressed on punishment.

129
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:40,792
Disrespect Party politics and espionage
were subjects to punishment.

130
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,291
Turtle Wong.

131
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,157
Mr. Cheng what does it mean by espionage?

132
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,524
It's the current practice of spying.

133
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,068
The people involved are called spies.

134
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,664
These people are punished by castration.

135
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,097
Castration!?

136
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,336
Chopping sex organ, kid.

137
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,211
Chopped by how many inches?

138
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,778
That depends on how many inches you've got.

139
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,847
The wrong book again, absent-minded!

140
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,422
Really absent-minded!

141
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,921
What's that noise?

142
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,347
Thank you for your help.

143
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,952
Come... Quicker...

144
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,353
Serve him right.

145
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,627
You're laughing so happily you come out too.

146
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,129
Come...

147
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,198
What's your name?

148
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,866
Star Chow.

149
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,734
And you?

150
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,205
Turtle Wong.

151
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,843
What's your name?

152
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,277
Star Chow.

153
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,241
What's yours?

154
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,583
Turtle Wong.

155
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,054
What's your name?

156
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,893
Star Chow.

157
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,765
Let's begin, Star Chow.

158
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,076
This experiment is quite complicated.

159
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,241
We must remember each step.

160
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,610
Forgetting one single step
will be very dangerous.

161
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,547
Sorry...
the most important thing of this experiment is...

162
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,984
Memory.

163
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,816
If not, it'll...

164
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,289
will be very dangerous.

165
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,970
Stop!

166
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,119
Hey... get back down here

167
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,777
Hey, you, go away

168
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,349
Please, could you get down here first?

169
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,515
What are you doing? Who are you?
What's this to do with you?

170
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,456
Excuse me and you get down.

171
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,061
Why pulling me down here?

172
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,993
You're standing on my belly.

173
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,701
Don't go away, we're on the same boat,
we share the same code.

174
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,595
Code!?

175
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,969
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

176
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,970
What's the code?

177
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,633
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

178
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,642
- What's this?
- The code!

179
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,175
God! Everybody's abnormal here,
excuse me.

180
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,011
You can't climb out from here.

181
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,152
You can't walk out from here.

182
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,254
OK, I'll use the front door.

183
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,687
Not even with the front door.

184
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:05,720
What's it?

185
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,984
Nothing, this boy's gone mad suddenly.

186
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,889
Yes, I've gone mad. I want home.

187
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:10,990
What is it?

188
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,130
Sorry, Sir.

189
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,991
Don't block my way, please.

190
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,657
Excuse me, please.

191
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,629
Excuse me, I want to go.

192
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,066
Are you alright?

193
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,611
I'm sick, I want to go home.

194
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,575
Please let me go! Thank you.

195
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,681
You're not feeling well.

196
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,509
Yes.

197
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,810
Come with me.

198
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,256
Let's see if you've got a fever.

199
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,219
No.

200
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,998
Yes.

201
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,491
No, look at it yourself.

202
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,304
It's me who's got the fever, not the thermometer.

203
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,907
I'm feeling so bad.

204
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,037
Let me see your eyes.

205
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,301
Look down.

206
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,573
Look up.

207
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,141
Look at the left.

208
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,947
Hey, your eyeballs can't move?

209
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,848
It can't move since I've got a fever.

210
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,393
Are you pretending?

211
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,023
I'm Miss Ho, I'm not teaching your class,

212
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,029
but I'm the counselor of your class.

213
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,732
You go back to classroom first.

214
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:28,136
Come to me anytime if you've got problem. Be good.

215
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,710
Are you mad just because I've dropped
your pencil-case unintentionally?

216
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,144
No, I ain't, ain't.

217
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,748
I'm so frightened.

218
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,245
So, how much do you want?

219
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,388
That depends...

220
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,314
Only $300.

221
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,824
I'm not frightened now.

222
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,629
If I know you still got money with you,

223
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,098
I'll not throw your pencil case away,
but you!

224
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,670
I understood.

225
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,930
Good, the savior comes.

226
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,304
Don't get it mistakenly,
I'm not helping you guys,

227
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,567
and I'm not your savior.

228
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,471
You can! You look so cheeky.

229
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,703
They'll only bully you, not me.

230
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,211
Thank you very much!

231
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,636
Sir, I remember the code.

232
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,738
It's Dong Tong, Tong Dong Dong, right?

233
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,807
- It's you?
- Yes.

234
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:10,566
You should have said earlier.

235
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,403
I forgot the code earlier.

236
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,167
Sir,

237
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,438
I'm CID5798,
I'm sent here to cooperate with you.

238
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,211
Go home and have your hands stopped trembling.

239
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,545
My hands are not trembling.
It's Parkinson.

240
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,215
I'm only pretending.
That saves me from doing a lot of work.

241
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,755
The boss has asked you to stay at my home.

242
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,687
What kind of stick are you chewing?

243
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,059
To give up smoking.

244
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,374
Hey... Miss Ho? Forget about her!

245
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,175
Her boyfriend is the head of Anti-triad Unit.

246
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,815
What are you saying?

247
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:53,575
What?

248
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,812
I'm keeping an eye on that kid who's smoking.

249
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,723
You mean Johnny?

250
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,551
What is he?

251
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,523
The head of the 4 Tigers of Beacon Hill.

252
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,094
His big brother, Teddy Big,
is really somebody.

253
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,028
He's the most suspicious in the case
which our boss lost his pistol.

254
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,666
Keep an eye on him.

255
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,239
Go!

256
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,110
Big brother.

257
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,572
You asshole, what a lousy idea.

258
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,538
Big brother.

259
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,581
Now somebody's after us for money.

260
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,518
It's fine to traffic drugs,
why trafficking arms?

261
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,482
You said, arms-trafficking is profiteering
during the Gulf War.

262
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,022
You should've persuaded me.

263
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,055
What are we going to do with these AK47s?

264
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,086
If we got pistols, we can rob.

265
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,787
Johnny is here.

266
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:40,954
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

267
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,360
He's cheeky.

268
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,765
Even you can be cheeky if you've got money.

269
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,469
You're here, come in.

270
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,244
They're for Feng-shui.
Keep your hands off.

271
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,814
I'm sorry.

272
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,578
How are you getting on?

273
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,652
You're cheeky now.

274
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,992
Don't worry, my dad has gone traveling.

275
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,734
He won't have come back
even our cars reach Shenzhen.

276
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,837
Let's see

277
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,999
and do pay us the money for the 2 cars
of my brother back.

278
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,468
I can only pay you when my clients pay me.

279
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,371
You're not that in need of money, right?

280
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,378
I need money badly.

281
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,245
The money I collected in the school...
can't even afford 2 nights in the Karaoke.

282
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,413
I've got a great thing, wanna see?

283
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,921
It's great.
We stole from the police academy.

284
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,025
Cop's pistol?

285
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,210
3 for each. Don't fight for it.

286
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,419
In memory of your fathers?

287
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,292
Do I still need to work
if I've got so many fathers?

288
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,518
They're all my ex-partners.

289
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,132
Good, noodles...

290
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,466
Cook some for yourself.

291
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,798
Come on, no...

292
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,639
Yes.

293
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,937
Cook oneself is illegal?

294
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,977
How many partners you've got?

295
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,047
But there're 10 here.

296
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,454
I have to prepare one to two more...

297
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,060
One to two more...

298
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,696
and see who's coming to me.

299
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:58,234
Maybe he needs it. Just keep as stock.

300
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,730
Would you mind?

301
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,335
What are you saying?

302
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,938
You don't understand?

303
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,048
It's better if you don't understand.

304
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,848
Die at an early age.

305
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,747
Eat your noodles,
I'll have supper outside.

306
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,117
Remember to do your homework,
you've to go to school on tomorrow.

307
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,883
- Damn you.
- No damning.

308
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,634
Nothing. Keep talking.

309
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,206
You're always so dirty.

310
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,399
I get used to it.

311
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,701
I worked as a servant in a school,

312
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,804
it was fine at first.

313
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,448
But I have to work under Sir Chow.
Really trouble!

314
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,086
What an ass.

315
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,949
What are you doing?

316
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,019
I'm less fortunate than you.

317
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,086
I'm following the case of Teddy Big.

318
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,024
Arms?

319
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,598
What a coincidence!
We are also after Teddy Big.

320
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,626
But for the pistol.

321
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,132
- Cop's pistol?
- Yes.

322
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:12,242
Really?
They're in the machine gun business.

323
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,411
Machine guns in HK?

324
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,140
Yes, goods have arrived.

325
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,677
Wow...

326
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,148
Why don't you arrest them?

327
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,720
The buyers are terrorists,

328
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,053
Boss wants to arrest all at one go.

329
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,190
That's tough!

330
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,496
It's life and death if something goes wrong.

331
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,872
We can't afford to alarm them.

332
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:47,670
Well, keep an eye for the pistol for me as well.

333
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,639
- Sure!
- Sure?

334
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,248
You have my word.

335
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,250
Among the gang of underground informers,

336
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,049
all are dead except you and me.

337
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,460
Of course, I'll keep an eye for you.

338
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,697
Everyone can die, except this.

339
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,396
Lousy.

340
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,843
Brother Teddy, stay calm.

341
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,602
We'll settle if there's any problem.

342
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,313
Remember Chicken Brand
whom you arrested 10 years ago.

343
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,248
He wants to say hello to you Inspector Wong.

344
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,542
Policeman.

345
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,677
Understand?

346
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,681
Yes, good.

347
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,486
Understand?

348
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,551
Damn you.

349
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,430
No homework

350
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,773
I'm deserved to be punished.

351
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,459
No homework again

352
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,300
Look around at the class

353
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,080
Stare nothing at the class

354
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:10,245
It's all my fault.

355
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,218
Stand on one foot.

356
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,694
A show over there.

357
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,924
Watch only...

358
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,024
What?

359
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:32,033
I said watch only, don't laugh.

360
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,347
Ha...

361
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,080
Are you alright?

362
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,155
Does it hurt?

363
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,289
You just didn't take my words to the heart.

364
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,296
Star of the week

365
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,978
This student is brainless, he's hopeless.

366
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,310
Yes... always absent-minded, hopeless.

367
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,949
He's a jerk already looks as...

368
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,524
if he's sick.

369
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,557
Never seen a "star" like him.

370
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,375
You two should be looking for the pistol
not looking up the dictionary.

371
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,643
Boss,

372
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:51,116
he couldn't hand in his homework today

373
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,380
and was punished by not allowing to go back
the classroom.

374
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,025
You can look into the case
even if you're outside the classroom!

375
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,657
If I fail to hand in homework again,
I'm out of the school.

376
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,322
Then I can't look into anything.

377
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,829
Can you solve this calculation?
Let's see.

378
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,334
I know nothing about trigonometry.

379
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,769
When you first asked me to handle this case,

380
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,035
your attitude was different.

381
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:13,939
No, he's always like this.

382
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,704
I'm always like this.

383
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,340
My soft words are for cheating you
to get involved.

384
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,685
What about asking some other policemen
to come here...

385
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,286
and solve the Math.

386
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,979
You're an idiot!
That means disclosing the case to everybody?

387
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,287
Let me tell you finish this case quickly,

388
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,995
or I'll kick your brains out
with my Scissors Legs.

389
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:33,926
What?

390
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,498
I'll fly over and kick you with legs
like scissors and kick your brain out.

391
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,794
Scissors Legs, scared?

392
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,495
Very...

393
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,002
Scissors Legs, what a joke.

394
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,842
He was really powerful.

395
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:52,914
He was!

396
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,346
He was able to deal with 20 guys alone.

397
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,350
Or only be able to shoot 20 planes!?

398
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:01,385
Dad, are you alright? Dad.

399
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,752
Dad, go to hell, Dad.

400
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,892
How can you say that!

401
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,938
Damn it! I'm late.

402
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,698
It's only 6 o'clock.

403
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,238
I'm influenced by his hard-work,
I've to do a little revision too.

404
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,318
Yam...

405
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,755
I'm not called Yam.

406
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,190
But you really look like.

407
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,955
Have you finished your Biology?
Let me copy.

408
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,133
I won't even if I have. Are you nuts?

409
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,803
I'll give you $50 in return.

410
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,299
I do...

411
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,374
You want money before finishing the homework?

412
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,541
Stay away, one by one.

413
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,247
As many as you want.

414
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,246
Any compositions? Compositions.

415
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,579
Keung, yours is torn, go away.

416
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,189
- He's quite popular.
- Yes.

417
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,831
Copy this so late?

418
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,534
You're ruining your future. Hopeless.

419
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,211
Look, I've finished.

420
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:05,880
You think you are smart?

421
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,142
Of course.

422
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,748
I'm not mocking you.

423
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,954
I just want to say, from now on.

424
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,057
I won't let anyone throwing dusters at me.

425
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,630
I won't be punished by standing
onto the corridor

426
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,357
or standing on the playground,

427
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,594
or holding a damn cardboard publicly,
like a monkey. No!

428
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,366
Just keep copying...

429
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,874
Sudden test, those who fail will be standing
on the playground for a week.

430
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,461
Chinese History Test

431
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,234
- Mobile phone?
- Cool, isn't it?

432
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,208
What?

433
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:51,083
What? Chinese history test?
You two can handle it.

434
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:55,653
What? Boss, my Chinese History won't do.

435
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,794
Hold on! Mandy,

436
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,324
ask all seniors to come up here.

437
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,533
Ask them who was the one

438
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,531
who suppressed the "An-Shi Rebellion"?

439
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,534
A: Kwok Chi-Yee,

440
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:11,137
B for boy, is that clear?

441
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:15,573
Li Kwang-Bud, C: Li Hark-Yong...

442
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,207
It's Li Hark-Yong, not Lee Hack-Ken.

443
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,817
A is Kwok Chi-Yee,
B is Lee Kwang-Bud.

444
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,593
Which two of them are the heroes?

445
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,461
Kwok Chi-Yee and Chu Wen.

446
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,892
It seems to be Lee Kwang-Bud and Chu Wen.

447
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,864
So who's the hero? Answer me!

448
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,038
Kwok Chi-Yee or Chu Wen?

449
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,998
What? You look up the book?

450
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,338
No, I can manage... few more seconds.

451
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,844
Son, it's Chu Wen. Who's Chu Wen?

452
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,207
The answer is B.

453
00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,349
Banana? B for banana.

454
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,959
Ask them.

455
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:11,031
What's the "Ox-Li Party Conflict"?

456
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,997
Search book again?
You even don't know this!

457
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,470
What have you studied? Shit!

458
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,537
Which big case are you in?

459
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,768
No idea.

460
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:29,515
A for apple, that's it.

461
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,115
Next question, listen carefully...

462
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,896
The answer is D, D for dog.

463
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,794
D for, D for dog.

464
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,278
B.

465
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,448
Uncle Tat, what are you doing here?

466
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,878
Well... collecting rubbish.

467
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,384
The female toilet is blocked,
can you do with that?

468
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,383
Come with me.

469
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:18,198
What, the test is over.

470
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,403
Sir, which case?

471
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,298
Three wolfs.

472
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,235
Dead already?

473
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,396
Reverse a previous judgment?!

474
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,951
Stupid me, I should have guessed that.

475
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,263
No.

476
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,382
No again.

477
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:25,995
You two are riding?

478
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,134
Falling instead.

479
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,139
So you two are cheating.

480
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,974
No, only me who's cheating.
Arrest me.

481
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,672
Come out with me.

482
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,919
A moment please.

483
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,594
He cheated in the Chinese history test by using
the Chinese literature book.

484
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,236
You are dumb.

485
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,696
That's not exactly cheating.

486
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,671
He was guilty.

487
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,977
I only want to let him have
the proper punishment.

488
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,837
What do you say?

489
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,847
Deduct 3 marks from his conduct as usual.
Stop it.

490
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,711
Please don't. A deduction of 12 marks
will let him out of this school.

491
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,088
Miss Leung, what about you?

492
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,350
Kill him.

493
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,515
What did you say?

494
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,891
That isn't what you want? Just cheating.

495
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,893
It's one of our experience of growing up.

496
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,465
Who hasn't cheated before?

497
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,673
But you even didn't use your brains to cheat.

498
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,537
Stand properly. Don't move!

499
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,411
You don't use your brains, you deserve it.

500
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,312
I suggest arranging for another test.

501
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:55,757
If he still doesn't learn from it,
test him again and again.

502
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,253
Until he passes.

503
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,591
That's punishing me, I can't afford the time.

504
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,197
- Save your time from going to The race-course.
- Yes...

505
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,492
I agree.

506
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:07,692
You can talk to his parents
and try to understand his family background.

507
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,373
Fine, I've decided.

508
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,678
He's punished by staying after school for a week
and cleaning the playground for 2 weeks.

509
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,076
Deduct 5 marks from his conduct,
re-test on next week.

510
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,546
Also, I want to meet your parents.

511
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,249
Parents? I don't have any.

512
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,286
I've got no relatives, no friends.

513
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,952
Who's your guardian?

514
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,387
I'm my own guardian.

515
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,719
If there's anybody you want to see, it's me.

516
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,328
His file.

517
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,032
Who's his guardian?

518
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,594
Uncle Tat?

519
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,063
Uncle Tat!

520
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,470
Stop it, God... big news.

521
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,210
Uncle Tat, is Star Chow really your son?

522
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,414
You're a senior to me, you say.

523
00:45:58,856 --> 00:45:59,880
Star Chow, say!

524
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,160
Don't laugh, say!

525
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,967
Yes.

526
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,176
Yes... I'm sorry...

527
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:25,077
I bet, they look exactly the same.

528
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,781
What? The same?

529
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,910
His dad? Nonsense.

530
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,647
Hey, no... here...

531
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,484
Your surname's Tso, his is Chow, why?

532
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,219
How do I know? Why?

533
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,995
This is an order.

534
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:52,741
When he was born, I named him, Star Tso.

535
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,347
But then he named himself, Star Chow.
I don't know why.

536
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,072
Is this correct?

537
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,608
It's right.

538
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,981
Sir, excuse us.

539
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:08,317
Hold on, Uncle Tat,
we want you to come up here to tell

540
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:09,918
your son cheated in a test.

541
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:18,125
Cheated? That's disgraceful, no good...

542
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,899
You can't cheat, Sir, cheating...

543
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,197
Excuse us.

544
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,606
Hey, don't you see,

545
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:30,307
parents and teachers should cooperate
to teach him.

546
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,538
Right?

547
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,013
How long can we teach him?

548
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,950
Your son's been here for only 3 days
and he cheated.

549
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,880
- Give me one or two slaps and then go.
- No...

550
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,786
You should teach him effectively.

551
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:42,923
Don't be too serious.

552
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:43,855
Of course, not to be too serious.

553
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,292
Alright, I know what to do.

554
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:52,031
You cheated?
I'll beat the hell out of you.

555
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,533
Don't be too agitated...

556
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,534
I'll beat you...

557
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,231
- Dead already?
- Dead already.

558
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,773
- You're lying.
- No.

559
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,001
One more hit.

560
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,678
You son-of...

561
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:18,055
Sir Chow, please.

562
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:23,658
I have to use all my strength
to beat a strong man like you.

563
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,633
Well...

564
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,293
I'm old and lacking of strength.

565
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,405
After I beat you, my bones crack.

566
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,668
- Really?
- Yes.

567
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:34,868
I'm sorry.

568
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,570
Never mind, I'm in this business.

569
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,874
Go and see the doctor, I'll pay for it.

570
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:39,515
Thank you, thank you.

571
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,707
Uncle Tat!

572
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:43,442
Miss Ho.

573
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,644
Don't be so angry.

574
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,382
Star Chow, do you know how great your father is?

575
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:58,131
Don't mention it, all parents are great.

576
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,965
He can't go on like this,
let me be his tutor.

577
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,697
I've got no money to pay you.

578
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,239
We can't owe you this favor, Miss.

579
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,840
- Uncle Tat!
- Dad.

580
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,337
I won't take any money.

581
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,441
No...

582
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,979
I'll lead him onto the right track.

583
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:12,808
No...

584
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,814
No... not good.

585
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,013
So, let's start from tomorrow.
Don't worry.

586
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,289
Thank you, thank you.

587
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:23,851
Thanks a lot.

588
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,429
Save it, it's a golden opportunity for you.

589
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,394
You said no to her, how dare you!

590
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,227
Be smart, don't reveal your identity.

591
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,371
Hey.

592
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:37,737
Somebody's looking for you.

593
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:38,499
Who?

594
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:39,699
Go up and you'll know.

595
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:40,934
OK. Coming.

596
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,273
I must show him how smart I'm.

597
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,413
He's coming.

598
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,025
Who helps him just stand on his side.

599
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,708
You want protection fee, I pay it for him.

600
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,972
You, Turtle, must have no idea of death!

601
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,949
Let me take your mouth as an ashtray.

602
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,918
Take him here.

603
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,671
Anything else?

604
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:48,973
Nothing.

605
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,671
So, don't call me up here unless necessary.

606
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,173
OK!

607
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,850
Hopeless!

608
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,549
Star, you're powerful than Bruce Lee.

609
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,819
Star, do you want to have your shoes cleaned?

610
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,021
Smart Star, have you got enough money?
I can give you.

611
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,699
What's more, if you're not neat and tidy,
I must beat you.

612
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:18,100
Your hand. Show me your hand.

613
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,368
I'm too old to be hit on the palm.

614
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,238
Show me.

615
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,343
Don't, no need, Miss.

616
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,479
That one.

617
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,206
I'll show you somewhere else to beat.

618
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,045
If you are cruel enough,
just use all your strength to beat me.

619
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,478
Like a garbage can.

620
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,724
It's shameful if Miss Ho sees this.

621
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,866
Hey, what's this? A toaster?
Throw the bread away.

622
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,166
The blue magazines in your room you have to...

623
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,735
Tidy up your room, stop eating.

624
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,239
- What?
- Let's play something.

625
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,068
OK, tidy this place.

626
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,176
Pretend to have Parkinson!

627
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,370
Is Parkinson your dad?
Always, so fond of this.

628
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,041
I don't care how old you're, I tell you.

629
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,047
The son shouldn't have a larger room
than his dad.

630
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,292
Miss, I'm not sure about this.

631
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,620
About what?
