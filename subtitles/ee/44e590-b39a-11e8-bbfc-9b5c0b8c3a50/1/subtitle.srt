1
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,411
Watch it!
- Sorry darling.

2
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,473
Here you are.
- Ah, thank you.

3
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,946
Mind if I join you?

4
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:48,542
I'll have the same.

5
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,422
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

6
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,426
Gandalf the Grey.
- I know who you are.

7
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:06,478
Well, now, this is a fine chance.

8
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:11,723
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

9
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:20,444
I received word that my father had been seen
wondering the wilds near Dunland.

10
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:25,449
I went looking,
found no sign of him.

11
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,540
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything but rumour was heard of Thrain.

12
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:34,258
He still lives. I am sure of it.

13
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:42,266
My father came to see you before he went missing.

14
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:43,467
What did you say to him?

15
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,470
I urged him to march upon Erebor -

16
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,473
- to rally the seven armies of the Dwarves.

17
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:53,376
To destroy the dragon and take back
the Lonely Mountain.

18
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:59,145
And I would say the same to you.
Take back to your homeland.

19
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:06,289
This is not a chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

20
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,391
No.

21
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,399
It is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.
That dragon has sat there long enough.

22
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:21,404
Sooner or later, darker minds will turn
towards Erebor.

23
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:26,299
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling
along the Green way.

24
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:29,257
They mistook me for a vagabond.

25
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,282
I imagine they regretted that.

26
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,615
One of them was carrying a message.

27
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,062
It is Black Speech.

28
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:44,326
Promise of payment.
- For what?

29
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,024
Your head.

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,942
Someone wants you dead.

31
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:57,438
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are the heir to the throne of Durin.

32
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,445
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.
Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.

33
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:09,350
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families.
Demand they stand by their oath.

34
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,555
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who
wields the king's jewel. The Arkenstone.

35
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:20,060
It is the only thing that will unite them and in case you
have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

36
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:27,638
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

37
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,574
How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away.

38
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:38,196
Buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.
- Yes, it does.

39
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,581
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

40
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,643
How close is the pack?
- Too close.

41
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:48,646
Couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.
- Have the wargs picked up our scent?

42
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:52,550
Not yet. But they will do. We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

43
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,563
They saw you?
- No, that's not it.

44
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:57,533
What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse!

45
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:02,460
Excellent burglar material.
- W-will you listen? Will you just listen!?

46
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,499
I'm trying to tell you there is something
else out there.

47
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:11,569
What form did it take, like a bear?

48
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,672
Yes. But bigger. Much bigger.

49
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,676
You knew about this beast?

50
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:22,479
I say we double back.
- And be run down by a pack of orcs?

51
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,464
There is a house...

52
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:30,721
...it's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

53
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,284
Whose house?

54
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:35,592
They friend or foe?
- Neither.

55
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,908
He will help us, or...

56
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,634
...he will kill us.

57
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,500
What choice do we have?

58
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,173
None.

59
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,612
Run!

60
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,256
This way! Quickly!

61
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,171
Go!

62
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,497
Bombur come on!

63
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,416
To the house!

64
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,638
Run!

65
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,274
Come on, get inside.

66
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,661
Open the door!

67
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,079
Quickly!

68
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,774
Push!

69
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:04,676
Come on lads!

70
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,685
What is that?

71
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,408
That is our host.

72
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,794
His name is Beorn.

73
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:25,033
And he's a skin changer.

74
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,804
Sometimes he is a huge black bear.
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

75
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,491
The bear is unpredictable,
but the man can be reasoned with.

76
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:39,765
However, he's not overfond of Dwarves.

77
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,718
He's leaving.
- Come away from there!

78
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,437
It's not natural. None of it.

79
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,824
It's obvious. He's under some dark spell.

80
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:55,628
Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.

81
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:01,834
Alright, now. Get some sleep all of you.
You'll be safe here tonight.

82
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,957
I hope.

83
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:52,916
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

84
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:58,922
Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

85
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:05,139
You know of Azog? How?
- My people were the first to live in the mountains.

86
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,933
Before the Orcs came down from the north.

87
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,036
The Defiler killed most of my family.

88
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:20,143
But some he enslaved. Not for work,
you understand. But for sport.

89
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:27,150
Caging skin changers and torturing them seemed
to amuse him.

90
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,053
There are others like you?

91
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:33,855
Once there were many.

92
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,058
And now?

93
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,290
Now there is only one.

94
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:45,968
You need to reach the mountain before
the last days of Autumn.

95
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:51,073
Before Durin's day falls, yes.
- You are running out of time.

96
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:56,178
Which is why we must go trough Mirkwood.
- A darkness lies upon that forest.

97
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,082
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

98
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:06,466
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria
and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

99
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,808
I would not venture there, except in great need.

100
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:15,997
We will take the Elven road. That path is still safe.
- Safe?

101
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:22,203
The Woodelves of Mirkwood are not like their kin.
They are less wise, and more dangerous.

102
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:26,107
But it matters not.

103
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,010
What do you mean?

104
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,116
These lands are crawling with Orcs.
Their numbers are growing.

105
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:41,021
And you are on foot. You will never
reach the forest alive.

106
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:48,128
I don't like Dwarves.

107
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:58,620
They're greedy, and blind. Blind to
the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.

108
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,839
But Orcs I hate more.

109
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,109
What do you need?

110
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,654
<i>Go now, while you have the light.</i>

111
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,482
<i>Your hunters are not far behind.</i>

112
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,287
The Elven gate.

113
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:52,291
Here lies our path trough Mirkwood.

114
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:56,395
No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.

115
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:08,106
Set the ponies loose.
Let them return to their master.

116
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:17,115
This forest feels sick.
As if a disease lies upon it.

117
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,219
Is there no way around?

118
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,123
Not unless we go 200 miles north. Or twice that distance -

119
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:29,201
- south.

120
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:58,255
Something moves in the shadows unseen.

121
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:01,678
Hidden from our sight.

122
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,362
Every day it grows in strength.

123
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:09,165
Beware the Necromancer.

124
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,214
He is not what he seems.

125
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:20,176
If our enemy has returned, we must know.

126
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,933
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

127
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,225
The High Fells.

128
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,694
So be it.

129
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,194
Not my horse, I need it!

130
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:44,199
You're not leaving us?
- I would not do this  unless I had to.

131
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,408
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.

132
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,509
You're not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire.

133
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,405
I was going to tell you.

134
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,906
I...

135
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,396
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

136
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,368
Found what?

137
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,261
What did you find?

138
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,707
My courage.

139
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,886
Good.. well that's good.

140
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:37,251
You'll need it. I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook -

141
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:41,578
- before the steps of Erebor. Keep the metal key safe.

142
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:45,127
Do not enter that mountain without me.

143
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:59,472
This is not the Greenwood of old. The very air of the
forest is heavy with illusion that will seek to enter your mind -

144
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:02,375
- and lead you astray.
- Lead us astray?

145
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,277
What does that mean?

146
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:11,484
You must stay on the path. Do not leave it.
If you do, you'll never find it again.

147
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:18,263
No matter what may come, stay on the path!
- Come on. We must reach the mountain before -

148
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,897
- the sun sets on Durin's day.
- Let's go.

149
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,496
It's our one chance to find the hidden door.

150
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,607
The path goes this way.

151
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:03,334
This way.

152
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:14,544
Air.. I need air!

153
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:19,350
My head, it's spinning. What's happening?

154
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,192
Keep moving. Nori...

155
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,701
Why are we stopped?
- The path.. it's disappeared.

156
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,908
What's going on?
- We've lost the path.

157
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,563
Find it.

158
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,566
All of you, look.
- Look for the path!

159
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,614
I don't remember this place.
None of it's familiar.

160
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,478
It's got to be here.

161
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:57,002
What hour is it?
- I do not know.. I do not even know what day it is.

162
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,635
Look, a tobacco pouch.

163
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:49,537
There's Dwarves in these woods.

164
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:54,453
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains no less.
This is exactly the same as mine.

165
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:55,643
Because it is yours.

166
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,435
You understand? We're going around in circles. We are lost.

167
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,449
We are not lost, we keep heading east.

168
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,550
But which way is east?

169
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,652
We've lost the sun.

170
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,759
The sun. We have to find the sun.

171
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,462
Up there.

172
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,783
We need to..get up there.

173
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:26,473
What, was that? Enough!

174
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:28,575
Quiet! All of you!

175
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,578
We're being watched.

176
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,727
I can see a lake.

177
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:27,633
And a river. And the Lonely Mountain.

178
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,635
We're almost there!

179
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:33,538
Can you hear me?

180
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:36,841
I know which way to go.

181
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:41,646
Hello?

182
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,657
Hello..

183
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,422
Oh come on..

184
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,964
Eat them now while the blood is running.

185
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:54,770
Their hide is tough, but there's good juice inside!

186
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:58,085
Stick it again, stick it again!
- Finish it off!

187
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,931
It's alive and kicking!

188
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,810
Kill him, kill him now!
- Let us feast!

189
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:09,245
Feast! Feast! Feast! Feast!

190
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,701
What is it?

191
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,433
Fat and juicy...

192
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,716
Just a little taste.

193
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,729
Where is it?

194
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,831
Here.

195
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,935
It stings! Stings!

196
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,742
Sting?

197
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:05,451
That's a good name.

198
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,576
Sting.

199
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,769
I'm alright.
- Where's Bilbo?

200
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,359
Bilbo?
- I'm up here.

201
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,441
Pull!

202
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,457
Come on!

203
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,885
Where is it?

204
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:17,914
Where is it?

205
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,838
No!

206
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,041
Thorin, get him!

207
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:54,950
Kili!

208
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:19,718
Mine.

209
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:59,072
Come on keep up!
- Come here!

210
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,935
Do not think I won't kill you, dwarf.

211
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,137
It would be my pleasure.

212
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,680
No!
- Kili!

213
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:50,162
Show me a dagger!

214
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:51,263
Quick!

215
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:55,167
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf,
you're mistaken!

216
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,346
Search them.

217
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,982
Hey, give it back! That's private!

218
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,424
Who is this? Your brother?

219
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:15,554
That is my wife!

220
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:21,993
And what of this horrid creature? A goblin mutant?
- That's my wee lad, Gimli.

221
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,707
Where did you get this?

222
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,326
It was given to me.

223
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,033
Not just a thief, but a liar as well?

224
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,640
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

225
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,093
This is not the end of it!

226
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:17,205
You hear me!?

227
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,332
Get off me!

228
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,216
Aren't you going to search me?

229
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:34,752
I could have anything down my trousers.
- Or nothing.

230
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,520
Leave it!

231
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:16,162
There's no way out! This is no Orc dungeon!

232
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:19,165
These are the halls of the Woodland realm.

233
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:21,167
No one leaves here -

234
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,369
- but by the King's consent.

235
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:31,177
Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand.

236
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:37,196
A quest to reclaim a homeland, and slay a dragon.

237
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:42,387
I myself, suspect a more prosaic matter.

238
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:47,877
Attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.

239
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:57,174
You have found a way in. You seek that which would
bestow upon you the right to rule.

240
00:36:58,203 --> 00:37:00,305
The King's jewel.

241
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:02,407
The Arkenstone.

242
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,423
It is precious to you beyond measure.

243
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:11,316
I understand that.

244
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:15,319
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire.

245
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:20,324
White gems, of pure starlight.

246
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:23,327
I offer you my help.

247
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:29,344
I am listening.
- I will let you go -

248
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:33,337
- if you but return what is mine.

249
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,443
A favor for a favor.
- You have my word.

250
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,955
One King to another.

251
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:56,269
I would not trust Thranduil, the Great King, to
all of his words, should end of all days be upon us!

252
00:37:57,185 --> 00:38:00,277
You, lack all honor!

253
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:03,488
I have seen how you treat your friends.

254
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:09,272
We came to you once. Starving, homeless. Seeking your help.

255
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:16,002
You turned your back!
You turned away from the suffering of my people -

256
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:21,283
- and the inferno that destroyed us!
[In Dwarvish] <i>May you die in dragon fire!</i>

257
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:26,939
Do not talk to me of dragon fire!
I know it's wrath and ruin.

258
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:35,297
I have faced the great serpents of the north.

259
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:41,739
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.

260
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:45,507
But he would not listen.

261
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,727
You are just like him.

262
00:38:54,416 --> 00:39:01,422
Stay here, if you will, and rot. A hundred years
is a mere blink in the life of an Elf.

263
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,527
I'm patient. I can wait.

264
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:17,538
Did he offer you a deal?
- He did.

265
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,543
I told him he could go <i>[Dwarfish profanities]</i>.

266
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,548
Well. That's that then.

267
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,452
The deal was our only hope.

268
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,939
Not our only hope.

269
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,466
I know you're there.

270
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:50,370
Why do you linger in the shadows?

271
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:54,474
I was coming to report to you.

272
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:57,922
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed
not two minutes past.

273
00:39:58,378 --> 00:40:02,682
We cleared the forest, as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep coming up from the south.

274
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:06,486
They are spawning in the ruins of Dul Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source -

275
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:12,018
That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our
lands clear of those foul creatures, that is your task.

276
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:13,593
And when we drive them off?

277
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:16,595
What then?
Will they not spread to other lands?

278
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:18,948
Other lands are not my concern.

279
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:27,406
The fortunes of the world will rise and fall.
But here in this kingdom, we will endure.

280
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:33,412
Legolas said you fought well today.

281
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,618
He's grown very fond of you.

282
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,425
I assure, my lord.
Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.

283
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,427
Perhaps he did once.

284
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:52,630
Now I'm not so sure.

285
00:40:56,534 --> 00:41:01,539
I do not think you would allow your son to pledge
himself to a lowly Sylvan Elf.

286
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,442
No, you're right. I would not.

287
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,545
Still, he cares about you.

288
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,823
Do not give him hope where there is none.

289
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:52,488
The stone in your hand. What is it?

290
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,492
It is a talisman.

291
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:03,599
A powerful spell is upon it.
If any but a dwarf reads the ruins in the stone -

292
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,702
They will be forever cursed.

293
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,116
Or not.

294
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,713
Depending on whether you believe in the kind of thing.
It's just a token.

295
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:22,618
A rune stone.

296
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,822
My mother gave it to me so I'd remember
my promise.

297
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:30,031
What promise?

298
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,290
That I would come back to her.

299
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:36,531
She worries.

300
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:39,534
She thinks I'm reckless.

301
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:41,359
Are you?

302
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:58,748
Sounds like quite a party you're having up there.

303
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:00,755
It is Merethan Gilith.

304
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:03,748
The feast of starlight.

305
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:06,929
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

306
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,664
What Woodelves love best, the light of the stars.

307
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:14,568
I always thought it is a cold light.

308
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:17,771
Remote. Far away.

309
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:20,774
It is memory.

310
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,777
Precious and pure.

311
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:30,110
Like your promise.

312
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:41,204
I have walked there sometimes.

313
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:44,597
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

314
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:49,173
I have seen the world fall away -

315
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,606
- and the white light forever fill the air.

316
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,711
I saw a fine one once.

317
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:05,718
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.
Red and gold it was, it filled the sky.

318
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:13,972
We were an escort for some merchants who (?), they were trading
in silverwork for thugs. We took the Green Way south.

319
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:18,730
Keeping the mountain to our left, and then it appeared.

320
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:23,168
This huge fine one. Lighting our path.

321
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,844
These empty barrels should've been sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

322
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:38,157
The bargeman will be waiting for them.
- Say what you like about our ill-tempered king -

323
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:40,209
- but he has an excellent taste in wine.

324
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:45,657
Come Elros, try it.
- I have the dwarves in my charge.

325
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:48,157
They're locked up. Where can they go?

326
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:56,667
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

327
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:59,050
We're never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

328
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:04,418
Not stuck in here, you're not.

329
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,851
Bilbo!

330
00:45:13,871 --> 00:45:16,293
Shh! There are guards nearby!

331
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,081
You first. Ori! Not that way.
Down here, follow me!

332
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:43,913
Easy now.

333
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,266
This way.

334
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:06,449
I don't believe we're in their cellars!

335
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:09,838
You're supposed to be leading us out, not further in!
- I know what I'm doing.

336
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:12,741
This way.

337
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,948
Everyone, climb into the barrels. Quickly!

338
00:46:20,048 --> 00:46:26,755
Are you mad? They'll find us!
- No no, they won't. I promise you. Please, please, you must trust me.

339
00:46:31,606 --> 00:46:33,269
Do as he says.

340
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,565
What do we do now?

341
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:54,782
Hold your breath.

342
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:56,784
Hold me breath? What do you mean?

343
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:24,508
Where is the keeper of the keys!?

344
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:38,660
<i>(Elvish)</i>

345
00:47:51,393 --> 00:47:53,303
Welcome, master Baggins.

346
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:55,941
Go! Come on, let's go!

347
00:47:58,024 --> 00:47:59,564
<i>(Elvish)</i>

348
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,863
Hold on!

349
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,194
No more!

350
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:31,283
Help!
- Thorin!

351
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:57,979
No!

352
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,165
Watch out!

353
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,705
Get up on the bridge!

354
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:47,343
Kili!

355
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,608
Kili?

356
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:20,505
Kili.

357
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:15,468
Kili!

358
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:40,334
Nori!

359
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,531
Cut the log!

360
00:53:01,796 --> 00:53:02,678
Bombur!

361
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:40,050
Tauriel!

362
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:40,786
Oh, it's you!
- Why am I here, Gandalf?

363
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:45,013
Trust me, Radagast. I would not have called you here without good reason.

364
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,950
This is not a nice place to meet.

365
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:56,404
No. It is not.

366
00:56:57,138 --> 00:57:00,982
These are dark spells, Gandalf. Old.

367
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:04,396
And full of hate. Who's buried here?

368
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:08,075
If he had a name, it's long since been lost.

369
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:12,682
He would've been known only - as a servant of evil.

370
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:17,911
One of a number.

371
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,492
One of nine.

372
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:28,989
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

373
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:33,502
The Ring Wraiths have been summoned to Dul Guldur.
- But it cannot be the Necromancer.

374
00:57:33,602 --> 00:57:37,506
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

375
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,349
Who said it was human?

376
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:52,896
The Nine only answer to one master. We've been blind,
Radagast. And in our blindness, the enemy has returned.

377
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:57,425
He is summoning his servants.

378
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,526
Azog the Defiler -

379
00:57:59,627 --> 00:58:01,529
- is no ordinary hunter.

380
00:58:01,636 --> 00:58:10,529
He is a commander. A commander of legions.
The enemy is preparing for war.

381
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:15,982
It will begin in the east.
His mind is set upon that mountain.

382
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,263
Where are you going?

383
00:58:17,255 --> 00:58:19,497
To rejoin the others.
- Gandalf!

384
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:21,522
I started this -

385
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:26,445
- I cannot forsake them. They are in grave danger.
- If what you say is true -

386
00:58:26,553 --> 00:58:29,935
- the world is in grave danger.

387
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:35,021
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

388
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:39,388
You want me to cast my friends aside.

389
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,099
Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

390
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:52,579
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long, we've lost the current.

391
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:54,417
We almost have ground!

392
00:58:55,276 --> 00:58:57,284
Make for the shore!
- Aye.

393
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,776
Come on, let's go!

394
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,691
Come on!

395
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:08,010
Move.

396
00:59:18,604 --> 00:59:19,705
I'm fine, it's nothing.

397
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:24,057
On your feet.
- Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

398
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:26,924
There's an Orc pack on our tail. We keep moving.

399
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,615
To where?
- To the mountain, we're so close.

400
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,393
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

401
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:34,619
We have no way to cross it.

402
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:38,738
So then we go around.
- The Orcs will run us down as sure as daylight.

403
00:59:38,824 --> 00:59:41,526
We have no weapons to defend ourselves.

404
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:45,530
Bind his leg, quickly. You have two minutes.

405
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,361
Do it again -

406
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:09,386
- and you're dead!

407
01:00:11,158 --> 01:00:16,072
Excuse me, but um.. you're from Laketown,
if I'm not mistaken?

408
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:22,666
That barge over there,
it wouldn't be available for hire by any chance?

409
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:26,570
What makes you think I would help you?

410
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,025
Those boots have seen better days, as has that coat.

411
01:00:31,575 --> 01:00:34,126
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed?

412
01:00:34,775 --> 01:00:36,271
How many bairns?

413
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:42,329
A boy and two girls.
- And your wife, I imagine, she's a beauty?

414
01:00:43,686 --> 01:00:44,884
Aye..

415
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:46,705
..she was.

416
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:54,290
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
- Oh come on, come on, enough with the niceties.

417
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,103
What's your hurry?

418
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:57,600
What's it to you?

419
01:00:58,001 --> 01:00:59,702
I would like to know who you are.

420
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:02,087
And what you are doing in these lands.

421
01:01:02,705 --> 01:01:05,400
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains -

422
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:08,611
- journeying to see our kin, in the Iron Hills.

423
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,814
Simple merchants, you say?

424
01:01:12,205 --> 01:01:15,494
We need food, supplies, weapons.

425
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:17,303
Can you help us?

426
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:23,725
I know where these barrels came from.

427
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:25,798
What of it?

428
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:28,876
I don't know what business you had with the Elves..

429
01:01:29,197 --> 01:01:31,197
..but I don't think it ended well.

430
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:39,009
No one enters Laketown but by lead of the Master.
All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.

431
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:42,978
He would see you with lions before risking
the wrath of king Thranduil.

432
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:44,978
<i>[Dwarvish]</i>

433
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,752
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

434
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:52,439
Aye.

435
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:57,658
But for that, you would need a smuggler.

436
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:00,478
For which we would pay. Double.

437
01:02:04,322 --> 01:02:07,798
<i>(Black Speech)</i>

438
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:16,439
Such is the nature of evil. Out there in the
vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads..

439
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:19,478
..a shadow that grows in the dark.

440
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:24,685
A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.

441
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:30,891
So it ever was.
So will it always be.

442
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:35,795
In time, all foul things come forth.

443
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,798
You were tracking a company of thirteen Dwarves.

444
01:02:38,898 --> 01:02:43,314
Why?
- Not thirteen. Not anymore.

445
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:47,707
The young one, the blackhead archer.

446
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,710
We stuck him with a mortal shot.

447
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:56,431
Poisons in his blood. He'll be choking on it soon.

448
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:59,034
Answer the question, filth.

449
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,925
I would not antagonize her.

450
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:08,719
You like killing things, Orc?

451
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,103
You like death?

452
01:03:12,337 --> 01:03:14,056
Then let me give it to you!

453
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:33,689
I do not care about one dead Dwarf.
Answer the question.

454
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:39,757
You have nothing to fear.
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

455
01:03:40,344 --> 01:03:45,251
You had orders to kill them. Why?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

456
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:52,777
The Dwarf runt... will never be king!
- King? There is no king under the mountain, nor will there ever be.

457
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:55,455
None would dare enter Erebor -

458
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:58,759
- whilst the dragon lives.
- You know nothing!

459
01:03:58,776 --> 01:04:03,781
Your world will burn...
- What are you talking about?

460
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,311
Speak!

461
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:08,444
Our time has come again.

462
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:13,155
My master serves The One.

463
01:04:13,632 --> 01:04:18,546
Do you understand now, Elfling?
Death is upon you.

464
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:22,999
The flames of war are upon you.

465
01:04:26,022 --> 01:04:27,218
Why did you do that?

466
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:29,366
You promised to set him free.

467
01:04:29,483 --> 01:04:30,718
And I did.

468
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:35,257
I freed his wretched head from his
miserable shoulders.

469
01:04:36,764 --> 01:04:38,815
There was more the Orc could tell us.

470
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,741
There was nothing more he could tell <i>me.</i>

471
01:04:42,514 --> 01:04:44,922
What did he mean by the flames of war?

472
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:50,826
He means they intend to unleash a weapon so great
it will destroy all before it.

473
01:04:50,926 --> 01:04:54,600
I want the watch doubled at our borders!
All roads, all rivers.

474
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:56,819
Nothing moves but I hear of it.

475
01:04:56,832 --> 01:04:59,483
No one enters this kingdom..

476
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:01,492
..and no one leaves it.

477
01:06:26,366 --> 01:06:27,616
Watch out!

478
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:38,624
What are you trying to do, drown us?

479
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:41,507
I was born and bred on these waters,
master Dwarf.

480
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,937
If I wanted to drown you,
I would not do it here.

481
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,796
Oh I've had enough of this lippy lakeman.

482
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:52,069
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with him.

483
01:06:52,085 --> 01:06:54,947
Oh, Bard, his name is Bard.

484
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:56,047
How do you know?

485
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:57,507
Uh, I asked him.

486
01:06:57,522 --> 01:07:00,052
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

487
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:03,952
We do not have to like him,
we simply have to pay him.

488
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:06,958
Come on now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

489
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,961
How do we know he won't betray us?

490
01:07:10,062 --> 01:07:11,624
We don't.

491
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:14,966
There's ehm.. just a wee problem.

492
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:17,452
We're ten coins short.

493
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,772
Gloin.

494
01:07:21,547 --> 01:07:22,172
Come on.

495
01:07:22,196 --> 01:07:25,413
Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

496
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:29,062
I have been bled dry by this venture.

497
01:07:29,585 --> 01:07:32,083
What have I seen for my investment?

498
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:36,132
Not but misery and grief and -...

499
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:46,096
Bless my beard.

500
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,171
Take it.

501
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:50,200
Take all of it!

502
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:58,477
The money, quick! Give it to me.
- We will pay you when we get our provisions but not before.

503
01:07:58,602 --> 01:08:01,171
If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.

504
01:08:01,499 --> 01:08:03,213
There are guards ahead.

505
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,131
What's he doing?

506
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,233
He's talking to someone.

507
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,804
He's.. pointing right at us!

508
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,143
Now they're shaking hands.
- What?!

509
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,245
He's selling us out?

510
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:00,335
Quiet!

511
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,273
We're approaching the toll gate.

512
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,390
Halt! Goods inspection!

513
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,242
Papers please!

514
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:24,411
Oh! It's you, Bard!
- Morning Percy.

515
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:26,093
Anything to declare?

516
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:31,989
Nothing, but I am cold and tired. Ready for home.
- You and me both.

517
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:38,278
There we are. All in order.

518
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:41,926
Not, so, fast.

519
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,622
Consignment of empty barrels, from the Woodland realm.

520
01:09:47,325 --> 01:09:58,125
Only.. they're not empty. Are they Bard?
If I recall correctly, you're licensed as a bargeman -

521
01:09:58,225 --> 01:10:02,510
- not a fisherman.

522
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:04,231
That's none of your business.

523
01:10:04,736 --> 01:10:09,049
Wrong. It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

524
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:12,138
Oh, come on Alfrid have a heart, people need to eat!

525
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:14,340
These fish are illegal.

526
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,510
Empty barrels over the side.
- You heard him, in the canal!

527
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,348
Come on. Get a move on.

528
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:24,569
(?) this town is struggling.

529
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:29,155
Times are hard. Food is scarce.
- It's not my problem.

530
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:32,814
And when the people hear the Master is dumping
fish back in the lake?

531
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:35,361
When the rioting starts?

532
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:39,971
Will it be your problem then?

533
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:45,494
Stop!

534
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:56,978
Ever the people's champion, eh Bard? Protector of
the common folk. You might have their favor now bargeman, but it won't last.

535
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:02,025
Raise the gate!

536
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:10,103
The Master has his eye on you! You'll do well
to remember, we know where you live.

537
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,955
It's a small town, Alfrid.

538
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,658
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

539
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:35,866
All this stink of civil unrest..
Someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.

540
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:40,171
Gout playing up, Sire?

541
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:44,228
It's the damp! It's the only possible explanation.
Get me a brandy.

542
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:47,874
The mood of the people, Sire... it's turning ugly.

543
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:51,234
They're commoners, Alfrid. They've always been ugly.

544
01:11:51,234 --> 01:11:55,937
It's not my fault they live in a place that stinks
of fish oil and tar.

545
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:59,624
Jobs, shelter, food!

546
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:01,584
It's all they ever bleat about.

547
01:12:01,593 --> 01:12:05,348
It's my belief, Sire;
They're being lead on by troublemakers.

548
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:09,976
Then we must find these troublemakers
and arrest them!

549
01:12:10,253 --> 01:12:15,429
My thoughts exactly, Sire.
- And all this talk of change must be suppressed!

550
01:12:15,437 --> 01:12:19,608
We can't afford to let the rebel band
together and start making noises.

551
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:25,109
The next thing you know they'll start
asking questions, forming committees!

552
01:12:25,265 --> 01:12:30,187
Launching inquiries!
- Out with the old, in with the new?

553
01:12:30,272 --> 01:12:31,373
What?

554
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:33,991
That's what they've been saying, Sire.

555
01:12:34,007 --> 01:12:41,570
There is even talk of an election.
- An election?! That's absurd! I won't stand for it.

556
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:44,695
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

557
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:54,148
Shaggers, ingrates, rebel rousers!
Who would have the nerve to question my authority?

558
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,499
Who would dare?!
Who-...

559
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:03,351
Bard!

560
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:09,004
You mark my words, that trouble making
bargeman is behind all this!

561
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:18,223
Get your hands off me!

562
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:27,198
You didn't see them. They were never here.

563
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:30,356
The fish you can have for nothing.

564
01:13:32,885 --> 01:13:34,083
Follow me.

565
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:47,703
Da, our house! It's being watched.

566
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:25,713
You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.

567
01:14:26,485 --> 01:14:27,666
Da!

568
01:14:28,103 --> 01:14:29,388
Where you been?

569
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:31,986
Father, there you are. I was worried!

570
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:36,627
Bain, get them in.

571
01:14:43,402 --> 01:14:47,971
If you speak of this to anyone,
I'll rip your hands off.

572
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:52,408
Get off.

573
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:54,956
Up there.

574
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,994
Da... why are there Dwarves coming out of our toilet?

575
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,791
Will they bring us luck?

576
01:15:11,478 --> 01:15:14,228
They may not be the best fit,
but they'll keep you warm.

577
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:17,002
Thank you very much.

578
01:15:26,543 --> 01:15:28,645
A Dwarvish wind lance!

579
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,908
You look like you've seen a ghost.

580
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:36,453
He has. The last time we saw such a weapon -

581
01:15:37,554 --> 01:15:39,656
- the city was on fire.

582
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:43,355
It was the day the dragon came.

583
01:15:46,135 --> 01:15:49,197
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

584
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:53,570
Girion, the lord of the city -

585
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:56,773
- rallied his bowmen and fired upon the beast.

586
01:15:57,171 --> 01:16:01,477
But a dragon's hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armor.

587
01:16:01,678 --> 01:16:07,537
Only a black arrow fired from a wind lance could
have pierced the dragon's hide.

588
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:11,247
And few of those arrows were ever made.

589
01:16:16,592 --> 01:16:20,513
The store was running low,
and Girion made his last stand.

590
01:16:27,692 --> 01:16:30,896
What they have of men, been true that day..

591
01:16:31,856 --> 01:16:33,757
..much would have been different.

592
01:16:37,713 --> 01:16:40,002
You speak as if you were there.

593
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:42,936
All Dwarves know the tale.

594
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,681
Then you would know Girion hit the dragon.

595
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,424
He loosened a scale under the left wing.
One more shot and he would have killed the beast.

596
01:16:51,322 --> 01:16:54,588
That's a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

597
01:16:55,802 --> 01:16:57,245
You took our money.

598
01:16:58,323 --> 01:17:00,135
Where are the weapons?

599
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,924
Wait here.

600
01:17:17,651 --> 01:17:22,138
Tomorrow begins the last days of Autumn.
- Durin's day falls the morning after next.

601
01:17:22,462 --> 01:17:24,365
We much reach the mountain before then.

602
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:26,333
And if we do not?

603
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,662
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?

604
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,782
Then this quest has been for nothing.

605
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,044
What is this?

606
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:47,638
Eye gauge. Made from an old harpoon.

607
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,583
And this?
- A crow bill, we call it. Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

608
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:56,589
It's heavy in a hand, I grant. But in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

609
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:59,497
We paid you for weapons.

610
01:17:59,692 --> 01:18:02,595
Iron forged swords and axes!

611
01:18:02,695 --> 01:18:03,943
It's a joke!

612
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:08,521
You won't find better outside the city armory.

613
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,193
All iron forged weapons are held there under lock and key.

614
01:18:11,318 --> 01:18:12,219
Thorin.

615
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,302
What if it was enough for end goal?

616
01:18:15,318 --> 01:18:16,599
I've made do with less.

617
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,935
So have you.

618
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,607
I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

619
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:23,831
What did you say?

620
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,083
There are spies watching this house in probably
every dock and wharf in the town.

621
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,722
You must wait 'till nightfall.

622
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:48,922
Thorin?

623
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:02,753
Da'?

624
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:06,750
Don't let them leave.

625
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,172
Tauriel..

626
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,693
..you cannot hunt thirty Orcs on your own.

627
01:19:43,893 --> 01:19:46,250
But I am not on my own.

628
01:19:46,796 --> 01:19:48,570
You knew I would come?

629
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:54,704
The King is angry, Tauriel. For six hundred years
my farther has protected you -

630
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:57,807
- favoured you. You defied his orders.

631
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:00,148
You betrayed his trust.

632
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:16,203
The King has never led Orc filth from our lands. Yet he would
let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

633
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:19,352
It is not our fight.
- It is our fight.

634
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:24,539
It will not end here. With every victory this
evil will grow.

635
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:32,641
If your father has his way, we'll do nothing. We will
hide within our walls. Live our lives away from the light.

636
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,727
And let darkness descend.

637
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:38,847
Are we not part of this world?

638
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:44,391
Tell me <i>mellon</i>, when did we let evil
become stronger than us?

639
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:51,703
Hello, Bard. What are you after?

640
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:58,828
There was a tapestry. An old one. Where is it gone?
- What tapestry are you talking about?

641
01:20:58,866 --> 01:20:59,967
This one.

642
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:02,031
<i>They were Dwarves I tell you.</i>

643
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:06,974
Appeared out of nowhere. Full beards.
Fierce eyes. I've never seen the like.

644
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:09,961
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

645
01:21:09,977 --> 01:21:12,234
It's the prophecy.
- Prophecy?

646
01:21:12,259 --> 01:21:14,633
Prophecy of Durin's book.

647
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:24,742
The prophecy?

648
01:21:27,894 --> 01:21:29,281
Prophecy.

649
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:31,023
The old tales have come true.

650
01:21:31,038 --> 01:21:33,764
Vast halls of treasure!

651
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,901
Can it really be true?

652
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:37,727
Has the Lord of the Silver Fountains returned?

653
01:21:37,988 --> 01:21:43,461
The Lord of the Silver Fountain.
The King of Carven Stone.

654
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:47,023
The King Beneath the Mountain.

655
01:21:48,014 --> 01:21:50,602
He'll come and doom us all.

656
01:21:51,117 --> 01:21:55,821
<i>And the bells shall ring in gladness at the
Mountain King's return -</i>

657
01:21:56,455 --> 01:22:03,219
<i>- but all shall fail in sadness.
And the Lake will shine, and burn.</i>

658
01:22:04,717 --> 01:22:08,609
Da'! I tried to stop them.
- How long have they been gone?!

659
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:14,039
Can you see anything?
- Shh, keep it down!

660
01:22:14,046 --> 01:22:16,914
As soon as we have the weapons,
we'll make straight for the mountain.

661
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:18,242
Go, go, go.

662
01:22:37,022 --> 01:22:38,577
You're allright?

663
01:22:38,863 --> 01:22:40,064
I can manage.

664
01:22:40,965 --> 01:22:42,867
Let's just get out of here.

665
01:22:56,568 --> 01:22:58,092
Run!

666
01:23:26,605 --> 01:23:29,003
What is the meaning of this?!

667
01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:31,261
We caught 'em stealing weapons, Sire.

668
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:37,480
Ah, enemies of the state, then?
- A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, Sire.

669
01:23:37,482 --> 01:23:39,472
Hold your tongue!

670
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,926
You do not know to whom you speak!

671
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:47,925
This is no common criminal. This is Thorin!

672
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,332
Son of Thráin, son of Thrór!

673
01:23:54,277 --> 01:23:56,668
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

674
01:23:58,941 --> 01:24:02,160
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

675
01:24:07,049 --> 01:24:09,855
I remember this town in the great days of old.

676
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:15,920
Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with
silks and fine gems.

677
01:24:15,957 --> 01:24:20,941
This was no forsaken town on a lake!
This was the center -

678
01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:22,964
- of all trade in the north!

679
01:24:24,165 --> 01:24:29,000
I would see those days return. I would relight
the great forges of the Dwarves -

680
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:33,800
- and send wealth and riches flowing once more,
from the halls of Erebor!

681
01:24:35,977 --> 01:24:40,214
Death! That is what you will bring upon us.

682
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:43,660
Dragonfire, and ruin.

683
01:24:45,086 --> 01:24:48,989
If you waken that beast, it will destroy us all.

684
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:53,457
You can listen to this naysayer.
But I promise you this.

685
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:57,855
If we succeed..

686
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:01,425
..all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

687
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:10,160
You will have enough gold to rebuild
Esgaroth ten times over!

688
01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:17,996
All of you! Listen to me, you must listen!
Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?

689
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:22,707
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?

690
01:25:24,808 --> 01:25:26,847
And for what purpose?

691
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:34,386
The blind ambition of a Mountain King, so driven by
greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

692
01:25:35,292 --> 01:25:42,230
Now, now, we must not, any of us,
be too quick to lay blame.

693
01:25:43,042 --> 01:25:49,448
Let us not forget, that it was Girion,
Lord of Dale, your ancestor -

694
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:52,292
- who failed to kill the beast!

695
01:25:54,353 --> 01:25:58,156
It's true, Sire. We all know the story.

696
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:04,199
Arrow after arrow, he shot.
Each one missing its mark.

697
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:12,628
You have no right.

698
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:16,074
No right to enter that mountain.

699
01:26:17,493 --> 01:26:19,832
I have the only right.

700
01:26:25,957 --> 01:26:28,652
I speak to the Master of the men of the Lake.

701
01:26:29,187 --> 01:26:32,089
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

702
01:26:32,298 --> 01:26:37,871
Will you, share, in the great wealth of our people?

703
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:44,808
What say you?

704
01:26:47,894 --> 01:26:52,113
I say unto you...

705
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:54,110
..welcome!

706
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:59,480
Welcome and rise!
Welcome King Under the Mountain!

707
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,418
You do know we're one short?
Where's Bofur?

708
01:27:13,438 --> 01:27:15,139
If he's not here, we leave him behind.

709
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:18,134
We'll have to, if we're to find the door before nightfall.

710
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,855
We can risk no more delays.

711
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:26,324
Not you.

712
01:27:26,349 --> 01:27:29,011
We must travel at speed.
You would slow us down.

713
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:31,699
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

714
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,918
No no.

715
01:27:38,154 --> 01:27:40,394
I'm going to be there when that door is open.

716
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,769
When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...
- Kili.

717
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,260
Stay here.

718
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:49,503
Rest. Join us when you've healed.

719
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:58,173
I'll stay with the lad.
My duty lies with the wounded.

720
01:27:58,173 --> 01:27:59,761
Uncle.

721
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,151
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

722
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:03,277
Tales you told us!

723
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,238
You cannot take that away from him!

724
01:28:05,261 --> 01:28:07,182
Fili.
- I will carry him if I must!

725
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,191
One day you will be King and you will understand.

726
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:14,285
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

727
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,191
Not even my own kin.

728
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:23,297
Fili, don't be a fool.
You belong with the company.

729
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,636
I belong with my brother.

730
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:40,105
By my beard, is that the time?!

731
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:52,714
..and then, we will give fortune to all!

732
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:05,073
Out of the way!

733
01:29:05,438 --> 01:29:06,439
No!

734
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:15,248
Did you miss the boat as well?

735
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:17,250
Kili? Kili!

736
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:23,356
No! I'm done with Dwarves, go away!

737
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,957
No! Please. No one will help us. Kili's sick.

738
01:29:30,362 --> 01:29:31,769
He's very sick.

739
01:30:11,821 --> 01:30:13,477
What is this place?

740
01:30:13,504 --> 01:30:18,758
It was once the city of Dale.
Now it is a ruin.

741
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,813
The desolation of Smaug.

742
01:30:21,813 --> 01:30:26,317
The sun will soon reach mid day. We must find
the hidden door into the mountain before it sets.

743
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:27,963
This way.
- Wait.

744
01:30:27,992 --> 01:30:33,367
Is this the overlook? Gandalf said to meet him here on no account-..
- Do you see him?

745
01:30:33,524 --> 01:30:35,891
We have no time to wait upon the wizard.

746
01:30:36,427 --> 01:30:39,329
We're on our own. Come.

747
01:30:55,321 --> 01:30:57,321
Dol Guldur.

748
01:30:57,347 --> 01:30:59,349
The hill of sorcery.

749
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:02,164
It looks completely abandoned.

750
01:31:02,352 --> 01:31:08,164
As it is meant to.
A spell of concealment lies over this place.

751
01:31:08,558 --> 01:31:12,462
Which means our enemy is not yet
ready to reveal himself.

752
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:18,367
He has not regained his full strengths.

753
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:24,373
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to
the Lady Galadriel. Tell her, we must force his hand.

754
01:31:24,473 --> 01:31:25,374
What do you mean?

755
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:30,883
I'm going in alone. On no account come after me.

756
01:31:36,484 --> 01:31:39,487
Do I have your word?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

757
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:52,930
Wait, Gandalf!

758
01:31:54,313 --> 01:32:01,438
What if it's a trap?
- Turn around and do not come back.

759
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,821
It's undoubtedly a trap.

760
01:33:31,617 --> 01:33:33,599
Anything?
- Nothing!

761
01:33:38,063 --> 01:33:42,305
If the map is true,
the hidden door lies directly above us.

762
01:33:47,187 --> 01:33:48,766
Up here!

763
01:33:57,203 --> 01:33:59,824
You have keen eyes, master Baggins.

764
01:34:31,761 --> 01:34:33,391
This must be it.

765
01:34:34,658 --> 01:34:36,727
The hidden door.

766
01:34:40,564 --> 01:34:45,078
Let all those, who doubted us, rule this day!

767
01:34:50,321 --> 01:34:52,675
Right then, we have a key.

768
01:34:54,777 --> 01:34:58,581
Which means that somewhere, there is a keyhole.

769
01:34:59,682 --> 01:35:02,414
The last light of Durin's day...

770
01:35:04,367 --> 01:35:06,689
...will shine upon the keyhole.

771
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,006
Nori.

772
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,592
We're losing the light. Come on!

773
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:34,717
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping!

774
01:35:34,724 --> 01:35:36,170
I can't find it.

775
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:38,849
It's not here!

776
01:35:41,513 --> 01:35:42,959
Break it down!

777
01:35:44,726 --> 01:35:45,827
Come on!

778
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:53,162
It has to break.
- It's no good. The door's sealed.

779
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:55,224
Can't be opened by force.

780
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:58,076
Powerful magic, aren't it?

781
01:36:07,206 --> 01:36:08,615
No!

782
01:36:13,754 --> 01:36:16,084
The last light of Durin's day...

783
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:20,661
...will shine upon the key hole.

784
01:36:23,664 --> 01:36:25,866
That's what it says.

785
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,771
What did we miss?

786
01:36:35,358 --> 01:36:36,967
What did we miss?

787
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,388
Balin...

788
01:36:39,396 --> 01:36:41,506
We've lost the light.

789
01:36:43,795 --> 01:36:45,785
There's no more to be done.

790
01:36:46,786 --> 01:36:48,788
We had but one chance.

791
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:54,404
Come away, lads. It's over.

792
01:36:55,795 --> 01:36:57,797
Wait a minute, what?

793
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:02,342
Where are they going?

794
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:05,279
You can't give up now!

795
01:37:20,441 --> 01:37:22,343
Thorin...

796
01:37:23,722 --> 01:37:24,923
You can't give up now.

797
01:37:36,735 --> 01:37:39,737
Stand by the grey stone.

798
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:43,741
When the Thrush knocks...

799
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:45,843
The setting sun.

800
01:37:46,323 --> 01:37:48,846
And the last light of Durin's day will shine.

801
01:37:50,905 --> 01:37:52,675
The last light.

802
01:37:54,852 --> 01:37:56,589
Last light.

803
01:38:32,789 --> 01:38:34,258
The last light!

804
01:38:44,407 --> 01:38:46,000
The key hole!

805
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:53,172
Come back! It's the light of the moon!
The last moon of Autumn!

806
01:38:56,112 --> 01:38:58,814
Where's the key?

807
01:39:01,148 --> 01:39:02,049
It was here.

808
01:39:03,018 --> 01:39:04,920
It was just...

809
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:03,977
Erebor.

810
01:40:04,547 --> 01:40:06,532
Thorin...

811
01:40:18,892 --> 01:40:20,994
I know these walls.

812
01:40:24,898 --> 01:40:28,101
These walls.

813
01:40:29,002 --> 01:40:32,005
This stone.

814
01:40:34,207 --> 01:40:37,010
Do you remember it, Balin?

815
01:40:40,012 --> 01:40:42,915
Chambers filled with golden light.

816
01:40:44,116 --> 01:40:46,062
I remember.

817
01:40:59,031 --> 01:41:04,406
Here in lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.

818
01:41:06,038 --> 01:41:12,244
May the Heart of the Mountain unite all Dwarves
in defense of this home.

819
01:41:14,246 --> 01:41:17,048
The throne of the king.

820
01:41:20,355 --> 01:41:22,954
And what's that above it?

821
01:41:27,058 --> 01:41:28,960
The Arkenstone.

822
01:41:30,061 --> 01:41:32,163
The Arkenstone.

823
01:41:35,536 --> 01:41:37,091
And what's that?

824
01:41:37,116 --> 01:41:38,928
That...

825
01:41:38,961 --> 01:41:41,161
...Master burglar...

826
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:43,186
...is why you are here.

827
01:42:01,992 --> 01:42:03,630
Can you not do something?

828
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,395
I need herbs, something to bring down his fever.

829
01:42:06,395 --> 01:42:08,981
I have Nightshade, and then Feverfew.

830
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:11,966
They're no use to me. Do you have any King's Foil?

831
01:42:11,966 --> 01:42:14,809
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

832
01:42:14,834 --> 01:42:16,105
Pigs?

833
01:42:16,106 --> 01:42:18,927
Weed? Right.

834
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:21,211
Don't move.

835
01:42:24,099 --> 01:42:27,989
You want me to find a jewel?

836
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:32,239
A large white jewel, yes.

837
01:42:34,123 --> 01:42:36,966
That's it? Only I imagine there's
quite a few down there.

838
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,856
There is only one Arkenstone.

839
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:42,677
And you'll know it when you see it.

840
01:42:44,019 --> 01:42:44,841
Right.

841
01:42:48,237 --> 01:42:55,630
In truth, lad. I do not know
what you will find down there.

842
01:42:57,786 --> 01:43:01,067
You needn't go, if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

843
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:03,092
No, Balin.

844
01:43:03,151 --> 01:43:05,184
I promised I would do this.

845
01:43:06,154 --> 01:43:08,256
And I think I must try.

846
01:43:12,536 --> 01:43:14,162
It never seizes to amaze me.

847
01:43:14,262 --> 01:43:17,065
What's that?
- The courage of Hobbits.

848
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:25,333
Go now. With as much luck, as you can muster.

849
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,399
Oh, Bilbo.

850
01:43:36,183 --> 01:43:39,286
If there is in fact a uhm...

851
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:42,189
...live dragon down there...

852
01:43:45,007 --> 01:43:46,546
...don't waken it.

853
01:45:04,269 --> 01:45:06,271
Where is your master?

854
01:45:07,272 --> 01:45:08,273
Where is he?!

855
01:47:22,253 --> 01:47:25,057
Sauron...

856
01:49:11,516 --> 01:49:12,594
What's that?

857
01:49:14,609 --> 01:49:17,687
No idea. Shush.

858
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:22,419
Arkenstone...

859
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:26,523
A large, white jewel...

860
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:29,626
Very helpful.

861
01:51:55,102 --> 01:51:59,923
Well, thief...

862
01:52:01,587 --> 01:52:08,516
I smell you. I hear your breath.

863
01:52:09,682 --> 01:52:14,687
I feel your air.

864
01:52:16,589 --> 01:52:21,794
Where are you?

865
01:52:41,613 --> 01:52:45,617
Come, now. Don't be shy.

866
01:52:45,817 --> 01:52:48,820
Step into the light.

867
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:59,180
There is something about you.

868
01:53:01,732 --> 01:53:04,094
Something you carry.

869
01:53:04,617 --> 01:53:07,555
Something made of gold.

870
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:13,985
But far more precious.

871
01:53:18,524 --> 01:53:23,282
There you are, thief in the shadows.

872
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:28,008
I did not come to steal from you -

873
01:53:28,383 --> 01:53:32,016
- oh Smaug, the unnecessarily wealthy.

874
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:34,852
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.

875
01:53:34,946 --> 01:53:39,141
To see, if you really were as great as the old tales say.

876
01:53:39,539 --> 01:53:41,430
I did not believe them.

877
01:53:50,469 --> 01:53:54,149
And do you now?

878
01:53:55,608 --> 01:53:57,188
Truly...

879
01:53:58,227 --> 01:54:00,516
...the tales and songs...

880
01:54:01,305 --> 01:54:06,961
...fall utterly short of your enormity,
oh Smaug the Stupendous.

881
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:10,688
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

882
01:54:10,699 --> 01:54:12,110
No.

883
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,828
No indeed.

884
01:54:15,867 --> 01:54:19,399
You seem familiar with my name.

885
01:54:19,407 --> 01:54:23,367
But I don't remember smelling your kind before.

886
01:54:23,414 --> 01:54:30,188
Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?

887
01:54:35,824 --> 01:54:37,025
I...

888
01:54:39,727 --> 01:54:41,578
I come from under the hill.

889
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,125
Underhill?

890
01:54:46,914 --> 01:54:49,937
And under hills and over hills my path has led.

891
01:54:51,024 --> 01:54:55,164
And through the air. I am he who walk unseen.

892
01:54:55,196 --> 01:55:00,110
Impressive, what else do you claim to be?

893
01:55:00,122 --> 01:55:01,524
I-I am...

894
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:06,053
Luck wearer.

895
01:55:07,249 --> 01:55:10,734
Riddle Maker.
- Lovely titles.

896
01:55:10,758 --> 01:55:13,430
Go on.
- Barrel Rider.

897
01:55:13,438 --> 01:55:17,258
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

898
01:55:18,586 --> 01:55:23,367
And what about your little Dwarf friends?

899
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:25,805
Where are they hiding?

900
01:55:27,282 --> 01:55:30,877
...Dwarves? No.

901
01:55:31,778 --> 01:55:35,008
No, no Dwarves here.
You've got that all wrong.

902
01:55:35,016 --> 01:55:37,071
Oh, I don't think so -

903
01:55:37,086 --> 01:55:45,813
- Barrel Rider. They sent you in here to do their dirty work
while they skulk around outside.

904
01:55:46,485 --> 01:55:53,008
Truly, you are mistaken, oh Smaug,
chiefest and greatest of calamities.

905
01:55:53,062 --> 01:56:00,680
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar!

906
01:56:00,742 --> 01:56:07,336
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
No one better.

907
01:56:07,438 --> 01:56:14,227
It is the gold. They are drawn to treasure
like flies to dead flesh.

908
01:56:16,867 --> 01:56:20,826
Did you think I did not know this day would come?!

909
01:56:21,968 --> 01:56:29,312
That a pack of canting Dwarves would come
crawling back to the mountain!

910
01:56:33,646 --> 01:56:37,399
Was that an earthquake?
- That, my lad...

911
01:56:40,513 --> 01:56:41,914
...was a dragon.

912
01:56:50,367 --> 01:56:53,414
Da'?
- It's coming from the mountain.

913
01:56:56,861 --> 01:57:00,391
You should leave us. Take your children.
Get out of here.

914
01:57:00,782 --> 01:57:05,108
And go where? There is nowhere to go.

915
01:57:06,641 --> 01:57:08,742
Are we going to die, da?

916
01:57:10,352 --> 01:57:11,610
No darling.

917
01:57:11,617 --> 01:57:14,314
The dragon. It's going to kill us.

918
01:57:24,539 --> 01:57:26,625
Not if I kill it first.

919
01:57:28,008 --> 01:57:32,996
The King Under the Mountain is dead.
I took his throne -

920
01:57:33,096 --> 01:57:37,900
And ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

921
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:46,434
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

922
01:57:46,715 --> 01:57:50,012
My armor is iron.

923
01:57:58,059 --> 01:58:01,924
No blade can pierce me!

924
01:58:05,801 --> 01:58:10,348
A black arrow! Why did you never tell me?
- Cause you did not need to know.

925
01:58:17,825 --> 01:58:22,020
Listen to me carefully,
I need you to distract the guards.

926
01:58:22,043 --> 01:58:25,676
Once I'm at the top of the tower,
I'll slip the arrow to the bow.

927
01:58:25,946 --> 01:58:27,934
There he is! Guards, after him!

928
01:58:27,948 --> 01:58:29,951
Quickly, down there, go!

929
01:58:30,051 --> 01:58:31,450
Stop him!

930
01:58:38,137 --> 01:58:39,270
Stop him!

931
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,966
Bain!

932
01:58:47,058 --> 01:58:50,245
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
- No.

933
01:58:50,278 --> 01:58:51,832
I'll deal with them.
- I won't leave you!

934
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,090
Go!

935
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,970
Braga!
- You're under arrest.

936
01:58:57,978 --> 01:59:01,629
On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

937
01:59:43,911 --> 01:59:46,528
What about Bilbo?
- Give him more time.

938
01:59:46,559 --> 01:59:48,958
Time to do what? To be killed?

939
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:52,950
You're afraid.

940
01:59:54,131 --> 01:59:55,927
Yes, I'm afraid.

941
01:59:57,607 --> 02:00:02,216
I fear for you. A sickness lies upon that treasure.

942
02:00:02,747 --> 02:00:06,935
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad.
- I am not my grandfather.

943
02:00:07,364 --> 02:00:09,200
You're not yourself.

944
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:11,739
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

945
02:00:11,763 --> 02:00:17,122
I will not risk this quest for
the life of one burglar.

946
02:00:18,833 --> 02:00:22,646
Bilbo. His name is Bilbo.

947
02:00:25,346 --> 02:00:31,568
It's Oakenshield! That filthy Dwarvish usurper!

948
02:00:33,482 --> 02:00:39,028
He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

949
02:00:39,076 --> 02:00:42,818
No. I don't know what you're talking about.

950
02:00:42,857 --> 02:00:48,091
Don't bother denying it.
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

951
02:00:49,818 --> 02:00:54,341
But it matters not. Oakenshield’s quest...

952
02:00:54,349 --> 02:00:59,161
...will fail. A darkness is coming.

953
02:00:59,196 --> 02:01:03,396
It will spread to every corner of the land.

954
02:01:33,932 --> 02:01:41,237
<i>(Black Speech)</i>

955
02:01:46,034 --> 02:01:53,248
You have been used, thief in the shadows.
You were only ever a means to an end.

956
02:01:54,096 --> 02:01:59,424
The coward Oakenshield has weighted the
value of your life.

957
02:01:59,458 --> 02:02:02,561
Found it worth nothing!

958
02:02:04,353 --> 02:02:05,376
No.

959
02:02:06,161 --> 02:02:07,262
No, you're lying.

960
02:02:07,262 --> 02:02:12,174
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?

961
02:02:12,190 --> 02:02:18,273
As if it was his to give.
I will not part with a single coin.

962
02:02:18,273 --> 02:02:22,176
Not one piece of it.

963
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:32,424
My teeth are swords, my claws are spears.

964
02:02:34,354 --> 02:02:38,643
My wings, are a hurricane!

965
02:02:44,004 --> 02:02:45,746
So it is true.

966
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:50,112
The black arrow found its mark.
- What did you say?

967
02:02:50,152 --> 02:02:56,189
I was just saying, your reputation proceeds you,
oh Smaug the Tyrannical.

968
02:02:56,209 --> 02:03:00,837
Truly, you have no equal on this earth.

969
02:03:04,197 --> 02:03:08,423
I am almost tempted to let you take it.

970
02:03:08,603 --> 02:03:16,181
If only to see Oakenshield suffer.
Watch it destroy him...

971
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:22,665
Watch it corrupt his arms and drive him mad!

972
02:03:25,822 --> 02:03:31,025
But I think not,
I think our little game ends here.

973
02:03:31,064 --> 02:03:36,830
So tell me thief... How do you choose to die?

974
02:04:48,972 --> 02:04:51,074
Da? Is that you da?

975
02:06:26,495 --> 02:06:27,683
Get down!

976
02:07:03,811 --> 02:07:05,186
You killed them all.

977
02:07:05,210 --> 02:07:07,553
There are others. Tauriel.

978
02:07:08,123 --> 02:07:09,014
Come.

979
02:07:13,074 --> 02:07:15,076
We are losing him!

980
02:07:18,155 --> 02:07:19,483
Tauriel.

981
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:44,937
Atheros.

982
02:07:47,179 --> 02:07:48,593
Atheros.

983
02:07:49,652 --> 02:07:51,354
What are you doing?

984
02:07:53,531 --> 02:07:55,433
I'm going to save him.

985
02:08:16,322 --> 02:08:17,937
You're alive!
- Not for much longer!

986
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:19,640
Did you find the Arkenstone?
- The dragon's coming!

987
02:08:19,665 --> 02:08:21,367
The Arkenstone!

988
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:25,332
Did you find it?

989
02:08:30,817 --> 02:08:32,719
We should get out.

990
02:08:35,512 --> 02:08:36,613
Thorin...

991
02:08:40,167 --> 02:08:41,368
Thorin!

992
02:09:11,844 --> 02:09:15,476
You will burn!

993
02:09:22,895 --> 02:09:24,443
Come on Bilbo!

994
02:09:37,045 --> 02:09:38,161
Come on.

995
02:09:55,112 --> 02:09:56,333
Hold him down.

996
02:10:04,725 --> 02:10:10,974
<i>(Elvish)</i>

997
02:10:13,434 --> 02:10:14,560
Tilda!

998
02:11:07,529 --> 02:11:08,732
Shh!

999
02:11:16,542 --> 02:11:21,447
We've given him to the slip!
- No, he's too cunning for that.

1000
02:11:23,654 --> 02:11:27,208
So where to now?
- The western guard room.

1001
02:11:27,326 --> 02:11:30,388
There may be a way out.
- It's too high...

1002
02:11:30,951 --> 02:11:33,193
There's no chance that way.
- It's our only chance.

1003
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:36,521
We have to try.

1004
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:45,245
I've heard tell of the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1005
02:12:45,401 --> 02:12:48,362
That was a priviledge to witness.

1006
02:12:50,698 --> 02:12:52,479
Tauriel.

1007
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:57,846
Lie still.

1008
02:13:04,709 --> 02:13:07,260
You cannot be her.

1009
02:13:10,058 --> 02:13:12,885
She is far away.

1010
02:13:16,323 --> 02:13:20,015
She is far, far away from me.

1011
02:13:21,229 --> 02:13:27,174
She walks in starlight in another world.

1012
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:33,823
And it was just a dream.

1013
02:13:45,514 --> 02:13:48,317
Do you think she could've loved me?

1014
02:13:55,229 --> 02:13:56,378
Stay close.

1015
02:14:06,427 --> 02:14:10,084
That's it then. There's no way out.

1016
02:14:16,601 --> 02:14:18,703
The last of our kin.

1017
02:14:22,723 --> 02:14:28,068
They must've come here, hoping beyond hope.

1018
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:39,584
We could try to reach the mines.

1019
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:43,096
Might last a few days.

1020
02:14:44,951 --> 02:14:46,685
No.

1021
02:14:49,224 --> 02:14:51,435
I will not die like this.

1022
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:56,434
Cowering. Clawing for breath.

1023
02:15:01,419 --> 02:15:04,263
We make for the forges.
- He'll see us.

1024
02:15:04,294 --> 02:15:06,396
Sure as death.
- Not if we split up.

1025
02:15:06,435 --> 02:15:09,466
Thorin, we'll never make it.

1026
02:15:09,552 --> 02:15:13,982
Some of us might. Lead him to the forges.

1027
02:15:14,635 --> 02:15:16,310
We kill the dragon.

1028
02:15:17,929 --> 02:15:23,034
If this is to end with fire,
then we will burn together.

1029
02:15:24,839 --> 02:15:26,349
This way!

1030
02:15:30,037 --> 02:15:36,263
Flee! Flee! Run for your lives!

1031
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:40,552
There is nowhere to hide.

1032
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:42,576
Behind you!

1033
02:15:43,874 --> 02:15:45,568
Come on!

1034
02:15:46,904 --> 02:15:48,076
Run!

1035
02:15:49,496 --> 02:15:52,693
Hey you! Here!

1036
02:18:50,099 --> 02:18:53,638
This way! Come on!

1037
02:18:53,982 --> 02:18:55,240
Thorin!

1038
02:19:00,024 --> 02:19:01,025
Follow Balin!

1039
02:19:02,396 --> 02:19:03,597
Come on!

1040
02:19:19,491 --> 02:19:20,593
Thorin!

1041
02:19:29,906 --> 02:19:31,857
Hold on!

1042
02:20:04,626 --> 02:20:06,528
Thorin!

1043
02:20:08,927 --> 02:20:10,439
Go!

1044
02:20:14,056 --> 02:20:18,041
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone gold.

1045
02:20:18,103 --> 02:20:22,110
He's right. We've no fire hot enough
to set them ablaze.

1046
02:20:24,327 --> 02:20:26,429
Have we not?

1047
02:20:27,494 --> 02:20:30,433
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!

1048
02:20:34,455 --> 02:20:37,339
You have grown slow, and fat!

1049
02:20:38,267 --> 02:20:40,299
In your dotage.

1050
02:20:41,424 --> 02:20:42,564
Slug!

1051
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,447
Take cover!

1052
02:21:13,189 --> 02:21:15,493
Bombur! Get those pillows working!

1053
02:21:15,672 --> 02:21:16,773
Go!

1054
02:21:30,829 --> 02:21:34,775
Bilbo! Up there. On my mark, pull that lever.

1055
02:21:45,235 --> 02:21:50,618
Balin, can you still mix a flaskflame?
- Alright, it'll only take a jiffy, come on!

1056
02:21:51,856 --> 02:21:54,032
We don't have a jiffy...

1057
02:22:05,078 --> 02:22:08,782
Pass the spell book!
- You sure you know what you're doing?

1058
02:22:20,381 --> 02:22:21,665
Come on!

1059
02:22:43,699 --> 02:22:45,055
Now!

1060
02:24:41,044 --> 02:24:43,146
Lead him to the gallery of the Kings!

1061
02:25:30,736 --> 02:25:32,616
Keep going, Bilbo!

1062
02:26:19,130 --> 02:26:24,692
You think can decieve me, Barrel Rider?

1063
02:26:25,653 --> 02:26:28,840
You have come from Laketown!

1064
02:26:30,317 --> 02:26:38,755
This is some sort of scheme hatched between these
filthy Dwarves and those miserable tuck-trading lake men!

1065
02:26:39,528 --> 02:26:46,520
Those sniveling cowards with their
long bows and black arrows.

1066
02:26:46,589 --> 02:26:52,675
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit!
- Oh no!

1067
02:26:54,481 --> 02:26:59,473
This isn't their fault! Wait!
You cannot go to Laketown!

1068
02:27:00,911 --> 02:27:05,231
You care about them, do you?

1069
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:07,005
Good.

1070
02:27:07,093 --> 02:27:09,700
Then you can watch them die!

1071
02:27:14,933 --> 02:27:19,255
Here! You witless worm!

1072
02:27:24,661 --> 02:27:29,262
You.
- I am taking back what you stole.

1073
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:38,648
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf.

1074
02:27:39,364 --> 02:27:44,083
I laid low your warriors of old.

1075
02:27:44,294 --> 02:27:48,997
I am still terror in the hearts of men.

1076
02:27:50,199 --> 02:27:55,997
I, am King Under the Mountain!

1077
02:27:56,005 --> 02:27:59,903
This is not your kingdom. These are dwarf lands.

1078
02:28:01,169 --> 02:28:03,340
This is dwarf gold.

1079
02:28:04,512 --> 02:28:07,676
And we will have our revenge!

1080
02:28:08,953 --> 02:28:10,855
[Dwarvish]

1081
02:29:28,473 --> 02:29:38,765
I am going to die? Amazing!
I will show you revenge!

1082
02:30:15,962 --> 02:30:19,966
Listen to me! Do you not know what is coming?

1083
02:30:22,044 --> 02:30:25,811
I am fire.

1084
02:30:26,766 --> 02:30:30,372
I am...

1085
02:30:31,764 --> 02:30:33,764
...Death.

1086
02:30:41,727 --> 02:30:44,090
What have we done?
