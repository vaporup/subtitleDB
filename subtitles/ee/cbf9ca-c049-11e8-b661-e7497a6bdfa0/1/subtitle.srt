1
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:08,888
Hey

2
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,394
Stop! Hey!

3
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,603
Stop! Mister

4
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,077
What is your name?

5
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,183
Shit!

6
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:33,043
"What is your name"
It means...

7
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,856
...asking for your name

8
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:37,323
There is a "Shit" man

9
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:38,726
wanting us to stop

10
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:41,890
But in such remote places,

11
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,392
we should not stop...

12
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,724
...for strangers

13
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,800
He may die of thirst

14
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,431
if we don't stop for him

15
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:51,941
Seven, tell him to pull over at once

16
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,368
Yes

17
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,070
Master, I've been eating too many
beans and suffer diarrhea from it

18
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,213
If I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

19
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,479
Stop!

20
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,978
Fai-hong, he can't hear you

21
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,418
What are you doing?

22
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,383
Climbing!

23
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,389
Pal, please stop to save that guy

24
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,590
What kind of talk's it?

25
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,763
What are you doing?

26
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,849
Craziest damn thing I've ever seen

27
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,695
Nothing makes me happier than
saving a life

28
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:46,830
How about saving yourself first?

29
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,372
Much obliged Ma'am,

30
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:00,501
folks round here call me Billy!

31
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:02,676
Nice to meet you!

32
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,005
I am Wong Fai-hong!

33
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:06,047
Pleasure!

34
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:07,943
This is a good chance...

35
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,848
...to practice your English,
come on

36
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:12,448
Who, what, where, when!

37
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,059
Who, what, where, when!

38
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:18,391
When!

39
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:19,293
When what?

40
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,898
I am Diana

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,728
Pleasure Ma'am

42
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:24,460
When?

43
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:26,831
Nothing

44
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:33,840
You know how?

45
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:35,110
I know everything!

46
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,878
See, here is the America,

47
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,581
and right there is where we are,

48
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,210
right there, that's my home town

49
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,183
My folks and I lived back east
for a while

50
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:23,986
But things didn't work out

51
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,816
So we moved out here looking for
a new start

52
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,024
You know what I mean?

53
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,324
Yeah

54
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:30,261
Yeah! Yeah!

55
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:31,364
Ma'am

56
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,489
Hi

57
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:37,730
You really understand what he said?

58
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,067
No

59
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,801
I simply pretend that I do

60
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,070
Yeah?

61
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:46,904
Yeah!

62
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:47,938
Yeah!

63
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,005
Yeah!

64
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:51,914
Yeah!

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,246
Yeah... Yeah...

66
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,318
Cut the bull shit and start eating

67
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,623
It's beans again?

68
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,187
We have to be very lucky to make it
to the America

69
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,063
Ah Sol's clinic...

70
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,261
there is also called
Po Chi Lam right?

71
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:13,172
Exactly under the same name

72
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:20,710
Having to go through this...

73
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,874
...to pay him a visit,

74
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,779
he must be joking

75
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,151
Master, we ain't no need to live
on beans anymore

76
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,589
Where are you going?

77
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:36,728
How would you like to have
chicken buff for appetizer?

78
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,260
Coffee, tea, or me?

79
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,232
Or me? How do I drink you?

80
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,343
You are such a woodshed

81
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,248
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,

82
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:05,457
I, J, K, L, M, N...

83
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,791
Do you like O?

84
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:13,667
I like an O!

85
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,669
Now,

86
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:22,972
don't you ever say that
I have no sense of humour

87
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:37,991
Thank you Ma'am

88
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,263
I've told you never
talk to strangers

89
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:42,663
Come on

90
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:37,378
Be careful!

91
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:13,086
Daddy!

92
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:14,153
Go, let's go

93
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:28,704
No-shadow Kick!

94
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:36,913
Master, many barbarians here!

95
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:37,938
Protect Aunt Yee

96
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,150
Yes!

97
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:52,855
I can manage on my own

98
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:25,225
Move out

99
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:56,361
Fai-hong, Seven!

100
00:11:58,098 --> 00:11:59,497
The horses are beyond control

101
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:04,669
Give me a ride!

102
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,428
Yee, I'm here to save you!

103
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,295
Seven!

104
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,533
This is dangerous, go back in

105
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:34,667
Yes!

106
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,031
Hands off my carriage

107
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,567
Where is your Master?
Fai-hong, where are you?

108
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:45,143
What did you say? I can't hear you
Take care of your back

109
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:47,744
Watch my kick!

110
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,373
I don't need you

111
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,011
Out!

112
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:53,945
Sit properly

113
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:18,937
Be care

114
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:20,772
Hold it tight!

115
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:35,288
Fai-hong...

116
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,226
Fai-hong...

117
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,096
Yee...

118
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,170
Master

119
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,068
Seven...

120
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:45,398
Yee...

121
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:51,904
Fai...

122
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:01,619
Fai-hong...

123
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,639
Thank you Billy!

124
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,538
Ma'am!

125
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:24,046
That's all I have to show for
gratitude from me and my family

126
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,510
Go on take it

127
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:26,677
Thanks

128
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:28,908
It's quality!

129
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,421
Hi, boss, these are clean

130
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:44,061
Let's go!

131
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,797
Hi Lola!

132
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,770
Hi how are you? Lone

133
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:51,840
I'm fine, thank you

134
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,067
Beer

135
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,406
- Hello, Dr. So
- Hi Susan

136
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,171
You've got dark circles
under your eyes

137
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,084
Did you get not enough sleep
last night?

138
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,507
OK! I guess

139
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:05,377
Well! Why don't I come over
to your clinic later

140
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:06,682
So you can check me up

141
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:08,957
Sure, sure. Come by anytime!

142
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:13,062
Yes, yes. Why don't you come
along with Lola too?

143
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,664
I'll buy you a drink!

144
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:19,498
Are you sure?

145
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,434
It's alright

146
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:21,232
OK. Thank you

147
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,338
See you later

148
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,045
No beer for Chinamen

149
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,411
Hey! This one's on me

150
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:00,269
You just passing through?

151
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:01,707
No

152
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,413
Hello. Mr. Mayor

153
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:04,906
Out!

154
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,051
I just want to...

155
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,046
Take it easy son, he's the Mayor!

156
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,419
- Out...
- Why are you doing this for...

157
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,524
Out

158
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,718
Let's go

159
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:17,791
I am sorry

160
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,367
Problem?

161
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:30,041
Just a little one!

162
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,710
Remember, you ain't Abraham Lincoln

163
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,013
C'mon, let me buy you a drink

164
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:37,975
No, thanks Sheriff.
Abraham Lincoln doesn't drink

165
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,301
No big deal!

166
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,141
The beer in town isn't good enough!

167
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,782
Sit down...

168
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:12,715
Let me take a look!

169
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:14,617
- It hurts
- It's alright

170
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,709
Take a seat...

171
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,287
Wait

172
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,827
How's he doing?

173
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,577
Po Chi Lam? What's that mean?

174
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,880
Advertisement!

175
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,047
Dr. So, help!

176
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,088
Dr. So, where are you?

177
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:51,212
Bring them in...

178
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,551
What's happened?

179
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,757
We saved them...

180
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,422
...from the Gold Sand River

181
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:00,691
They've waken up for a short while,

182
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:01,766
then again lost consciousness

183
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:05,330
Seven!

184
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,102
Aunt Yee

185
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:11,970
Ying,

186
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,146
Yes, Master!

187
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,178
Go massage his chest

188
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,339
By using the technique which
you have just learnt

189
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,852
Doctor... may I massage
this lady for you?

190
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,921
No... I'll help her...

191
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,386
Stop!
What are you guys fighting for?

192
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:23,753
Let's take turn

193
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,289
I'll be the first. Yes...

194
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,449
Wait! She is...

195
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:30,724
She is my master's fiancée,

196
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,420
don't you dare trying a finger on her

197
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:36,028
Let me give you a hand!

198
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:39,640
If you want to kiss somebody,
kiss me!

199
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,404
I ain't trying to kiss her

200
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,411
This white bastard actually
wants more!

201
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:48,145
Shut up

202
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:48,805
She's awake now

203
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:49,574
Seven!

204
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:50,776
Aunt Yee

205
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,645
I am damn hungry

206
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:55,413
Seven!

207
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,857
Fai-hong!

208
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:18,474
I have a new son!

209
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:27,121
This weave is excellent,
we should learn how to do it

210
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,385
Father, the great spirit has
blessed me with another son

211
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,117
Where am I?

212
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,686
Stop!

213
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,734
Why do you treat him so badly?

214
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,162
His coat is different,

215
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,034
his skin color is different,

216
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,837
his speech is different

217
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,772
His blood is red. Like us

218
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:21,001
My God!

219
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:22,408
But, it will not flow for us

220
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:24,509
In the end I afraid
we will be bleeding for him

221
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:26,038
No!

222
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,411
Go away

223
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,682
How can you be so rude to a lady?

224
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:48,902
What is your name? What is your name?
What is your name?

225
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,164
What is your name?
What is your name?

226
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:56,310
"What is your name" means...

227
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,204
...what's your name in Chinese!

228
00:20:58,415 --> 00:20:59,473
What is your name?

229
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,744
Master,
I've been eating too many beans,

230
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,285
if I don't have rice soon,
I'll die too

231
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,428
Watch out! The Red Hair's coming

232
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,511
Sorry, Sorry

233
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:46,119
Wong Fai-hong... Master Wong...

234
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:50,331
Aunt Yee

235
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:54,335
Aunt Yee,
would you like a cup of tea?

236
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,605
Master Wong

237
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,277
Wong Fai-hong

238
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,079
This is Master's umbrella!

239
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:05,581
Aunt Yee...

240
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,078
Look, this is Master's umbrella

241
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,619
Aunt Yee,
shall we have lunch first?

242
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,224
I ain't hungry. You guys go ahead

243
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,598
What are you Chinese doing here?

244
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,692
We are looking for a friend

245
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,500
He had an accident up river

246
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:26,433
Now you know Mayor Barclay...

247
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,302
...doesn't wanna see you
Chinese outside your alley

248
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,402
Would you just pretend
you did not see us?

249
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,142
Sorry. No, I can't do

250
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,940
You bastard,
we are only searching for our friend

251
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,353
They treat us Chinese miners
like dogs,

252
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:44,047
having all kinds of
restrictions on us

253
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,885
Yeah!
We are always on the wrong side

254
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,322
Shall we stand together and
overcome him now?

255
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,225
No... The sergeant is nice to us
Chinese indeed!

256
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,701
Remember?

257
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:58,268
He had driven away some white
bastards for us several times

258
00:22:58,704 --> 00:22:59,898
Let's go!

259
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:02,431
Hey!

260
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:03,499
Yes?

261
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:04,902
Remember,

262
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,544
no Chinese women allowed here

263
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,775
That's the law

264
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:11,411
I will not forget

265
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:18,388
Goodbye, Mr Lincoln

266
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:28,530
Don't worry Ma'am.
Wong Fei-hong is gonna be just fine

267
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,434
Hey! What are you doing here?

268
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,672
Behave yourself or
I won't give you face

269
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:34,904
What?

270
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:36,033
"What"? The hell!

271
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,345
What the hell? I like that

272
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:24,248
It's raining dogs and cats,
please go back inside

273
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:29,194
No, Fai-hong won't find us
when he is back

274
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:34,924
Master would be upset
if you fell sick

275
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,466
Exactly, Aunt Yee please go back inside

276
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,632
Fai-hong...

277
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:10,098
Yee...

278
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:11,599
Master...

279
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,400
Seven...

280
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:15,610
Yee...

281
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:18,136
Water topples a boat and

282
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,838
so it floats one

283
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,880
Hardness and softness can grow
or temper with each other

284
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:23,110
This is the spirit of Tai Chi

285
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:24,411
Reckless movement repels,
stay clam and you stay as one piece

286
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:25,678
Understand?

287
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:26,948
OK, show me what you have learnt
from Tai Chi

288
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:27,647
Yes, Master

289
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,115
Give way...

290
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,780
What are you guys looking at?

291
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:02,755
It is a woman

292
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,816
What's so excited about a woman?

293
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,520
Uncle Han, don't you think
you're too old for that?

294
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,254
But I can still see well...

295
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,396
...with my eyes

296
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:11,857
Shoot!
We are closed for business today

297
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:13,294
Aunt Yee!

298
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:15,337
Seven, help me to check its texture

299
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,302
Yes!

300
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:18,135
Should I add more water?

301
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,242
- Good?
- Good!

302
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,154
Sol, what are you eating?

303
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:41,393
This is glue

304
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,230
Is it sticky enough?

305
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,492
Very!

306
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:49,806
And you!
Why did you say it tastes good?

307
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,066
I did not! I was only nodding

308
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,074
Go post these Lost and

309
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:54,973
Found bills on the street

310
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,207
Yes Ma'am

311
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:58,943
Let's go, gluey-mouth

312
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:14,694
Post one here

313
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:25,308
Post one here!

314
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:39,214
Hey! What the hell you boys think
you're doing here?

315
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,882
Why did you tear...

316
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,856
...our poster away?

317
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,120
We're looking for our master!

318
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,385
You can't hang those posters here!

319
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,964
What did he say?

320
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,462
Nothing... Let's go

321
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,696
You hang one more poster,
you're going to jail

322
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,313
Forget about them! Let's go

323
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:06,776
Deputy!

324
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,062
Damn!

325
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,032
The money

326
00:28:58,372 --> 00:28:59,201
Hey, you are good

327
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,499
Thanks partner,

328
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,541
when are you going to teach me

329
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:03,634
What?

330
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:04,839
This!

331
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:08,812
Can you show me?

332
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,410
You want to learn leg stance?

333
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,415
If not you can put up
with the hardship

334
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:15,922
Like this!

335
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,354
Press each of your legs like this
for 4 hours

336
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,626
That's all it takes

337
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:22,626
Alright

338
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,419
OK boys, you're under arrest,

339
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:25,999
the jail's that way

340
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,061
Take it easy partner.
I've got everything under control

341
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,762
Yeah, move it

342
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,572
Alright come on

343
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:35,335
What do they call you son?

344
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,137
My name is Billy!

345
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,838
Billy,
interested in being my deputy?

346
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,312
We'll talk after I get my reward

347
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:44,979
Nick

348
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:46,712
You done yet?

349
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,080
God damn Sheriff

350
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:52,625
you made me lose my count.
Now I have to start all over again

351
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,456
Sheriff, the pay is bad

352
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:56,926
I've to cut partial of my freedom

353
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,395
I understand!

354
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,524
You can come to work for me
only when there is trouble

355
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:05,471
Sheriff, you got yourself a deputy

356
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:09,071
Good, try this on for size

357
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,722
Hi, if you see this man,

358
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:30,853
we're at the clinic

359
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:34,735
If you see this man,

360
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:35,666
we're at the clinic

361
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,438
How about a drink?

362
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:40,769
No, thank you

363
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,435
When I say drink,

364
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:46,475
you drink

365
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:48,973
Hey! Leave him alone

366
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:49,743
You shut up

367
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,621
Have another

368
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,006
You are a pretty China doll

369
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,137
Hey lady where are you going?

370
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:19,378
If you don't want to drink

371
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,015
Then wear it!

372
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,456
Stop it stop it stop it...

373
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,191
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee

374
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:46,609
Now all the boys,
I wouldn't do that if I were you,

375
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:55,245
you wanna fight,
well, you've got one

376
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:07,163
I ain't looking for no fight

377
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,791
That's good

378
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,097
Now I want a fight!
Seven, teach them a lesson

379
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,402
Sure!

380
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,701
Why don't we try something different, pal?

381
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:19,973
Care for a friendly wager?

382
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:24,044
Now I bet this Chinamen can
wipe you out...

383
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,169
...without your guns

384
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,816
And my money is on the Chinamen, pal

385
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,917
which one is man enough
to fight him?

386
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:56,738
I win!

387
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,040
No, this is only good for a warm up
since master isn't around

388
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:00,211
Sol, translate for me

389
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:01,348
What?

390
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:02,851
Tell them to fight me all at once

391
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,855
They are the winner
if anyone of them beat me

392
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:05,918
What did he say?

393
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:08,988
He said he wants to fight you all

394
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:10,793
If you win, you can take the money

395
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:13,055
AII? Wait a minute,

396
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:14,662
we might lose!

397
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,593
Seven, he said if...

398
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:18,497
Trust me

399
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:19,634
Trust me

400
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,772
Sorry! Trust him!

401
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:04,447
I am a happy man

402
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,612
Me too

403
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:08,184
Aunt Yee, what about you?

404
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,145
Me too

405
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,482
Susan, Thank you!

406
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,696
How can I enjoy
this beautiful landscape now?

407
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:26,863
Why don't you take me back to...

408
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:28,270
...where you found me?

409
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:30,400
Maybe I can remember
where I come from

410
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,275
Only you have no idea
on what I am saying

411
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:43,820
Clothes, how I wish you could talk

412
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:46,488
Then you would be able to
explain everything

413
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:05,171
Master... America... Setting up
Po Chi Lam... One year anniversary,

414
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:08,436
Sol...

415
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:11,672
What's this letter about?

416
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:14,244
Is it by me or for me?

417
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,082
My name is Sol?

418
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:23,660
...and I have a master?

419
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:27,426
I must find him,
he will have the answer

420
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:31,693
Wong Fai!

421
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,940
This name sounds familiar,

422
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,642
I must have known him

423
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,507
If I found him,
everything would be explained

424
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:06,737
What can I do for you?

425
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,905
I want to marry your daughter!

426
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,147
How dare you insult my sister?

427
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,645
You are the weakest among
all the tribes,

428
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,521
if you don't give me your daughter,

429
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:22,554
I will destroy you all

430
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:27,488
Fierce Eagle!

431
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,923
We are not afraid of you,
we will fight you to death!

432
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:43,942
Fierce Eagle!

433
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,358
Please, do not fight!

434
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:02,822
Hey, don't...

435
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,097
Yellow, please do not fight him

436
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:23,775
Hey...

437
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:38,900
Come on!

438
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:30,815
Let me try

439
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:34,987
What are you doing?

440
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:45,628
Stop it. Don't!

441
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:54,804
I'm good, I'm good...

442
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,541
I really envy you guys

443
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,413
At least you know where is your root

444
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:33,042
I don't even know where I come from

445
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:35,511
The sunshine's beautiful
on this land

446
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:39,454
but the sunshine is
more beautiful on our land

447
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:42,553
But, we were forced to leave our home

448
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:47,090
You don't understand a bit of
what I'm saying

449
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,265
That's fine, at least you are lucky

450
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,437
Unlike me, I keep thinking...

451
00:39:54,506 --> 00:39:55,996
...where I should be heading

452
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:58,834
I know,

453
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,607
someday I shall return to my land,

454
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,474
to my home

455
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:21,025
For bleeding for our tribe

456
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:22,459
Thank you

457
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,202
From now on,
verbal communication is not necessary

458
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:32,342
Body language is much better, right?

459
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,841
I tried to forget,
but the vision keeps coming back

460
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:10,778
Damn it!

461
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,451
I must learn to let go

462
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:16,451
Yellow!

463
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:24,491
You like it?

464
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,265
Take it!

465
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,376
Fai-hong, have a smoke!

466
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:43,878
Oh shit!
Aunt Yee is being possessed

467
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:47,151
Nah, it is not that

468
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:48,251
What's it then?

469
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:52,189
Master's stuff reminds her of him

470
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:54,361
Master?

471
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,726
Though I did not like you to smoke,

472
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,898
it isn't my main concern now

473
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,983
What is taking him so long
to take a shit?

474
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,149
What, are you hungry?

475
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:52,242
That's really funny

476
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:02,618
Come on...

477
00:44:06,462 --> 00:44:07,759
Come on...

478
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,034
Come on...

479
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:17,472
Come on...

480
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:02,546
I think I've seen him before

481
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,318
Let's go

482
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:12,421
Hey! Look what we got here.
We got some rich Indians

483
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:16,263
Hey, I'm talking to you,
stinking red skin

484
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:20,972
Why don't you show me and
my boys one of your war dances?

485
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,301
I do not dance for the white man

486
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:40,023
You're dancing now, ain't you?

487
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,359
Isn't he Fai-hong?

488
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:47,317
You're a woman?

489
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:53,997
Why are you following us?

490
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,100
I'm looking for him

491
00:46:58,638 --> 00:46:59,627
Fai-hong!

492
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,604
Fai-hong? Who is Fai-hong?

493
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:03,630
You are Fai-hong!

494
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:05,837
Am I? Then who are you?

495
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:10,342
I am Yee, Aunt Yee, your fiancée!

496
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:11,750
Since you are my aunt,

497
00:47:12,452 --> 00:47:13,510
how can you be my fiancée as well?

498
00:47:14,988 --> 00:47:15,784
Yellow?

499
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,253
Your name is Yellow?

500
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:21,087
All the people here call me Yellow

501
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:35,901
You cannot just grab that!

502
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:53,193
A, B, C, D, E...

503
00:47:56,964 --> 00:47:57,988
Take it back!

504
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:03,201
She can't do without the ring,

505
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,531
why wouldn't she want it?

506
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:16,049
Yellow, that girl knows you,

507
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:17,911
you must follow her

508
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,916
The darker of your inside is
taking over

509
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,118
That's why I feel sick?

510
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:27,621
Absolutely

511
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:29,663
So I must sit under the sun more?

512
00:48:29,964 --> 00:48:35,494
Aunt Yee is making a mess
in Po Chi Lam

513
00:48:35,804 --> 00:48:38,271
Everyone in Po Chi Lam tries to
stay away from her

514
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,633
And you thought
Master had bad temper?

515
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:43,978
You should check her out now

516
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,174
We haven't seen Chinese women
for ages

517
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:47,314
How is it when Aunt Yee gets mad?

518
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:49,081
Sol...

519
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:51,351
Aunt Yee is making a fuss again

520
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:52,821
What's the fuss this time?

521
00:48:53,922 --> 00:48:54,820
She is packing up

522
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:57,291
Aunt Yee, where do you want to go?

523
00:48:57,759 --> 00:48:58,316
Back to China

524
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:00,462
China? What?

525
00:49:01,597 --> 00:49:03,622
Prepare a carriage for me,
I am going home

526
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:04,729
Am I clear?

527
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,393
Yes, of course

528
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:08,629
Seven, prepare the carriage

529
00:49:09,104 --> 00:49:10,435
Why so?

530
00:49:11,673 --> 00:49:15,234
Aunt Yee is having
odd thinking again

531
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:18,878
Take her for a walk
around the block,

532
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:21,744
then tell her she's already home

533
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,677
OK, I get it!

534
00:49:25,454 --> 00:49:26,512
Aunt Yee, shall we?

535
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:28,817
What are you doing?

536
00:49:30,827 --> 00:49:32,158
You really think I am insane?

537
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,762
I know how to get back to China

538
00:49:35,297 --> 00:49:37,289
It takes 10 days to reach
San Francisco by carriage,

539
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,092
Another six months...

540
00:49:39,235 --> 00:49:40,463
...to Hong Kong by ship

541
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:42,798
From there it takes 3 days'
on train to Canton,

542
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,200
then again by carriage to Fu Shan

543
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:46,840
Whatever you say will not change
my decision

544
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:52,411
Now will you go prepare
the carriage?

545
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,485
Fine

546
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:01,790
Aunt Yee, we are ready now

547
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:14,167
Seven

548
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:16,331
Aunt Yee, this way please...

549
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:30,915
Aunt Yee,
I have forgotten my luggage,

550
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:31,951
I must go back

551
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:33,614
Carry it Sol

552
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:41,992
Aunt Yee...

553
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:43,727
Aunt Yee...

554
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:47,359
Aunt Yee...

555
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:49,595
Aunt Yee, it's master!

556
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,033
Master...

557
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:54,000
Aunt Yee, Master...

558
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:01,440
May I ask...

559
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:02,247
I accept no explanation from you

560
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,678
Aunt Yee...

561
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,653
I ain't here to explain, I just...

562
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:07,585
I don't want to hear anything

563
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,725
You happen to know someone
called Sol?

564
00:51:12,464 --> 00:51:13,590
Sol?

565
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,432
What about Wong Fai?
Does it ring the bell?

566
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:22,904
I go ask her then

567
00:51:25,076 --> 00:51:26,407
Master is teasing us, isn't he?

568
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:30,308
No... Master seems to have lost
his memory

569
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:36,246
Piss off! Leave me alone, would you?

570
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:38,085
You are Aunt Yee right?

571
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:39,178
I am not!

572
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:40,155
Do you know Wong Fai then?

573
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:41,456
Wong... what?

574
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:52,061
Please stop!

575
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:54,165
Aunt Yee

576
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,035
I don't give allowance just
because you're a woman

577
00:51:59,444 --> 00:52:00,343
What are you doing?

578
00:52:00,479 --> 00:52:02,470
Checking your pulse

579
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:06,873
Aunt Yee, Master suffers...

580
00:52:07,218 --> 00:52:07,946
...from loss of memory

581
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:09,021
So...

582
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:11,851
He has lost his memory?
What should we do?

583
00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:13,692
Let me try

584
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:22,929
What are you doing?

585
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:24,196
I want to show you
Wong's super stance,

586
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,300
No Shadow Kick

587
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:26,499
Who is Wong Fai-hong?

588
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:28,134
Sure that was you!

589
00:52:28,507 --> 00:52:30,634
You are one of the 10 Canton Tigers,
coach of the local militia

590
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,277
You live in no. 8,
Sing Nam Street, Fu Shan,

591
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:33,910
you're a doctor

592
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,914
You give free treatment to the poor,
and teach Chinese Kung-fu

593
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:37,014
You are the Master of Po Chi Lam,

594
00:52:37,116 --> 00:52:38,208
people's hero,

595
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:40,013
Wong Fai-hong

596
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,283
What is 10 Canton Tigers?
And coaching for what?

597
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:43,921
Po Chi Lam?

598
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:45,751
Free treatment to people?

599
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:46,949
Kung-fu master?

600
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:47,990
Master of Po Chi Lam,

601
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:49,220
people's hero

602
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:50,820
Wong Fai-hong?

603
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:53,596
He is Wong Fai-hong?

604
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,028
Notice that...

605
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,397
...we both know this post?

606
00:52:58,872 --> 00:53:00,840
Seven, he forgot who he is

607
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,031
Showing him the post has got no use

608
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:11,581
Are you alright?

609
00:53:11,685 --> 00:53:13,000
- Are you alright, Sol?
- Yeah, I'm alright

610
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,921
You must help him regain his memory

611
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:22,487
You!

612
00:53:22,562 --> 00:53:23,893
Wong Fai-hong,

613
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,397
I, Yim Chun-tung,
will see how good you really are

614
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,016
Ha! With my iron cloth martial arts,

615
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,053
you can't beat me!

616
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,571
Come on!

617
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:15,038
Thicker! Thicker!

618
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:28,587
Wong Fai-hong,

619
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,221
You should go for my stomach
not my face!

620
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:40,433
Wong Fai-hong,
do you remember Na Lan Yuan Shu?

621
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:44,477
Na Lan Yuan Shu

622
00:54:53,388 --> 00:54:54,286
Na Lan Yuan Shu!

623
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:04,791
Quit fooling around

624
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,133
Seven!

625
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:40,866
Follow me!

626
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,732
Master,
why are you getting fired up?

627
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,183
Seven, stop fighting with him!

628
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:17,259
Seven!

629
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:19,300
Stop fighting!

630
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:39,547
Fai-hong!

631
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:40,554
Yee!

632
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:42,590
Yee, are you alright?

633
00:57:43,028 --> 00:57:43,551
I am fine

634
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:46,156
Seven...

635
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:49,526
I am fine!

636
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,492
Seven

637
00:57:51,771 --> 00:57:52,669
How did you fall so badly?

638
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:54,169
It wasn't from falling

639
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,904
Master, you hit me!

640
00:57:57,776 --> 00:57:59,641
It's okay now, Seven

641
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:01,937
The Master is back!

642
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:13,191
This trip to America...

643
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:14,652
...is just like a dream

644
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:17,786
I can do with a dream...

645
00:58:18,664 --> 00:58:20,359
...with an Indian beauty

646
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,798
What?

647
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:23,402
Only you know the story!

648
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:27,664
I've just cleaned my face

649
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:30,868
You can give the ring twice,

650
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:31,568
but you can't wash your face twice?

651
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:33,212
Sure, sure

652
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:35,679
I can't remember anything

653
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:37,182
I don't understand
what you're talking about

654
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:39,082
Have you thought of that woman?

655
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:40,546
I don't have time
to think about woman

656
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,187
Do you miss her?

657
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:45,449
Well, a little bit

658
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,455
You just said
you haven't thought of woman

659
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:50,727
Thinking and missing are
two different things

660
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:52,732
If you don't think of her,
how can you miss her?

661
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,100
But it's the truth

662
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:58,596
The truth is I don't want to
talk to you anymore

663
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:03,632
But the one I miss is you

664
00:59:04,778 --> 00:59:05,870
You know...

665
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:07,413
I can never say
these things out loud

666
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:14,520
The games are about to start. Hurry!

667
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:15,550
Master Wong

668
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:16,883
How's everyone?

669
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:46,782
Master Wong is here, Uncle Lone,
Master Wong is here

670
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,581
So?

671
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:50,514
Master Wong doesn't like
people gambling

672
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:52,382
Let's pack it up and gamble later

673
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,452
No way,

674
00:59:54,629 --> 00:59:56,324
I've just won this game

675
00:59:56,497 --> 00:59:57,623
Hurry up

676
00:59:57,798 --> 00:59:59,664
Master is coming!

677
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:03,393
Have you won?
How much did you bet?

678
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:04,866
I want in

679
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:07,338
Let's gamble together

680
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:08,340
Come on!

681
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,172
Master Wong, you too?

682
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:12,811
Come, let me be the House

683
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:14,479
Come on, come on!

684
01:00:14,582 --> 01:00:15,276
Let's have some larger bets

685
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:16,883
Really?

686
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:19,813
Sure! Bet more!

687
01:00:20,588 --> 01:00:23,113
Okay, if Master Wong wants us to,
we'll bet a little

688
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:24,526
Master...

689
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:26,628
Bets down and hands off

690
01:00:26,728 --> 01:00:27,592
You've got nowhere...

691
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:28,459
...to spend your money anyway

692
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:29,689
Why don't you bet it all?

693
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:36,066
Master Wong, you are our hope,

694
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:38,468
you gamble like us,
how can we find a role model?

695
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,302
We are not used to seeing
you gambling

696
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:42,136
Master Wong,
why don't you be your normal self?

697
01:00:42,277 --> 01:00:43,005
We won't gamble anymore...

698
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:44,438
Today

699
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,846
Get out of here!

700
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:49,678
We understand now

701
01:00:51,486 --> 01:00:52,248
People,

702
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:54,989
I thank you all...

703
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,259
...for your concern

704
01:00:59,228 --> 01:01:01,662
I have something to say

705
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:05,432
You came a long way...

706
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:08,264
to a foreign place,

707
01:01:08,971 --> 01:01:11,030
Po Chi Lam was opened
for this reason

708
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,937
"When they leave home, goods are
worth more and people are worth less"

709
01:01:14,077 --> 01:01:17,045
And you should know who you are

710
01:01:17,246 --> 01:01:18,645
I don't hope for good business,
that'll require you being ill

711
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:19,772
Rather I hope Po Chi Lam...

712
01:01:19,882 --> 01:01:22,578
...help you achieve good health,

713
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:24,448
build up a strong body

714
01:01:24,554 --> 01:01:27,546
Copy the merits of foreigners and
compensate our short-comings

715
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:29,782
And shine...

716
01:01:29,926 --> 01:01:30,790
...for the Chinese people

717
01:01:35,397 --> 01:01:36,660
Simply put,

718
01:01:37,267 --> 01:01:38,598
you must remember who you are

719
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:42,868
Today, I would like to stop here,

720
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:44,838
thank you for listening

721
01:01:49,612 --> 01:01:52,377
Master Wong, that was a great speech

722
01:01:52,616 --> 01:01:53,514
You're too kind...

723
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:56,009
Let's go...

724
01:01:57,253 --> 01:01:58,777
Sir, take the money,

725
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:00,090
it was hard-earned

726
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:02,353
Master Wong, no more speech please

727
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:03,420
Bye! Bye!

728
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:04,615
Please excuse me...

729
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:09,798
Your gold mine dried up

730
01:02:10,634 --> 01:02:11,601
Yeah

731
01:02:14,003 --> 01:02:17,462
And there's still a little matter of
the $150,000 loan,

732
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:18,600
I've discreetly left off the books

733
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,306
Your can't even pay the coolies

734
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:26,549
Damn your smell like a pail of buffalo dung

735
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:30,080
Here, try some of these

736
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,354
Maybe it'll help your breath

737
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:38,956
Put a $100,000 is in the safe

738
01:02:39,397 --> 01:02:40,591
I'll take care of everything else

739
01:02:41,533 --> 01:02:43,466
What? Another $100,000?

740
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,298
Do as I say

741
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:48,832
Keep your faces covered,

742
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:51,304
I want your identities kept secret

743
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:53,507
I'd mark pretty face

744
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,000
on every post office and board...

745
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,005
beside... the Mississippi Hell

746
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,906
I want to be famous

747
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:02,649
Shut up!

748
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,322
I don't give a damn,
let's just do it

749
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:26,577
Let's do it,
Master Wong won't come this time

750
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,043
Why?

751
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:33,311
He is real busy. Come on!

752
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:34,844
I'll be the House
Bet. Bet. Bet

753
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:39,423
It's pay day!

754
01:03:39,991 --> 01:03:42,425
Seven,
I'm the 11th child of my family

755
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:46,124
And I was thinking, if you and
I should open a store together,

756
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:48,590
we'll call it 7-11

757
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:54,730
Uncle Han, who is that guy?

758
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,399
He is our foreman,

759
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:57,642
and always cheat us

760
01:03:59,077 --> 01:04:00,136
So what if you can kick real fast?

761
01:04:00,746 --> 01:04:02,714
Don't forget,
this is a world of guns

762
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:05,340
You can't be as fast as a bullet

763
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:25,001
You got the money?

764
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:26,263
Now go on and get out of here

765
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:32,944
I thought we had a...

766
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,408
Adios

767
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,207
Hell, that's too easy,

768
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,440
let's find some real excitement

769
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:40,184
When they start to shoot,
that would be exciting

770
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:36,276
Get back, get out

771
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:48,617
Billy

772
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:50,321
What are you doing?

773
01:05:50,758 --> 01:05:51,783
What do you mean?

774
01:05:52,093 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah, you're alright

775
01:05:53,728 --> 01:05:54,490
You alright, Billy?

776
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:12,140
Half a million dollars?

777
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,000
What? We only got $100,000!

778
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,500
What happened to the rest of it?

779
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:20,187
Let's go back and pay the Mayor and
his little town a visit

780
01:06:21,522 --> 01:06:23,514
What about Pete?
He isn't gonna to make it

781
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:30,755
Adios, Pete!

782
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:53,078
Watch out!

783
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:53,913
Master

784
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:57,021
Master Wong

785
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:58,315
How's everyone?
How are you?

786
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:00,352
Master Wong, is that a new sign?

787
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:01,386
Yes

788
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:02,655
People,

789
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,529
I have something to say today

790
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:08,034
Master, you have something
to say again?

791
01:07:08,637 --> 01:07:09,626
Why don't you show us...

792
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:10,670
...some fist dance
instead of a speech?

793
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:11,435
Yeah, come on! Show us

794
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:12,768
Show us some fist dance! Come on

795
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:15,110
You'll get the chance!

796
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,178
Today is the first anniversary of...

797
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,972
the American Po Chi Lam

798
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,175
First of all,

799
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:24,946
I would like to thank you all
for taking care of my student Sol

800
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:27,252
Don't mention it,
we are all Chinese!

801
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,015
We should help each other,

802
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:31,453
right?

803
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:34,463
People, you've come a long way...

804
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:36,324
to a foreign place

805
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:39,566
You should co-operate and
take care of each other

806
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:42,304
Po Chi Lam was opened...

807
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:44,135
...for this reason

808
01:07:45,342 --> 01:07:47,309
I don't hope...

809
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:49,468
...for good business,

810
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,450
that'll require you being ill

811
01:07:53,684 --> 01:07:55,742
This is not what I hope for
Instead, I hope that...

812
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:57,114
The American Po Chi Lam...

813
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:58,948
...would become your club house

814
01:07:59,723 --> 01:08:01,782
when you have time,
you can have tea,

815
01:08:02,359 --> 01:08:03,986
chat, and practice Kung-fu here

816
01:08:04,728 --> 01:08:06,786
Build up a strong body

817
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:09,025
And come in line...

818
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,360
...with Po Chi Lam's spirit

819
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:13,762
Hand in hand
we copy foreigners' merits and

820
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:15,227
compensate our short-comings

821
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:17,296
And shine...

822
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,974
...for the Chinese people

823
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:21,668
That's all

824
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,720
Come in! Refreshment time!

825
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,930
Let's go and have some snacks...

826
01:08:47,105 --> 01:08:48,367
Master,

827
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,197
I think your speech deserved
some applause

828
01:08:51,176 --> 01:08:53,735
Aunt Yee may come...

829
01:08:53,977 --> 01:08:56,139
the timing of Aunt Yee's presence
wasn't right

830
01:08:57,282 --> 01:08:57,941
Timing

831
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:59,678
Timing!

832
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:02,485
Right!

833
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,122
Make yourself at home,
there's still more...

834
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:19,699
Welcome... Mr. Mayor,

835
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:21,602
gentlemen, we're pretty surprised

836
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,901
Looks like
you're having a celebration

837
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:25,706
Get in there men!

838
01:09:43,896 --> 01:09:45,989
I reckon you boys have something
to do with the robbery

839
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,194
Search the damn place

840
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:50,327
No! It's ridiculous!

841
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:51,868
Quiet!

842
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:54,367
They said we were involved
in the robbery,

843
01:09:54,507 --> 01:09:55,474
they want to search this place

844
01:09:57,476 --> 01:09:59,444
No problem, we are innocent!

845
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,246
Give way,

846
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,604
let the police do their job

847
01:10:03,816 --> 01:10:04,783
search this place

848
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:22,393
We've found the money!

849
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:26,998
What? How can it be?

850
01:10:31,745 --> 01:10:33,144
Look what we have got here

851
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:37,142
Arrest every last one
of these Chinese, sons of bitches!

852
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:48,954
Be careful, Master,
they will shoot!

853
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,394
Move!

854
01:10:55,136 --> 01:10:56,500
We're innocent,

855
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:57,729
let us out!

856
01:10:57,904 --> 01:11:00,372
You can't put these people in jail

857
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:02,464
They had nothing to do
with the robbery

858
01:11:02,576 --> 01:11:04,135
You don't tell me what I can and
can't do, Billy!

859
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:06,945
Now settle down son

860
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:10,274
Look, I was with Doc Sol and
Seven right before the hold-up

861
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,576
They've been framed

862
01:11:12,086 --> 01:11:14,054
I don't give a damn if you come up
with a hundred reasons

863
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,800
Fact is we found some of the money...

864
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
...in Po Chi Lam

865
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
If the Chinamen didn't take
the money, who did? Me?

866
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:25,492
Maybe it was you Billy!

867
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,430
No! That's crazy! I shot one of 'em

868
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:30,370
Maybe you were trying to
throw us off

869
01:11:30,638 --> 01:11:32,299
Maybe you're working with the gang

870
01:11:34,842 --> 01:11:36,241
Easy there, Billy

871
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:39,571
I wont let you do it

872
01:11:40,314 --> 01:11:41,474
How are you going to stop me?

873
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:42,678
I'll kill you

874
01:11:56,831 --> 01:11:57,855
Are you alright?

875
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:00,292
I guess someone was quicker
at that time

876
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:02,268
You're a real friend to the Chinese

877
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:05,404
Billy! I appreciate you too!

878
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:17,109
Settle down. I said settle down

879
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:28,458
He said he would get
the best deal for us,

880
01:12:31,366 --> 01:12:33,027
provided that 7 of us would confess
to the crime,

881
01:12:34,336 --> 01:12:36,133
If we confess do we go jail?

882
01:12:36,505 --> 01:12:37,563
You can forget jail,

883
01:12:38,006 --> 01:12:39,235
they are going to hang you

884
01:12:40,342 --> 01:12:42,902
If you don't confess to the crime,
they're going to hang you all

885
01:12:43,078 --> 01:12:44,340
Remember,

886
01:12:44,413 --> 01:12:46,347
they found the money
with you Chinese

887
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:49,382
No, not all the Chinese,

888
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:51,178
only the Po Chi Lam people

889
01:12:57,327 --> 01:12:58,453
Uncle Lone is right

890
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:01,024
This is Po Chi Lam's problem,

891
01:13:01,196 --> 01:13:02,185
nothing to do with you all

892
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:04,529
Sol, tell the sergeant,

893
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:06,261
can I take all the responsibility?

894
01:13:08,738 --> 01:13:09,897
No!

895
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:12,942
You can't confess to the crime alone

896
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:15,110
If you are going to be
the first to confess,

897
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:16,370
I'll be the second

898
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:17,442
Sol!

899
01:13:17,513 --> 01:13:18,741
Master my nick name is Seven,

900
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,813
if I am not the 3rd one,
I will be the 7th one

901
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:23,746
Fai-hong

902
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:25,884
You all stay here, I'll go alone

903
01:13:26,122 --> 01:13:27,283
This is a set up!

904
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:30,554
Master Wong, you are young
and capable

905
01:13:30,927 --> 01:13:32,861
Your life should be spared for...

906
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:34,553
...the good of we Chinese workers

907
01:13:35,132 --> 01:13:37,292
You've nothing to do
with Po Chi Lam,

908
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,990
don't get yourself into trouble!

909
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,795
Uncle, we are not telling others the
pathetic tales of the Chinese workers

910
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:45,942
We want to tell the glorious
history of the Chinese workers

911
01:13:48,244 --> 01:13:50,007
I, Wong Fai-hong,
should stand for all of you

912
01:13:50,748 --> 01:13:51,646
Who disagrees?

913
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:53,345
Come with me

914
01:14:03,794 --> 01:14:08,060
Ma'am!

915
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:12,702
Fai-hong

916
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:30,847
It's my fault!

917
01:15:32,283 --> 01:15:34,514
I couldn't imagine that,

918
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,445
the establishment of Po Chi Lam
in the America a year ago,

919
01:15:39,058 --> 01:15:41,491
would pave the way for tragedy

920
01:15:42,695 --> 01:15:44,663
And I dragged Master down too...

921
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:47,458
Uncle Han, are you afraid?

922
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:54,739
Getting married and working hard,

923
01:15:55,975 --> 01:15:59,468
pretending as emperor at home
but working as slave outside...

924
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:02,938
That is my life!

925
01:16:06,453 --> 01:16:10,445
Sir, it is our custom,

926
01:16:10,589 --> 01:16:12,853
man would die with a full stomach

927
01:16:12,992 --> 01:16:14,323
May I feed them?

928
01:16:22,702 --> 01:16:25,637
All the prisoners get their
final meal before they're executed

929
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:26,897
What can it hurt?

930
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,713
Master Wong

931
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,492
This is all I can do

932
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:57,995
Master Wong,
stuffed dumplings for you

933
01:17:00,173 --> 01:17:00,935
Eat!

934
01:17:17,524 --> 01:17:20,119
Master, we all depend on you

935
01:17:20,695 --> 01:17:22,162
Master,
I have full confidence in you

936
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:29,860
I want more!

937
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:38,670
They're waiting!

938
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:51,687
Go

939
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,485
Go away!

940
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:11,371
Why were you not in jail...

941
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:12,813
...with us?

942
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:15,441
I didn't do anything

943
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:19,209
I didn't do anything wrong

944
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:24,724
Citizens,

945
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:28,724
as Mayor of this town and
in the name of God

946
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:33,434
I'm here to witness this fair and
just execution of these men

947
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:36,630
God has decided the day
they are to die

948
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:40,271
Now I shall decide their hour

949
01:19:07,937 --> 01:19:08,699
Escape!

950
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:09,635
Move everyone

951
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:01,719
Up the way

952
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:26,582
We have to stop him, boys!

953
01:20:31,089 --> 01:20:32,317
No! No!

954
01:20:46,404 --> 01:20:49,032
Master Wong,
that are the ones who robbed the bank

955
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:52,868
Master, he was the bank robber

956
01:20:54,512 --> 01:20:56,275
I have to get him to clear my name

957
01:20:57,382 --> 01:20:58,747
Sol, save the others first

958
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:06,452
Master, leave these two to me

959
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:13,320
Mayor Barclay

960
01:22:17,297 --> 01:22:18,457
What're the hell you're doing here?

961
01:22:18,832 --> 01:22:19,889
I need the rest of my money

962
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:23,698
The other Chinese is suspicious of me

963
01:22:24,337 --> 01:22:25,463
I think I should leave town

964
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:28,405
I agree with you, you'd leave town

965
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:45,818
What do you want?

966
01:22:45,926 --> 01:22:47,155
I'm just doing business with you

967
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,387
I want my four hundred thousand

968
01:22:49,896 --> 01:22:51,523
That's the bank's money

969
01:22:52,098 --> 01:22:54,294
You told me the job was gonna
a cake walk,

970
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,301
but one of my man's been killed

971
01:22:57,738 --> 01:22:59,967
Sorry,
I've nothing to do with that

972
01:23:00,574 --> 01:23:01,563
It was an accident

973
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:03,901
I'm sorry too

974
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,131
Piece of shit!

975
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:36,369
Go to hell

976
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:45,609
What the hell!

977
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,200
You little bastard,
how did you get there?

978
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,155
Shit!

979
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,424
What kind of a man is he?!

980
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:37,690
This is for you!

981
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:51,639
Go in

982
01:26:05,496 --> 01:26:06,327
Plays rough!

983
01:26:07,499 --> 01:26:08,226
I like that

984
01:26:47,205 --> 01:26:48,069
You like that

985
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,064
I don't think so

986
01:27:54,506 --> 01:27:55,234
Come on!

987
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:00,096
Go, get out...

988
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:15,000
get out...

989
01:29:39,613 --> 01:29:40,409
God damn it!

990
01:29:43,218 --> 01:29:44,480
Where are you?

991
01:29:47,989 --> 01:29:49,251
Where are you?

992
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:02,336
Come on out now,

993
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:05,206
let's talk about it!

994
01:30:11,179 --> 01:30:12,009
Let'S...

995
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:30,818
Surrender now!

996
01:31:35,599 --> 01:31:36,395
You still fight?

997
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:15,462
What the hell are you?

998
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:35,589
Hold it tight!

999
01:32:37,629 --> 01:32:39,722
Get off me, I don't need your help!

1000
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:41,292
Come on up!

1001
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:42,490
Come on up. Look out!

1002
01:33:04,323 --> 01:33:05,449
I need you to prove my innocence

1003
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:09,761
You're no human

1004
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:11,855
Get up!

1005
01:33:26,312 --> 01:33:27,279
Are you alright?

1006
01:33:27,546 --> 01:33:28,570
Who, what, where, when?

1007
01:33:29,315 --> 01:33:30,282
Oh, Diana!

1008
01:33:43,929 --> 01:33:45,055
Fai-hong, are you alright?

1009
01:33:45,264 --> 01:33:46,288
Where do you go?

1010
01:33:46,599 --> 01:33:47,861
I get them here to help you!

1011
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,164
Who are they?

1012
01:33:49,469 --> 01:33:50,060
They are...

1013
01:33:50,337 --> 01:33:51,497
Forget it

1014
01:33:51,571 --> 01:33:52,538
People are hurt.
Let's go help them

1015
01:34:23,236 --> 01:34:23,895
Seven, get ready for lion dance

1016
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:53,661
Come here!

1017
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,271
Congratulations, Billy

1018
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:10,574
I trust you will be a good Mayor

1019
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:12,816
As a new Mayor,

1020
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:16,500
I proclaim in name of friendship and
understanding that from this day on,

1021
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,260
this area of Fort Stockton will be
known as China Town

1022
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:27,200
I think, you will be as good as Lincoln

1023
01:35:32,073 --> 01:35:32,835
Farewell, Yellow

1024
01:35:33,342 --> 01:35:34,274
I'm not Yellow

1025
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:36,634
My name is Wong Fai-hong

1026
01:35:36,978 --> 01:35:38,103
A name is just a name

1027
01:35:39,046 --> 01:35:40,638
You'll always be our brother

1028
01:35:52,494 --> 01:35:53,324
Who are they?

1029
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,300
Don't you remember them?

1030
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,500
Come on!

1031
01:36:08,243 --> 01:36:09,267
Everyone...

1032
01:36:09,344 --> 01:36:10,777
Master Wong, no more speeches!

1033
01:36:10,912 --> 01:36:12,209
It's time to get going

1034
01:36:12,514 --> 01:36:13,709
That's right,
if you miss this train,

1035
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:14,974
you'll miss the boat as well

1036
01:36:15,184 --> 01:36:16,115
Now go

1037
01:36:16,685 --> 01:36:17,344
Yeah...

1038
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,582
Seven!

1039
01:36:20,722 --> 01:36:21,951
Master,

1040
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:23,582
didn't you have
a long speech readied?

1041
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,727
How come you finish your speech
so soon?

1042
01:36:29,432 --> 01:36:30,490
Everyone...

1043
01:36:30,533 --> 01:36:31,761
Master Wong, please do go now

1044
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:32,526
Get on the train

1045
01:36:32,602 --> 01:36:33,432
Let's go!

1046
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,195
See you!

1047
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,336
See you...

1048
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:39,497
Here she is!

1049
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:42,071
Master Wong, take care

1050
01:36:43,946 --> 01:36:44,912
How are you doing?

1051
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:47,944
Who is that woman?

1052
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,519
People say she's Uncle Lone's wife

1053
01:36:53,257 --> 01:36:54,382
Where the hell is it?

1054
01:36:54,524 --> 01:36:55,491
It's far from home!

1055
01:36:55,525 --> 01:36:57,356
- It's a nice place
- It's a nice place!

1056
01:36:57,527 --> 01:36:58,152
Right!

1057
01:36:58,227 --> 01:36:59,455
I am tired!

1058
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:00,427
I'll need at least 3 days' rest
before I can take care of you

1059
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,725
No problem. As you wish

1060
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:04,130
Why are they so happy?

1061
01:37:06,235 --> 01:37:07,202
Happy!

1062
01:37:07,503 --> 01:37:08,765
No more than 10 people per day,

1063
01:37:08,905 --> 01:37:10,134
and I break on the 1st and 15th

1064
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,198
You really don't remember
the Indian woman?

1065
01:37:17,247 --> 01:37:18,475
No, I remember nothing!

1066
01:37:25,522 --> 01:37:26,489
See you!

1067
01:37:29,326 --> 01:37:30,486
No need to see me off, Sol,

1068
01:37:30,794 --> 01:37:31,624
go tend to the store

1069
01:37:31,794 --> 01:37:33,057
Good bye!
