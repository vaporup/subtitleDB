1
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,880
Out of office,
leave your message.

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,040
Hi, Bob,
it's Eden Moore calling you.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
I was just wondering
what happened the other day.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,840
You just rushed outta here...

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,600
Mmpf...
E... Eden, Eden!

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,640
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,200
What happened to you?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Listen, I'm... I'm...
I'm so so sorry...

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,560
for disappearing
on you like that, uh...

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,800
You know what, uh...
an alarm went off...

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,960
and the security
had everything blocked, so...

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,920
I was...
I was stuck for there for hours.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
- Uhum.
- No, no, really.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,560
I mean, I've been desperate
to call you, I...

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,960
I've been meaning to call you.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,000
Alright, well...

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,040
I'll let you make it up to me.
Take me to lunch.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,760
What?

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,320
Yeah, you can come in with
a better story by then.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,080
Y... Y... You wanna go to
the cafeteria?

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,640
No, I thought we could eat out.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,400
Eat out?

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,720
Yeah.
You don't want to?

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
No, no, no...
I'd love to!

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,120
Okay, great.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,400
Uh... how about
café 'Dos Mundos', you know?

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,760
Yes...

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
Of course, uh... wow!

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Café Dos Mundos.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,720
Is that a problem?

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,440
No, no problem at all.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,160
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow at noon.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
Okay, great.

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,480
Alright, see you then.

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:19,507
Welcome to TransWorld.

37
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,027
Today it's 21 degrees,

38
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:25,067
a beautiful and sunny day in TransCity.

39
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:28,067
TransWorld wishes you a very lovely day.

40
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:01,627
TransOil, energy for a better life.

41
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,747
We're building your future.

42
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,347
- Hey.
- Hi.

43
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,187
How are you?

44
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,227
Good.

45
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,347
I'm so sorry I'm late.

46
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,227
Oh, don't worry about it,
I just got here.

47
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,987
Oh, you did? Oh, good.

48
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:26,347
So, how come I've never seen you
around TransWorld before?

49
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:30,547
Well, I mean it's a...
it's a pretty big company.

50
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,787
I don't know, maybe that's why.

51
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,667
Do you live nearby?

52
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,747
Me? No, no, uh...

53
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:40,147
I... I have a really long commute.

54
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:59,187
You know, I'm sorry...
Y... You really don't remember me?

55
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:03,227
I mean, if you... if you look at me,
like... I mean, really...

56
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:04,787
really look at me...

57
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,387
You don't remember me at all?

58
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,187
Come on, Eden...

59
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,227
Eden, we know each other.

60
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,267
- What?
- No, no, wait...

61
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,547
We really know each other,
I mean...

62
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,107
Why are you doing this to me?

63
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,547
What?

64
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,627
No, Eden...

65
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,227
Eden, please...

66
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:25,627
Damn...

67
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:28,227
Eden, wait!
Wait, wait, wait...

68
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,067
Come on, sorry...
Please, please, don't...

69
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,947
It's just a misunderstanding.

70
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,267
I just meant that we met before.

71
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,507
You know, it was at the elevator...

72
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:37,547
at work...

73
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,507
You dropped your papers and
I helped you pick 'em up.

74
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,187
- You don't remember that?
- No, I don't.

75
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,707
Yeah, why...
why would you, I guess.

76
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,387
Look, I... I'm sorry...

77
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,627
I'm confused, a little nervous,
that's all.

78
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,627
You know, I didn't mean
to come at you like that.

79
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,507
I'm really sorry.

80
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:57,467
Can you forgive me?

81
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:58,627
Look...

82
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:01,227
I should get back to work,
I think.

83
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,907
Come on,
just stay for one drink.

84
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:04,987
You can't stay for one drink?

85
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:06,827
We don't even have to eat.

86
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,147
You know, uh...

87
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,307
I'm not even hungry.

88
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,947
U... Unless, of course, you're hungry...

89
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,587
in which case I'm... I'm...
I'm starving.

90
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,427
Yeah, I mean, I'll eat
the whole menu... tw... twice!...

91
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,747
...if... if... if you sit down
and have one drink.

92
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,427
- I'm starving, actually.
- Yeah? Great.

93
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:21,867
Wanna sit down?

94
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,947
Isn't this upside down?

95
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:32,107
I will teach you how to
drink that stuff, really.

96
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,227
So...

97
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,587
- How am I supposed to do it?
- You have to...

98
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,667
- ...and you hold it like this...
- Okay.

99
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,147
Tilt it down.

100
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,467
What?

101
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,187
- How could I know?
- For a year?

102
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:51,627
- For a year?
- Exactly.

103
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,827
- Let's do it again.
- A year.

104
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,987
- These are good.
- Yeah.

105
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,347
- They're good.
- Yeah, take it easy.

106
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,427
Alright. Strong...

107
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,627
Hey, you know,
I wanna show you something.

108
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,467
Sure.

109
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:06,387
Uhm... it's a personal project
of mine, but...

110
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,707
I wanna do it at a much larger scale...

111
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,867
but I find your invention
could come in handy.

112
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,147
Wow, that's...
That's amazing, really.

113
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:14,827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,907
It's amazing, I mean...
I'd love to help.

115
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,427
Yeah.

116
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,587
That's the...
Sage Mountains, right?

117
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:21,907
Yeah.

118
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,907
I, uh...
I grew up there.

119
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,307
We still have our old house there.

120
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,027
Yeah, I know. We used to
go out there all the time.

121
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,187
You know, we still, uh...

122
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,507
come and pick the pomegranates.

123
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:32,787
Yeah, me too.

124
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,507
- They're the best!
- They're the best.

125
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:38,987
You're okay?

126
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,547
Uh? Yeah.
No, I'm good.

127
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,827
- I'm fine, no, really.
- Mmh.

128
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,027
It's getting, a little warm
in here, don't you think?

129
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,187
Let's get outta here.

130
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,227
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,827
Yeah, sure.
We get the check?

132
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,147
- Yeah.
- Okay.

133
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,307
So there's this great orchestra
from down below.

134
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,187
Uh, ...they play here
Friday nights.

135
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,867
They're incredible,
you have to hear it.

136
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,747
Wow, that sounds great.

137
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:11,867
Okay, so see Friday maybe?

138
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,947
- Yeah, su... sure.
- Okay.

139
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:15,947
- Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,987
- Thanks for lunch.
- Alright, take care.

141
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:18,667
Thanks.

142
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:09,827
Eden.

143
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,547
Eden it's me.

144
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:43,667
Our demonstrator will
apply the full product live.

145
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:47,627
We'll be selling five separate creams

146
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,827
...of increasing strengths

147
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:53,747
...according to the concentration
of the active ingredient,

148
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,827
...five being the most potent.

149
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:01,067
The goal is to tailor the lift

150
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:05,507
...to the condition of
various facial regions.

151
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:08,267
And as you see,
a range of strengths

152
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:12,147
...allows the consumer to apply
what's needed where needed.

153
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:15,107
For a general purpose product
I think the level two

154
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,267
...provide visible
all-round improvement

155
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,307
...without adverse effects.

156
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:23,507
Number five, being strongest,
can work miracles.

157
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,147
And speaking of miracles,

158
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:29,187
...now we're also developing a product
for the breasts and the buttocks.

159
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,467
Oh, I think it's ready!

160
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,907
Bravo! Bravo!

161
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,667
- Any questions before we continue?
- Yes.

162
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:50,267
Couldn't we market a cheaper
version for down below...

163
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:51,587
...with only one product?

164
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:53,827
Oh, yes, we could...

165
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,347
...at the very
lightest concentration.

166
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:58,787
The product doesn't hold up well
at very high doses.

167
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:03,147
Uhm, let's see what happens
with excessive application.

168
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:11,747
She had a product applied
about ten minutes ago, so...

169
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:27,147
I have a question to the demonstrator.

170
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:29,707
Mr. Boruchowitz, right?

171
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,827
Uhm...

172
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:49,827
I'm sorry, you must have
me confused with somebody else.

173
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,947
My name's Adam.

174
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:56,547
Adam Kirk.

175
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,227
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Eden Moore.

176
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:22,227
Have you seen her?

177
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,307
Yeah, she just left.

178
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,427
No, no!

179
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,467
Damn it!

180
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,707
Hey, stop!

181
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,507
Security please...

182
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,707
TransWorld.
For a better, brighter tomorrow.

183
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:57,907
That's him!

184
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,067
Gravity.
A revolution about to begin.

185
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,467
New from TransCosmetics.

186
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,787
Uplift yourself today!

187
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:55,987
Hey!

188
00:17:58,587 --> 00:17:59,947
What are you doing here?

189
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,787
I'm looking for my dog.

190
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,147
What's your name?

191
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:05,427
I can't talk to you.

192
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:07,987
Why not?

193
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,467
You're from down below.

194
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,707
I'm Adam.

195
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,507
You son of a gun!

196
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,227
I knew you're up to something.

197
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:41,627
Bob, can I come in?

198
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:44,187
'Course, that's what I'm here for.
Come on, come on.

199
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,160
Right, right, well,...
I made it maximum weight

200
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,080
...to the exterior layer
to cover the heating problem.

201
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,040
Now, my friend,
try this for size.

202
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,080
If it fits, you are through
with overheating.

203
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,800
This is nice...

204
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
Whoa, wow, this is nice.

205
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

206
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,120
TransWorld are gonna curse the day
they fired me.

207
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,760
You got it?

208
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,000
That's a pretty good fit.

209
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Good, good, right.

210
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,040
Well, I will get back
to the outer layer...

211
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,840
The icing on the cake!

212
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,160
I don't get it.

213
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,040
It's impossible to change
gravity status.

214
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Are you sure?

215
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Yeah, absolutely.

216
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,400
Look, all we have to do...

217
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,440
...is carefully...

218
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,480
...mix the two opposing solutions...

219
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
...and wait a second to
stabilize gravity...

220
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
...and then...

221
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,760
Voilà!

222
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,000
No...

223
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,160
God!

224
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,720
That is better than
a good idea, my friend.

225
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,920
That is...

226
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
...revolutionary!

227
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
But don't they have the formula now?

228
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,160
No.

229
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,040
No, I gave 'em everything
but the main ingredient.

230
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Ah, hooo!

231
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
I would give good money...

232
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,800
...just to see the look on
Lagavullan's face right now!

233
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,960
So, are you telling me
we don't have the formula?

234
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,200
We...

235
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,840
Well, we tried to
recreate it several times.

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,840
But the thing is,
we're missing an ingredient, uh...

237
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Pink powder.

238
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,200
We found traces in his office.

239
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
Without it there is no cream.

240
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,120
That's unacceptable!

241
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
You can't figure out without him?

242
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
No.

243
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
You remember?

244
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm starting to.

245
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,800
Border Police!

246
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
Everybody up against the wall!

247
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,720
Now, this way, please.

248
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,040
Damn it!

249
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Listen, I gotta go.

250
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,680
No!

251
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,960
- Identification!
- I'll find you!

252
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Hey, you!

253
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,680
Hey!

254
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,160
Come back here!

255
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,440
Hey, stop!
Stop!

256
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,000
Breaking news coming in live.

257
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,640
Border Police have launched a
massive manhunt for a fugitive

258
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,520
...who just escaped from
the café Dos Mundos.

259
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,280
All national law enforcement
agencies have been alerted

260
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
...and we'll keep you updated
as the story develops.

261
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,436
Come on, let's go.

262
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:08,916
Wait, wait, wait...

263
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:10,636
What?

264
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,796
I... I... I just thought
I heard something.

265
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,236
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,556
Go, go, go, go!

267
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,756
Hey, you! Stop!

268
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:34,836
Eden, come on!

269
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:42,316
Come on, come on, come on!

270
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,196
Go, go, go!

271
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:54,996
Eden, the waist!

272
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,716
- Take on my waist!
- Okay!

273
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:57,596
Come on!

274
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,436
Eden, take this arm!

275
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,916
Hold on!
Hold on, hold on!

276
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:22,436
Eden, hold on!

277
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:24,236
Hold on!

278
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,476
Hold on!

279
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:31,516
I'm holding you!

280
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,196
Don't let go!

281
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,436
Hold on, hold on!

282
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,916
- Let go off me, please.
- No!

283
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:45,996
No!

284
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:48,676
I'm so sorry.

285
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:49,836
No!

286
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,116
- I'm so sorry.
- No!

287
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:06,356
The guy fell.

288
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,129
No, no, wait!

289
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,929
Don't do this to me! Ugh!

290
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:04,889
No, no!

291
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,089
- Oh, please, no!
- Get in the car!

292
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:12,049
Ahh, no!
Don't do this to me!

293
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:13,209
Here's the deal...

294
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:16,129
You give us the complete
anti-aging cream formula

295
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,769
...and if you attempt to
contact Ms. Moore

296
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,049
...charges against her
will be reinstated.

297
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,249
Do I make myself clear,
Mr. Kirk?

298
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:50,529
So that's it.

299
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:52,249
They won.

300
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,409
And I lost.

301
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:58,449
- I just lost everything.

302
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,769
They took aunt Becky
and they took Eden from me.

303
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,209
Oh, it's hard to accept that I will
never see Eden again.

304
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:17,569
I was naive to think that
I can change the world.

305
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,249
You know, up there,

306
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,489
...they always win.

307
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:25,089
And down here...

308
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,409
Well, we always lose.

309
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:32,489
So I guess I just
go back to my life...

310
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:34,409
...to my world.

311
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,369
But I will never...

312
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,129
...ever...

313
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:47,929
...forget her.

314
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,129
Gently does it...

315
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,569
Victory!

316
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:10,089
So, is it true
everyone's rich up top?

317
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,329
Don't you know,
it's total paradise up there!

318
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,649
Paradise?

319
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:20,409
Well, guys, I...
I don't think so, you know.

320
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:22,729
Th... they might be
rich, sure, but...

321
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:25,729
...it's definitely not paradise.

322
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,649
Hey let me look at that, huh?

323
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:38,049
What do you think, we should,
uh, think we should make this fly?

324
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:38,889
Yeah.

325
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,409
Oh yeah, we'll give it a boost?

326
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:41,609
Alright, hold on a bit.

327
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,849
Alright, now try.

328
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:58,489
Go on, throw it.

329
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:11,969
Hey, Eden, it's Paula.

330
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,649
Are you still sick?

331
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,769
You haven't shown up
for four days.

332
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,969
Did you get those strange
flowers we sent over?

333
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,289
I think they come from floor zero.

334
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:22,969
Let me know, okay?

335
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,729
I hope you're alright.
Bye.

336
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:41,726
Bob?

337
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:43,166
Boruchowitz?

338
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:45,126
Yeah?

339
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:46,766
I'm Eden.
Moore.

340
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:48,126
I need your help.

341
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,886
Yeah! Fantastic!

342
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,686
Bob... Bob!

343
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:27,766
What?

344
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:29,966
You think you're the only one
who can go upside down?

345
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,286
You won't get rid of me!

346
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:33,606
Easy as that, old buddy!

347
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:34,926
How did you make this?

348
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:36,726
I mean, how...
how did you do it?

349
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:37,766
Hey, hey, hey...

350
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,326
Check this out!

351
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,606
Did you make a vest or what?

352
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:52,846
I can't believe it!

353
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,006
Oh, oh!

354
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,046
Put me down, sweetie!

355
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,846
You're not even wearing a vest!

356
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:02,686
- No, no...
- Where's the weights?

357
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:05,166
No, no, no... We're 90%
water, right?

358
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:07,486
So I combine
upper and lower inversion...

359
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:09,526
with a hyper... infusion, yeah?

360
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:10,686
Now, you know this better than I do.

361
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,686
But, but the breakthrough, man,...
the... the breakthrough, ahh...

362
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:14,166
Ahh, man, I'm jabbering...

363
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:15,246
The pro...

364
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,606
The problem is, right,...

365
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:18,726
The effect only lasts an hour,
right? I'll improve it.

366
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,366
Oh... you, you my friend...

367
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:22,406
Hey, you...

368
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,326
you have a rendezvous.

369
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:26,766
What's this?

370
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:33,726
"CAFE DOS MUNDOS"

371
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:37,846
You better not go dressed like that.

372
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:41,086
Hey, did you tell him?

373
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,486
Hey, another thing...!

374
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:43,646
The cream...

375
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:45,686
Well, thanks to your stamps

376
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:49,006
...I bought the patent
under the name 'Albert & Co.'

377
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,046
...before...

378
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,326
TransWorld.

379
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,726
Nice! Nice!

380
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,006
Adam!

381
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:38,366
Eden!

382
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:40,886
I can't believe it!

383
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,686
How did you get down here?

384
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:45,846
Bob found a way
to bring me down.

385
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,046
I can't believe it.

386
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,406
I... I... I don't know
what happened to you?

387
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,166
Are you okay?

388
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,646
I'm pregnant.

389
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:10,086
We're having twins.

390
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,566
I can't believe it!

391
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:24,566
I can't believe it!

392
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,246
How long can you
stay down here for?

393
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:30,686
Forever, maybe.

394
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:33,526
Bob said
it's because I'm pregnant.

395
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:34,846
He said you'd understand

396
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,126
...how this makes me different.

397
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:43,566
I love you.

398
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:46,206
I love you.

399
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:30,326
We didn't realize yet the
repercussions of what we had done.

400
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:35,886
Our love would forever
alter the course of history.

401
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:39,246
But that's another story...
