1
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:22,382
The universe...

2
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:25,342
So full of wonders...

3
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:29,462
I could spend hours and hours
looking up at the sky.

4
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:33,942
So many stars,
so many mysteries...

5
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,982
And there's one very special star

6
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:41,982
that makes me think
of one very special person.

7
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,582
Now let me tell you my story.

8
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,902
At the dawn of time,

9
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,742
from the chaos,

10
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:53,022
came an exception.

11
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:57,622
One of the most mysterious secrets
of the universe.

12
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,462
You see, I come from
that very mysterious and unique place.

13
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:08,182
We are the only known solar system
with double gravity.

14
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:12,702
Two twin planets
whirling together around one sun

15
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,502
but each with its own
and opposite gravity.

16
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:20,982
Now, in our world
it's possible to fall up

17
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,902
and to rise down.

18
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:27,902
But... my story,
it's about love.

19
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:32,502
Some people say
that true lovers are one soul

20
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,782
that is separated when it's born.

21
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:39,782
And those two halves will always yearn
to find their way back together.

22
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,942
Well, to understand my story,

23
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:47,462
you're gonna need to know the three
basic laws of double gravity.

24
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:51,262
All matter, every single object

25
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:56,142
is pulled by the gravity of the world that
it comes from, and not the other.

26
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:01,262
- An object's weight can be offset using-

27
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:03,582
inverse-matter.

28
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:10,422
After a few hours of contact,
matter in contact with inverse-matter

29
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,022
...burns.

30
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,462
All these laws are as old
as the universe itself.

31
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:21,862
They're are unchangeable,
and there are no exceptions.

32
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,662
Gravity...

33
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:27,982
They say you can't fight it.

34
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,662
Well, I disagree.

35
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:34,782
What if love
was stronger than gravity?

36
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,102
Now let's go back
to the dark times

37
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:43,422
when any contact between worlds
was extremely dangerous

38
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:46,542
and totally forbidden.

39
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:52,782
Up top had grown rich
and prosperous

40
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,302
while here, down below,

41
00:02:55,382 --> 00:03:00,262
we stole inverse-metal from up top
to heat our homes and to survive

42
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:03,022
risking everything,

43
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,862
even our own lives.

44
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,782
I think he's dead.

45
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,902
Hey! Police!

46
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:28,502
They only authorized contact
between worlds is through TransWorld,

47
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,182
a giant corporation up top,

48
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:34,222
created to take cheap oil
from down below

49
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:37,542
and to sell back to us
overpriced electricity

50
00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:39,902
that we couldn't afford.

51
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:49,622
Because of TransWorld,
I grew up in an orphanage.

52
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,582
You see,
my parents died in the Big Blast,

53
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:58,222
a TransWorld oil refinery explosion
that destroyed much of the city.

54
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,422
Fortunately,
there were the weekends.

55
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,742
They let me visit
my great aunt Becky,

56
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,862
my only surviving relative.

57
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:33,182
- As well as Becky, there were-

58
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:38,502
model airplanes
and Becky's flying pancakes.

59
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,222
Going to have to get me
some more pink pollen tomorrow.

60
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:43,302
Okay, sweetie?

61
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:47,102
Becky also initiated me
into an ancient knowledge

62
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:51,262
passed down over the generations
to the women of our family...

63
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,022
Now catch!

64
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,942
The secret of the pink bees.

65
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,142
Becky, how do they do that?

66
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,822
It's all in this book.

67
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,462
It was passed down
to my mother from hers.

68
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:28,142
And, of course,
I would have given it to your mother.

69
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:32,622
One day, when you grow up, it'll be yours..

70
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:43,702
Becky would often sent me to gather
pink pollen from the Sage Mountains.

71
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:48,942
This was the only place,
and a forbidden place,

72
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,982
where pink bees could be found.

73
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:56,462
Bees that fed of flowers
from both worlds

74
00:05:56,702 --> 00:06:01,102
and without whom this story could
never have happened.

75
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:04,942
But I have a little secret
of my own...

76
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:08,702
I used to go chase inverse-rain
from up top.

77
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:17,462
One day
I went much further than usual,

78
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:22,462
climbing higher and higher
above the cloud line.

79
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:28,262
And that day... that day...

80
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,942
changed my life...

81
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,942
...forever.

82
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:18,742
Hey!

83
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:22,582
Hi!

84
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,142
Hey!

85
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:04,982
Hey!

86
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,262
Hey, where have you been?
I've been waiting ages for you.

87
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,942
Our neighbors got robbed.

88
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,542
They're saying it was a thief
from down below.

89
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:18,862
There's hunters with guns
and border patrol trucks.

90
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:20,542
Are you serious?

91
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,582
Don't make that face!

92
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,982
I made it here, right?

93
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,662
Look, as long as you're okay...

94
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,822
Hey, look, I'll throw it up!

95
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,462
- Alright, ready?
- Alright right, Adam!

96
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:53,942
Are you tied on?

97
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:55,502
- I'm done!
- Yeah?

98
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,822
Okay, I pull you down!

99
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,662
Don't drop me!

100
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:05,262
You know,
these ones from up top are so good...

101
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:07,542
- They're the best.
- Yeah, they are. They're amazing.

102
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:14,462
Oh, wait.
I got something for you, too...

103
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,822
And this is from both worlds.

104
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:17,742
What is it?

105
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,942
I can't tell you.
You gotta close your eyes.

106
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:22,662
Close your eyes!

107
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,902
Come on, like 'closed' closed!

108
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:27,182
- I closed!
- Alright.

109
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,342
- Are they closed?
- Uhmm.

110
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:36,782
Okay, open your mouth.

111
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,582
I can't reach!

112
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,182
Mmh...

113
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,782
How is that from both worlds?

114
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,142
I don't know, you should
probably ask the bees.

115
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,382
I don't know.

116
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:02,502
Imagine if we could
go anywhere we wanted to.

117
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,982
I mean, really...

118
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:09,022
I can imagine that...

119
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,182
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

120
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:14,262
Well, we can.

121
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,902
Come on, let's imagine we can,
let's go down!

122
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:25,742
Are you holding on?

123
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:28,262
- Ready!
- Three, two, one...

124
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,302
Go!

125
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,142
Alright, I go down.

126
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:43,542
- You're holding on?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,382
Don't you let my legs go!

128
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,542
I got it, I got it!

129
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,222
- Okay, let it spin! Whoa!
- Whooo!

130
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,942
I've got my eyes closed.

131
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,982
Look at the branch, whoa.

132
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,182
- We gonna go again?
- Uhum.

133
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,102
- It's the biggest one ever.
- Alright, I'm ready.

134
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,942
- You hold on?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:12,982
Coming down!

136
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:14,382
Alright.

137
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:15,862
- Are you okay?
- Uhum.

138
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,022
Okay, mind if we go
for another spin?

139
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:20,182
Yeah, let's get really high,
let's get even higher than that.

140
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:21,342
Okay, yeah. Ready?

141
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:24,582
Did you hear that?

142
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:26,382
Yeah.

143
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:33,702
- We should go.

144
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,502
- He's there!
- Let's get him!

145
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,382
Quick, Adam!

146
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,182
Eden!

147
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,982
Eden!

148
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,502
Oh no!

149
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:48,582
No! No, please!

150
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,022
- Becky!
- No!

151
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,662
- Becky, I'm sorry!
- - No!

152
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:55,942
Becky!

153
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:02,062
No, no! No!

154
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,982
- Becky!
- Adam!

155
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:06,982
You did nothing wrong!
Nothing!

156
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:12,142
Becky!

157
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,302
No, Becky!

158
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:18,422
Please, no! No!

159
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:20,902
Becky!

160
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:34,502
10 YEARS LATER

161
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,262
Adam, come on, stop!

162
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,702
Come on, make us a plane!

163
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,542
Oh, I can't.
I can't.

164
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:45,782
I gotta go to work.

165
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,822
Come on!

166
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,982
I gotta go to work.
I'll do it later!

167
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,062
Hey, Mr. Jones!

168
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:42,022
- TransWorld...

169
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:44,622
...you've got to play to win!

170
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:49,342
- Hello, Albert.
- Mrs. Nathanson.

171
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:53,142
- What do you have for me?
- Inverse-matter to pay my debts.

172
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,942
Will this cover it?

173
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,902
My husband says it's stainless steel.

174
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,862
From the main pipeline.

175
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:04,662
Oh...

176
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,622
Pablo, it's ready.

177
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,542
Okay, don't start it till it's
fully applied.

178
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:11,582
Okay.

179
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,502
Okay, here we go.

180
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:24,782
Wow, that stuff is amazing!

181
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,302
Is it for sale?

182
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,302
Oh...
Not great yet.

183
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:32,982
Nah.

184
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,302
- We're all settled, darl.
- Thank you.

185
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,702
And, uh... can you keep me
posted on that beauty cream?

186
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:42,502
We'll do. You take care, no?

187
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,382
Do you hear that, Adam?

188
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,422
We have got to finish this cream.

189
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:51,982
Well, I would love to,
Albert, you know, but...

190
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:55,102
with this equipment, you know,
it'd take years.

191
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,542
...TransWorld will fulfill
everyone's dream

192
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:01,582
and transform his life working
for TransWorld.

193
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:03,462
We're live down below with our

194
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,982
nine finalists feverishly
awaiting the results.

195
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:11,062
I'd like to welcome
Ms. Eden Moore of Trans Publicity,

196
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,902
a division of TransWorld.

197
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,702
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

198
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,062
Welcome!

199
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,502
Now, she'll tell us more
about what she does.

200
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:23,582
But more importantly, let's hear
about our winner's new job.

201
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,662
Well, our division handles all of
TransWorld’s graphic designs.

202
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:30,102
Right now, we're going to work on...

203
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:34,582
Uh... that sounds fascinating
but our audiences are dying to know...

204
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:37,182
just what job will our winner begin?

205
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:40,782
Well, today we're offering the winner
a job in our department.

206
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,782
Okay, here we go.

207
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,822
Let's choose our lucky winner.

208
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:50,022
It's her.

209
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:51,022
Number 2.

210
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,822
- Pablo, it's Eden.
- Are you sure?

211
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:55,742
I'm probably sure.

212
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:59,382
She... she's alive!
I can't believe it!

213
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:02,462
I couldn't find her,
and she works at TransWorld!

214
00:21:32,902 --> 00:21:35,942
Attention,
this is a final call.

215
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:39,262
Doors will be closing in five minutes.

216
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:47,342
Stay in line, prepare jackets and
personal objects for weighing.

217
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,462
Please, remove
your jacket and empty

218
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:52,862
your pockets of personal
belongings for weighing.

219
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,462
Place your jacket in the bin as well.

220
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:01,902
Stay in line, prepare jackets and
personal objects for weighing.

221
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,262
165 pounds.

222
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,022
- Don't move.

223
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,262
- New?
- Yeah.

224
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:12,862
- What floor?
- Floor zero.

225
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:15,662
- Name?
- Adam Kirk.

226
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,022
Thanks.

227
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,142
Need some help?

228
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:14,582
Uh, yeah, yeah. I... I'm looking for
a station 15, sector 8.

229
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:16,022
Third aisle down.

230
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:17,342
Thank you.

231
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,222
"WELCOME"

232
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,422
Welcome aboard, newbie!

233
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:57,782
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

234
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,582
- Goddammit!

235
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,542
I'm so... so sorry.
I... I... I had no idea...

236
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,622
- I was gonna...
- Don't worry, my friend.

237
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:15,822
They do that to all the newbies.

238
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,342
Oh, great...

239
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:21,022
My name's Bob, Bob Boruchowitz.

240
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:23,182
And you are?

241
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,862
I'm Adam, Adam Kirk.

242
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,062
Mr. Kirk?

243
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:31,462
Please, follow me. The managing
director is waiting to see you.

244
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,102
Right, sure, uh.
Okay, thanks.

245
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:36,782
Psst! Hey, hey!

246
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:38,422
Your back...

247
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:40,222
Your back, check it out.

248
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:43,622
Oh...

249
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:47,582
Right... that's, uh...
That's pretty funny.

250
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:48,662
Oh ho.

251
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:51,742
Mr. Kirk,
we don't have much time!

252
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,102
Come see me on your way out

253
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,702
for the list of materials
you require for your work.

254
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,822
I need you to complete
your security clearance form.

255
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:05,662
I'll also give you your various
access badges and meal vouchers.

256
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,862
Come in, Mr. Kirk.

257
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,262
Come in, come in.

258
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:23,862
This anti-aging cream idea of yours
seems to be quiet promising.

259
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,742
Your application has been approved.

260
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:30,062
But this is strictly on a trial basis,
you understand?

261
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:32,182
O... Of course.

262
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,222
Have a seat, please.

263
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:35,542
Thanks.

264
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,062
Fasten your seat belt, Mr. Kirk.

265
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:40,782
I'm sorry?

266
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:41,822
Your seat belt.

267
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:44,142
Seat...
Oh, right.

268
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:50,662
Are there any questions, Mr. Kirk?

269
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:56,062
Yeah, I was just wondering what
all these people up my side do?

270
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,822
Mmh...
They're merely adapters.

271
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,462
They adapt our products
to your world.

272
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,742
You on the other hand have
a real opportunity here.

273
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:09,342
Company policy
doesn't normally allow

274
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:13,142
for someone from... 'down below'
to hold such an important position,

275
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:16,222
but were making an exception
in your case.

276
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,862
Sign here, please.

277
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:37,262
Now then, a word of warning...

278
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:41,822
We scrupulously observe a full
separation between worlds here.

279
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:46,542
That means there is to be no
unnecessary contact with those up top.

280
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:48,982
Just stick to your job
and all will be well.

281
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:50,822
One last thing...

282
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,182
The rules are quite strict here.

283
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:55,742
As you know, you'll be working
with upper world materials.

284
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:58,622
This means that you will be
thoroughly searched and weighed

285
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,862
every time
that you leave the premises.

286
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:03,662
If they find
any inverse-matter on you,

287
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:06,422
you'll be fired
and jailed on the spot.

288
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:11,382
But I have a feeling that
this won't happen in your case,...

289
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:14,742
will it, Mr. Kirk?

290
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,662
No, sir.

291
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,142
Try not to prove me wrong.

292
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,822
Right then...
Dismissed!

293
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,382
Another massive
oil leak has developed,

294
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,142
following a metal robbery
from the main pipeline

295
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,142
forcing TransWorld to
double their security.

296
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:37,782
The three thieves from down below
arrested last week were hanged

297
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:40,622
this morning at dawn
raising interworld tensions.

298
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:43,182
Here's the senior TransWorld
executive with a statement...

299
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:45,542
They got what they deserved.
We don't go down to their world,

300
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,462
we certainly don't want them coming up to ours.
- Hey.

301
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:51,182
Nice boss you got there.

302
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:54,382
And that's tonight's news on TTW7.

303
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:55,862
Thank you for watching us.

304
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:58,702
Adam,
you did not have to do this.

305
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,982
I could have gotten you
that patent.

306
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,062
TransWo... TransWorld is the worst
thing that ever happened to us.

307
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,742
And what now, you're...
you're one of them?

308
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:06,822
Come on, Albert...

309
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,782
Those people are vultures.

310
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:11,342
And you're gonna give them
your golden goose for peanuts?

311
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:12,862
We have nothing!

312
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,422
Yeah, we're from down below.
I mean, that's just the way it is.

313
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,982
I mean, we have nothing.

314
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:21,102
Don't you tell me I'm nothing!

315
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:24,022
This isn't nothing,
this is everything!

316
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,542
And I gave you everything,

317
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:29,582
treated you like you were
my own son!

318
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:31,062
And you know what
you're gonna do?

319
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,062
You gonna go out there and
you're gonna get yourself killed!

320
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:35,622
That's all you're gonna do...
get yourself killed.

321
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:37,062
Shit...

322
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,822
What?

323
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:48,062
Al... Albert, come on!

324
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,502
I didn't mean it like that.

325
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,342
Albert, please, come on!

326
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,342
Alright...

327
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,262
Don't you dare to think
that I have forgotten

328
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:00,102
that TransWorld took away
my entire family!

329
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:01,702
Alright?

330
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:08,102
Look...

331
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:11,462
If I could use TransWorld...

332
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:14,942
and... and aunt Becky's
pink powder just to...

333
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,182
I... I... I don't know...

334
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,222
Just to give my life
some kind of hope.

335
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:21,742
That's how I'm gonna do it.

336
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:24,382
Come on, Albert, please!

337
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:29,502
Come on, I need you your help.

338
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:30,902
Albert, please!

339
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,862
Come on!

340
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,982
Alright...
Alright, I'll help.

341
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:51,902
Okay...

342
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:55,342
Today we have someone joining us
for the first time.

343
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,022
Hello, Eden.

344
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,102
Hi.

345
00:29:58,182 --> 00:29:59,782
Hi.

346
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:02,062
Eden. Eden Moore.

347
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:03,742
Uhm...

348
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:06,102
I had an accident
when I was a teenager.

349
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,142
Uhm...

350
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,102
Everything before that is gone.

351
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,062
Sometimes things come
back to me in dreams.

352
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:18,782
But I'm never sure if they're real
or if I'm making them up.

353
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:21,382
It's frustrating.

354
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:23,062
You know, I...

355
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:25,942
I know that whatever is missing,
it's in there.

356
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:28,622
Uhm...

357
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,462
But it scares me.

358
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,342
Uhm...

359
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:35,822
Mostly it just feels like
something's missing.

360
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:38,142
Mr. Kirk?

361
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:39,222
Yes.

362
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:42,942
Here's the key to your
personal refrigeration system.

363
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:48,262
And here's your very first allocation...

364
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,462
of inverse-matter.

365
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:52,662
Okay, great.

366
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,422
Be careful. Without cooling
it gets hot very fast.

367
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:56,622
Err...

368
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:59,582
Thank you.

369
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:04,462
Hey...
Not exactly a charmer, is he?

370
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:07,302
- Oh!

371
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,302
- Lunch time.
- Lunch time!

372
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:12,262
I usually go to the smoking room
after lunch break.

373
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:16,622
Why don't you drop by,
and we have a little conversation?

374
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:19,382
Okay, sure.

375
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:30,622
- Hey, Bob?
- Mmh?

376
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,702
Mind if I come in?

377
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:34,822
Come in, come in,
sit down, hey!

378
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:36,022
Want a cigar?

379
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,142
- Smoke?
- No, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

380
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:39,702
Okay, fine.

381
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:51,822
See? Empty.

382
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:56,382
"No one smokes in TransWorld anymore..."
pfft.. Well, I do so.

383
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:03,782
Hell, people have a funny way
of seeing things here.

384
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:07,622
Anything or anyone different is...

385
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,182
well, they say...

386
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:10,702
'frowned upon'.

387
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:14,462
Can I ask you a favor?

388
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:17,222
Yeah.

389
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,262
Yeah, sure.

390
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:28,302
Can you get me some stamps?

391
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:31,182
Some stamps?

392
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:34,222
Yeah... stamps.

393
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,022
I, uh...

394
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:37,742
I don't like to boast, but...

395
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,702
I got one of the largest known
stamp collections up top.

396
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,982
And if you can get
me some from your side...

397
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,942
Oh, boy...!

398
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,742
Right, yeah, I mean, uh,...

399
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:51,782
I mean... sure, I guess.

400
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,262
Great... Great!

401
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:56,302
So, you're saying...

402
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,942
anti-gravity...

403
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,302
Yeah, you know, I... I've...

404
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:02,062
Well,
I've been working on this, uh...

405
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,222
- Well, it's an anti-aging cream.
- Uhum.

406
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:07,342
Oh... well,
I'm here if you need me,

407
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,502
expert in conductivity,
in computer programming,

408
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:11,782
anything you need, anything,
just ask.

409
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:14,822
Well, then, uh...

410
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:18,022
I... I... I guess there could be
something you could help me with...

411
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,062
uhm...

412
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:23,862
I was wondering if you might be able
to get me in touch with an employee...

413
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:26,542
...up top.

414
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,022
Up top?

415
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:30,062
Yeah.

416
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:32,822
Her name's, uh...

417
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,382
Eden Moore.

418
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,822
Sure...

419
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:42,782
Sure.

420
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:07,542
So, what's your plan?

421
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,022
I don't know yet.

422
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:13,222
Working on it.

423
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:16,662
I mean,
but you've seen her, alright?

424
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,542
No, I mean...
I... I haven't actually seen her, but...

425
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:25,582
...but she's there, Pablo. I mean,
she's just like a... fifth floors above.

426
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:31,742
Are you sure this is worth it?

427
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:37,182
I mean it's been like ten years
since you last saw her.

428
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:40,942
Yeah... it's worth it.

429
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:18,182
It's amazing!

430
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:19,862
The ma... The man with no hair!

431
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:21,502
I can't believe it!

432
00:35:33,782 --> 00:35:35,382
So what kind of shirt you want?

433
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,342
- You want like a sport shirt?
- No, no...

434
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,542
T-shirt?
One of of the button-down collars?

435
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:41,262
- Yes, like a normal button-down shirt.
- You want a jacket?

436
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:43,702
Yeah, like... I don't know...
a suit jacket.

437
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:52,262
Stay in line...

438
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:47,182
You may proceed, Mr. Kirk.

439
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:49,062
Thank you.

440
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:06,662
Now, this should be happening
any moment now.

441
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:09,662
You watch carefully.

442
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:11,982
Here it comes.

443
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,302
How long does the effect last?

444
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:20,502
Well, right now really
only like a few minutes...

445
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:21,902
...but I...
we've been working on...

446
00:37:21,902 --> 00:37:23,102
It's been working long enough.

447
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:25,302
Soon we'll begin clinical trials
on human subjects.

448
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,822
Obviously, we start with a sample
of women from down below.

449
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:31,022
I need quick results.
I'm counting on you.

450
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,022
Is that beauty cream
for Halloween?

451
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,822
No, they got different
standards of beauty down below.

452
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:40,382
The... uglier the better.

453
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:44,662
Hey, don't let those guys
get to you.

454
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,982
They're just jealous,
that's all.

455
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:50,022
Are you... staying late?

456
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,182
Yeah, you know, I thought I stay and
finish up a few things, you know.

457
00:37:53,262 --> 00:37:55,742
Ah, yeah. Well, I take the dog
back to the kennel.

458
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:57,422
Come on, girl.

459
00:37:57,502 --> 00:37:59,222
Hey, here!

460
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,742
You realize they don't pay
overtime, right?

461
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,062
Yeah, I know.

462
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,862
Okay, alright.
See you tomorrow!

463
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,182
Don't work too hard!

464
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:09,462
I won't.

465
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:23,822
Hello?

466
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,542
Yes, it is.

467
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:28,622
No, I'm sorry,
she's got home for tonight.

468
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,502
Yeah, you can come by tomorrow.

469
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:34,062
Okay, what's your name again?

470
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:37,182
BO-RU-CHOWITZ.

471
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:39,742
Thank you.

472
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,542
Okay, see you tomorrow.

473
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:50,782
Believe me, Adam,
it's gonna burn.

474
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:54,742
And the pinch... just use a little
water to cool it down.

475
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:59,022
Please, remember, you won't last
an hour with these kind of things on.

476
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:00,862
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know...

477
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:07,262
Alright, Pablo, what?
What is it?

478
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:10,382
Alright, what's your plan, huh?

479
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:13,382
You dress up in disguise, you show
up to meet her, and then what?

480
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:15,022
Then what? I...

481
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,102
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

482
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:17,142
No, I don't know.

483
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,102
Alright, let me
get this straight, okay?

484
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,342
She sees you, alright,...

485
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:23,862
she throws herself in your arms,
says she loves you, and... and...

486
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:25,102
she never forgot about you.

487
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:26,342
- Yeah, yeah, maybe.
- Okay...

488
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:28,502
Since you're starting
to burn up...

489
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,862
you tell her you love her too,
but you really have to go.

490
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:32,942
And if you don't get
caught or shot,

491
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,742
maybe you see her again
in ten years.

492
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,022
Besides, what... y... you...

493
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,542
You really think she, uh...

494
00:39:39,622 --> 00:39:40,702
she just waited for you?

495
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:41,782
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?

496
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:42,822
Yeah, actually I do.

497
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:46,182
Adam, you're from down below,
okay? Don't you get that?

498
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,062
Besi... you know what...

499
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:52,142
I bet she calls the cops
the second she sees you.

500
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:55,142
- She's not gonna call the cops...
- Adam, you're so delusional.

501
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:58,662
Hey, why are you so obsessed
with those people, anyway, huh?

502
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,062
You know,
my brother was the same way...

503
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:06,902
when he went up there and...

504
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:10,342
well, he never came back.

505
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,182
You wanna end up like him?

506
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:05,222
"Hey, Eden. It's Adam!"

507
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:07,862
"It's Adam."

508
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,022
Who's there?

509
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:20,742
Possible breach.

510
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:40,262
Ah!

511
00:43:35,622 --> 00:43:36,582
Eden.

512
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,462
Eden, it's... it's... it's me!

513
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,662
Oh, yes, Mr. Boruchowitz, right?

514
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:48,382
I'll be with you in a second.

515
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,582
Wait...
Come on, Eden.

516
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:54,102
Hi.

517
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:56,502
I'm Paula.
We spoke on the phone yesterday.

518
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:58,622
I didn't realize
you guys knew each other.

519
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah... no, we do.

520
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,342
I mean, I can't believe she would
just ignore me like that.

521
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:04,702
No...

522
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,742
No, she just forgets things.

523
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,342
What do you mean?

524
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:09,622
It's her amnesia.

525
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:13,102
W... wait, she has amnesia?

526
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:15,782
Yes, since her accident.

527
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:18,182
- - Will you get these two?
- Yeah.

528
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,022
You wanted to see me?

529
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:26,622
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, no, I did, uh...

530
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:29,782
Look, look, you know,
I thought that we...

531
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:31,502
I... uh,...

532
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:33,702
I... I thought...

533
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:34,982
that, uh...

534
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:37,262
that, uh...

535
00:44:37,862 --> 00:44:40,462
...that this product
that I've been working on...

536
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:41,982
I... I thought it might be of...

537
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:43,542
...some interest to you...

538
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:47,022
- ...professionally speaking.
- Uhum.

539
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:49,302
Yeah, I... I... uh...
Oh, would you...

540
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:51,702
Can I, can I show you...?

541
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,742
Yeah, sure.
That's just a mock-up.

542
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:09,302
You know, it takes a...
second to work, so...

543
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,502
Okay.

544
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:14,462
You know, uh...

545
00:45:14,822 --> 00:45:15,782
I've, uh...

546
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:17,462
I've been working
with this, this...

547
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:18,662
young man...

548
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:21,582
who's just recently started
here at TransWorld.

549
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:22,822
But, uh...

550
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:24,662
He had like a trouble childhood.

551
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:26,982
Yeah, he grew up in a, like a...
like an orphanage.

552
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:28,102
Oh, that's terrible.

553
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:29,702
Yeah, you know hi...

554
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:31,862
his aunt Becky...?

555
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:34,822
Who's like his only
real family?

556
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:36,302
Well, you should've brought him.

557
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:38,462
Yeah...

558
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:39,782
Well, uh...

559
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,822
Th... the truth is...

560
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,302
that he couldn't come.

561
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:44,822
Oh, why not?

562
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,702
Well, 'cause...

563
00:45:48,222 --> 00:45:50,182
...he's from down below.

564
00:45:54,942 --> 00:45:57,942
- Oh... sorry.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

565
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,982
I just don't know why
you tell me this.

566
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:03,462
- Anyway, I thought that...
- Oh...

567
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:05,582
...the product might
be of some interest.

568
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,222
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

569
00:46:07,302 --> 00:46:09,182
It's perfectly straight.
What is this stuff?

570
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:11,062
It's top secret, actually.

571
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,862
I like secrets.

572
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:19,702
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

573
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:20,982
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure?

574
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:23,582
- Yeah, oh, yeah. I'm good.
- Wait, you're sweating.

575
00:46:23,662 --> 00:46:25,542
Oh, really?
God, look at that...

576
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:28,022
- Do you want Translenol?
- No, no, really, I... I'm good.

577
00:46:28,062 --> 00:46:28,942
I'm pretty good.

578
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:30,302
You know what,
can you just, uh...

579
00:46:30,382 --> 00:46:31,862
excuse me for like...
just one second.

580
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:33,902
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

581
00:46:34,422 --> 00:46:35,862
I'll be right back.

582
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:42,542
So funny.

583
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:54,822
Ohh, ahh!

584
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:14,702
Ahh!

585
00:47:24,502 --> 00:47:25,462
Uh!

586
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:46,502
Hey! Stop!

587
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,382
He's not coming back?!

588
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:54,982
Can you believe it?

589
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,542
No, I don't.

590
00:47:57,902 --> 00:48:00,062
But he is cute though...

591
00:48:02,742 --> 00:48:04,502
- I know.
- Uhum.

592
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:10,942
You know I hate to say it,
but I told she wouldn't remember you.

593
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,462
Pablo... please.

594
00:48:12,982 --> 00:48:16,062
She got amnesia
...after all of that.

595
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:18,942
Boy, you sure know
how to pick 'em.

596
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:22,022
You burned yourself
pretty good there too.

597
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:26,742
Put some more of that on,
tonight when you go to bed.

598
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:27,822
Okay.

599
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,542
Everything alright, Mr. Kirk?

600
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:53,182
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah...
everything's fine, just uh...

601
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:55,422
you know,
cleaning up a few things.

602
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,942
Here's the list of candidates
for your clinical trial.

603
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:01,462
Oh! Oh, great!
Thank you.

604
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:06,462
I'll come by at the end of the day
for your selections.

605
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:10,422
Psst! Hey!

606
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:12,542
May I see?

607
00:49:12,662 --> 00:49:13,622
Sure.

608
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:20,382
Uh-ohh... man, Geez,
models like that...

609
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:21,862
Your goose is cooked, man!

610
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:24,302
What are they trying to do,
get fired or what?

611
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:27,062
Show time!

612
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:31,262
- It's showtime, honey.
- What's that?

613
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,742
Oh, you'll see...

614
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:37,262
You just started here,
you'll be on to a lot of fun.

615
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,022
Your attention, please.

616
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:42,062
Before we begin
handing out the bonuses...

617
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:46,142

I'm sorry,
did you said 'Bob Boruchowitz'?

631
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:21,622
Well, uh, I think that's
a mistake, yeah?

There is no mistake,

Don't ever trust
anyone here, Adam.

All a bunch of snakes.

643
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:05,222
That's it? I mean, you just
pack up your things and leave?

644
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:10,422
31 years... They toss you out
like a bag of garbage.

645
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:14,102
Yep, that's the TransWorld way.

646
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,822
This is for your collection.

647
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:22,622
Some things in here
may come in handy.

648
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:24,782
You're ready?

I'm really sorry.

Don't worry about me my friend.

655
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:45,862
It's their loss.

656
00:51:46,942 --> 00:51:47,942
Right.

657
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,262
Take care of yourself, right?

Right...

659
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:55,462
Come on, old girl.

We're out of here,
you're comin' with me.

661
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:59,142
All these jerks...

662
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,222
...wind me up in a tin can.

663
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,182
Come on, girl, come on.

664
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:07,022
Hey, Bob...

665
00:52:08,262 --> 00:52:09,222
Thank you.
