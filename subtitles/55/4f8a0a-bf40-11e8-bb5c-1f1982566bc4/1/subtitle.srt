1
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,063
Hurry up!

2
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,034
Try this!

3
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,076
We're late.

4
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:36,028
You look stupid holding that bag!

5
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,040
These are mine.

6
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:40,095
Get rid of them fast! The car is coming.

7
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,053
Give me 2 packs of cigarettes.

8
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,070
What brand?

9
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,048
Miss.

10
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,036
What's this? Let me have a look.

11
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:19,036
Police! What is it?

12
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,011
Show me your ID card.

13
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:32,000
You throw this bag to Shanghai.

14
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,008
You be careful! Get on.

15
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,035
You don't trust me?

16
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,090
Don't trust me?

17
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,094
Tell him to come over.

18
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,086
Have I ever overcharged you guys?

19
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,020
Never! You get what you paid for.

20
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Paul, those 2 girls will come to night.

21
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,054
Boss, here they are.

22
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:15,038
You'll be satisfied with these girls.

23
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:18,000
I won't hold you up. Do have fun!

24
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,038
Enjoy yourself!

25
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:22,076
Keung, come.

26
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,085
Yes, Boss?

27
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:30,006
What did you say to him just now?

28
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,006
Nothing.

29
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,089
What did you say?

30
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,011
Really, nothing.

31
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,073
You did say something to him!

32
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,069
Truly, I did not.

33
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,065
Damn!

34
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:46,011
You didn't?

35
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,087
No, Boss.

36
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,058
You didn't?

37
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:02,009
Paul, what are you hiding?

38
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:03,088
Show me.

39
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:10,056
Why do you keep our customers' numbers?

40
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Just to help in calling them.

41
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,093
Just to help yourself, I suppose?

42
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:17,077
I heard that you've set up a new den.

43
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,023
You want to betray me?

44
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,065
So you don't trust me, Boss.

45
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,053
Relax, I'm just joking.

46
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:30,028
My congratulations
if the rumor were true!

47
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,008
Be smart!

48
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:34,045
Boss.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,008
Boss.

50
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,037
Ling and Susan, 13th floor.

51
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:38,096
Helen and Jane, 15th floor.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,079
Pinkly, 16th floor.

53
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,009
Hey, they've got bigger.

54
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:44,005
Keep your hands off.

55
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,010
This one is just night.

56
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,027
She's our new girl.

57
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,031
Take her to my room.

58
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,011
Will he pay me?

59
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,071
Ah Chiu found your girl in Yaumatei.

60
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,067
Her boyfriend was killed.

61
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:29,001
So we seized her.

62
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,080
You heard that? So get lost!

63
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,085
Will he pay me?

64
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,014
God, he will pay after.

65
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,081
I go to the washroom.

66
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:53,028
I can stand it.

67
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:57,045
I'll soon see my Brother.

68
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:02,096
I can! Surely can.

69
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,088
I shouldn't cry!

70
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,013
I have no right to cry.

71
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:10,034
A month will pass soon.

72
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,010
I treated you well.

73
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,085
Why did you elope?

74
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:18,031
It's wrong!

75
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:21,006
You're my girl.

76
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,090
Don't make me lose face!

77
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:26,015
Just told me if you had an affair.

78
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,074
Things wouldn't have gone this bad!

79
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:32,053
Now he died on the streets.

80
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:34,041
Shame on you.

81
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,024
But don't worry. We can talk.

82
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,083
Drink this!

83
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,037
Drink!

84
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,042
Drink!

85
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,051
Try to play dumb, you bastard?

86
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:52,088
Drink it up, or you die!

87
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,039
Come over here.

88
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:08,015
Strip off!

89
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,058
Undress me.

90
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,067
Pay me first.

91
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:32,051
One banknote each service.

92
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,076
The whole bundle will exhaust you!

93
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:55,001
That bitch, she...

94
00:09:56,026 --> 00:10:03,052
Help me...

95
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,042
That girl has killed the Boss!

96
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:31,092
Go and kill her.

97
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,067
Yes.

98
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,061
Are you alright?

99
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,053
Are you alright?

100
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,070
Please go.

101
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:09,008
Stay.

102
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:12,033
They're after me. Please help me.

103
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,009
- Stop!
- Get down! Stop her!

104
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:35,054
Thank you.

105
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,097
Why are you so late?

106
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,005
It's your turn next!

107
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,010
Have I ever let you down?

108
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:02,053
Beware of Fatso. He's sly...

109
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,036
Look where you're going!

110
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,016
She's over there!

111
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:24,047
Get off!

112
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,072
Who took the girl away just now?

113
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,064
Which girl?

114
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,076
The one in white.

115
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
No.

116
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,056
Stay when I'm talking to you?

117
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Or I'll fix this place up.

118
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,044
Get our men here!

119
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:39,056
Who lit firecracker?

120
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,094
Which bastard did that?

121
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:46,024
You know who controls this place?

122
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,057
You know who is the boss?

123
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,062
Who cares!

124
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,066
Just don't fool around here.

125
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,029
Be careful, Baldhead!

126
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,080
If I know who's hiding the girl,

127
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,034
I'll kill him.

128
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,047
Let's go.

129
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:09,055
Give way...

130
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,081
Let's go!

131
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,082
Let's go in.

132
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,083
Where is my money?

133
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,084
5 laps only. We're sure to win.

134
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,001
Give me five.

135
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,080
"Man in black on motorbike..."

136
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:23,077
Stay away!

137
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,032
I'll collect the money.

138
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,086
Give me the money!

139
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,024
Come on, loser, pay me!

140
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,049
Don't you want to keep you promise?

141
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:42,004
Of course, it's only $15,000!

142
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:44,029
I'll beat him next time.

143
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,054
Let's wait and see.

144
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,021
Call me if you've enough savings.

145
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:51,026
Here's your money.

146
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,022
Plus $100 for you, Bootlicker!

147
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,058
James, when will we have a race?

148
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,067
Come on, say something!

149
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:29,042
You're scared me?

150
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,009
Come here tomorrow night!

151
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,034
Is this a challenge?

152
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,051
Come down! Yankee.

153
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:37,014
I'm not talking to you, Cripple.

154
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,068
You win if you follow close enough.

155
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,022
Stop all this shit!

156
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,022
- Race me now if you've the guts!
- OK!

157
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,006
- Let's go for a drink.
- Leave me alone.

158
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,069
- Accompany me to take some food.
- Leave me alone.

159
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,077
Come on!

160
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:49,023
You may lead
by the length of Broadcast Drive!

161
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,082
Nathan Road? Castle Peak Road?

162
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,057
- Go to hell.
- Go!

163
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,078
Hell your mother.

164
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:00,078
Bill, is your head alright?

165
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,095
It's OK.

166
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,013
Bill's back. Let's tease him!

167
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,042
- Bill.
- Bill!

168
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,017
Yes... Billy.

169
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,084
Your head's OK, Billy?

170
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:18,059
We heard that you fought with a woman.

171
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,005
We thought you were great.

172
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:22,022
Later we knew,

173
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:25,068
she hurt your head.

174
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,089
Poor Billy!

175
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,090
Stop it or I'll kill you.

176
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,023
I'll beat you even you are that old.

177
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,019
Stop bluffing, or I'll kill you.

178
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:37,095
Damn you old bag.

179
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,053
What? You want a fight here?

180
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,091
I got hit!

181
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,029
Bill, come to my office.

182
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,092
Your record is bad enough.

183
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:52,079
Stay cool and take it easy!

184
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:57,076
There you are 2 months off.

185
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Take a break, old folk.

186
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,047
I'm fine.

187
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:03,047
Officer Lau.

188
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,060
Yes?

189
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:07,073
We found photos of women from China.

190
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:10,069
They said she'd killed their Boss.

191
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:12,027
They're after her too.

192
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,036
A chic killed the pimp-good ending.

193
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,003
Inspector Chan asks you to see him.

194
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:19,032
How can she kill him?

195
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,095
Don't disclose the information.

196
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,099
Yes, sir.

197
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:26,066
Bill, take a break. Don't overwork!

198
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,013
She's really fierce!

199
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,076
You like her? That'll cost you $2,000!

200
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,043
I can afford that.

201
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,031
Wait! Don't touch them.

202
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:56,044
What do you want? Go away!

203
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:57,044
What are you doing here?

204
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,032
Police.

205
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:01,040
So what? Don't mess it up!

206
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:02,024
I lost something.

207
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:04,032
I've just tied it up!

208
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,087
You can't touch that either.

209
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:08,033
Or I'll throw them to police station.

210
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:11,004
I got it!

211
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,092
Crazy old man!

212
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,043
Bureaucrats shield one another.

213
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,019
I'm innocent.

214
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,023
Just let them lock me up.

215
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,028
They'd release you for $50,000.

216
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,003
I'll raise the money anyway.

217
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,091
Sister, be sensible! They don't even...

218
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:48,091
I won't sit and let you suffer.

219
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:51,037
Anyway, I'll get you out.

220
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,071
Whatever I can do at any cost.

221
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,070
Mother!

222
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,059
Mom...

223
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,035
Mom

224
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,056
Mom

225
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,059
Frank was here! He's good boy!

226
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,005
Take his flowers away.

227
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:34,039
He's your son after all.

228
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:40,056
Why you so hard on him?

229
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,011
Mistress loved you both.

230
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:47,049
If she knew all these things.

231
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:49,024
It'll break her heart.

232
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:50,091
Say no more.

233
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,050
We'll be leaving HK soon.

234
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:04,005
Then you can't see him.

235
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:10,047
It's a waste to throw them away.

236
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:18,035
- Give me an ice-cream.
- Alright.

237
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,065
Paul.

238
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:30,070
Shall we have a chat?

239
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:33,058
I told everything at the police station.

240
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,016
Don't be so arrogant!

241
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:43,075
Yes, your boss is dead.

242
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,097
Only you can replace him!

243
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:53,085
What you try to bull here?

244
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:54,080
The ice-cream.

245
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,056
Give me that too.

246
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:04,077
Have some, Paul.

247
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,057
You've argued with your boss
before he died.

248
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,040
What was it about?

249
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,057
What do you mean? Old man.

250
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:12,036
Who are you anyway?

251
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,012
A woman hurt you. You're on leave.

252
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:17,041
Everybody knows that.

253
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,054
Be smart and get lost,

254
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,091
or you won't even get your pension.

255
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:22,079
Have it first!

256
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,088
Don't play the fool!

257
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:31,059
All your boss's girls
go to your place now.

258
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:32,084
Go to hell, old fool!

259
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,043
Shit, bastard!

260
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:43,027
We must find that chap.

261
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:46,011
Keep an eye on that old fool.

262
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,500
OK.

263
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:25,010
Excuse me, did you see my money?

264
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:27,040
No.

265
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:31,028
Thank you.

266
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,030
Does it hurt?

267
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,010
You want your money back?

268
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:10,019
Damn! He's so fierce.

269
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,073
You lost it last night?

270
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,074
We know where it is.

271
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:17,074
Come over here.

272
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,099
Lucky that I bet on him,

273
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,087
but we won't gain much.

274
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,096
It's his show tonight.

275
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,071
He's great!

276
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,025
I'll get the money.

277
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:46,056
The amount's right.

278
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:51,057
"Riding in black leather jacket."

279
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:55,040
"My tears fall in the rain."

280
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:59,045
Happy? Pay me back now!

281
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,041
I'll pay you later.

282
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,037
Jack, be honest!

283
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:06,029
You placed a bet on Dino!

284
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,008
But you still owe we $50,000.

285
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:09,075
Leave me some please.

286
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,092
No, you must pay when you can!

287
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,072
Hurry up!

288
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,045
I've got your money.

289
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,045
You should've said earlier!

290
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,025
I'm all turned on now!

291
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,009
You won't get it back
even if they find it.

292
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,030
How can I recover the money?

293
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,064
I've been looking for it
since last night.

294
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:06,039
It's no use staying here. Let's go.

295
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,097
Ice-cream cones and lollies!

296
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:52,006
- A lolly please.
- Two ice-cream.

297
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,006
Thank you.

298
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,023
Have you ever seen this girl?

299
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,048
No.

300
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,086
No.

301
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,053
You want girl, go to nightclub!

302
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,024
Two mungbean lollies.

303
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,004
Isn't she the girls who...

304
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,025
You've seen her?

305
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,063
Somebody took her away.

306
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:29,076
Stop.

307
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:32,006
Show me your ID and license.

308
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,052
I don't have ID card.

309
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:47,066
Get inside.

310
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,001
Put this on.

311
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,039
I'm very hungry.

312
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,010
Take a rest first.

313
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,052
Thanks.

314
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:21,029
"The chocolate flavor lost,"
"it suits you!"

315
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:26,026
Are you looking for somebody?

316
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,001
He is Frank's father. Is Frank there?

317
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,031
He's out.

318
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,085
Sir, go in and wait.

319
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:41,052
I'll pick you up later.

320
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:44,032
Come on in.

321
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,003
Please sit down.

322
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,012
Thanks.

323
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:03,000
Who are you?

324
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,025
I'm Celia.

325
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:10,051
This is plain congee. You like some?

326
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,014
Frank'll soon be back. Please have some.

327
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,002
No thanks.

328
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:21,027
Come on!

329
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:24,027
You go ahead.

330
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,070
There are gingkoes inside.

331
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:52,063
The congee is good. Please try.

332
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,028
Frank and his mom used to hate gingkoes.

333
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:12,036
Where's his mom?

334
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:15,095
Passed away.

335
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,033
Thanks for the congee.

336
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,080
I'll find it for you.

337
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,059
Is he still riding motorbikes?

338
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,047
Yes.

339
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,068
Tell me if you need money.

340
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,073
Don't touch my things.

341
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,019
I...

342
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,035
Cut it out.

343
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:30,023
I don't know how long you'll stay.

344
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,069
But don't touch my things again.

345
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,039
Your father's been here.

346
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,060
He's been waiting you long.

347
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,064
He's looking for a chain.

348
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,019
Sorry for all the troubles.

349
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:19,028
"Too much milk
will spoil chocolate flavor."

350
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:21,058
"But if chocolate flavor is too strong,

351
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:24,008
there'll be no taste of milk."

352
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:25,091
My dear brother, isn't that funny?

353
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:29,000
Hong Kong is a beautiful place.

354
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,033
People are so nice to me.

355
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:35,009
I work hard and hope to come home soon.

356
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:51,006
Give me a packet of cigarettes.

357
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,090
$20.

358
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:56,015
For that guy with a red motorbike,

359
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,095
do you know where he lives?

360
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:02,078
I don't know him!

361
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,037
Don't be so nasty!

362
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:31,010
You hurt me!

363
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:33,031
I'll catch you.

364
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:37,057
Police. Run!

365
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:06,085
How dare you are? You know who I am?

366
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:09,072
Stay!

367
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,023
Stay!

368
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,048
Thank you.

369
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:20,015
Where are you going?

370
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm fine.

371
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,034
Thank you.

372
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,085
You don't want it any more?

373
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:10,016
Where else can you go?

374
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:12,037
Go to my house.

375
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:28,089
Hang on!

376
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:30,018
I'm not afraid.

377
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,094
But I'll be a burden to you.

378
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,002
Don't push yourself.

379
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:41,019
Your brother needs you.

380
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:48,028
My brother is a man of calibre.

381
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:53,012
He's a writer of anti-corruption.

382
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,021
God will bless him.

383
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,063
Until I've money to save him from jail.

384
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,079
You think so?

385
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:01,067
Does it hurt?

386
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,034
My arm.

387
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:19,098
Aren't you afraid at all?

388
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:21,048
Stay here.

389
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,086
They won't find you.

390
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:21,067
Your mother looks very pretty.

391
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,038
She's fond of playing.

392
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:25,071
So do you.

393
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:30,084
Therefore, dad scolded us often.

394
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,068
She bought me the first motorbike.

395
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:35,051
For that, dad grumbled her for months.

396
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:41,056
Did she die of illness?

397
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:45,023
She died because of me.

398
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,065
So, you're on bad terms with your dad?

399
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:53,041
Yes. Dad loved her so much.

400
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,074
He drove me away.

401
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,012
So he won't forgive me.

402
00:40:58,062 --> 00:41:00,079
No, it's you not to forgive yourself.

403
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,046
If your mother died because of you,

404
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,096
could you forgive yourself?

405
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,044
Let Dino talk to me if you can't decide!

406
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:24,006
Stop the crap.

407
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,031
Just ask him yes or no.

408
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,073
I'm using mobile phone.

409
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,099
It's costly.

410
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,082
I'll wait.

411
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,091
Am I afraid?

412
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,050
What?

413
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:50,046
$100,000 is good enough, alright?

414
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,076
You really think you were a Dino?

415
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,022
Why laid such a large bet?

416
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:01,010
This dummy always want to race with me.

417
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,098
I said no because he's not my type.

418
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:05,002
Anyhow, let's take the bet.

419
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:06,048
We'll win for sure.

420
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:08,082
I only need $50,000.

421
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:12,019
The other $50,000 goes to me then.

422
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,086
Lost again?

423
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,078
Damn it!

424
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:22,066
What's happened to your foot?

425
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,092
Don't touch me, I can stand.

426
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:30,084
Go change your jeans.

427
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,067
No.

428
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,080
I care about you.

429
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:38,014
The chains were stolen together.

430
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:39,035
You're still keeping yours well.

431
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,085
But mine is like a crap.

432
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,068
See you at car racing park.

433
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,082
I'm going out, I'll be back soon.

434
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,091
Frank.

435
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:05,016
Come back early. I'll prepare supper.

436
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,005
How can you win like this?

437
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,088
You've to concentrate.

438
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,022
I'm concentrating!

439
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,026
You've got to use your brain!

440
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:29,048
Are you ready?

441
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:31,073
Ready.

442
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,057
Give me five.

443
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:36,086
Wait.

444
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:41,078
Why are you so sad?

445
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,053
It's OK!

446
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:06,053
Bingo! Won!

447
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:10,075
Why a fall?

448
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:21,076
It crashed. Give me money!

449
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,043
Don't worry, I'll pay.

450
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:28,006
It's still a lot
after deducting what you owe me.

451
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:29,085
Make it quick.

452
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:40,053
Jack!

453
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:51,037
Jack...

454
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,042
Jack!

455
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:00,084
It's a set up, I won't take it.

456
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:02,017
I don't care what you're up to.

457
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,043
No tricks with me!

458
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:05,072
One of you must answer for it.

459
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:07,022
Or else I won't let it go.

460
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,031
Fine, we'll make the show go on.

461
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:13,073
Good. Stick to the rules.

462
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:15,058
Stay clear!

463
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:19,079
Go home!

464
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:26,013
How is it up there?

465
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,055
Who knows, it's a mess!

466
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:28,059
Did you see this girl?

467
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:30,022
- She's about 20.
- No!

468
00:47:30,026 --> 00:47:32,047
Take a good look.

469
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:34,081
- She is my informer.
- No!

470
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:37,010
Go to hell.

471
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:40,077
Don't come close, it's dangerous!

472
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:42,011
Hairy, we can't find her.

473
00:47:42,015 --> 00:47:43,078
Spread up and try again!

474
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:10,059
Are you alright?

475
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:15,018
They fired to force me out.

476
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,081
I couldn't get anything out.

477
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:19,081
This is all I could salvage.

478
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,003
I'm sorry!

479
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:31,028
Sorry!

480
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:52,080
A condom?

481
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,085
Out.

482
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:05,011
We can't go home. They're still around.

483
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,020
Let me help you.

484
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,046
Let's stay here tonight.

485
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:32,026
I'll find you another hiding place.

486
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:36,030
Don't help me anymore.

487
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,043
I owe you too much.

488
00:49:39,098 --> 00:49:43,023
If my destiny let me survive.

489
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,057
Let me look after you,

490
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:50,028
before I leave.

491
00:49:56,074 --> 00:49:57,087
OK?

492
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:28,050
It's my free will.

493
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:33,021
I'll never regret.

494
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:52,036
Excuse me.

495
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:07,096
Don't play game. Tell me where they are!

496
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,012
Speak up!

497
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,038
I don't know.

498
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,057
Say something!

499
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:42,066
This is Celia.

500
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,074
Be quiet!

501
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:45,095
It's that China girl.

502
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:49,029
You finally call.

503
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,054
Stop looking for me.

504
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:54,063
Give me a day, I'll see you tomorrow.

505
00:52:57,013 --> 00:52:58,055
But I'll call first.

506
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,081
There is no towel.

507
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,031
I'll get you one.

508
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,081
Thank you.

509
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:20,032
Sorry to have got you into this state!

510
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:21,078
Never mind.

511
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:23,037
If that girl had called sooner,

512
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,057
you wouldn't have suffered that much.

513
00:53:24,062 --> 00:53:26,033
- Sure...
- Take it as your birthday present!

514
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,091
Be careful!

515
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:16,004
Don't come over!

516
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:24,005
I've to counter attack!

517
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:31,010
I want to kill you bastard!

518
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:50,012
Mr. Cheung!

519
00:54:54,016 --> 00:54:55,071
Mr. Cheung...

520
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:01,025
Sir, look!

521
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,013
Stop.

522
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,097
Are you OK?

523
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,026
I'm fine.

524
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,072
You came out suddenly. I couldn't stop.

525
00:55:07,076 --> 00:55:09,080
- Sorry...
- You're really OK?

526
00:55:09,085 --> 00:55:10,068
Yes.

527
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,073
Your hand...

528
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:18,048
I'm here to give you this chain.

529
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:23,003
Will you forgive him?

530
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,061
He asked you to come?

531
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:31,016
Please forgive Frank, your son!

532
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:36,025
He even doesn't tell Frank
he's leaving HK today!

533
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:38,021
How can you be so cold?

534
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:42,084
Don't let Frank become a nobody child.

535
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:46,009
I was angry with him.

536
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:49,026
But I've always waited for his return.

537
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:53,085
I wonder you've said so.

538
00:55:58,077 --> 00:55:59,090
Take a look please.

539
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,082
This one.

540
00:56:01,086 --> 00:56:03,019
- This one?
- Right.

541
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:07,032
I'm at your dad's place.

542
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:11,032
He's going back to the States
this afternoon.

543
00:56:11,037 --> 00:56:13,045
He's forgiven you.

544
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:16,054
Come quickly.

545
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:23,092
Don't hurry. Handle with care.

546
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,022
Sir, master is back.

547
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:35,097
Master is back.

548
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,041
Dad.

549
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:13,093
I've lost my wife.

550
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:17,018
I don't want to lose my son.

551
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:22,015
Uncle Man, we'll miss the plane.

552
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:24,040
So what?

553
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,094
This is a reunion.

554
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:27,048
Don't disturb them!

555
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:30,074
Come to the States and we can talk.

556
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:31,078
Sure.

557
00:57:31,082 --> 00:57:34,082
Come, so you two can have a long talk.

558
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:37,016
Uncle Man, take good care of dad.

559
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,041
And yourself too.

560
00:57:39,045 --> 00:57:41,067
Yes.

561
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:45,034
I'll take the luggage.

562
00:57:52,084 --> 00:57:55,026
Remember to bring Celia together.

563
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,095
Where is Celia?

564
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:14,028
She left already.

565
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:37,060
Tonight, at the garage.

566
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,081
Boss, should we seek help?

567
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:39,097
Nonsense.

568
00:58:40,002 --> 00:58:42,048
Just a chap and a girl!

569
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,073
Eat!

570
00:58:44,027 --> 00:58:45,056
Did you get Fei's money?

571
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,081
He said later.

572
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:48,044
Later? I'll go myself.

573
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:06,017
When will the girl show up?

574
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:07,079
I don't know...

575
00:59:08,017 --> 00:59:09,034
Don't know?

576
00:59:09,038 --> 00:59:13,067
Tell me!

577
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:16,013
Tonight at the garage!

578
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:31,032
Are you checking out tonight?

579
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,031
Frank.

580
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,028
Where's the girl?

581
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:34,017
You can't protect her the whole life.

582
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:38,080
I'll use you as a bait.

583
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:41,001
The girl must be with you.

584
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,097
You want to play games?

585
01:00:45,002 --> 01:00:47,023
I'll go wherever you go.

586
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:53,006
Handcuff me!

587
01:00:54,002 --> 01:00:55,040
Angry?

588
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:57,094
Here's the police station. Blast it!

589
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:01,041
Keep cool.

590
01:01:01,045 --> 01:01:02,082
Use your brain!

591
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:04,078
The chick will ruin your life.

592
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:07,058
Why are you always after her?

593
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:09,071
A fight?

594
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:13,084
I haven't had good fight for a long time.

595
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:15,015
Stop or I'll hurt you!

596
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:19,073
Stop!

597
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:28,049
I don't know what's between Paul and her.

598
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:33,021
You'll save her if you bring her to me.

599
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:36,013
Where's she now?

600
01:02:36,054 --> 01:02:37,084
I want to know too.

601
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:46,014
For her own good only.

602
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:48,001
Paul ordered to kill her.

603
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,026
Tell her.

604
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,041
5 o'clock tomorrow at the Pier,

605
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:15,004
a boat will leave for China.

606
01:03:15,054 --> 01:03:16,088
I've paid already.

607
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,054
Fetch your girl from the garage now.

608
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,021
How do you know she's there?

609
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,047
I've betrayed you.

610
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,084
I can't guarantee that's the last.

611
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,089
Her life is in your hands.

612
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,077
Your face?

613
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:36,023
I hope you can save her, my brother.

614
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,023
I owe you nothing now.

615
01:03:38,056 --> 01:03:39,069
Where are you going?

616
01:03:39,073 --> 01:03:43,028
I've been sucking from you too long.

617
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:46,024
It's time for me to be a hero.

618
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:49,049
It's worthwhile even if I lose to Dino.

619
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:52,087
Jack!

620
01:04:05,038 --> 01:04:06,072
Boss, the girl is coming.

621
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:09,001
Where's the chap?

622
01:04:09,005 --> 01:04:10,005
No.

623
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,051
Go to get him.

624
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,089
Yes.

625
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:15,027
- Hairy.
- What?

626
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:20,040
- No matter how, kill him.
- Alright.

627
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:27,007
- Move!
- Ok.

628
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:34,020
Let's go.

629
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,080
Let my friend go, he's innocent.

630
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,018
Let him go.

631
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:56,035
Alright!

632
01:04:57,031 --> 01:05:00,031
Come on, shoot.

633
01:05:01,056 --> 01:05:03,015
I've been looking for you.

634
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:04,040
Go, none of your business!

635
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:07,019
- You promised to let him go.
- Shut up!

636
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:08,049
You think you can cover it up?

637
01:05:08,053 --> 01:05:11,070
If she dies, all will know
you've murdered your boss.

638
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,099
Are you threatening me?

639
01:05:13,003 --> 01:05:13,074
Aren't you scared?

640
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,095
Bill, is the news reliable?

641
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,041
Why should I fool you?

642
01:05:19,092 --> 01:05:21,067
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

643
01:05:31,026 --> 01:05:32,039
Drive the car.

644
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:34,076
Get inside.

645
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,060
Get inside.

646
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:44,056
Move on quick!

647
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:58,012
Tell everyone stays away from the office.

648
01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:04,042
Sorry.

649
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:07,063
You've helped me a lot.
I can't leave you this way.

650
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,072
No matter what, I'll help if I can.

651
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:12,005
You should have started a new life.

652
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:16,022
It's not the time for romance.
Drive faster!

653
01:06:16,026 --> 01:06:17,026
Don't beat him.

654
01:06:20,098 --> 01:06:22,031
I told you to shut up!

655
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,082
Are you afraid?

656
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:36,091
No!

657
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,075
What trick is this?

658
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,088
Stop the car!

659
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,063
Stop or I'll shoot you!

660
01:06:56,005 --> 01:06:57,010
Stop!

661
01:06:57,072 --> 01:06:58,085
Will you regret?

662
01:06:58,089 --> 01:07:02,010
I won't.

663
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:05,056
Are you mad?

664
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:09,027
Stop!

665
01:07:46,014 --> 01:07:47,098
Let him go. He's innocent.

666
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:50,011
Arrest me.

667
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:53,094
Send her away if you love her.

668
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:55,095
What are you looking at?

669
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:03,083
I must save Jack from trouble.

670
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,050
Wait for me at the pier.

671
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:10,050
You must come.

672
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,067
What are you looking at?

673
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:16,047
She'll leave by speedboat tonight.

674
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,005
Please take her there.

675
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:19,039
Me?

676
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:20,089
You'd rather let her die?

677
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:21,097
Me?

678
01:08:23,072 --> 01:08:25,002
I'll come.

679
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:30,036
I didn't promise!

680
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:34,007
I'm a cop!

681
01:08:44,004 --> 01:08:47,016
Get help if you can't manage!

682
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:48,029
Dummy!

683
01:08:48,033 --> 01:08:49,071
I'm fit enough for this!

684
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:53,030
Your feeder isn't coming.
Hold your tears!

685
01:08:53,034 --> 01:08:56,017
Want me to crush your head?

686
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:59,034
Here's your feeder.

687
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:01,080
Go and open your mouth!

688
01:09:06,031 --> 01:09:07,039
Don't go.

689
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,086
No!

690
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:17,074
Playing tricks again?

691
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:25,095
Just once.

692
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:27,070
Let me be the hero!

693
01:09:28,004 --> 01:09:31,004
I was a hero too!

694
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:32,046
Not moron.

695
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,059
You can make it?

696
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:36,084
Leave me alone!

697
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:45,031
Beat him!

698
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:54,011
A plastic leg?

699
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:56,011
Alright, give me back!

700
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,086
I want my leg!

701
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:04,041
That's enough!

702
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:09,070
How can a peg fight!

703
01:10:10,096 --> 01:10:12,079
Go away, busybody!

704
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,026
Let's race?

705
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:21,022
Good. Tonight's race will be fun.

706
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,086
Let me look.

707
01:10:38,044 --> 01:10:39,078
What have you put on your face?

708
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:42,070
Hair lotion?

709
01:10:43,078 --> 01:10:44,070
Watch out!

710
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,063
Ready.

711
01:11:59,094 --> 01:12:02,015
I'm still a fast racer!

712
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:12,087
Get away!

713
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:31,014
Fuck you!

714
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,014
Bump me if you dare!

715
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,094
You want to lose the other leg?

716
01:12:39,098 --> 01:12:41,031
I started it. Let me help.

717
01:12:41,036 --> 01:12:43,053
- Go away now!
- I'll go all out tonight.

718
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:45,040
I'll make it a tie at least.

719
01:13:01,071 --> 01:13:04,055
Look! I've done it!

720
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:14,006
Keep chasing after Baldhead!

721
01:13:25,003 --> 01:13:26,015
This ass is pretty fast.

722
01:14:20,058 --> 01:14:23,058
Frank. Don't give up.

723
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:30,055
Frank, get his bike.

724
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,055
I will beat you.

725
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,027
Go to hell.

726
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:56,020
Quick!

727
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:03,029
We win...

728
01:15:10,013 --> 01:15:11,013
Coming again?

729
01:15:14,022 --> 01:15:16,014
Stand up, quick!

730
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:25,044
This won't help!

731
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:08,052
Is that enough?

732
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,070
My legs...

733
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:18,041
Worse than mine.

734
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:30,009
Celia is waiting for you.

735
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:35,005
Get away.

736
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:38,076
Monkey, lend me your van.

737
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,085
I'm in a hurry for marriage registration!

738
01:16:40,089 --> 01:16:42,022
No way.

739
01:16:42,026 --> 01:16:43,039
I'll beat you if you don't!

740
01:16:43,043 --> 01:16:44,064
Get out!

741
01:16:45,043 --> 01:16:47,006
Be careful. It's still on mortgage.

742
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,000
You bastard!

743
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:51,012
Why?

744
01:17:51,017 --> 01:17:53,042
Bastard, I'll kill you!

745
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:56,063
Why did you shoot him?

746
01:18:26,024 --> 01:18:27,095
Frank, stand up.

747
01:18:28,087 --> 01:18:32,096
Stand up!

748
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:41,042
Stand up!

749
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:46,051
The bad times were over.

750
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:50,002
We're buddies, aren't we?

751
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:53,081
Stand up.

752
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:56,015
Don't leave me alone.

753
01:18:57,002 --> 01:18:59,065
Stand up.

754
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:03,028
Celia is waiting for you.

755
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:30,081
Bill, please have mercy.

756
01:19:31,047 --> 01:19:33,081
Why shouted at me?

757
01:19:34,014 --> 01:19:36,086
I'll be in trouble if I delay.

758
01:19:39,027 --> 01:19:40,090
Ok, 15 minutes more.

759
01:19:40,094 --> 01:19:42,015
Ok, 15 minutes.

760
01:19:42,065 --> 01:19:44,099
You promised. No more bargain.

761
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:51,041
Roger, Bill, roger.

762
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:54,071
Roger, sir.

763
01:19:55,012 --> 01:19:56,025
Where are you?

764
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,025
At gas station.

765
01:19:58,029 --> 01:19:59,042
What bloody station!

766
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:02,055
Paul's man killed the chap you wanted.

767
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:05,076
You're looking for trouble.

768
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:10,097
Bill, did you get it?

769
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,068
I'm coming back.

770
01:20:21,019 --> 01:20:22,011
Go now.

771
01:20:22,094 --> 01:20:23,094
Let's wait for Frank.

772
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,074
We are going now.

773
01:20:25,078 --> 01:20:26,091
Why don't we wait for him?

774
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,037
Go!

775
01:20:29,016 --> 01:20:31,008
We're keeping others waiting.

776
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:34,025
I'll wait for him
and tell him you're safe.

777
01:20:34,075 --> 01:20:36,046
Shut up,
it's the first time I've begged you.

778
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,058
But now you refuse to help me!

779
01:20:39,096 --> 01:20:43,046
Don't yield to me,
remember you're smuggling!

780
01:20:44,017 --> 01:20:45,059
Shit!

781
01:20:46,005 --> 01:20:47,026
Set off!

782
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:00,048
Please ask him
to bring me that handkerchief.

783
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:01,082
He gave it to me to dress my wound.

784
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:04,099
I keep it.

785
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:06,082
He'll recognize.

786
01:21:16,025 --> 01:21:17,046
Thank you.

787
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,051
Celia...

788
01:21:29,005 --> 01:21:30,014
Nothing.

789
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,093
Bye...

790
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:34,026
Take care...

791
01:21:35,052 --> 01:21:39,052
You too, bye.
