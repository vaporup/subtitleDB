1
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,103
JAKE: When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,109
with a big hole blown through
the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,413
I started having
these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,249
I was free.

5
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,048
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

6
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,483
(SIGHS)

7
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,394
(MONITOR BEEPING)

8
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,374
In cryo, you don't
dream at all.

9
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,402
It doesn't feel like 6 years.

10
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,946
More like a 5th of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

11
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,319
Tommy was the scientist,
not me.

12
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,591
He was the one who wanted to
get shot light-years out in space

13
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,990
to find the answers.

14
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,493
Are we there yet?

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

16
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,499
We're there.

17
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,034
AGENT 1:
It's about your brother.

18
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,502
JAKE: So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

19
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,804
a guy with a gun
ends his journey

20
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,276
for the paper in his wallet.

21
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,481
You've been in cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

22
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,452
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

23
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,114
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks...

24
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,215
JAKE:
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

25
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,523
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt going
someplace he's gonna regret.

26
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,402
Up ahead was Pandora.

27
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,814
You grew up
hearing about it,

28
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,780
but I never figured
I'd be going there.

29
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,227
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,128
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

31
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,793
And since your genome is
identical to his,

32
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,768
you could step into his shoes,

33
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,705
so to speak.

34
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,641
AGENT 1: It'd be a fresh start
on a new world.

35
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,990
AGENT 2:
And the pay is good.

36
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,593
Very good.

37
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,644
Exo-packs on! Let's go!
Exo-packs on!

38
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,878
ASSISTANT:
Exo-packs on! Let's go!

39
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,318
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

40
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,322
you're unconscious
in 20 seconds,

41
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,085
you're dead in 4 minutes!

42
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,491
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

43
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,957
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,830
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,405
JAKE:
One life ends,

46
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,599
another begins.

47
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,382
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

48
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,923
Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
ASSISTANT: Harnesses off. 1 minute!

49
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,016
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

50
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,653
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

51
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,537
Go, go, go, go!
Get out of there!

52
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,266
Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!

53
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,870
JAKE: There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.

54
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,940
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

55
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,046
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass.

56
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,181
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

57
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,894
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

58
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,693
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

59
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,193
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

60
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,333
Well, well,
ladies.

61
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,409
Look at all this
fresh meat! Whoo!

62
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,545
JAKE: Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs, Marines,

63
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,143
fighting for freedom.

64
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,384
AMPSUIT OPERATOR:
Look out, hot rod!

65
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,731
JAKE: But out here
they're just hired guns,

66
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,666
taking the money,
working for the company.

67
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,134
Check this out, man.

68
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,238
Meals on wheels.

69
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,441
Oh, man,
that is just wrong.

70
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,676
MAN 1: I got 2 guys
free in about 20 minutes!

71
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,303
MAN 2:
Got it! Need them!

72
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,555
QUARITCH:
You're not in Kansas anymore.

73
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,895
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

74
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,729
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

75
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,596
If there is a hell,

76
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,671
you might want to go there
for some R&R

77
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,971
after a tour on Pandora.

78
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,006
Out there, beyond that fence,

79
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,414
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

80
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,647
wants to kill you and
eat your eyes for Jujubes.

81
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,323
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

82
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,761
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

83
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,628
that'll stop your heart
in one minute.

84
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:19,068
And they have bones reinforced with
naturally occurring carbon fiber.

85
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,502
They are very hard
to kill.

86
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,968
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

87
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,711
I will not succeed.

88
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,284
Not with all of you.

89
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,912
If you wish to survive,

90
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,390
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

91
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,389
You've got to obey the rules.

92
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,165
Pandora rules.

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,128
Rule number 1...

94
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,862
JAKE: There's nothing like
an old-school safety brief

95
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,665
to put your mind at ease.

96
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,509
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Jake!

97
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,545
You're Jake, right?
Tom's brother.

98
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,477
Wow! You look just like him.

99
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,551
Sorry, I'm Norm.
Spellman.

100
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,141
I went through avatar training
with him.

101
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,388
(CHUCKLING)
...into the bio-lab.

102
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,646
We're gonna spend
a lot of time up here.

103
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,658
Hey! How you doing?
Norm, avatar driver.

104
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,988
FEMALE SCIENTIST: Hi.
MALE SCIENTIST: Hey.

105
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,653
Link... Here's the link room
right here.

106
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,027
This is where we're connecting
to the avatar.

107
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,893
JAKE: Me and Norm
are here to drive

108
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,166
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

109
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:32,267
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

110
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,312
Hey. Welcome.
Hey.

111
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,005
Welcome to Pandora.
Good to have you.

112
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,173
Thanks.

113
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,649
(LAUGHS)
Damn! They got big.

114
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,278
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

115
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,687
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

116
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,656
Yeah, they've got
great muscle tone.

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,591
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

118
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,629
but you guys can take them
out tomorrow.

119
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,496
There's yours.

120
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,759
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

121
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,736
Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
NORM: Good to meet you, yeah.

122
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,376
(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)

123
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,163
Looks like him.

124
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,229
No, it looks like you.

125
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,269
NORM:
This is your avatar now, Jake.

126
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,908
JAKE: And the concept is that every
driver is matched to his own avatar,

127
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,742
so that their nervous systems
are in tune,

128
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,615
or something.

129
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,453
Which is why they
offered me the gig,

130
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,385
because I can link
with Tommy's avatar,

131
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,288
which is insanely expensive.

132
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,529
Is this right? I just say
whatever to the video log?

133
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,757
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

134
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,890
You know, what we see,
what we feel.

135
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,059
It's all part
of the science.

136
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,659
And good science
is good observation.

137
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,170
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next 6 years.

138
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,071
All right.
Whatever.

139
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,670
So, uh...

140
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,179
Well, here I am,

141
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,350
doing science.

with this picture?

NORM:
Grace Augustine is a legend.

151
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,571
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

152
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,379
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

153
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,716
Well, that's 'cause she likes
plants better than people.

154
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,119
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

155
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,886
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

156
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,359
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

Grace?
This is Jake Sully.

161
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,474
Ma'am.

162
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,510
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are,

163
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,952
and I don't need you.
I need your brother.

164
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,651
You know, the PhD who trained
for 3 years for this mission?

165
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,158
He's dead.

166
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,726
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

167
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,959
How much lab training
have you had?

168
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,631
I dissected a frog once.

169
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,199
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

170
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,433
without even the courtesy of
calling it rain.

171
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,971
I'm going to Selfridge.
No, Grace,

172
