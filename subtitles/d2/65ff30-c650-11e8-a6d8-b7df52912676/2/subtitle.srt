What we think we know

is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

402

between the roots
of the trees,

403
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,208
like the synapses
between neurons.

404
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:04,876
And each tree has 10-to-the-4th
connections to the trees around it.

405
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,920
And there are 10-to-the-12th
trees on Pandora.

I'm guessing.

420

If you want to share
this world with them,

421
