1
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,200
The Jingtai period of the Ming
dynasty - eunuchs abused their power.

2
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,200
In the capital they established
many government offices.

3
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,300
One of them, Dong Chang,
responsible for supervision -

4
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
- was the most barbaric,
imperious and despotic.

5
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,200
To fight their enemies -

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,200
- they spend much money
on employing warriors -

7
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,200
- and established the cold blooded
black flag force -

8
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,300
- which secretly received
special training.

9
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
Dong Chang also established
a weapon department -

10
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
- specialized in developing
various new weapons.

11
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,300
They were tested on those
who had been sentenced to death.

12
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Let me go, you traitors!
Go to hell!

13
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm an imperial official.
You can't kill me!

14
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
And you!

15
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Butterfly-shooting bird arrow!

16
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Canine hook arrow.

17
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Phoenix-tail arrow!

18
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,199
The eunuch Cao made himself
commander of the Dong Chang.

19
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,199
He had the Emperor in his power
and bullied the dukes in his name.

20
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,199
Dong Chang did everything
to destroy opposition -

21
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,199
- and tried to establish
its own empire.

22
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,199
Cao built a private jail.

23
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Anyone who opposed him
was immediately arrested -

24
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,199
- and suffered a cruel death.

25
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,199
The mere mention of Dong Chang
inspired fear.

26
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,300
The whole Ming empire
cowered in terror.

27
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,199
- Who is he?
- Minister of Defence Yang Yu Xuan.

28
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,199
- What has he done?
- Sent the Emperor a secret report.

29
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,199
He wanted him to impeach
Dong Chang and punish Cao.

30
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,300
My lord, here is the report.

31
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,199
Yang, why are you always
causing problems for me?

32
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
We in Dong Chang
are loyal to the Emperor.

33
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,300
You wrote a secret report. Aren't
you afraid of losing your head?

34
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,199
The first Ming Emperor taught us
that a eunuch can't assume power.

35
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
You built a private jail and
killed those loyal to the Emperor.

36
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,199
And you still deceive the Emperor.
That's unforgiveable.

37
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,300
How dare you say that?
Punish him!

38
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Yang Yu Xuan,
you are old and confused.

39
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Give up your power, then
I'll forgive you and let you live.

40
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,199
You are outrageous.

41
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,199
Without an imperial edict, never!

42
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Give up my power!

43
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,300
You want an imperial edict?
Write him one!

44
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,300
How dare you presume
to be Emperor?!

45
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,199
He just committed suicide.

46
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Yang is the top official.
We have to give a verdict.

47
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,199
Then we can report it
to the Emperor.

48
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Yang placed troops by the pass and
plotted treason. Tomorrow he dies.

49
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Yes, my lord.

50
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,199
The imperial edict:

51
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,199
The Minister of Defence placed troops
outside the pass, plotting treason.

52
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,199
The Emperor commands
that he must be executed at noon.

53
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,199
THE NEW DRAGON GATE INN

54
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,199
Producer:
Wu Si Yuan

55
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
With Zhang Man Yu, Lin Qing Xia,
Liang Jia Hui, and Zhen Zi Dan

56
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Director:
Li Hui Min

57
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,199
Cao killed off
Yang Yu Xuan's entire family -

58
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,199
- except a boy and a girl,
whom he deliberately spared.

59
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,199
The same autumn he sent them
to another place.

60
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,199
Cao pretended to hunt, but secretly
deployed the black flag riders.

61
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,199
He wanted to lure Yang's ally,
the general Zhou Huai An, into a trap

62
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,300
so that he could
eliminate them all.

63
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,199
Brother...

64
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,300
What a damned place.
Not a single tree!

65
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,199
Buddha... I, Qiu Mo Yan,
hold this sword and swear -

66
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,199
- that I will rescue Yang's children.

67
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Everything is ready. Let's go.

68
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Go!

69
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,199
To get through Yumen Pass,
you must go past three places.

70
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,199
Split up in three groups.
I will stay in the middle.

71
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
We'll spread out like a net.

72
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
My lord, three groups are positioned
according to your instructions.

73
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
What do we do now?

74
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,199
To get through the pass,
we must go past three places.

75
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,199
This is very dangerous.

76
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,300
In my opinion, Cao must have
placed his ambush here.

77
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,199
On the west side
there is a dry river bed.

78
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
We strike them suddenly
before they are prepared.

79
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
We strike from here.

80
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
My lord, Zhou Huai An
has not appeared.

81
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,199
Zhou Huai An
is Yang's favourite general.

82
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
He became the leader
of 800,000 troops -

83
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,199
- because of Yang's
recommendation.

84
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,300
These two children are our bait.
Zhou will turn up for sure.

85
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Thirsty.

86
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Drink...

87
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Uncle, give us some water.

88
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,199
Go away!

89
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Come here.
Open your hands.

90
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Thank you.

91
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
- Brother, drink slowly.
- Sister, you drink, too.

92
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
No, you drink.

93
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Someone's coming.

94
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,199
- Let them go, quick!
- Who are you?

95
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
- Do you want to get killed?
- Wait!

96
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,300
We are here to rescue, not to kill.
You'd better kill those Dong Chang.

97
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,199
Give us the children and follow us.
The Dong Chang won't forgive you.

98
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,300
No more talk!
Quick, take off the chains.

99
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
- Sister!
- Brother!

100
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
You two, cover the children.

101
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Sister!

102
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Shrimp soldiers and crab generals!
You haven't seen the big fish yet.

103
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Brother!

104
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
My lord, the rescuers of the children
finally turned up.

105
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Brother, where are you?

106
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Sister, where are you?

107
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Sister!

108
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,300
We can't beat them.
Take the children.

109
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,300
My lord, this is not Zhou Huai An.
His kung fu is not academic.

110
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Brother, we are safe.

111
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Zhou Huai An uses tactics.

112
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,200
These people are not academically
trained, so let them go.

113
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I want to eliminate them all at once.

114
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,300
This is Dragon Gate Pass.
We meet Zhou at the Dragon Gate Inn.

115
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,200
We have two children with us
and Dong Chang behind us.

116
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,200
We should take
Sky Dragon Mountain Lane.

117
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Just do as you say.

118
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,200
Sha Sao Wei is difficult to access.
Take someone to hold that pass.

119
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,200
Yumen Pass is very steep.
Not good for big troops.

120
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Send two cavalry groups there.

121
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,200
Dragon Gate Pass is the main escape
route. Give orders to close the pass.

122
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,200
Go west along the dry river bed
and close all the passes.

123
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,200
Your decision is the best.

124
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
- Go ahead.
- Yes, my lord.

125
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:08,200
After the meal
sing a folksong

126
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,200
the girl in the desert likes men

127
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,200
yes, the girl in the desert likes men

128
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,300
yes, the girl in desert likes men

129
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
Hey, hot buns coming!

130
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,200
- What happened to my food?
- It's coming.

131
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,200
- Damned hot!
- Qin Hu, you are early today.

132
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
- Why, does that bother you?
- No, no...

133
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Serving you is our pride.

134
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
- Then serve me!
- I'll heat the wine.

135
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Here's your wine.

136
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,200
We have earned our name.
Let's drink.

137
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
We're flattered.

138
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,300
- Where's the mistress?
- Doing business with a guest.

139
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
How do you like my place?

140
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Yi Mo Hong...
I run an inn, I don't sell my body.

141
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
You've come to the wrong person.

142
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
No, I haven't.

143
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,200
You men are so impatient.
You want everything right away.

144
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
- And then you leave.
- No more talking.

145
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,300
- See how impatient you are.
- I want you!

146
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,200
You want to get through the pass
or you want me?

147
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
- I want both.
- Not so cheap.

148
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Look at yourself!

149
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,200
Getting through the pass
costs 100 Liang.

150
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Going to hell costs 400 Liang.

151
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
What should Jin Xiang Yu do?

152
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
We've got meat for buns!

153
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,200
Mistress,
why did you finish so quickly?

154
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Shut up, old fart!
Without me, you'd starve to death.

155
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,200
Could I borrow your room
just to warm up?

156
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Damn you!

157
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm not eating goat.
I want to eat you!

158
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,200
Eat mine,
mine is bigger than your father's!

159
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Who is this?

160
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Do you like that man?
I want you.

161
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,200
Did I ever disappoint you?
He's handsome.

162
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,300
He's wanted.
He used to command 800.000 men.

163
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,200
He looks like a gentleman.
So he's a soldier?

164
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,200
Good-looking, but useless.
He's an enemy of Dong Chang.

165
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,300
- He's finished.
- Dong Chang?

166
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
- Who cares about Dong Chang?
- Don't talk like that!

167
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh, his head is worth 500 Liang.

168
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Xiao Hei Zi, tell the kitchen
to keep the head of the pig!

169
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,200
You think of goats and pigs,
but never of me!

170
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,300
How dare you touch my bottom!

171
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Why is there blood on your skirt?
What's this?

172
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,200
- Are you menstruating?
- Never seen it before? Ask you mum!

173
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,200
- My mum's finished with that.
- Then ask your sister!

174
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
- I want to ask you!
- Then come here!

175
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,200
- You want rooms?
- The three best rooms.

176
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Then sit down and wait.

177
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,200
- Sunze, take care of the guests!
- The three best rooms!

178
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,200
It's wasn't that time last month.
Why does it come today?

179
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,200
Go upstairs!

180
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Let's go back.

181
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
- May I help you?
- No. I help myself.

182
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,300
It's clean here.
By the window it's dirty.

183
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Is there anything to eat?

184
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,300
How about some wine?

185
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,200
The place is mine.
The goods also belong to me.

186
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,300
If you break the rules, never come
here again to peddle stolen goods.

187
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,200
"Wind and rain is nowhere as strong
as in the Dragon Gate Mountains."

188
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
On this fine day,
why talk of wind and rain?

189
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Oh, you come from far away.

190
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Dear guest, where do you come from?
- We come from Wu Zhou.

191
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,300
- Where are you going?
- Gua Ning Zhou.

192
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,200
- How long are you staying?
- We leave tomorrow.

193
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Buns...

194
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,200
Catch!

195
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,200
Those people are neither one thing
nor the other. Be careful.

196
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,200
One is an officer.
One has been wounded by an arrow.

197
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,200
The man in black is the leader.

198
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
- That's a woman.
- Is it a woman?

199
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Anyone who doesn't look at me
is not a man.

200
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,200
The meat doesn't taste right.

201
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,300
- What kind of meat is it?
- Not the right kind.

202
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Look, they don't buy it.

203
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,300
What now?

204
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Chopsticks!

205
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Let's go.

206
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,300
- Do you have something for wounds?
- Call your mum!

207
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,300
It's getting dark.
Light the lamp.

208
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,300
- What's that meat in the bun?
- Mixed meat.

209
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,200
- What's mixed meat?
- Have you never heard of mixed meat?

210
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,200
In Liang Shan Po,
madame Sun sold mixed meat.

211
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,200
Madame Sun's inn
is run by brigands.

212
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,200
- My inn is Dragon Gate Inn.
- You look like a devil woman.

213
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,200
- My name means gold perfume jade.
- What a pity.

214
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,200
The jade is in a box, and
the golden pin is covered by mud.

215
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Well spoken, but many people
are not quite what they seem.

216
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,300
You have a good-looking body.

217
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,200
You have a good-looking body, too.

218
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,300
But I see you much better
than you see me.

219
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
You should let me have
a better look at you.

220
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,200
What a pity this is not valuable.

221
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,200
But maybe men like it.

222
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Shit! Do you think I'm afraid
of men looking at me?

223
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,200
I've had more men
than you've seen.

224
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Look at you!
Maybe you've never lit a candle!

225
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Maybe you're still a little girl!

226
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:07,200
On the 15th of August the temple
door opens, and many candles...

227
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Going on about men all the time...
Go light a candle in your room!

228
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,200
...red candle, white candle...

229
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,300
...a girl like me can't handle
them all at once.

230
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Where did this candle come from?
What are you laughing at?

231
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,200
- Where is the Dragon Gate Inn?
- Right behind me.

232
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,200
- Are you the mistress?
- Just call me Jin Xiang Yu.

233
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,200
"Gold", splendid. "Jade", exquisite.
A beautiful name.

234
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,300
- And me, you think I'm beautiful??
- Any spare rooms?

235
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,200
You're so handsome.
Are you a tradesman?

236
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,200
- I want a room.
- For how long?

237
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,200
- Are you afraid I won't pay?
- No, I'm afraid you'll leave.

238
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,200
"Wind and rain is nowhere as strong
as in the Dragon Gate Mountains."

239
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,200
"Rain in the Dragon Gate Mountains
makes the Xue Yuan tiger come down."

240
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,200
We are alike. We can have
more dealings in the future.

241
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,300
We meet by chance. I hope
you'll take care of me in the future.

242
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,300
That depends on
whether your candle shines or not.

243
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,200
He's here.

244
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,200
- This is the inn. Please enter.
- Mistress, what's with your clothes?

245
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,300
My skirt was clean this morning,
but now it's full of dirt!

246
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,200
- That must be a woman.
- How do you know?

247
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,200
As you say, someone who doesn't
look at you, can't be a man.

248
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,300
This one is different. The eyes
don't look, but the heart does.

249
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
It doesn't look like it.

250
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,200
This time I can
hear your flute once again.

251
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Go to work!

252
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,300
The mistress is a troublemaker.

253
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
- Uncle!
- Dear children. You've been afraid.

254
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,200
This is He Fu.

255
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,300
You've been a great help, brother.
I appreciate it.

256
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
This is called a canine hook arrow.

257
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,200
Dong Chang couldn't wait
to get it ready.

258
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,200
Very few survive it.

259
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,200
We must be very careful.

260
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,300
- When do we take the children out?
- The sooner the better.

261
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,200
Brother Yang Yu,
take this silver and go home.

262
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,200
No, Uncle Zhou, I can't do that.

263
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,300
This inn is run by brigands.
Take the luggage and leave.

264
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,200
- Mistress...
- I knew you would come.

265
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,200
You're a real prophet.
I'm impressed.

266
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,200
I don't need your flattery.

267
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,300
- I come to ask about the weather.
- Come inside.

268
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,200
Nice quiet room.

269
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,200
In the desert there are no nice
rooms, only rooms made of mud.

270
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,300
What would you like,
Long Zhu or Tu Pu Ling?

271
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,300
What is this flower?
It's elegant.

272
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,300
It's a raddish flower.
No snow lotus flower, of course.

273
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,200
Snow lotus flowers only grow
in Snow Mountains.

274
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,200
Tea...

275
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,300
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight.

276
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,200
- I'm afraid you can't leave.
- Why not?

277
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,300
- Don't you know the desert weather?
- What is your advice?

278
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,300
It's the rainy season.
The weather is unpredictable.

279
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,200
Even on a fine day,
suddenly you get storm and rain.

280
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,200
You go out,
and you can't get to the pass.

281
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,200
Within 30 miles,
this is the only inn.

282
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Good or bad weather
is all in your heart.

283
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,300
That depends on who.

284
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,200
The inn won't retain guests,
but the rain will. Stay a few days.

285
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,300
The weather is changeable.
My staying depends on the weather.

286
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I can't imagine
you have something in mind.

287
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Next time we'll know each other.
I hope you'll take care of me.

288
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,200
You still want to go?

289
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,200
Because of two children.

290
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Are they hostages?

291
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
I hope you will give me advice.

292
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,200
That depends on which way you go.
The border officer is my friend.

293
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,200
If I ask for something,
he will do it.

294
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,300
If you want to go secretly...

295
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Let me see.

296
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,300
It's nothing, just a cut.

297
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,300
I'm not a person who receives
without giving something in return.

298
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,200
Come tonight.

299
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,200
And if I leave tonight?

300
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,300
You won't be able to.
I'll wait for you.

301
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,200
- The wind is too strong.
- Hold it!

302
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Move the table over to hold it.

303
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,200
Open the door!

304
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,200
That bastard! I just closed it!
I won't let him in!

305
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,200
Open the door!

306
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,300
What are you knocking for?
You think it's your mum's cunt?

307
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,300
We've been knocking so long!
Why don't you open up?

308
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Three Dong Chang officials.
We have problems.

309
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Fuck you!

310
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,200
My accounts are getting all wet!
Close the door!

311
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
Close the door quickly!

312
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,200
- Mistress.
- You there!

313
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,200
- Don't you see I'm busy?
- Any nice rooms?

314
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,300
- No, we're full.
- Then tell them to leave.

315
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,300
I'm in charge here.
I can take a hundred if I like.

316
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,200
If I won't, I don't care
if you point knives at my throat!

317
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,200
- How dare you!
- And you?!

318
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,200
We are tradesmen.
Money is no problem.

319
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,200
We just want to be comfortable.

320
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,200
I also do business
and don't care about money.

321
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
You make a mess!
What am I to do?

322
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Give us an estimate of the damage,
and I'll pay three times the amount.

323
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
There still is one nice room.

324
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,300
The rain is so heavy,
I don't think we can leave.

325
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
Let's wait till it stops.

326
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,200
Bring the luggage inside.

327
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,200
I have few rooms and too many guests.
How long will you stay?

328
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,300
The weather here is unpredictable.
How long can we stay for this gold?

329
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,200
You come in this bad weather.
Have some tea.

330
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Have any strangers come
to stay here the last couple of days?

331
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,200
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Merchants always fear problems.

332
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,200
I only ask as a matter of routine.

333
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,300
Tea...

334
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,200
If there were problems,
how could I run an inn here?

335
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,200
I'm sorry.

336
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Mistress, this tea is very unusual.

337
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,300
The tea is not unusual.
But maybe the person drinking it is.

338
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Do you think Zhou Huai An
will take this route?

339
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,300
Let's find out.

340
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,200
- Xiao Hei Zi!
- Mistress?

341
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,300
- Why do you start before I tell you?
- There are shadows everywhere.

342
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,200
Look everywhere.
Look after the money box.

343
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,300
It's a mess inside. Even thieves
must watch out for thieves.

344
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,300
- What is he singing?
- He is a dazi. It's a dazi song.

345
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,300
"A pair of eyes...
can't see anything."

346
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
"Strip off your skin."

347
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
"Chop off your head
and you can't live."

348
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
They're more ruthless than us!

349
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Someone's up there.

350
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Don't bother.
When the rain stops, we leave.

351
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,200
- Who was struck by lightening?
- We're all here.

352
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Good!
Go strike your ancestors!

353
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,200
The God has eyes.

354
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,200
Where are Shao Qing
and Zhou Biao?

355
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,200
- Go and find out.
- In rain you'll leave footprints.

356
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,300
We can't leave in this rain,
and they can't, either.

357
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,300
When I get drunk, I can see you.
In my dream music brings you back.

358
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,300
When will we be able
to live peacefully?

359
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,200
How long do we have to wait?

360
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Impatience doesn't help.
It depends on the weather.

361
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,200
I can't wait.

362
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,200
When they come in,
we'll be beaten like dogs.

363
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,200
Hou Hu, you have been paid well.
We must follow our rule.

364
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,200
We are the brotherhood, who in
He Lan Mountain never met trouble.

365
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,200
We have prospered in danger.

366
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,200
This rescue mission
has been costly for us.

367
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,200
Let alone that we have
become known to the official.

368
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I'll compensate you.

369
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,300
- Dear guest, did you sleep well??
- Don't talk rubbish!

370
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Take a seat there.
Sun Zi, take care of the guests.

371
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,200
- Bring us food.
- Coming.

372
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,200
Any news of Zhou Biao
and Shao Qing?

373
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,200
It's very strange.
We haven't even seen their bodies.

374
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,200
Alive or dead, where are they?

375
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,200
- Sun Zi, serve the buns.
- Right away.

376
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,300
- No buns. We want a roasted goat.
- A roasted goat.

377
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,300
- Do you have roasted goat?
- Yes, we do.

378
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,200
A very good one.
Slaughtered last night.

379
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,300
- We want two.
- Right away.

380
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,300
They made noise all night and
are up so early! Sharpen the knife!

381
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,200
This brother is handsome.

382
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:31,300
A bright forehead, a round chin
and a face glowing with health.

383
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,200
Thank you.

384
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,200
If you don't mind,
may I read your palm?

385
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Certainly.

386
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,200
You may reach the top as an official.
For two years you've had that luck.

387
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,200
- I'm only a tradesman.
- Where?

388
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,200
Where the field is uneven,
I level it.

389
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,200
Where a tree is growing wild,
I cut it down.

390
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,300
No wonder your fortune
as an official isn't being realised.

391
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,300
I have no luck as an official.
But you must have.

392
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,200
How do you know?

393
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Who else would wear
official's boots in the desert?

394
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:25,200
Do you know something important
happened in the capital recently?

395
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,200
What happened of importance?

396
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,200
The Minister of Defence,
Lord Yang Yu Xuan, was killed.

397
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,200
Not only him,
but his entire family.

398
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Brother, do you know
who did it?

399
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,300
- I don't know.
- Really?

400
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,300
- I have no idea.
- How hot it is.

401
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,300
My lord, can you help me see
if he is lucky with women?

402
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,300
I can see in his eyes that he is.

403
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,200
The killers of Lord Yang are monsters
who eat men and spare no bones.

404
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,300
They are animals without tails!
Bastards!

405
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,200
It's so hot here!
Let's make it cooler.

406
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,300
Hi, candle girl...
Take this and buy another table.

407
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,200
That may not be enough.
Bring in food!

408
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,200
Drinking wine, passing water...

409
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,300
men in the desert
like drinking wine...

410
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,200
Brother, you are very brave.
What is your name?

411
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,200
A drifting duckweed has no roots.
A traveler need not be asked.

412
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,200
Come, let's drink to nothing.

413
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Good. I drink with you to nothing!

414
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,300
Cheers.

415
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,300
A roasted goat!

416
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,200
Mistress, where is ours?

417
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,200
They must be roasted
one at a time.

418
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,300
First come, first served!

419
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,200
Take one half each!
Diao Gui!

420
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Coming...

421
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,300
What's the matter?

422
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,300
- Cut the goat in half!
- Across the middle or lengthways?

423
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,300
- It doesn't matter. Just do it!
- Right!

424
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,200
I don't know their relationship
with this inn. Can we arrest them?

425
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,300
I don't think so.
Tonight we'll find out.

426
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,200
The rain stopped.
We can leave.

427
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,300
You're so excited.
They'll notice.

428
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,300
Now we're an open target.
The situation outside is unknown.

429
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,200
With two children
we can't run faster than them.

430
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,300
It's an inn run by brigands.
There must be a secret tunnel.

431
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,300
Let's look for it tonight.

432
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
It was too dangerous.

433
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,200
If I hadn't stopped it,
there would have been a fight.

434
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,300
Not that, it may be poisoned.
Take that.

435
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,300
What about tonight?

436
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,200
You're all fools.

437
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,200
There must be a secret tunnel.
We must find it tonight.

438
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
We're in the middle.
The room on the second floor.

439
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,200
He Hu, Tie Zhu, one takes
the left side, the other the right.

440
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,200
This room is probably a dead end,
there's only a door in front.

441
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,300
Right. I take it.

442
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
"Dong Chang identification"

443
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,300
Candle lighter!

444
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,200
Jin Xiang Yu, what are you
doing here after midnight?

445
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,200
What are youdoing here
after midnight?

446
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,200
Mind your own business!

447
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,200
This is my inn,
I'm responsible for my guests.

448
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Many already die in your inn.

449
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,200
We've known about you
a long time already.

450
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Don't make me blow out the candle.

451
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,200
- Who are you?

452
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,200
- Thieves have their way;
officials, too.

453
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,200
You go your way, I go mine.

454
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,200
- I'll use your way tonight.
- How?

455
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,200
Have you seen two children?
They are hostages.

456
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,300
- That's not my business.
- What about 1000 Liang?

457
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,200
- Will you kill them?
- You won't have to do anything.

458
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,300
I only need you to hold them here
for one night and not interfere.

459
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,300
- What do you say?
- Good...

460
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:48,300
- Your kung fu is good.
- You accept?

461
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,200
The children are frightened.

462
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,300
- Go to bed.
- Yes.

463
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,300
Take care of them.

464
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,300
- Uncle, where is Uncle Zhou?
- Don't worry...

465
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,200
It's cold outside.
You go out in the desert this late?

466
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,200
It's too hot inside.

467
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,300
I don't feel too hot.

468
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,200
I can't find the tunnel. It gets
more dangerous the longer we wait.

469
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,200
We'll fight our way out.

470
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,200
Mo Yan and I will divert
the Dong Chang.

471
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,200
Take the children and meet us
at the Dragon Gate Pass.

472
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,200
You take cover outside,
I'll take the inside of the inn.

473
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,300
Mo Yan...

474
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,200
- Come inside.
- Sister Qiu...

475
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,200
Don't worry.
We'll see that you're safe.

476
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,300
- Mo Yan...
- Huai An, see the children off.

477
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
Wait...

478
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,300
Can I have this?

479
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,300
Don't fight them.
If they want to go, just follow them.

480
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,300
It looks like they'll fight again.

481
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Go!

482
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Why is the door locked?
Don't you do business?

483
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,200
We're saved!

484
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,200
The wind is so strong today!

485
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,300
Be alert. Don't let them
get away in the throng.

486
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:36,200
On time! You bring fair weather,
you can put out the fire!

487
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,300
How can you say that
with such a wind?

488
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,200
- Where is the fire?
- The fire is burning, don't you see?

489
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,300
- Where? Where?
- Right here. Fire!

490
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,200
Don't you see it?

491
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Let them go first.

492
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,200
Who are you?
Why so many weapons?

493
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,200
- Of course, they are tradesmen.
- All of them?

494
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,200
My lord Qian Hu...

495
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,300
We are tradesmen.
These days we must carry weapons.

496
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:17,300
You look familiar.
Who are you?

497
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,300
- You there!
- My lord.

498
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,200
I think we'll watch two tigers fight.

499
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,200
- Where do you come from?
- Are you the border officer?

500
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,200
- Who are you? How dare you?
- We are...

501
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,200
We are from Dong Chang.
Our identification...

502
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,300
No one must know.

503
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,200
Damn! It's our identification.

504
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Now we'll be the thieves!

505
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,200
- Where are you headed?
- Through the pass.

506
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,300
Don't you know
the pass is closed for two days?

507
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,300
Without a personal letter from Cao,
no one can get through.

508
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,200
Right...

509
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,300
You look like that wanted man,
Zhou Huai An.

510
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,300
- Very much.
- I don't think so.

511
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,200
Look! The man on the picture
has a birthmark.

512
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,200
He hasn't!

513
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,200
No. I remember no birthmark.

514
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,200
The one over there had one.

515
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:37,300
He had one when he came,
but today it has disappeared.

516
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,200
I suspected they were the ones
wanted by the Dong Chang.

517
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,200
Take them back to the capital
and get the reward.

518
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:53,200
I am giving you a great opportunity.
You'll owe me a favour.

519
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,200
Of course.

520
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,200
You! Come here!
What are you waiting for?

521
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:04,200
The one with the mark
on the forehead!

522
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,200
Yes, you!

523
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,300
Come here!

524
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,200
You have the forehead of a thief
and the eyes of a mouse!

525
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,200
A tradesman?!
I'm not blind!

526
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,300
Careful now, stay calm.

527
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,200
Fuck! I don't like your face.

528
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,200
- Take them all to the camp.
- Yes!

529
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,200
Don't move!

530
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,200
They're all staying.

531
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,300
That officer can't control them.

532
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,300
- Mistress, warm up some wine.
- My lord, the reward is 1000 Liang.

533
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:48,200
But each of these drafts
is worth 1000 Liang.

534
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,300
I'm a reasonable man.

535
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,300
But these days the control is tight.
Even birds can't fly across.

536
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,300
Stay a few days. When the pass
is open, I'll let you through.

537
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,300
- Thank you.
- Come on.

538
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:11,300
- Zhou Huai An has disappeared.
- Lu Xiao Chuan!

539
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Master, he has been here.

540
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,300
You have a delivery.

541
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,300
It's alive! It's alive!

542
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,200
You look at me so long.
It's the first time.

543
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,300
Mistress...

544
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
Go.

545
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,300
He came from the tunnel.

546
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,300
You come from the tunnel
and look at me like that.

547
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,300
If I open more tunnels,
maybe you will do what I want?

548
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,300
You've been here a long time,
you know what I want.

549
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,200
And you know what I want.

550
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,300
I'll pay you 1000 Liang
for a way through the pass.

551
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:32,300
1000 Liang? If I wanted 1000 Liang,
I hadn't put a spot on that picture.

552
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,200
- You don't want money?
- Of course I do.

553
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,300
I want money... and you.

554
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,300
Have you been frightened?

555
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,300
The hero and the beauty
is a classical romance.

556
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,200
No man could refuse
such a beautiful thing.

557
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:02,300
But one condition.
We must have a wedding ceremony.

558
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,300
What?
Have you been frightened, too?

559
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,300
You want a kowtow to your father?
Only one night!

560
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:18,200
I'm a gentleman.
I do things like a gentleman.

561
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,300
If we have a one night romance,
someone will think I raped you.

562
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,200
Okay, we agree.
This will be your betrothal gift.

563
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,300
- Give it back!
- You get it when you touch me there.

564
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,300
If you touch me, the ceremony
won't be necessary. Come on.

565
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Okay, I'll get it back
on the wedding night.

566
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,300
My lord, we are close
to the Dragon Gate.

567
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:05,200
- Why do you need a ceremony?
- Jin's tunnel is the only way out.

568
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,300
You're the only one who believes her!
I don't trust the bitch!

569
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:15,200
You and I can be brothers.
Why can't I trust her?

570
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,200
People make deals
at The New Dragon Gate Inn.

571
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,200
It can survive in this desert.
There must be a reason.

572
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,200
We'll let the old man from Dong Chang
host the ceremony to retain him.

573
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,200
Then I'll make Jin
reveal the secret tunnel.

574
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:33,200
When you see a candle,
break the wineglass and go ahead.

575
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:38,300
Mo Yan will take the children and
force Jin to go through to the pass.

576
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,200
Mo Yan... there is no friendship
in politics or in battle.

577
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,200
A man in a bridal chamber
doesn't leave!

578
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:55,300
Right, but I won't ruin our
plan for one night's romance.

579
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,300
Just do as Zhou says.

580
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,200
Even Sister Qiu
doesn't understand you.

581
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,300
In war nothing is too deceitful.
The more confusing the better.

582
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:18,300
I don't want to see more sunrises
at the New Dragon Gate Inn.

583
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:47,300
- How is it going outside?
- It's almost ready.

584
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,199
- Has the old man accepted?
- There should be no problem.

585
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:58,199
Of course there'll be no problem...

586
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,300
If you stay, he'll accept.

587
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,199
How can I be the wedding host?

588
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,199
If you hadn't mentioned my luck
with women, I wouldn't be here.

589
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,199
You deserve it.

590
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,300
Their parents aren't here.
You're dignified with your grey hair.

591
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,199
Then I accept.

592
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:26,300
Thank you. You are all invited
to the dinner. Drink till you drop!

593
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,300
Your people don't look happy.

594
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,199
Give us a speech!

595
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,199
I, Jia, do business all year round,
and go everywhere. No family.

596
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:44,300
I never thought I would host
a wedding in this desert.

597
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,199
It's a great pleasure.

598
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,199
Why are you all standing there?
Today's a happy day.

599
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,300
Let's celebrate!

600
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:07,199
My bride, there aren't
many good men in the world.

601
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,300
Once you've got him,
make sure you keep him.

602
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,300
An able groom, a beautiful bride.
A wolf and a tiger. A perfect match.

603
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,199
Very good!
A toast for this old man.

604
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,199
- A happy day, but don't get drunk.
- On such a day, one must!

605
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,300
Don't touch wine that's not ours.
It may be poisoned.

606
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Right, I'll drink with you.

607
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,300
- Excellent!
- Get into the chamber soon.

608
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,300
Cheers!

609
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,300
Why so soon?

610
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,199
- We want to celebrate with them.
- Try to get past me.

611
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Very well.

612
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,199
Today is a happy day.
We shouldn't touch weapons.

613
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,300
- How about a drinking match?
- Bring in wine!

614
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,199
Master, don't worry.
We have more drinkers.

615
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:19,199
We have more people.
We have an advantage.

616
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,300
- These jars are diluted with water.
- How about five bowls?

617
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,199
What are you doing?

618
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,300
You've lit plenty of candles.
Don't pretend.

619
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,199
I only pretend for you.

620
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,199
Let's have a talk.

621
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,199
I hope your candle
is not just good to look at.

622
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,300
I've waited a long time.

623
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Master Si,
there's still the fifth bowl.

624
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:56,199
- Tell me about the secret tunnel.
- You're so impatient.

625
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,300
It's our wedding night.
Have you brought your stuff?

626
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,300
Where is my flute?

627
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:14,300
- Bald guy, I drink with you.
- I'll drink one jar with you.

628
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
You're useless!
Take him away.

629
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,300
Come on.

630
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:05,300
- Be careful.
- Come, sister.

631
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Sit down.

632
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,300
I've brought you some fruit.

633
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,199
Thank you.

634
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
Thank you.

635
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,300
- Is it good?
- Yes.

636
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,199
The moon's very round tonight.

637
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:38,199
Sister, why is the moon
so different from back home?

638
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:42,300
Mum said the moon is round at home.
Here it's not as good as at home.

639
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,199
But now we have nothing at home.

640
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,300
We sit safely and look at the moon.
The God is treating us well.

641
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,300
Is my place good?

642
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,300
- Of course. You give us fruit.
- Eat it.

643
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,199
Xiao Chuan...

644
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:05,300
We should watch them all closely.
Don't let them escape.

645
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:10,300
Be alert.
Act with caution.

646
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,199
Help me get out.

647
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,300
All right, but not tonight.

648
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,300
This is our only chance.
I must get out tonight.

649
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:29,300
Listen, once you're in my chamber,
there's nothing you can do.

650
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,300
When I say I'll go, I'll go.

651
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,199
Jin Xiang Yu, if you help me,
I'll come back. Then we'll be even.

652
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,300
Haven't you taken
advantage of me enough?

653
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,300
Master Jia,
Cao's troops will arrive soon.

654
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,199
Sister, this is not water, but wine.

655
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,300
Leave me alone,
just watch for the signal upstairs.

656
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,300
- They must be really doing it.
- That doesn't concern us.

657
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:33,199
You seem okay.
Watch more carefully.

658
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,300
- Don't even go out to pass water!
- Yes, yes.

659
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,199
Jin's chamber has a secret tunnel.
Zhou will escape through it tonight.

660
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,300
I knew it was a trick.
No one will escape!

661
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,199
Let's use a trick to get in
and find out what happens.

662
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,300
A trick... Good idea.

663
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,300
- Where is the tunnel??
- In my body!

664
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,199
- Not difficult to find.
- Try!

665
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,199
- Mistress, open up!
- Who's that?

666
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,199
Open up!

667
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,300
What is it?

668
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:17,300
One of my men is wounded.
Have you got any medication?

669
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,300
What's the matter?

670
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,199
What is it?

671
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,300
My man got a wound in his head.
Do you have some medication?

672
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,199
Tonight is my wedding night.
What is more urgent?

673
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,300
- Get something for a wound!
- Wait. Come here.

674
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,300
- This way...
- What for?

675
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,300
You won't get away!

676
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,300
Why so impatient?
Wait till after tonight.

677
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,199
Don't spoil it for me.

678
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,199
- I fear you'll spoil it for me!
- What do you mean?

679
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:11,300
I know Zhou is planning
to escape through your tunnel.

680
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:19,300
He can pay for it and take me along!
What can you do?

681
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,300
Just give me a price!

682
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,199
- 100.000 Liang.
- Money is no problem.

683
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,199
If you cooperate,
anything is possible.

684
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,300
- Pay the money, I hand over the man.
- Watch out. You may lose both.

685
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,199
- Are you all coming back?
- Two more wounded?

686
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,199
If you use my medication,
you'll have to pay me more.

687
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,199
Did you conclude your deal outside?

688
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,300
You still owe me a debt.

689
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,300
You can't run away.

690
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,199
- Brother He, have another drink.
- Yes, drink!

691
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,199
Drink your father's dick!
I'm going for a pee!

692
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:28,199
Right.
I also have to go!

693
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,300
You go first!

694
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,300
The candle was blown out!

695
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,300
Vixen!

696
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:49,300
- That's not the signal!
- He already forgot our mission.

697
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,300
That's just for defense!
It's nothing, let's drink!

698
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,300
They're ready for fighting,
so let's fight!

699
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,300
Catch him!

700
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,300
Take it!

701
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,300
Take the baskets!

702
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,300
Don't be tricked.
Our target is Zhou.

703
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:20,199
Don't wait for Zhou.
We'll fight our way to Dragon Gate.

704
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,300
- Where's Uncle Zhou?
- Don't ask.

705
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,300
- Let me go!
- I know I can light this candle!

706
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,199
Follow them!

707
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:41,199
- I won't let you go!
- You're Dong Chang's pawn!

708
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,300
Zhou Huai An!
Fuck you!

709
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,300
You scum!

710
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,300
Zhou Huai An, stay!

711
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:05,199
Hei Zi...
Who started the fight?

712
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,199
Not us...
The grey-haired old man.

713
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,300
The old bastard...
Hei Zi...

714
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,300
Damn you!

715
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,300
- Jin Xiang Yu, you took our money.
- I'll keep it for your coffin!

716
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,300
There's a desert storm coming!

717
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,300
It's not the wind, it's the troops.
Why so soon?

718
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,300
Let's spread out and go.

719
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,300
Cao's black flag riders!

720
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,300
I'm on your side!

721
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,300
I'm on your side!

722
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,300
Tie Zhu! He Hu!
Ye Ye! Jin Bao!

723
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,199
- Sister! I'm here!
- Where is Jin Bao?

724
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,300
- Sister!
- I'll take care of you.

725
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,300
Are you mad?

726
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,300
Xiao Chuan!

727
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:52,300
You two bastards!
You bloodsuckers!

728
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,300
I'll let you drink your own blood!

729
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,300
- Sister...
- Mo Yan!

730
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,199
Mo Yan! Are you all right?

731
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,300
- Cao is here!
- Cao? Mo Yan!

732
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,199
She's unconscious.
It's no use calling her.

733
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,300
Come into my chamber, quick!

734
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:48,300
Diao Gui! Tell the border officer
I'm in trouble.

735
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:45,300
Something for the wound.

736
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,300
We've gone through
much hardship and survived.

737
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,199
All because of this uncertain world.

738
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:09,300
I don't know
if we'll survive this time.

739
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:21,300
- Mo Yan...
- I shouldn't have doubted you.

740
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,300
The flute...

741
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,199
...I didn't mean to give it to Jin.

742
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,199
I didn't know I hurt you,
but now I can explain.

743
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,199
They say that in troubled times
one shouldn't fall in love...

744
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,199
...but love in troubled times
is deeper.

745
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,300
Do you think we can't
find the flute again?

746
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,300
That's just a material thing.

747
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:55,300
It can't compare with our love
at this moment.

748
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,199
Shit!

749
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,199
Are you still here, vixen?

750
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,300
It's my inn. Why should I go?

751
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,199
I forgot. Like the desert,
you have no human feeling at all.

752
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,300
Neither do you. You think
of yourself, but no one else!

753
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,199
- That's why you run a brigands' inn?
- You guests!

754
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,199
You take what you want and leave!

755
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,300
No feelings!

756
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,199
- Who is there?
- Diao Gui, are the troops here?

757
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,199
- No. The border's closed.
- The bastard has no heart!

758
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,199
When I'm through with those people,
I'll teach him a lesson!

759
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,300
Why do you come back?
Don't you want to leave?

760
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:14,300
I never thought the last person
to stay with me would be a dazi.

761
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,300
They're moving in.

762
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,300
Diao Gui, take the tunnel.
Get out of the inn now!

763
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,300
Damn you!

764
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,300
I'll help you.

765
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,300
Let's go.

766
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,300
Your flute. I don't want
other people's things.

767
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,300
Mo Yan, you go first.

768
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,300
Hold on.

769
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,300
- Come on!
- Go!

770
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,300
Someone up there?

771
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,300
Take these!

772
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,300
Take cover!

773
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:48,199
Jin Xiang Yu,
take the children through the pass!

774
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,300
Go to the border and wait for me!

775
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,300
Block his way.

776
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,199
How dare you support Yang?

777
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,300
I'll teach you to defy me!

778
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:05,300
We stand together.
You are alone!

779
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,300
Just come on!

780
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,300
We are sinking in the sand.

781
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,300
- What do we do?
- Don't move.

782
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,300
Die!

783
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,300
Mo Yan!

784
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,300
Mo Yan!

785
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,300
I'll get you out.

786
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,300
Mo Yan!

787
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:42,300
Mo Yan!

788
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,300
Die!

789
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,300
Watch out!

790
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,300
You'll be all right! You have
to take the children through!

791
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:30,300
No one defies me!
You have chosen your own death!

792
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,300
Get him!

793
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,300
My leg!

794
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,300
My hand!

795
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,300
The sword!
Move me over there!

796
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,300
Zhou Huai An!
Is he...?

797
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:27,300
Mo Yan... Mo Yan...

798
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,199
Will you come back
to the Dragon Gate Inn?

799
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:08,300
When the next group of guests come,
you'll have forgotten me.

800
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,199
I don't have your courage
to face this desert.

801
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:16,300
I'll go through the pass.

802
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,199
Dragon Gate Inn...

803
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,300
Take the wine...

804
01:38:10,300 --> 00:00:01,300
We'll leave this evil place.
Let's find Zhou Huai An.
