SHIM Eun-Ha

3
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:48,178
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

4
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,608
Attention!... At ease!

5
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,852
Attention! Bow to the principal!

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,387
At the start of this new school year,

7
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,229
I hope you all have new resolutions...

8
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:22,363
Dr Kim to the Outpatients Clinic, please.

9
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,596
When I was a kid...

10
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,592
...I always sat alone in the playground

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,104
after the other boys had gone,

12
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,941
...thinking about my late mother

13
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,976
It struck me that

14
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,809
we'd all disappear in the end...

15
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,108
...my father, my sister,

16
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,048
all my best friends.

17
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,597
Can I help you?

18
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,065
My photos should be ready...

19
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,866
- The name is...?
- Choi Myung-Suk

20
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,663
You took them two days ago.

21
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,174
Here they are.

22
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,186
Sorry... it's not a very good likeness...

23
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,078
Let me just fix your hair a little.

24
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,116
That's much better.

25
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,455
Just a touch higher on this side.

26
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,889
It's all right as it is.

27
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,498
Okay? Then we'll take one.

28
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,638
Look straight at the camera...

29
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,542
One, two...

30
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,255
Hello? Chul-Ku?

31
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,695
Your father has died?

32
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,863
CREMATORIUM

33
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,042
Please try to regain your composure!

34
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,976
He has passed on, but we must carry on!

35
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:21,885
Please help yourselves to some food.

36
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,082
This way! Lunch is served.

37
00:05:54,053 --> 00:06:04,429
CHOWON PHOTO STUDIO

38
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:16,302
"CLOSED"

39
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,559
I've been waiting for ages!

40
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,258
Can you print this for me urgently?

41
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,796
How long will it take?

42
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,833
I'm sorry, can you come back later?

43
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,609
No, it's very urgent! I need an

44
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,773
enlargement of the bit I've circled

45
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,533
Did I upset you?

46
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:38,778
Sorry, I've had a very hard morning.

47
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,749
Is the enlargement ready?

48
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,682
Give me must a few moments more.

49
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,997
Dad, the potatoes are ready.

50
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,290
Put them in the pot.

51
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,470
- Jung-won...
- What?

52
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,665
Bring me the green onions, will you?

53
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,869
- The green onions?
- Yes!

54
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,204
How much do you want, sir?

55
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:08,932
Fill it up, please.

56
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,030
Right you are, sir.

57
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,776
Welcome!

58
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,250
Hi! Good morning!

59
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,381
It's full, sir.

60
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,282
- How much?
- That'll be $2.

61
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,385
Here you are.

62
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,224
Thank you, sir.

63
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,594
How much miss?

64
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,632
Fill it up, please.

65
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,797
Mister, isn't she the cutest one?

66
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,934
- Who?
- Her? She's short and fat!

67
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,170
Mine's prettier!

68
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,680
Get real! Look at mine!

69
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,010
Boys! Calm down!

70
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,379
Chan-Kun, which is your favorite?

71
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,413
I have several.

72
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,616
Really? Which ones?

73
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,053
This one, this one and this one.

74
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,751
- Three?
- She's the best one.

75
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,057
This one? What's her name?

76
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,292
Seo Eun-Ji! She's the best!

77
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,726
She's mine! Hands off!

78
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,372
Boys... have you spoken to these girls?

79
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,371
- Not yet.
- Never?

80
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,972
If I enlarge this, it won't come out very sharp.

81
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,137
That's all right

82
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,010
Sure? Okay, then come back tomorrow...

83
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,584
say around six.

84
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,946
They'll be ready then.

85
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,645
Please take special care, mister!

86
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,213
Don't worry about it!

87
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,049
Bye for now, mister.

88
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,058
Bye.

89
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,055
Men and boys, you're are all the same,

90
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,429
always chasing girls...

91
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,234
What's wrong with that? It's natural!

92
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,806
Anyway, better than bringing in pin-ups.

93
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,434
You enlarge those too?

94
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,944
Yours is a porker.

95
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,914
Well, yours is ugly.

96
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,577
Boys, stop fighting!

97
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,550
It's been a really long time...

98
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,280
Yes, it has.

99
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,556
You're back now?

100
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,384
Yes.

101
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,090
You haven't changed at all.

102
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,501
- Neither have you.
- Who? Me?

103
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,969
Well... bye for now.

104
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,574
OK.

105
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,215
Bye...

106
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,569
Hi, Brother!

107
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,709
When did you get back?

108
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,939
Just now... What's that?

109
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,809
I bought some radishes.

110
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,721
The red one is radish kimchi,

111
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,746
it goes in the fridge.

112
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,116
The white one is cabbage kimchi,

113
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,817
it's not fermented yet.

114
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,196
I ran into Ji-Won this afternoon.

115
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,767
She told me she met you.

116
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,940
I feel very sorry for her.

117
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,444
Her husband started gambling again.

118
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,610
He's even violent sometimes.

119
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,378
How are things at work?

120
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,488
Busy... but it's still hard

121
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,387
to pay all the salaries.

122
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,191
You still haven't got over Ji-won?

123
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,903
Remember our days in primary school?

124
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,631
You kept her picture

125
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,902
in your exercise book.

126
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,769
I only just stopped here!

127
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,337
You want to fine me again?!

128
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,541
Yes, if you keep parking here!

129
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,981
Please move your car!

130
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,786
This is a no-parking zone!

131
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,160
Can I help you?

132
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,864
Can you fix my camera?

133
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,206
Sure

134
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,905
How much is the camera you use?

135
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,343
Why do you ask?

136
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,446
Just curious...

137
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,022
People would take me more seriously

138
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,058
if I had a big one like that.

139
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,661
Mind if I take a rest here?

140
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,131
No problem.

141
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm fed up with this heat!

142
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,938
Exhausting, isn't it?

143
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,584
You're a Leo, right?

144
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,522
Born in August?

145
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,894
Leos are supposed to be

146
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,662
compatible with me.

147
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,032
By the way, how old are you?

148
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,603
Me? I'm... late twenties.

149
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,542
That means thirty-something!

150
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,012
Middle-aged!

151
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,845
You're still single, right?

152
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,285
Wrong! I have two kids.

153
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,723
You're lying!

154
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,298
I can tell from your clothes!

155
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,262
I'll take a short nap...

156
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,398
Please don't talk to me.

157
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,722
- By the way...
- What?

158
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,661
How come you're so fresh with me today?

159
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,747
Dad, how come your stew

160
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,544
always tastes so good?

161
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,353
Mine is never this good.

162
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,579
Me neither.

163
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,347
It takes time and effort.

164
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,791
She's a good wife but a terrible cook...

165
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,622
Just like her mother!

166
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,063
You mean my daughter won't

167
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,395
be a good cook either?

168
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:57,933
Right!

169
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,202
Brother, call me after you've

170
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,765
seen the doctor tomorrow.

171
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,769
I'll be all right, don't worry.

172
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,385
Take care of Chong-Rae,

173
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,244
she should eat less sugar.

174
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,223
Dad, shall I take it?

175
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,590
I was a professional too, don't forget.

176
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,787
One, two...

177
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,587
Hi, where are you off to?

178
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,789
The district office.

179
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,490
What's that?

180
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,593
Going to give me a hand?

181
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,437
Since you're my best customer...

182
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,904
It's quite heavy!

183
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,574
Get on.

184
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,959
No boyfriend?

185
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,990
No, not interested. They are all boring.

186
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,027
You'll change your mind when

187
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,629
you meet a nice one.

188
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,375
Maybe...

189
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,907
Okay, hold tight!

190
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,525
Hello...

191
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,332
Ji-Won!

192
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,571
Cleaning up?

193
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,997
Yes...

194
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,475
Wait for me inside.

195
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,576
Ji-Won...

196
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:57,245
You remember our school days?

197
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,822
I used to copy your diary...

198
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,288
And we had a big fight when I found out.

199
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,090
You've been here for

200
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,665
more than twenty years!

201
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,700
Not bored with it yet?

202
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,897
Well, I don't know...

203
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,044
Why didn't you marry?

204
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,606
I was waiting for you!

205
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,020
You have two kids?

206
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,958
Yes...

207
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,863
I didn't expect to come back.

208
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,341
I heard you're very ill.

209
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,646
No, no, not at all.

210
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,618
It's really serious?

211
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,557
I'm all right! I'll be fine!

212
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,844
Time changes us so much.

213
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,920
After some more awkward small talk...

214
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,088
Ji-Won asked me to remove

215
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,256
her picture from the display.

216
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,799
I suppose all things must pass,

217
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,235
including 'Iove'...

218
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,876
Mr. Yoo Jung-Won,

219
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,752
please come to the MRI Room.

220
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:15,898
Where are you going?

221
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,238
I have to take some pictures.

222
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,711
So what can I do?

223
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,475
This is terribly urgent!

224
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,197
Tastes good?

225
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,106
No, no... I've had enough.

226
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,999
- Go on! Have some more!
- No, no...

227
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,252
You're the only son, right?

228
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,716
What makes you think so?

229
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,913
I can tell from the way you eat.

230
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,155
When we had ice-cream at home,

231
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,857
there was always a riot.

232
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,765
Go ahead, you first.

233
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,167
Many brothers and sisters?

234
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,733
How many?

235
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,839
I don't know why Mom had so many.

236
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,881
Look...

237
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,451
Drawing a line like this would

238
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,023
always start a fight.

239
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,128
It was a real drag.

240
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,245
Damn traffic cops!

241
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,516
Get lost!

242
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,652
You're killing my business!

243
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,089
We want some lunch!

244
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,097
No way. You're not eating here!

245
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,569
Looks like no restaurant will have us.

246
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,377
Hi, what are you doing there?

247
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,138
Just enjoying the shade...

248
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,524
Where have you been?

249
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,824
At the market.

250
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,393
You?

251
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,103
Yes, I like cooking.

252
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:05,635
Let's see... noodles... and spinach?

253
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,877
You can cook all this?

254
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,171
Why not?

255
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,817
I must go.

256
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,044
- Back home?
- Yes.

257
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,978
Take care!

258
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,974
Excuse me!

259
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,906
What are you doing?

260
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,741
- Finished work?
- Yes.

261
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,620
Could you have these ready by tomorrow?

262
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,748
Sure.

263
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,818
She's shattered... we had a lousy day.

264
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,528
- See you!
- See you!

265
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,706
It's been ages since we drank together.

266
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,070
Really!

267
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,188
Remember that girl you chased?

268
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,954
The butcher's daughter?

269
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,021
Yeah, the one who dragged you

270
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,590
onto presidential campaign rallies!

271
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,344
Hard to believe that was only

272
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,812
ten years ago...

273
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,685
One more bottle, please!

274
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,546
There's no mistake in the check!

275
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,060
Chul-Ku, buy me one more drink!

276
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,625
No way. I'm a reformed character!

277
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,969
A quick one in that little bar!

278
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,366
Hey, you're already drunk.

279
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,446
Remember what you said

280
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,674
just before we turned thirty?

281
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,315
Who, me?

282
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,251
Don't remember.

283
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,019
No?

284
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,051
What's with you tonight?

285
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,153
"Drink till we die!"

286
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,558
Jung-won, where are you going?

287
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,097
Hey, man!

288
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,608
Man, what's wrong with you?

289
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,612
Something's bugging you, right?

290
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,882
That's why you want to get drunk?

291
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,179
Lay off!

292
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,125
Tell me what's wrong.

293
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,226
Shit, why can't I pee?

294
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,757
I was really bursting just now...

295
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,366
What's the matter?

296
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,841
I'm going to die soon.

297
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,340
What? That's crap!

298
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,610
You just want another drink!

299
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,119
Okay, okay.

300
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,785
- Really?
- Come on!

301
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,899
"Drink till we die!"

302
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,033
Finally, I joked about the truth.

303
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,267
But I wondered how many days.

304
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,040
I had left...

305
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,172
...to hang out with him, drinking

306
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,379
and laughing like we always used to.

307
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:50,823
Where did this happen?

308
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,624
In front of the phone booth.

309
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,388
Why?

310
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,260
He started it because

311
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,229
I was using the phone...

312
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,560
So you didn't do anything to him?

313
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,429
No

314
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,926
Please wait over there.

315
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,004
I'm the chauffeur

316
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,198
for the Democratic Party.

317
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,603
That party's over! Wait over there!

318
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,705
He kicked me...

319
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,312
What happened was...

320
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,642
All right, all of you wait over there!

321
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,345
- You look like shit!
- Fuck you!

322
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,665
Shut up!

323
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,866
All of you, shut up!

324
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,003
Why the bloody hell should I shut up?

325
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,073
Why the fuck should I shut up?

326
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,775
Jung-Won! Calm down!

327
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,138
Calm down! Jung-Won, calm down!

328
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,911
Quiet!

329
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,552
Why should I shut up?

330
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,851
Hello?

331
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,054
Chul-Ku?

332
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,642
Police box? I don't remember...

333
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,239
yes, that little bar...

334
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,211
Did I really?

335
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,957
And the girl traffic cop?

336
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,526
No, I'll be fine. I'll call you later.

337
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,782
Concord, licence number 2587,

338
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,449
please remove your vehicle!

339
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,262
Excell, licence number 8731,

340
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,729
remove your vehicle.

341
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,629
This is a no-parking zone!

342
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,854
What are you doing?

343
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,425
What... are... you... doing?

344
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,205
May I come in?

345
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,943
May... I...come... in?

346
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,349
OK

347
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:55,968
Why are you smiling at me?

348
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,740
What did you do before you

349
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,074
became a traffic cop?

350
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,414
I just hung around at home.

351
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,189
How come you never married?

352
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,220
Marry? I guess I was too busy.

353
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,365
It's hot.

354
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,691
I see

355
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,772
You like your job? Isn't it hard?

356
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,942
So so.

357
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,051
How is your life?

358
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,231
You know, nothing special.

359
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,466
I got paid today!

360
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,103
So you're going to treat me?

361
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,411
Maybe... depends on you

362
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,405
Darim, let's see now...

363
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,306
Why don't you moisten our lips?

364
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,404
Just a bit more...

365
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:49,715
Good!

366
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,286
Just a moment

367
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,279
Madam, you prefer to keep

368
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,221
your glasses on or to take them off?

369
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,693
Yes, your glasses... which do you prefer?

370
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,727
My glasses? Take them off?

371
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,171
Let me see... as you prefer.

372
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,635
My son bought them for me,

373
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,573
so I'd rather keep them on.

374
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,104
Everybody ready?

375
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,386
Big smiles, please

376
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,052
Smile when I count...

377
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,083
One, two...

378
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,452
Yes!

379
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,224
Perfect!

380
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,125
Thank you!

381
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,028
Mother, since we're here,

382
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,834
why not have your portrait taken?

383
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,674
Maybe later...

384
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,608
No, please let's do it now.

385
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,849
Go ahead.

386
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,262
Just a moment.

387
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,727
So you've bought a new house!

388
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:14,923
Wasn't it expensive?

389
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,489
We want to move too,

390
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,727
But it's hard to find a nice flat...

391
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,201
How much was it, honey?

392
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,538
What a surprise!

393
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,275
Darim!

394
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,503
What are you doing here?

395
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,375
Getting my scooter repaired

396
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,812
Great, can I share your umbrella?

397
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,044
For free?

398
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,618
How can I repay you?

399
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,349
I could come by later and

400
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,189
you could buy me a drink.

401
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,332
- It's a deal!
- Promise?

402
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,995
What time?

403
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,507
7 or 7:30, okay?

404
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,715
"...the street-lamps are lit

405
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,326
as darkness falls..."

406
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,874
Madam!

407
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,946
The photo isn't ready yet...

408
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,082
The one we took this afternoon...

409
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,055
You want to take another?

410
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,823
Can I?

411
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,089
Of course you can

412
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,668
And you won't charge me?

413
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,560
Absolutely not, ma'am!

414
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,333
Thank you, young man.

415
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,635
- This way please.
- Over there?

416
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,952
I'm ready, Madam.

417
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,457
If you'll come this way...

418
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,456
This has to look good.

419
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,732
May I ask why?

420
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,165
It'll be my memorial portrait.

421
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,597
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll do my best.

422
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,609
You must have been very

423
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,345
charming when you were young.

424
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,544
You really think so?

425
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,723
I think we're ready now.

426
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,034
Would you mind taking off your glasses?

427
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,103
You look much better without them!

428
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,108
So... Iook at me

429
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,070
A little to the right.

430
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:03,648
Now, would you smile a bit?

431
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,382
Good.

432
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:10,118
A little to the right, and smile...

433
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,629
One, two...

434
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,063
Just a moment...

435
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,667
I'll do one more.

436
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,993
Were you upset that I didn't come?

437
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,599
Why didn't you?

438
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,571
Just didn't feel like it.

439
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,778
I have to go to work... Bye!

440
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,751
Did Chul-Ku call you?

441
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,446
He said he'd never see me again

442
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,048
If I didn't come!

443
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,820
I was going to call you too...

444
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,561
Yeah, it's been too long.

445
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:55,701
Is the food ready yet? Coming!

446
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,439
Fussy, as ever... Coming up!

447
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,812
I win!

448
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,715
(It's void!) Have some first...

449
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,322
What the fuck!

450
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:18,223
Screw You! I'm on a winning streak!

451
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,660
- Try them!
- Not now!

452
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:26,694
Such an ass since primary school!

453
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,766
Try the potatoes!

454
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,205
Fuck the potatoes!

455
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,940
Messed up again?

456
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,482
Such a jerk...

457
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,365
Let's take one more, okay?

458
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,567
Jung-Won!

459
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,962
Yes, Father...

460
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,871
Can you put this tape on for me?

461
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,039
Did you rent it?

462
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,014
It's From Here to Eternity.

463
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:25,316
I saw this with your mother.

464
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,398
Dad, try to do it yourself this time.

465
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,301
I'll show you.

466
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,906
Put the tape in,

467
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,949
it starts running automatically.

468
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,109
Turn on the TV...

469
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,618
Press this 'TV' button, and then

470
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,522
select Channel 4...

471
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,522
Please try it for yourself.

472
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,034
No, Father!

473
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:19,401
First turn the power on, then press

474
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,339
'TV', then select Channel 4...

475
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,414
Switch it on...

476
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,353
No, Father!

477
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,824
Power on, press 'TV',

478
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,488
then select Channel 4!

479
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,430
Isn't this video?

480
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:52,030
No! Power on, press 'TV'.

481
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,474
and then set it to '4'!

482
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:55,902
Try again.

483
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,319
Press!

484
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,375
"1: Put the tape in the machine,

485
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,850
turn the power on."

486
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,553
"2: press..."

487
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,543
Hello!

488
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,486
All right?

489
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,449
You have a bout coming up?

490
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,325
What pose would you like?

491
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,126
I don't think you should smile...

492
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,435
One, two...

493
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,435
Good evening...

494
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,146
You're wearing make-up!

495
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,119
Yes.

496
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:00,325
You look nice, really pretty!

497
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,767
Can I get you some coffee?

498
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,935
Ah! Ice cream!

499
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,081
Where are you going?

500
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,087
Darim, how do you spend your weekends?

501
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:36,020
Reading... Iounging around...

502
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,934
How about you?

503
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,499
Me?

504
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,436
Mostly sleeping!

505
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,374
All day?

506
01:00:54,817 --> 01:01:00,847
No. I do some laundry, and ironing,

507
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:07,321
then have another nap...

508
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,936
My friend works every Sunday.

509
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,071
What does she do?

510
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,512
Didn't I tell you?

511
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,812
She works in Seoul Land Amusement Park.

512
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,815
She's promised me free tickets...

513
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,858
And...?

514
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,527
That's all.

515
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,506
I want to go there sometime,

516
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,567
but I always seem to be too busy...

517
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,742
Feeling better? Got over the dizziness?

518
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,687
Drink...

519
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,534
Call that running?

520
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,990
Darim! Let me catch up!

521
01:03:56,899 --> 01:04:00,357
PUBLIC BATH

522
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,011
Out already!

523
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,749
Men are so quick in the bath!

524
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,326
Want one?

525
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,684
Mandarin oranges?

526
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,826
You bought only one? Or two?

527
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,929
Two

528
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,604
Where are you going?

529
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,277
To buy some more!

530
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,751
This is the true story from the

531
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,186
time I did military service.

532
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,487
I was on duty here with my junior

533
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,155
and there was this terrible smell.

534
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,493
I asked him if he'd farted,

535
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,760
and he denied it.

536
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,633
He even suggested that I farted

537
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,174
and tried to blame me!

538
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,033
We squabbled about it

539
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:18,239
until we got back to barracks.

540
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:24,512
I was about to go to sleep, and...

541
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,523
And what?

542
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:34,156
I was about to drop off, and...

543
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,858
He swore it wasn't him,

544
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,427
and I knew it wasn't me...

545
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:43,334
Later we found out that a boy

546
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:48,309
killed himself on that very spot...

547
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,039
...because his girlfriend died.

548
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,742
And that boy was always farting!

549
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,742
- Funny!
- Funny?

550
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,184
A bit scary, though.

551
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,815
I won't dare to walk alone here again!

552
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,158
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

553
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,429
You smelled a ghost fart!

554
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:14,201
Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.

555
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,031
People die and become ghosts,

556
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,303
It's natural! Maybe you and I...

557
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:25,437
I suppose it makes sense

558
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,349
Are you sure that ghost fart?

559
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:32,779
Maybe, maybe not...

560
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,549
Strange...

561
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:48,133
GENERAL HOSPITAL

562
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:25,340
"How to operate the DP machine?"

563
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:07,028
Is the rent very high here?

564
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,830
Not that high.

565
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,299
Planning to move out?

566
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:19,012
I can't afford to!

567
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:22,473
I'm tired... let's go to sleep.

568
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,722
I'll tell you a ghost story.

569
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,857
No way! I hate scary stories!

570
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,365
It isn't scary...

571
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,736
At least, I don't have to tell it

572
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,897
in a scary way. Listen...

573
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:53,509
There was this guy in the army,

574
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,608
standing guard with his junior...

575
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:01,554
And they suddenly smelt something bad.

576
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,655
So he turned to his junior and asked...

577
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,157
"You let out a fart, didn't you?"

578
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:14,091
And the junior said "No, sir. I didn't".

579
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,038
So this guy...

580
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,375
His shoes...

581
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,275
Careful...

582
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:32,851
Wait...

583
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,683
Be careful!

584
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,120
Dad, I'll call you from the hospital!

585
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,139
They're moving you to

586
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,406
another district next week?

587
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,478
Yes.

588
01:11:58,747 --> 01:11:59,771
Whereabouts?

589
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,407
No idea.

590
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,621
May I join you?

591
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,814
Sure.

592
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,519
Are you transferring with Darim?

593
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,223
Not this time.

594
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,294
Then we should all have a farewell drink!

595
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,596
Sounds good to me.

596
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,167
I wonder where we'll end up this time...

597
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,045
Can you wait here for just a moment?

598
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,366
Finished?

599
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,254
Pass me some water.

600
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,329
Awake?

601
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,257
Are you in pain?

602
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,602
You've been dreaming?

603
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,777
Had a sweet dream?

604
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,860
How come you have no women visitors?

605
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,821
Isn't there someone you want to see?

606
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,197
No. I'm fine.

607
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,769
There's no one I miss.

608
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:56,842
"To: Miss Kim Darim.

609
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,208
From: Yoo Jung-Won."

610
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:39,443
I always knew that

611
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,846
feelings of love would fade...

612
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,453
just like old photographs.

613
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:49,621
But for you,

614
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:52,189
you will always remain in my heart.

615
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:56,590
as you are in my last moment.

616
01:33:57,765 --> 01:34:00,029
Thank you and goodbye...
