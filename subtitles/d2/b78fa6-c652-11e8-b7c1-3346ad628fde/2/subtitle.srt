1
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:15,087
Haul in that line or it'll foul us.

2
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,423
Start the engine.

3
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:22,636
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna make a phone call.

4
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,812
Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?

5
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:35,357
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you read me?

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,943
Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...

7
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,576
Excuse me, Chief.

8
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,706
That's great. That's just great.
Now, where the hell are we?

9
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,586
You're certifiable, Quint.
You know that? You're certifiable.

10
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:59,840
- You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!
- Boys.

11
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,511
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.

12
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,431
Hook me up another barrel.

13
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:39,963
Bring her around after him.

14
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,232
Full throttle.
Get me right up alongside of him.

15
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:02,610
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not gonna take it.

16
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,130
Five degrees port.

17
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:31,055
All right, hold your course.

18
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,230
Five degrees port now.

19
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,151
Hold your course.

20
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,822
- Fast fish.
- Watch my hand.

21
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,785
Be sure you watch my hand.
Follow me. Follow me.

22
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:56,956
Lad, you watch him now.
Starboard. Starboard.

23
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,375
Run him down.

24
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,551
Hard apart.

25
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:13,138
Watch him.

26
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,390
Starboard.

27
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:42,167
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

28
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,049
It's incredible.

29
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:57,224
- They're up again!
- Now what?

30
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:10,529
Why don't we lead the shark into shore
instead of him leading us out to sea?

31
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:16,827
Grab a couple of poles.

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,248
Hang on now, we're going around.

33
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:24,417
Into starboard. Easy.

34
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:29,005
I'm gonna back her off now.
Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.

35
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,054
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

36
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,104
Now then tie them to the stern cleats.

37
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,734
Brody, bring your end around the cleat.

38
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,947
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

39
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,534
Stay clear of the line.

40
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,377
Watch it. Stand clear.

41
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,098
Stand away from those stern cleats.

42
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,154
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

43
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:38,574
He gonna have a heart attack
when he sees what I brought him.

44
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,626
Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.

45
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,464
My God, this one, too. They're both going.

46
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:58,135
- He's eating his way through that line.
- He's working his way right up to us.

47
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,222
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

48
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:04,433
Out of my way.

49
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:10,731
Watch it.

50
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,363
Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.

51
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,534
Make it fast.

52
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,496
I can't. It's trying to run.

53
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,376
Pull, you son of a bitch!

54
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,297
Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.

55
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,472
It's impossible!

56
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,032
We're breaking up! Cut it!

57
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,910
Watch your hands!

58
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:07,996
Cut it quick. I can't hold it!

59
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,728
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

60
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,980
Not with three barrels, he can't.

61
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,732
What about us?

62
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,278
Get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

63
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:41,905
We're gonna sink, aren't we?

64
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:44,741
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

65
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:52,957
Starting to go under.

66
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,628
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

67
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:33,623
You ever have one do this before?

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,043
No.

69
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,826
He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.

70
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,001
I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.

71
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:23,005
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.

72
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:25,841
- We're headin' in, Brody.
- Thank Christ!

73
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:36,143
- You ever had a great white do that?
- No.

74
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,193
How far do we have to go?

75
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,656
Don't put that much pressure on it.

76
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,544
- Goddamn it.
- Shut up. Get back there.

77
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,259
Hold on.

78
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:29,029
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

79
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:36,828
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

80
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,459
"For we received order
for to sail back to Boston"

81
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:46,338
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.

82
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:51,426
All right stop the boat. Stop the boat.
Stop it.

83
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:34,194
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

84
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:42,494
I think I can pump 20 ccm
of strychnine nitrate into him.

85
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,747
If I can get close enough.

86
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,169
Get this little needle through his skin?

87
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,672
No, I can't do that.

88
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,218
If I can get him close to the cage,
I can get him in the mouth.

89
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:02,181
- That shark'll rip that cage to pieces.
- You got any better suggestions?

90
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:29,166
Easy.

91
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:32,878
Up she goes.

92
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,392
Ain't got no spit.

93
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,243
Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.

94
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,664
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

95
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:51,676
Bring him up, goddamn it.
Bring him up now!

96
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,016
Pull it up. Pull it.

97
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,737
Come on, Quint, bring him in.

98
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,283
It's giving way.

99
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,172
Rig something!

100
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,635
Got it?

101
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:39,807
It's comin'.

102
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:43,394
Slower.

103
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:00,005
Show me the tank.

104
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:19,441
Blow up!

105
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,655
Smile, you son of a bitch!

106
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,078
Quint?

107
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,413
No.

108
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,549
Can we get in on those?

109
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:16,724
What day is this?

110
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,520
It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think.

111
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:25,024
I think the tide's with us.

112
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,401
Keep kicking.

113
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,573
I used to hate the water.

114
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,702
I can't imagine why.
