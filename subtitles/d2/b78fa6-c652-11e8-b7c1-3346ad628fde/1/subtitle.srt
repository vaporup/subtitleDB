1
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:32,325
- What's your name again?
- Chrissy.

2
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,495
- Where are we goin'?
- Swimming.

3
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:41,501
Slow up. Slow down some.

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,129
I'm not drunk. Slow down.

5
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,550
Wait. I'm coming.

6
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,469
I'm coming.

7
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,555
I'm definitely coming.

8
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:56,975
Hold on.

9
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,152
I can swim.

10
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,948
I just can't walk or undress myself.

11
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,761
Come on in the water.

12
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,263
Take it easy. Take it easy.

13
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:23,727
Help me!

14
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,729
I'm coming. I'm coming.

15
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,858
It hurts!

16
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,115
Oh, my God!

17
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,127
Please help!

18
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:22,410
How come the sun didn't
use to shine in here?

19
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,417
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

20
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,507
Somebody feed the dogs.

21
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,550
Right.

22
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:42,972
Do you see the kids?

23
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,231
They must be in the backyard.

24
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:53,358
In Amity you say "yard."

25
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:58,947
They're in the "yard",
not too "far" from the "car."

26
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,160
- How's that?
- Like you're from New York.

27
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,123
Mom, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.

28
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,709
You were playin' on those swings,
weren't you?

29
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:15,755
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.

30
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,465
I think you're gonna live.

31
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:20,259
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

32
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,011
- Yes.
- Can I go swimmin'?

33
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,347
Let me clean this thing off first.

34
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,600
What do they usually do?
Wash up or float up? Or what?

35
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:35,107
Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...

36
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:41,447
...15, 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off. Go on, get a Band-Aid.

37
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,492
Got to go. Missing person.

38
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,328
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

39
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,708
Listen, Chief...

40
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,669
...be careful, will ya?
- In this town?

41
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,046
Hi, Dad.

42
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,381
Wait a minute. Let me get on.

43
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,468
- I want my cup back!
- You'll get it.

44
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,388
Wave goodbye. Bye.

45
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,337
Nobody saw her go into the water?

46
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,548
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

47
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:45,260
- You mean, she ran out on you?
- No, sir.

48
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,306
She must've drowned.

49
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:52,309
Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?

50
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:54,853
- You live here?
- No. Hartford.

51
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:57,939
I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.

52
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,609
- Your folks were born here, right?
- I'm an Islander.

53
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,819
They moved off when my dad retired.

54
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:04,988
- You an Islander?
- No. New York City.

55
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,823
You here for the summer?

56
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,408
Come on.

57
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,547
Hold it.

58
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:36,645
Oh, Jesus.

59
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,256
You're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

60
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:11,554
- Chief, what have you got on?
- Lf this new filing system is to work...

61
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,974
...you must keep that old stuff
off my desk. Just the pending.

62
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:18,227
Yes, Chief. We got a bunch
of calls about the Karate school.

63
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:21,647
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been...

64
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,275
...karate-ing the picket fences.

65
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,196
Chief Brody's office.
The Medical Inspector.

66
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,502
The Fire Chief wants you to go over...

67
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,797
I want a list of the water activities
that the city fathers...

68
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,424
...are planning for today.

69
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,634
Hendricks!

70
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,011
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

71
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,346
We never had any.

72
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,849
There's a truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

73
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,353
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

74
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,712
Look what the kids did to my fence.
Eight and nine-year-olds...

75
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,505
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.

76
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,551
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

77
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,309
This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.

78
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,853
The summer ginks come
down here in June.

79
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,814
You haven't got one thing
on here I ordered.

80
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:49,902
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

81
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:52,154
If I can't get service...

82
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,122
Polly sent me to tell you
that there's a bunch...

83
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,959
...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay,
doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.

84
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:08,628
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

85
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,464
Come on, get out of there.

86
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:13,508
Take this stuff back to the office
and work on those signs.

87
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,928
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

88
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,555
Let Polly do the printing.

89
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:21,933
- What's the matter with my printing?
- Let Polly do the printing.

90
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:23,935
Chief Brody!

91
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,773
What have you got there?

92
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:31,693
We had a shark attack at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

93
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,862
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

94
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,656
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

95
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,624
Charlie, take me out to those kids, will ya?

96
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:13,484
You're gonna shut down
the beaches on your own authority?

97
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,696
- What other authority do I need?
- You need a civic ordinance...

98
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,866
...or a resolution by the board.
- That's going by the book.

99
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,911
We're really a little anxious that you're
rushing into something serious here.

100
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,164
This is your first summer, you know.

101
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,790
What does that mean?

102
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,044
I'm only trying to say
that Amity is a summer town.

103
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,255
We need summer dollars.

104
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:38,968
If they can't swim here, they'll be glad
to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...

105
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,678
...the Hamptons, Long Island.

106
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,930
That doesn't mean we serve
them a smorgasbord.

107
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,892
But we've never had
that kind of trouble in these waters.

108
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,645
What else could've done that?
A boat propeller?

109
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,523
I think possibly yes, a boating accident.

110
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,775
That's not what you told me
over the phone.

111
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:58,070
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.

112
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,948
- And you'll stand by that?
- I'll stand by that.

113
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:06,162
A summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

114
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,623
- She tires, fishing boat comes along...
- It's happened before.

115
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:13,252
I don't think you appreciate
the reaction people have to these things.

116
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,422
I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

117
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,425
It's all psychological.

118
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,345
You yell "Barracuda!"
and everybody says, "What?"

119
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,932
You yell, "Shark!"...

120
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,562
...we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

121
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,858
Okay. You can take us back now.

122
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,123
I'm gonna get my raft
and go back out in the water.

123
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,958
Let me see your fingers.

124
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:58,338
- Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune.
- Just let me go out a little longer.

125
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,883
- Just 10 more minutes.
- Thanks.

126
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,057
All I want to know...

127
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,894
I just want to know one simple thing:
When do I get to become an Islander?

128
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,063
Ellen, never. Never.

129
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,024
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

130
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,334
Don't bother him. Come right back.

131
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,464
I know you got
a lot of problems downtown...

132
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,801
...but I've got a couple of problems
I wish you'd take care of.

133
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:31,347
One, I've got some cats parking
in front of the house, I can't get...

134
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,937
What I need is a red zone.
It's simple, you could take care of it.

135
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,273
Would you come here a minute, please?

136
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,153
Are you okay?

137
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,281
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

138
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,576
Look, if the kids goin'
in the water is worrying you...

139
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,370
...they can play out here on the beach.

140
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,205
It's all right. Let them go.

141
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,216
It's cold.

142
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,389
We know all about you, Chief.
You don't go in the water at all, do you?

143
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,975
That's some bad hat, Harry.

144
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,816
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

145
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,028
Come on. That's it.

146
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,001
Tippet! Tippet!

147
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,658
Did you see that?

148
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,085
Blood!

149
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,174
Everybody out!

150
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
Get them out!

151
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,396
Michael, get out of the water!

152
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,326
Alex!

153
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,348
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

154
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,142
I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.

155
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,105
I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
This is turning into a contest.

156
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:30,942
<i>It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out of town papers.</i>

157
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:35,196
I suggest we move to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

158
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,365
I'm responsible for public safety here.

159
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:40,243
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

160
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:43,329
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

161
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,457
The ad is gonna run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

162
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,126
Right in here, please.

163
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,421
Move on in, please.

164
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,604
Why do you insist on playing the heavy?

165
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:12,525
I have a point of view and it speaks
for many of the people here.

166
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:19,281
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

167
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,242
Let's have some order.

168
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:25,287
Let's have some order, please.

169
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,998
Any special questions?

170
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,586
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

171
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,675
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.

172
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,343
All right, all right.

173
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:44,014
That's private business between
you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

174
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,976
Martin, would you please...

175
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,270
Chief Brody.

176
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:55,484
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

177
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,319
What about the beaches, Chief?

178
00:19:57,402 --> 00:20:01,281
We're gonna put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

179
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,827
And then we're gonna try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

180
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,579
Are you going to close the beaches?

181
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,459
Yes, we are.

182
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,632
We're also bringing in some experts
from the Oceanographic Institute.

183
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,677
Only 24 hours.

184
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,179
I didn't agree to that.

185
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,307
Only 24 hours.

186
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,685
24 hours is like three weeks.

187
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,587
You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.

188
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:03,301
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.

189
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:08,223
Not like goin' down to the pond
and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.

190
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,935
This shark, swallow you whole.

191
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:17,315
Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.

192
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:19,943
And we got to do it quick.

193
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:24,197
Got to bring back the tourists that'll put
your businesses on a payin' basis.

194
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,575
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

195
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,870
I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.

196
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:36,334
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

197
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,087
You got to make up your minds.

198
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,464
Gonna stay alive and ante up...

199
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,884
...gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

200
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,971
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

201
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,599
There's too many captains on this island.

202
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:55,144
$10,000, for me, by myself.

203
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,107
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

204
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,489
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

205
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,743
We'll take it under advisement.

206
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:16,749
Mr. Mayor, Chief...

207
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,378
...ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:56,205
Oh, God, you scared me.

209
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:04,046
People don't even know
how old sharks are.

210
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:07,549
If they live 2,000,
3,000 years they don't know.

211
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:11,220
Enough. You're not going to be able
to go to sleep tonight.

212
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,430
Here. Come on.

213
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:16,099
Thanks.

214
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,194
Want to get drunk and fool around?

215
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:28,862
Oh, yeah.

216
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:35,202
Mikey really loves his present.

217
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:37,704
Where is he?

218
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,623
Sitting in it.

219
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:43,627
Good God.

220
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,883
All right, Michael, out of the boat.

221
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:53,845
Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.

222
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:55,889
I'm helpin' Michael.

223
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,849
- Get out of that boat.
- Hi, Dad.

224
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,809
Just a little longer. Please?

225
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:02,812
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- I don't want him on the ocean!

226
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:06,441
He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.
He's not gonna go in the water.

227
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:10,904
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

228
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,823
Now don't say that.

229
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:17,285
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

230
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:21,790
I want him to read the boating regulations,
the rules...

231
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:24,042
...before he goes out on his own.

232
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,546
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

233
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,266
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

234
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:44,854
The chief lives on the other side
of the island.

235
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:47,231
Am I comin' in straight?

236
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,609
Just keep rowin'.

237
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,537
We better catch something,
this is my wife's holiday roast.

238
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,249
Don't worry about it.
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.

239
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:16,552
Come and get it.

240
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,682
The tide's takin' it right out.

241
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:26,395
Can't we go home?

242
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,915
He's takin' it.

243
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:31,877
Go, go, go.

244
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:05,577
Charlie, take my word for it.
Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.

245
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:13,043
Come on, Charlie, swim to me!
Keep comin'.

246
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:20,967
- I can't get up.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

247
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:26,764
- Help me!
- Get your feet out of the water!

248
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:42,030
Can we go home now?

249
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,667
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there tryin' to catch their breath...

250
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:59,172
...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife
what happened to her freezer full of meat.

251
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,841
That's not funny. That's not funny at all.

252
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,635
<i>Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in Field and Stream.</i>

253
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:07,096
<i>Looks more like The National Enquirer.</i>

254
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:12,518
All right, hold it, hold it.
Hold everything. I said, hold it!

255
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:22,278
- Hello.
- Hello, back, young feller. How are you?

256
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,365
Say, I hope you're not goin' out
with those nuts, are you?

257
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:32,455
The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.

258
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,416
You have to move out,
or he can't get out at all.

259
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:40,463
Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it.
You got a paddle on the boat?

260
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:43,549
Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.

261
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,845
How many guys are you gonna put
in that boat?

262
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,346
Whatever's safe, right?

263
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,766
- Yeah, well that ain't safe.
- Watch it, that's dynamite.

264
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:57,563
- Where are you goin' with that?
- I'm goin' on the boat.

265
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:00,899
- Help me get those guys out of the boat.
- Sure.

266
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:07,072
Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you
that you're overloading that boat.

267
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:09,241
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,369
- You ain't going. What do you care?
- Can you tell me...

269
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:14,788
...if there's a good restaurant
or hotel here?

270
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,874
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

271
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,418
They're all gonna die.

272
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,547
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

273
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,799
You've got to get somebody to help us.

274
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:28,760
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.

275
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:32,222
Because we've got more people
down here than we can handle.

276
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:35,350
What are you doing?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

277
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,227
They aren't mine. They're from all over.

278
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:41,273
You see the plates in the parking lot?
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...

279
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:44,651
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help?

280
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:47,112
That's not until the Fourth of July.

281
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:49,865
You know those guys
in that fan-tail launch out there?

282
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:52,284
None of them will get
out of the harbor alive.

283
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:55,954
That's what I'm saying. You know
their names. Talk to those clowns.

284
00:29:56,037 --> 00:30:00,250
- Everyone seems to be having a good time.
- Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.

285
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,878
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

286
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,004
Who are you?

287
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:07,048
Matt Hooper.
I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.

288
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:10,719
For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody.

289
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:12,804
- I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.

290
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,724
I know you got a lot
on your hands right now, but...

291
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:19,269
The best thing for me to do is
to see the remains of the first victim.

292
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:20,770
The girl on the beach.

293
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:23,314
- Just bear with me, will ya?
- Sure.

294
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,819
Wait'll we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

295
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,320
There'll be some fun.

296
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:32,157
They'll wish their fathers
had never met their mothers...

297
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,785
...when they start diggin' the bottoms out
and slammin' into them rocks.

298
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,621
Get away from there, you goddamn fool!

299
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,290
What's the matter with you?

300
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,792
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

301
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,795
What are these guys doin' out here?

302
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:49,882
- What are they doin' back there?
- They're chummin' right now.

303
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:52,468
- What is that?
- They're tracking the shark now.

304
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:55,722
$3,000 divided four ways is what?

305
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:06,649
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

306
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:13,531
Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian.

307
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,118
- And here's the way we have it.
- Probable boating accident.

308
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:28,129
The height and weight of the victim can
only be estimated from the partial remains.

309
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:35,594
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

310
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:38,848
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?

311
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:43,477
The right arm has been severed
above the elbow with massive tissue loss...

312
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,729
...in the upper musculature.

313
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:48,107
Thank you, very much.

314
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,946
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

315
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:58,742
- Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
- No. It was only local jurisdiction.

316
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:07,501
The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum
and portions of the rib cage are intact.

317
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,087
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

318
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,507
This is what happens.

319
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:19,430
<i>Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large squalus, possibly longimanus...</i>

320
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,432
<i>...or isurus glaucus.</i>

321
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,936
The amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis...

322
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:29,022
<i>...however, the attacking squalus
must be larger...</i>

323
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,651
<i>...than any normal squalus
found in these waters.</i>

324
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:35,028
Didn't you get a boat
and check these waters?

325
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,531
This is not a boat accident.

326
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,702
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

327
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:44,037
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

328
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,625
It was a shark.

329
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:08,311
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I wanna get on the state wire services.

330
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:10,564
See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.

331
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:13,817
Call Dave Axelrod in New York
and tell him he owes me a favor.

332
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,028
This is the shot I want
with everybody and the fish in it.

333
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,739
Guys, could we please get organized?

334
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:22,200
I want to get a picture for the paper.

335
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:27,163
- Ben Gardner get this?
- No, no. We caught it.

336
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,335
- That's swell.
- It's a beauty, eh?

337
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,673
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way, please.

338
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:39,676
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

339
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,095
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

340
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:47,058
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign please?

341
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,112
Young fella,
could you step out of the picture?

342
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:03,408
We're ready.

343
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,495
- Can you get that, please.
- How's that?

344
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,711
Larry, you won't believe it.

345
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:18,464
- What kind of a shark is that?
- I don't know.

346
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:21,801
- I think it's a mako.
- It's got a deep throat, Frank.

347
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:25,096
- Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?
- Tiger shark.

348
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:27,848
A what?

349
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,433
We can start breathing again.

350
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,186
- Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
- You bet he is.

351
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,480
What is this bite radius crap?

352
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,194
You stuff your friggin' head in there man,
and find out if it's a man-eater.

353
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:47,284
All I'm saying,
is that it may not be the shark.

354
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,705
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.

355
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:55,626
- Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- Nice to meet you.

356
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:00,839
There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.

357
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:03,175
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...

358
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:06,095
And the chances that these bozos got
the exact shark...

359
00:35:06,178 --> 00:35:09,974
- There are no other sharks like this here.
- It's 100 to 1.

360
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:14,603
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

361
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:17,815
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

362
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,943
The fact is,
the bite radius on this animal is different...

363
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:22,986
...than the wounds on the victim.

364
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:27,074
I want to be sure. You want to be sure.

365
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:30,410
We all want to be sure. Okay?
What I want to do is very simple.

366
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:33,330
The digestive system
of this animal is very, very slow.

367
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:36,625
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...

368
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,962
...is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.

369
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,261
It may be the only way to confirm it.

370
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:50,681
Look, fellas let's be reasonable.

371
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,266
This is not the time or the place...

372
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:56,853
...to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

373
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:01,525
I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open...

374
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:05,362
...and see that little Kintner boy spill out
all over the dock.

375
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:31,346
I just found out...

376
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,767
...that a girl got killed here last week.

377
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:38,895
And you knew it.

378
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:42,273
You knew there was a shark out there.

379
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,611
You knew it was dangerous.

380
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:49,906
But you let people go swimming anyway.

381
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:55,912
You knew all those things...

382
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,918
...but still my boy is dead now.

383
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:08,883
And there's nothing you can do about it.

384
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:16,516
My boy is dead.

385
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,023
I wanted you to know that.

386
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:39,914
I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.

387
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,250
No, she's not.

388
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:49,840
All right, fellas...

389
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:53,719
...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down
before it stinks up the island.

390
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:57,556
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

391
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:10,712
Come here.

392
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:15,675
Give us a kiss.

393
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:17,219
Why?

394
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,181
Because I need it.

395
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:27,145
Get out of here.

396
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:32,817
The door was open.
Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.

397
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,402
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

398
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:37,530
Your husband's home?
I'd really like to talk to him.

399
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,157
Yes, so would I.

400
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:42,994
Can I get you some coffee?

401
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,705
Wine. How nice.

402
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:06,059
How was your day?

403
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:13,358
Swell.

404
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:19,363
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

405
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:20,823
That's nice.

406
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,868
Is anyone eating this?

407
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:36,005
My husband tells me you're in sharks.

408
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,387
Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it
quite put that way. But yes, I am.

409
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:45,348
I love sharks.

410
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:47,725
- You love sharks?
- Yeah, I love them.

411
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,146
When I was 12 years old, my father got me
a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

412
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:54,398
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...

413
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:57,401
...I hooked a four and a half foot
baby thresher shark...

414
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:59,653
...who proceeded to eat my boat.

415
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:03,783
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

416
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:07,077
He turned an inboard into an outboard.
Scared me to death...

417
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,954
...and I swam back to shore.

418
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:10,623
When I was on the beach...

419
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:13,500
...I turned around and I saw my boat
being taken apart.

420
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:16,211
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks...

421
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:19,548
...and that's why I'm gonna go
to the Institute tomorrow...

422
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:22,718
...and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

423
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:26,138
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- I'm sorry, I thought that...

424
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:28,015
You told me the shark was caught.

425
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:30,726
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

426
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:33,270
They caught a shark, not the shark.

427
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,356
Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.

428
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:39,318
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

429
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,987
Which I wanted to prove
by cutting the shark open...

430
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,573
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

431
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:07,637
You'll be the only rational man
left on this island after I leave tomorrow.

432
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:09,264
Where are you going?

433
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,350
I am going on the Aurora.

434
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:17,314
- The Aurora? What is that?
- It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.

435
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:19,399
Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.

436
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:22,694
Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.

437
00:42:23,612 --> 00:42:27,199
Martin sits in his car when we go
on the ferry to the mainland.

438
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:31,536
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?

439
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,829
Drowning.

440
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:38,126
Is it true that most people get attacked
by sharks in three feet of water...

441
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,420
...about 10 feet from the beach?

442
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:45,175
And before people started
to swim for recreation...

443
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:48,261
...I mean before sharks knew
what they were missing...

444
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:51,181
...that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

445
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,892
That's right.

446
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:58,354
Now this shark that swims alone,
what's it called?

447
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:00,356
- Rogue.
- Rogue, yeah.

448
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:02,692
Now, this guy...

449
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:06,237
...he keeps swimmin' around in a place
where the feeding is good...

450
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:09,866
...until the food supply is gone. Right?
- That's called territoriality.

451
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:13,286
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

452
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:20,126
Then why don't we have one more drink
and go down and cut that shark open?

453
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,713
Can you do that?

454
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:30,011
I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.

455
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,978
We start in the alimentary canal...

456
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:42,940
...open the digestive tract.

457
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:15,556
- Just like I thought.
- What?

458
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:19,602
Came up from the Gulf Stream
from southern waters.

459
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,734
He didn't eat a car, did he?

460
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:30,321
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

461
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,990
Somebody probably threw that in the river.

462
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:40,956
That's it.

463
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,752
I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.

464
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:49,089
You got a bigger problem than that.

465
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:51,717
You still got a hell of a fish out there...

466
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,844
...with a mouth about this big.

467
00:44:58,515 --> 00:45:00,684
How do we confirm that by morning?

468
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:05,230
If he is a rogue, and there's any truth
to territoriality at all...

469
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:08,692
...we could spot him
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

470
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:11,570
- Where're you going?
- To find him. He's a night feeder.

471
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:14,156
- On the water!
- We're not gonna find him on the land.

472
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:15,949
I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.

473
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:17,909
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

474
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:19,870
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

475
00:45:28,962 --> 00:45:32,132
I'm tellin' you,
the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.

476
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:36,595
There's so many problems, you never feel
like you're accomplishing anything.

477
00:45:36,678 --> 00:45:39,139
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

478
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:43,143
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.

479
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:45,854
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

480
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:50,775
In 25 years, there's never been a shooting
or a murder in this town.

481
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:54,154
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

482
00:45:54,946 --> 00:45:56,114
Where are we?

483
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:59,200
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

484
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:03,538
Can you get the Late Show on this thing?

485
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:07,834
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore and aft.

486
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:11,754
Who pays for all this stuff?
The Government? The Institute?

487
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:13,881
This stuff cost a lot of money.

488
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,886
- I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
- You're kidding.

489
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:21,764
- You rich?
- Yeah.

490
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,975
How much?

491
00:46:24,058 --> 00:46:26,144
Personally or the whole family?

492
00:46:27,395 --> 00:46:31,149
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

493
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:37,405
It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates
the water to live on an island, either.

494
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:40,575
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

495
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,702
That makes a lot of sense.

496
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,418
What is that thing doing?

497
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,338
It's a fish finder.

498
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:58,634
It's probably just a school of mackerel
or something, all clumped together.

499
00:47:00,594 --> 00:47:01,804
Wait a minute.

500
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:09,562
- There's somethin' else out there.
- What is it?

501
00:47:10,271 --> 00:47:12,898
About 100 yards, south, southwest.

502
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,269
- That's Ben Gardner's boat.
- You know him?

503
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:53,522
It's all banged up. Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

504
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:56,817
What happened?

505
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:05,617
I got to go down there and check their hull.

506
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:07,703
Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?

507
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:10,455
We will. I just got to check something out.

508
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:12,290
Keep the lights going.

509
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:38,316
Let's tow it in.

510
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,027
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's gonna happen.

511
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:48,368
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

512
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:52,706
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.

513
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,001
I'll be back in two minutes.

514
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,423
This is a great white. A big one.

515
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:30,344
Any shark expert in the world
will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.

516
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:34,807
A great white shark has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

517
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,060
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

518
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:41,188
There's no limit to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.

519
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,482
Two people killed in a week.
It'll happen again.

520
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:45,567
It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.

521
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,695
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

522
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,238
Tell him about the swimmers.

523
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:52,616
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity...

524
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,494
...that occurs whenever people swim.
You can't avoid it.

525
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:57,830
If you open the beaches
on the Fourth of July...

526
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:00,666
...it's like ringing the dinner bell,
for Christ sakes.

527
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:04,836
I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass,
out of a boat out there.

528
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,713
It was the tooth of a great white.

529
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,634
It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.
I helped tow it. You should've seen it.

530
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:13,971
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

531
00:51:14,096 --> 00:51:15,263
I didn't see it.

532
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:18,016
- He dropped it on the way in.
- I had an accident.

533
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,894
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

534
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,524
<i>It's a carcharodon carcharias.
It's a great white.</i>

535
00:51:25,607 --> 00:51:27,567
You don't have the tooth?

536
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:31,530
We depend on the summer people
for our lives...

537
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:34,908
You are not gonna have a summer
unless you deal with this problem.

538
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:38,453
We have to close the beaches,
and hire somebody to kill the shark!

539
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:39,955
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

540
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:42,916
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

541
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:45,377
You'll have to ring this entire harbor.

542
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,047
I don't think either one of you
are familiar with our problems.

543
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:52,384
I know that you are going to ignore...

544
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,804
...this problem until it swims up
and bites you on the ass!

545
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:59,015
Wait a second.
There are two ways to deal with this.

546
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:02,519
You're either gonna kill this animal,
or cut off it's food supply.

547
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,396
We have to close the beaches.

548
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,649
Sick vandalism.

549
00:52:07,982 --> 00:52:11,861
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

550
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:15,365
I want those little paint-happy
bastards caught...

551
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:18,618
...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.
- That's it. Goodbye.

552
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:22,705
I won't waste my time arguing with a man
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

553
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:24,165
Don't do this.

554
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,469
What we are dealing with here,
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.

555
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:41,766
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does is swim...

556
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,269
...and eat, and make little sharks.
And that's all.

557
00:52:45,937 --> 00:52:48,981
Now, why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign.

558
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,901
- Those proportions are correct.
- You'd love to prove that.

559
00:52:51,984 --> 00:52:54,529
<i>Get your name
into the National Geographic.</i>

560
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:10,127
Larry, if we make an effort today,
we might be able to save August.

561
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:14,173
August? For Christ sake,
tomorrow's the Fourth of July.

562
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,050
And we will be open for business.

563
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:18,344
This will be the best summer
we've ever had.

564
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:22,389
If you are concerned about the beaches
do what you have to, to make them safe.

565
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:25,309
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

566
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:50,668
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

567
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:52,836
I don't need to come to Brisbane...

568
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,214
...when I have a great white shark
right here.

569
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:57,925
<i>We need men to patrol the swimming area.</i>

570
00:53:58,008 --> 00:54:00,928
<i>We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.</i>

571
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:15,567
Monday!

572
00:54:17,444 --> 00:54:21,573
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy with a crew cut.

573
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:42,385
Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?
Could you connect me, please?

574
00:54:57,692 --> 00:54:59,819
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

575
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:04,240
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

576
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:06,493
All right. I'll get to them later.

577
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:12,415
Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.

578
00:55:19,297 --> 00:55:21,007
Brody to Daisy, do you read me?

579
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:24,511
<i>Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me?
Come in, Hooper. What do you see?</i>

580
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:27,096
Nothing, here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

581
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:31,434
Amity Island has long been known
for it's clean air, clear water...

582
00:55:31,726 --> 00:55:33,811
...beautiful white sand beaches.

583
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:35,396
But in recent days...

584
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,108
...a cloud has appeared on the horizon
of this beautiful resort community.

585
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:41,944
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

586
00:56:11,474 --> 00:56:15,019
- Hi, Larry.
- Why aren't you in the water?

587
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:20,649
I just put some sun tan lotion on,
and I'm trying to absorb some...

588
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:22,777
Nobody's going in.

589
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,696
Please, get in the water.

590
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:28,884
Do me a favor, will you?

591
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:32,804
You and the other guys take the boat
and put it in the pond instead.

592
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:35,015
The pond's for old ladies.

593
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:38,685
I know it's for the old ladies,
but just do it for the old man.

594
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:42,564
- All right.
- Thanks.

595
00:57:55,202 --> 00:57:57,037
I've got Sean.

596
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:06,087
Michael, wait!

597
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,923
Michael, I don't like you no more.

598
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:36,409
Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.

599
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,703
Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

600
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:46,461
False alarm. Must be this glare.

601
00:58:57,513 --> 00:59:00,600
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have...

602
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:05,479
...caught and killed a large predator
that supposedly injured some bathers.

603
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,440
As you see, it's a beautiful day.

604
00:59:07,523 --> 00:59:10,776
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

605
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,446
"Amity," as you know, means "friendship."

606
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:28,377
My God!

607
00:59:38,512 --> 00:59:41,182
Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!

608
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:49,398
<i>Martin, get them the hell out of the water.</i>

609
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:55,904
No whistles! No whistles!

610
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:59,908
<i>Everybody please, get out of the water.
Everybody out of the water.</i>

611
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:09,311
<i>Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?</i>

612
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:16,276
He made me do it. He talked me into it.

613
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:20,739
Please, please, move back.
Please. Give these people some air.

614
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:27,203
Martin it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

615
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:30,457
Everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

616
01:01:37,755 --> 01:01:40,091
Shark! A shark!

617
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:45,513
- It's going into the pond! Shark in estuary!
- Now what?

618
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:48,016
Michael's in the pond.

619
01:01:50,393 --> 01:01:53,354
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

620
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:08,911
- Hurry up. Get that done.
- I can't do a damn thing.

621
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:17,587
Haul in your sheet. Make it fast.

622
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,176
You guys okay over there?

623
01:02:24,468 --> 01:02:25,678
In the pond!

624
01:03:07,386 --> 01:03:11,098
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

625
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:37,541
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not. He's in shock.

626
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,075
Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.

627
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,038
- How's my big kid?
- I'm all right.

628
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:19,749
You gonna miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

629
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,419
- Want anything from home?
- My cars.

630
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:24,462
- What about ice cream?
- Coffee.

631
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:38,560
Want to take him home?

632
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:42,355
Like to New York?

633
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:44,774
No. Home, here.

634
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:06,045
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

635
01:05:07,088 --> 01:05:08,714
You got a pen, Larry?

636
01:05:09,507 --> 01:05:11,050
Yeah, pen, you know.

637
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:16,764
'Cause you're gonna do what you do best.

638
01:05:16,848 --> 01:05:20,059
You're gonna sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

639
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:24,355
- I don't know if I can do that without...
- I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.

640
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:26,857
- August?
- What?

641
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:29,443
What are you talkin' about?

642
01:05:29,652 --> 01:05:31,821
Summer's over.
You're the Mayor of Shark City.

643
01:05:31,904 --> 01:05:34,365
These people think
you want the beaches open.

644
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:37,535
I was acting in the town's best interest.

645
01:05:37,618 --> 01:05:39,620
You were acting
in the town's best interest.

646
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:41,747
That's why you're gonna do the right thing.

647
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:46,210
That's why you're gonna sign this, and
we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.

648
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:53,008
My kids were on that beach, too.

649
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:05,145
Sign it, Larry.

650
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:16,240
<i>$10,000.</i>

651
01:06:16,323 --> 01:06:19,701
<i>- $200 a day, whether I catch him or not.
- You've got it.</i>

652
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:23,080
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more zoning crap.

653
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:24,498
You've got that.

654
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:28,210
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

655
01:06:28,627 --> 01:06:31,672
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

656
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:35,342
<i>Champagne, pâté de foie gras,
Iranian caviar...</i>

657
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:37,678
...and don't forget the color TV.

658
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:44,518
You try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

659
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,727
Thanks.

660
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:49,272
Here's to swimmin'
with bow-legged women.

661
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,198
Excuse me, Chief.

662
01:07:13,004 --> 01:07:15,799
Can't get a good man these days, under 60.

663
01:07:15,924 --> 01:07:18,343
All gone at least 35 years.

664
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:19,844
Don't drink that.

665
01:07:25,684 --> 01:07:27,310
You'll need an extra hand.

666
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:28,978
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know.

667
01:07:29,062 --> 01:07:31,189
- I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
- Transplants?

668
01:07:31,272 --> 01:07:34,776
- He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- And an America's Cup trial.

669
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:38,988
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talkin'
about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.

670
01:07:39,906 --> 01:07:43,493
I'm talkin' about workin' for a living.
I'm talkin' about sharkin'.

671
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,829
I'm not talkin' about hookin'
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

672
01:07:46,913 --> 01:07:49,123
I'm talkin' about finding a great white.

673
01:07:49,207 --> 01:07:51,584
Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?

674
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,591
Just tie me a sheepshank.

675
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:04,555
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

676
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:08,017
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

677
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,854
How's that?

678
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:16,818
Gimme your hands.

679
01:08:18,653 --> 01:08:19,654
Dogfish?

680
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:23,241
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

681
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:26,577
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
by the time he's finished with that net...

682
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:30,539
...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class
has cut it up for a paper doll.

683
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:36,253
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.
You been countin' money all your life.

684
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:40,132
I don't need this.
I don't need this working class hero crap.

685
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:43,719
You're not gonna do this
aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?

686
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:47,181
Maybe I should go alone.

687
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:52,561
It's my party. It's my charter.

688
01:08:52,978 --> 01:08:56,106
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.

689
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:58,025
You're on board my vessel...

690
01:08:58,108 --> 01:08:59,902
...I'm mate, master, pilot...

691
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,404
...and I'm captain.

692
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:07,952
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.

693
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:11,664
You got him.

694
01:09:15,959 --> 01:09:20,339
Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, pliers, irons...

695
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:24,218
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float...

696
01:09:24,301 --> 01:09:27,096
...temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...

697
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:30,015
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

698
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:42,402
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure.

699
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:49,284
Jesus H. Christ!

700
01:09:49,826 --> 01:09:54,623
When I was a boy, every squirt wanted
to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.

701
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,086
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

702
01:09:59,169 --> 01:10:02,214
- An anti-shark cage.
- Anti-shark cage?

703
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:05,258
You go inside the cage?

704
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:09,054
Cage goes in the water?

705
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:11,932
You go in the water? Shark's in the water.

706
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,392
Our shark.

707
01:10:16,561 --> 01:10:20,815
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

708
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:25,487
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

709
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:31,159
"For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston

710
01:10:33,078 --> 01:10:37,248
"And so never more
shall we see you again"

711
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:46,591
- Did you take your Dramamine?
- Yes.

712
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,637
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks...

713
01:10:51,054 --> 01:10:55,558
...and there's the stuff for your nose,
the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.

714
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:00,188
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothin'.

715
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:03,775
Young girls just ain't quite smart
like their grandmothers were.

716
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:05,860
That's got to be Quint.

717
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:07,403
Colorful, isn't he?

718
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:08,946
He scares me.

719
01:11:11,074 --> 01:11:14,869
- Don't use the fireplace in the den.
- What am I gonna tell the kids?

720
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:20,458
Tell them I'm going fishing.

721
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:28,799
Break it up, will ya, Chief?
Daylight's wastin'.

722
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:33,346
Front: bow. Back: stern.

723
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,473
Better get it right, squirt...

724
01:11:35,556 --> 01:11:39,143
...or I throw your ass out
the little round window on the side.

725
01:11:39,477 --> 01:11:41,771
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

726
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:44,190
See you got your rubbers.

727
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:51,072
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee,
Died at the age of 103

728
01:11:51,447 --> 01:11:56,368
"For 15 years she kept her virginity,
Not a bad record for this vicinity"

729
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:00,372
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt.

730
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:04,835
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow.

731
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:11,800
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.

732
01:12:21,018 --> 01:12:22,728
How's the Missus, Chief?

733
01:12:23,812 --> 01:12:27,399
If they don't like you goin' out,
they'll love you comin' in.

734
01:12:53,216 --> 01:12:56,428
Keep that chum line goin'.
We got five good miles on it.

735
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:01,600
- Who's driving this boat?
- Nobody. The tide.

736
01:13:02,893 --> 01:13:06,855
One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.

737
01:13:06,938 --> 01:13:09,316
Two to wear him down and bring him up.

738
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:12,694
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

739
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:16,490
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.

740
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:20,994
Jesus H. Christ.

741
01:13:22,537 --> 01:13:25,332
Best drop another chum marker.

742
01:13:47,687 --> 01:13:49,230
Damn it, Martin!

743
01:13:50,064 --> 01:13:51,775
This is compressed air.

744
01:13:51,858 --> 01:13:55,361
- What the hell kind of a knot was that?
- You pulled the wrong one.

745
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:58,656
You screw around with these tanks,
and they're gonna blow up.

746
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:02,327
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear you've brought out here.

747
01:14:03,453 --> 01:14:06,247
I don't know what
that bastard shark's gonna do with it.

748
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:10,251
Might eat it, I suppose.
Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.

749
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:17,508
Next time,
you just ask me which line to pull, right?

750
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:26,350
Little brown eel comes out of the cave...

751
01:14:27,226 --> 01:14:28,978
...swims into the hole...

752
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:33,441
...comes out of the hole,
back into the cave again.

753
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,652
It's not too good, is it?

754
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:40,281
Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.

755
01:16:01,278 --> 01:16:02,404
I got it.

756
01:16:04,072 --> 01:16:06,116
- What?
- Get behind me.

757
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,288
Hooper, reverse her!

758
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:14,166
Takin' a hell of a lot of line.

759
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,377
Get the scoop out of the bucket.
Wet the reel.

760
01:16:22,632 --> 01:16:24,259
Reverse her!

761
01:16:27,012 --> 01:16:30,348
Duck your head down.
We're swingin'. Get behind me again.

762
01:16:31,016 --> 01:16:33,894
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

763
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:37,939
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watchin' it!

764
01:16:41,943 --> 01:16:43,570
Hooper, neutral.

765
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,203
Where'd he go now?

766
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:54,998
He ain't foolin' me.

767
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,917
What's he yankin' on now?

768
01:16:59,127 --> 01:17:00,545
Go on, try it.

769
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:16,352
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

770
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,527
Jesus...

771
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:29,741
He's gone under.

772
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:33,327
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

773
01:17:34,537 --> 01:17:36,080
Yeah, it's too easy.

774
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:39,417
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

775
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:43,212
Keep her steady, now.
I got somethin' very big.

776
01:17:43,421 --> 01:17:44,839
I don't think so.

777
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,967
Chief, put your gloves on.

778
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:51,012
You put your gloves on, both of you.

779
01:17:53,806 --> 01:17:55,850
Getting ready to run out again.

780
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,269
Quint, let it go.

781
01:17:59,353 --> 01:18:02,231
You may be big in the lab,
but out here you're just cargo.

782
01:18:02,314 --> 01:18:05,192
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here.

783
01:18:05,276 --> 01:18:08,237
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

784
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,657
- It's not a shark.
- The wire's showing!

785
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,992
Unbuckle me.

786
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:17,580
- Get the other side.
- It's a tuna or swordfish.

787
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:21,792
Take this rod.

788
01:18:22,793 --> 01:18:25,296
- Give the Chief a hand, will you?
- Right!

789
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,684
It's a marlin or a stingray...

790
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:41,687
...but it's definitely a game fish.

791
01:18:53,448 --> 01:18:55,075
Gamin' fish?

792
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:58,579
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

793
01:18:58,871 --> 01:19:00,914
Don't you tell me my business again.

794
01:19:00,998 --> 01:19:04,626
- You get back on the bridge.
- Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.

795
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,253
It proves one thing.

796
01:19:06,378 --> 01:19:10,090
It proves that you wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough...

797
01:19:10,173 --> 01:19:11,967
...to admit when you're wrong.

798
01:19:21,309 --> 01:19:23,979
What's the point? Hooks and lines?

799
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:28,984
You lose one, you rig one.

800
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:36,157
Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now.
Full throttle.

801
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:37,742
Aye, aye, sir.

802
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:43,123
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick 'em to the surface.

803
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,083
And then jab at 'em.

804
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:48,920
I'm not gonna haul 'em up
like a lot of catfish.

805
01:19:49,879 --> 01:19:50,964
Full throttle.

806
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,675
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

807
01:19:54,008 --> 01:19:56,845
Your head's bleeding. First aid there.

808
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,750
Start that chum line again, will ya?

809
01:20:30,545 --> 01:20:32,255
Let Hooper take a turn.

810
01:20:32,547 --> 01:20:34,924
Hooper drives the boat.

811
01:20:50,189 --> 01:20:52,233
Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.

812
01:20:52,316 --> 01:20:54,193
Slow ahead, if you please.

813
01:20:55,027 --> 01:20:56,862
You heard him. Slow ahead.

814
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:07,206
Slow ahead.

815
01:21:07,623 --> 01:21:11,836
I can go slow ahead. Come on down
and chum some of this shit.

816
01:21:28,978 --> 01:21:31,063
You're gonna need a bigger boat.

817
01:21:46,578 --> 01:21:48,247
Shut off that engine.

818
01:22:16,108 --> 01:22:18,777
- That's a 20-footer.
- 25.

819
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:21,279
Three tons of him.

820
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:29,162
We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?

821
01:22:29,454 --> 01:22:30,914
Gotta get to work.

822
01:22:31,123 --> 01:22:32,749
How do we handle this?

823
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:35,752
Come up front, Martin. I need you.

824
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:39,297
He's circling the boat.

825
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:56,523
<i>Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.</i>

826
01:22:56,606 --> 01:22:57,816
<i>Come in, Orca.</i>

827
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:02,237
<i>- Orca. Come in.
- I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>

828
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:03,530
Put her on.

829
01:23:04,364 --> 01:23:07,283
- Come on, Martin! Move!
- I'm not goin' out there!

830
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:12,080
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels, further out.

831
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:13,581
- Further out.
- Why?

832
01:23:13,665 --> 01:23:15,166
- Go further out.
- What for?

833
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,168
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

834
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:19,504
- What?
- Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

835
01:23:19,587 --> 01:23:22,548
I need something
in the foreground to give it some scale.

836
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:23,758
Foreground my ass!

837
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:27,011
Your husband's okay. He's fishin'.
He just caught some stripers.

838
01:23:27,095 --> 01:23:29,097
We'll bring 'em for dinner.
We won't be long.

839
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,099
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

840
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,559
- I'm not staying here!
- I'm begging you!

841
01:23:33,643 --> 01:23:34,977
Goddamn it!

842
01:23:35,436 --> 01:23:37,438
Come here, come here, darlin'.

843
01:23:43,069 --> 01:23:45,905
I want you up on the bridge,
just take her forward, steady.

844
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:50,243
- I've never steered a boat in my life.
- Just watch my hand, take her steady.

845
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:53,621
Attach the end of this line to the first keg.

846
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:57,500
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

847
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:18,104
Get clear of the bow.

848
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:25,319
- Hurry up, will ya?
- Your turn, Quint.

849
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:27,571
Hooper, where are you?

850
01:24:31,492 --> 01:24:33,327
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

851
01:24:34,787 --> 01:24:37,206
He's comin' straight for us!
Don't screw up now.

852
01:24:37,289 --> 01:24:38,749
Don't wait for me.

853
01:24:41,335 --> 01:24:44,338
Come on, Hooper. Come on.
Hurry it up. Tie it on.

854
01:24:45,172 --> 01:24:46,507
Now. Now.

855
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:51,595
Kill it!

856
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:53,555
Now!

857
01:24:55,682 --> 01:24:56,809
Shoot!

858
01:25:00,104 --> 01:25:01,104
Time.

859
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:07,027
What were you doin', anyway?
I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.

860
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,656
Let's see how long that barrel takes
to bring him up.

861
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:15,410
Free another barrel.
I'm comin' around again.

862
01:26:09,255 --> 01:26:11,174
What do we do now? We're quittin', right?

863
01:26:11,257 --> 01:26:15,261
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

864
01:26:15,595 --> 01:26:17,764
We could radio in and get a bigger boat...

865
01:26:43,373 --> 01:26:45,541
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

866
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:48,044
It won't be permanent.

867
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:50,463
You want to see something permanent?

868
01:26:56,928 --> 01:26:59,722
You want to feel somethin' permanent?

869
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:04,560
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

870
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,939
Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.

871
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:13,944
I got that beat.

872
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:23,537
It's a moray eel.

873
01:27:24,413 --> 01:27:26,582
It bit right through my wet suit.

874
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,795
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...

875
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:34,423
...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.
See this?

876
01:27:34,507 --> 01:27:36,717
I can't extend that. You know why?

877
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:38,802
'Cause in the semi-final...

878
01:27:39,136 --> 01:27:41,388
...celebrating my third wife's demise...

879
01:27:41,472 --> 01:27:44,600
...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.

880
01:27:56,945 --> 01:27:58,155
Look at that.

881
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:01,617
That's a bull shark.

882
01:28:01,992 --> 01:28:04,495
He scraped me when I was takin' samples.

883
01:28:05,537 --> 01:28:07,247
I got something for you.

884
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,126
There's a thresher.
You see that? A thresher's tail.

885
01:28:11,752 --> 01:28:13,587
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

886
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,718
- You want a drink? Drink to your leg?
- I'll drink to your leg.

887
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:21,970
So we drink to our legs.

888
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:30,270
<i>I got the crème de la crème.
Right here. Hold on.</i>

889
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:33,148
Here, you see that?

890
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:35,442
You're wearin' a sweater.

891
01:28:36,193 --> 01:28:38,278
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

892
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:41,281
She broke my heart.

893
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,210
What's that one?

894
01:28:53,418 --> 01:28:56,212
- What?
- That one, there. On your arm.

895
01:28:59,049 --> 01:29:01,051
A tattoo. I got that removed.

896
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,596
Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother."

897
01:29:10,268 --> 01:29:11,603
What is it?

898
01:29:16,858 --> 01:29:18,985
That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

899
01:29:27,327 --> 01:29:29,287
You were on the Indianapolis?

900
01:29:29,454 --> 01:29:30,747
What happened?

901
01:29:32,624 --> 01:29:36,836
Japanese submarine slammed
two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

902
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:41,549
I was comin' back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte...

903
01:29:41,633 --> 01:29:44,761
...just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

904
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:50,683
1,100 men went into the water.

905
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:53,019
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

906
01:29:55,438 --> 01:29:58,357
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

907
01:29:58,566 --> 01:30:00,359
Tiger, 13-footer.

908
01:30:00,443 --> 01:30:03,362
Know how you know that
when you're in the water?

909
01:30:03,446 --> 01:30:06,282
You tell by lookin'
from the dorsal to the tail.

910
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:10,077
Well, we didn't know.

911
01:30:10,703 --> 01:30:13,414
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret...

912
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:16,959
...no distress signal had been sent.

913
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:26,260
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

914
01:30:28,054 --> 01:30:31,223
Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...

915
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:34,685
...so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

916
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:40,191
Kinda like old squares in a battle
like you see on a calendar...

917
01:30:40,274 --> 01:30:41,942
...like the Battle of Waterloo.

918
01:30:42,026 --> 01:30:44,695
The idea was,
the shark comes to the nearest man...

919
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:47,656
...and he starts poundin'
hollerin' and screamin'.

920
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:49,742
Sometimes the shark would go away...

921
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,579
...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

922
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:56,457
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right into you...

923
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,250
...right into your eyes.

924
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:01,962
You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...

925
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:03,714
...lifeless eyes.

926
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:06,467
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

927
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:11,180
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be livin'...

928
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,348
...until he bites you.

929
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:16,602
Those little black eyes
roll over white and then...

930
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:21,732
...then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screamin'.

931
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:23,859
The ocean turns red...

932
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:28,196
...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin',
they all come in.

933
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:31,742
They rip you to pieces.

934
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:39,166
You know, by the end of that first dawn...

935
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:42,335
...we lost 100 men.

936
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:46,298
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

937
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:49,468
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

938
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:53,013
On Thursday mornin',
I bumped into a friend of mine...

939
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,265
...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

940
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:59,269
Baseball player, Bosun's mate.

941
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:03,481
I thought he was asleep.

942
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:06,192
Reached over to wake him up.

943
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:10,780
He bobbed up and down
in the water just like a kind of top.

944
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,949
Upended.

945
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,831
He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.

946
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:27,672
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

947
01:32:27,755 --> 01:32:30,592
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

948
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:32,635
Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...

949
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,054
...and he came in low,
and three hours later...

950
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:38,433
...a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

951
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:41,686
That was the time I was most frightened.

952
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:44,063
Waitin' for my turn.

953
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,817
I'll never put on a life jacket again.

954
01:32:50,236 --> 01:32:52,488
So, 1,100 men went into the water...

955
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:54,949
...316 men come out.

956
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,870
The sharks took the rest
June the 29th, 1945.

957
01:33:02,081 --> 01:33:05,710
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

958
01:33:18,097 --> 01:33:19,265
What's that?

959
01:33:20,308 --> 01:33:21,600
It's a whale.

960
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:27,982
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

961
01:33:29,859 --> 01:33:34,572
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"

962
01:33:39,285 --> 01:33:43,164
"Show me the way to go home

963
01:33:44,582 --> 01:33:48,711
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

964
01:33:50,129 --> 01:33:54,800
"I had a little drink about an hour ago

965
01:33:55,259 --> 01:33:59,346
"And it's gone right to my head

966
01:34:00,514 --> 01:34:04,518
"Wherever I may roam

967
01:34:05,519 --> 01:34:09,565
"By land, or sea, or foam

968
01:34:20,576 --> 01:34:23,620
"Show me the way to go home

969
01:34:24,037 --> 01:34:27,124
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

970
01:34:27,249 --> 01:34:29,835
"I had a little drink about a hour ago

971
01:34:29,918 --> 01:34:32,379
"And it's gone right to my head

972
01:34:32,462 --> 01:34:34,756
"Wherever I may roam

973
01:34:35,173 --> 01:34:37,467
"On land or sea or foam

974
01:34:37,592 --> 01:34:40,929
"You can always hear me singing this..."

975
01:34:44,141 --> 01:34:45,684
Start the engines.

976
01:34:55,694 --> 01:34:56,903
Fire her up!

977
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:07,372
Put out the fire, will ya?

978
01:35:17,048 --> 01:35:18,717
- Pump her out.
- Done.

979
01:35:27,475 --> 01:35:29,853
- Everybody on deck.
- He ate the light.

980
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:31,521
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

981
01:35:34,065 --> 01:35:37,026
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

982
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,280
What's wrong with this?

983
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:46,494
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

984
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,555
You okay?

985
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,683
You okay?

986
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,418
More left rudder.

987
01:36:36,293 --> 01:36:37,795
Pull your left hand down.

988
01:36:37,878 --> 01:36:40,798
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.

989
01:36:40,923 --> 01:36:44,718
All of our injectors got scored
from the salt water in the fuel.

990
01:36:45,803 --> 01:36:48,389
Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.

991
01:36:49,223 --> 01:36:53,686
Try the left rudder again. More left.
Good. Once again now.

992
01:36:57,773 --> 01:36:58,983
There it is.

993
01:36:59,316 --> 01:37:01,026
What do you say, Chief?

994
01:37:01,235 --> 01:37:03,821
The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.

995
01:37:07,616 --> 01:37:11,036
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

996
01:37:23,423 --> 01:37:25,425
If we can get close enough...

997
01:37:26,426 --> 01:37:31,139
...I've got things on board that'll kill it.
