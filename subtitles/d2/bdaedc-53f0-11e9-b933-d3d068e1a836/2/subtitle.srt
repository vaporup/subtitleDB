1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,509
Excuse me, I'm just getting changed.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,869
- Chief Inspector Tung is here!
- What's he doing here?

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,474
Keep him talking,
I'll be in the back.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,835
Chief Inspector Tung?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,671
- Please, come in.
- For you.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
Thank you. How can I help you, sir?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,756
- I was just passing by.
- And the flowers?

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,195
I confiscated them from a hawker.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,992
I must say you've got a
very pleasant place here

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,277
so bright and airy
and beautifully decorated.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,716
It really has a woman's touch
about the whole place.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,475
And such a wonderful scent
of fresh flowers, too.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,916
Oh, yes, your two officers
are right...

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,678
My two officers what?

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,037
- My two officers are what?
- Where are your officers?

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,390
They're all downstairs
waiting for me.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,750
I'll patrol around this area everyday.
Just in case.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,598
What is it?

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,033
- Are you all right?
- Indigestion.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,952
It's hiccups. I have a cure.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,872
Does it work?

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,236
It's a very ancient remedy.
It can cure hiccups.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,672
You're cured. It always works.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,311
- Are you better now?
- Yes, I am.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,039
If you have hiccups again,
you know what to do.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,235
I was wondering...

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,630
- Why don't we put them in a vase?
- Yeah? Sure!

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,470
Let me help you.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,393
- Where's the water tap?
- Behind you.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,352
Normally I close this window
when I'm cooking.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,839
Are you cooking now?

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,957
No, I'm not cooking now,
I may as well leave it open.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,430
You've got a problem here,
but I can fix it.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,873
Thank you.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,033
Here.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,915
Don't move.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,068
It won't hurt,
it's just a little water.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,029
Stand back or you'll get wet.
It won't take too long.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,517
I'll go and get a towel.

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,796
All right, the coast is clear.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,912
I'm sorry. I fixed it,
but I got all wet.

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,715
Thank you.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,677
- So you know about plumbing?
- Sure.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,479
I was chief of waterworks before.

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,193
My uniform's wet.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,953
- I'll hang it up for you.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,678
Enough heroics.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,669
You're still here?!

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,796
There are lots of police downstairs.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,632
Keys.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,593
Quick! Hurry!

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,588
Maggie!

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,598
Where are you?

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,234
- Finished! Where will I put them?
- In the living room.

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,710
Can you hang this out to dry
and lend me a shirt?

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,231
- What's up?
- It won't open.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,038
Let me.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,592
The humid weather
makes the wood expand. Hold this.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,477
Try this side.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,834
There.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,918
- I hope this will do.
- It will have to.

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,150
- Thank you.
- I'll iron your jacket.

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,516
No, it can't be ironed.
It must be hang-dried.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,512
It's all right.
I'm patient. I can wait.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,831
- That's what it was!
- They're...

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,354
They're handcuffs.
We use them on prisoners.

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,592
When you arrest a criminal,
you put this end on his arm

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,036
and you put this end on your own arm,
so he can't escape.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,032
When there are two thieves
and one runs off, then...

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,070
Bingo! This guy can't move.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,119
While you run after that guy,
this guy can't move. He can't escape.

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,156
- I left my keys in my jacket.
- I'll get them.

73
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,630
That must be your cousin.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,075
Hi.

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,877
- It's Chun!
- Really? Tell him I'm not here.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,030
No! He's here to see me.

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,237
- Tell him you're not here.
- He's already seen me!

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,436
Why did I handcuff myself?
I must hide.

79
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,312
I need a hiding place.

80
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,308
I'm just changing.

81
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,396
- Give me a hand.
- Go over there.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,153
- All right, quickly.
- Go that way!

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,559
This way.

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,471
Ow! That hurt!

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,196
- Quick!
- Where will I hide?

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,236
- Under the bed.
- All right.

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,153
- This one here, it's safer.
- All right, the sofa first.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,629
You must get under the bed first.

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,473
- All right, whatever you say.
- Come on, hurry.

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,515
Don't move.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,075
- Sorry, I was just changing.
- That's OK.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,630
- Chun, is this your beat now?
- Yes, it is.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,790
Nice place you have here.

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,671
So, do you have any complaints
about the district?

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,548
- Yes, a lot.
- Really? What are they?

96
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,394
Well, it's becoming dangerous
around here. Just last night...

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,399
Forget it.

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,948
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

99
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,600
- I'll go and make some tea.
- Thank you.

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,639
Oh, no. I've no hot water.
I'll get some drinks from the shop.

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,199
Don't worry.

102
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,637
Chun, do you visit everybody
as part of your police duties?

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,399
Yes, of course.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,274
- I'd better go.
- Good idea.

105
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,876
Bye! Take care, Chun.

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,829
Don't forget if you're ever
in the area, feel free to drop by.

107
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,108
Me?

108
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,954
You're...

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,113
If Chun's gone, I'd better go, too.

110
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,994
What are you doing?

111
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
I thought I'd give you
a goodbye kiss.

112
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,113
No, you don't!

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,512
That was wonderful.

114
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,550
Hurry up now, or you'll be late.

115
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,792
You've had your kiss, now go.

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,952
- When are you going?
- Now.

117
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,508
I promised to meet
some of my officers.

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,519
- Well, OK?
- No. There are two men up there.

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,828
Another two?

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,434
- How did they all get in my house?
- What now?

121
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,435
- Come on, this way.
- Right.

122
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,873
Where are the damn keys?

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,357
Who are the bravest cops in history?

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,112
The Hong Kong blue boys!

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,239
You should see the way we catch them

126
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,550
Rain and hail and heat and typhoon

127
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,315
Nothing stops us, because
we're the toughest cops ever!

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,630
And who are the greatest people
in all Hong Kong?

129
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,119
It's our policemen

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,112
They don't need to catch any robbers

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,758
Because they're the crooks

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,513
They take bribes and get rehousing

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,876
They're clumsy and useless

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,919
Keep going, keep going.

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,838
And Mr Tung,
why do you have a moustache?

136
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,833
Because I'm proud of myself

137
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,637
Who are you? Let's get him!

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,995
- Are you alone?
- What are you doing here?

139
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
- Was it you?
- Go on, beat him up.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,277
- Talk!
- Stab him. Stab his heart.

141
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,193
- Stab his thigh. Kick his ass.
- All right.

142
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,877
He's going to die!

143
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,394
Are you going to talk or not?!

144
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,948
- Go on!
- Don't hit him any more.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,316
- Stop. He's not moving. Is he dead?
- No, he isn't.

146
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,916
Tell us or I'll blow your head off.

147
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,278
Hold it! I've got two hostages.
Move and I'll shoot them both dead.

148
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,590
- We have a hostage, too.
- Choy, are you OK?

149
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,113
Sure, he might live.

150
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,316
OK, we'll exchange a hostage,
but no funny business.

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,753
Move it!

152
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,957
Choy, are you hurt?

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,352
Don't move an inch.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,117
- Sir, he did it!
- Go find the keys for me.

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,952
I was really worried about you.

156
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,152
I work for the dowager empress.

157
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
So what are you doing here, then?

158
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,668
I'm here to arrest rebels.
The Hong Kong police can't touch us.

159
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,273
We have different laws here.

160
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,512
And our laws apply to everyone
in Hong Kong, including you.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,072
Lock him up along with this one here.

162
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,473
Send them back to Manchuria.

163
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,473
I can't find them, sir.
I know, let's shoot the lock off.

164
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,676
- What if you miss?
- I won't.

165
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,478
Lock them up first.

166
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
What about me? Look at me.

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,993
Be careful, sir.

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,756
Don't worry about me,
just get Ma back to the prison.

169
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,070
I'll change my signature next time.

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,758
Chief, your hand.

171
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,717
My hand's holding important evidence
which proves they're thieves.

172
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,553
- Where are your keys? Open it.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,188
I have the cuffs, but not the keys.

174
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,598
All right, I'll take them in.

175
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,549
Dragon, you're not free yet, you
have to be back in prison by sunset.

176
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,550
- I'll take him back.
- I can do that for you, sir.

177
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,791
- Come on, let's go.
- Move it.

178
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,711
You know what to do.

179
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,311
Out of the way! Stand back.

180
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,153
Dragon, you know the rules,
don't you?

181
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,593
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,831
Sir, can you take off the cuffs?
I won't run away.

183
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,797
I don't have my keys with me.

184
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,480
Dragon Ma, you're a dead man!

185
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,153
- Who are you?
- We're victims of your heroism.

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,559
We'll kill you today.

187
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,792
I've nothing to do with this.

188
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,235
Get lost, then.

189
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,997
- What about me?!
- Good luck.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,753
This is for Captain San-po.

191
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,832
My keys! My keys!

192
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,152
- Stop there. Do you know who he is?
- I'm a superintendent.

193
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,351
We don't give a shit!

194
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,518
- Hey, up here.
- What?

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,276
- I said up there.
- I didn't hear you.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,679
Come on, we've got to work together.

197
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,112
- Higher.
- Stop.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,633
Out of the way!

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,832
Not that way.

200
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,553
We're police!
Help, we're being attacked.

201
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,997
This way, come on.

202
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,519
We've got to jump.

203
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,039
Quick!

204
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,431
- Stop there.
- Come on. Quick!

205
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,473
Come on, this way.

206
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,514
Open up. Open up.

207
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,319
Hold it!

208
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,676
- Over here, officer.
- Over here, officer.

209
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,758
Why did you hit me?

210
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,152
Try this.

211
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,478
Come on.

212
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,718
- Come on.
- Upstairs.

213
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,952
No, you don't.

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,833
No, this way.

215
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,953
This way.

216
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,393
Come on.

217
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,077
You almost got me killed!

218
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,719
This way!

219
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,160
You! Tell me who you are
or I'll kill you.

220
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,353
Help!

221
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,119
Come on.

222
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,429
That hurts!

223
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,314
- It's them.
- They're officers!

224
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,960
Get the men inside, hurry!

225
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,191
Come down, the cops are coming.
Let's go.

226
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,832
- Bread?!
- Let's go.

227
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,990
- But it's bread!
- So what?

228
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,999
- They've gone.
- Everyone back to the station.

229
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,310
What?! Go after them!

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,194
- Where are you from, sir?
- Shandong.

231
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,397
- In all Shandong, there's no one...
- ...as tall as me?

232
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,993
No, as clumsy as you.

233
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,672
What's that?

234
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,034
Come on!

235
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,872
Once you're back in Canton,
you'd better keep a low profile.

236
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,236
- There are spies everywhere.
- I'll be careful.

237
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,596
I don't have much time.
Please give this to Maggie.

238
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,558
I hope when we meet again,
it will be in victory.

239
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,868
Sure.

240
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,439
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

241
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,236
It's Chun.

242
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,312
- Hey, Superintendent.
- Warden. Nice to see you here.

243
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,595
- Are you OK?
- He almost got me killed.

244
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,796
- Where are you going?
- Back to my office.

245
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,030
Great, you can take him back to jail.

246
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,758
Have you got the keys?

247
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,632
Go find the others.

248
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,238
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

249
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,039
Goodbye, Dragon.

250
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,108
Goodbye.

251
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,991
- Waiter, a cup of tea.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,111
This isn't the way to the prison.

253
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,350
It's a short cut to another place.

254
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,317
Where?

255
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,872
Hell.

256
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,358
What are you doing? Let me go!

257
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,273
What are you doing?

258
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,759
- Hurry!
- Let me go!

259
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,912
What are you doing?

260
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,354
We'll say he fell
in the water if they ask.

261
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,759
Right.

262
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,474
Come on.

263
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,708
- He doesn't look too good.
- He's hungry.

264
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,758
- How do you know?
- Aren't you hungry?! We all are.

265
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
- His head's real hot.
- He's got a fever.

266
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,870
This is all Dragon Ma's fault.

267
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,351
It's not Ma's fault,
it's all our own fault.

268
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,389
If I'd found us all proper jobs when
we landed instead of looking for Ma,

269
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,596
we'd never have ended up like this.

270
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,319
You should have said that
from the start.

271
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,231
But he killed many of our brothers.

272
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,950
It's his job, he's a policeman,
like it's our job to kill people.

273
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,077
- Why didn't you say that before?
- Yeah!

274
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,754
Who cares? Let's see
what's wrong with him first.

275
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,193
Are you all right?

276
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,876
I'm hot and cold.

277
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,074
- The hot and cold thing!
- What?!

278
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,913
- We've got to get some medicine.
- Come on.

279
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,916
- Thank you for letting my men go.
- Is there anything else I can do?

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,992
I came here to capture
some assassins.

281
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,036
Is our Government offering any help?

282
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,759
There's a reward of 5,000 taels
for each of them.

283
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,910
Maybe I can be of help then.

284
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,073
Chun, that will be brilliant.

285
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,835
- It was you who saved my life.
- If we didn't do what Chun asked,

286
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,070
you wouldn't have gone to jail.

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,674
- We owed you one.
- Why did you set me up?

288
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,957
We needed money to buy weapons,
so we did a deal with Chun.

289
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,191
Then we realised
we'd helped him set up a good cop.

290
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,759
Where's the necklace?

291
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,991
It's in the Commissioner's study,
inside one of his books.

292
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,752
You did save my life.
I guess I'll let it go this time.

293
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,717
- Are you going?
- Don't worry.

294
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,476
- I won't tell anyone your secret.
- That'll only help our revolution.

295
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,755
- But you still worry us.
- Really?

296
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,115
- You still want to be a cop?
- What else can I do?

297
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,760
Join us, the revolution.

298
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,712
If we had comrades like you,
we'd have a better chance.

299
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,153
I won't join you.

300
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,710
Are you still angry
about what we did?

301
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,360
You've got to bend the rules
to achieve a noble goal.

302
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,910
We're even prepared to sacrifice
our lives for the revolution.

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,516
That's exactly why I can't join.
There's no way I can bend the rules.

304
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,114
However noble the cause,
I can't change.

305
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,069
As far as I'm concerned, I couldn't
break the law to achieve any goal.

306
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,229
However, I do admire you.
I think one day you'll succeed.

307
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,269
I understand that to overthrow the
Government, lots of people must die.

308
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,112
But I won't ask people to do that

309
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,352
because I don't know what will be
left once the sacrifices are over.

310
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,238
So I'll remain a policeman.

311
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,711
I think every life is precious and
I want everyone to have a happy life.

312
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,076
A country of 400,000,000 people
is made up of individuals.

313
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,630
If they hate their lives,
how can they love their country?

314
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,757
I see what you mean.
I'll remember your words.

315
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,832
We're both working
for the people but in different ways.

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,354
So being a policeman
is noble after all.

317
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,831
But they won't let any good policemen
exist in a colonial region.

318
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,273
They'll destroy you.

319
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,316
I'm here to fight those people.

320
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,637
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

321
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,956
Uncle Koon,
she only left me a letter.

322
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,510
- Why did she leave in such a hurry?
- Maybe it was urgent.

323
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,433
- Thank you. I'm going. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

324
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,474
OK, I'll go.

325
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,952
- Give me that axe.
- Let's hope this works.

326
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,473
Be nice.

327
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,633
Excuse me, brother, I need some
medicine, and can I pay later?

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,631
Sorry, we don't do that here.

329
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,517
But a life is at stake.

330
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,953
We're not a charity.

331
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,635
If everybody was like you,
we'd soon be out of business.

332
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,073
- Give it to him.
- Right.

333
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,472
But I'd like to know who you are
and what I did to offend you.

334
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,958
Perhaps I arrested your friends
by mistake before.

335
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,914
Wan, I'm going.
You can put it on my slate.

336
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,231
- My friend.
- My friend.

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,549
- What's wrong with your friend?
- The hot and cold thing.

338
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,074
- What?
- It's probably typhoid.

339
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,474
Keep quiet!

340
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,873
Uncle Koon, run!

341
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,997
Now you have a warrant,
no one will stop you.

342
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,752
This way please, sir.

343
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,029
- Move along.
- This is police work.

344
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,994
Here he is.

345
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,911
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, look.

346
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,276
- I saw Dragon Ma, too.
- Did you kill him?

347
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,749
No, he paid for the medicine.

348
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,557
They're all upstairs.

349
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,274
Uncle Koon, you first.

350
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,952
- See you later.
- Keep it.

351
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,995
Come on.

352
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,275
- It's Dragon Ma.
- Why is he still alive?

353
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,031
- Here, take this.
- Be careful.

354
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,833
Come on.

355
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,918
- Mr Chun, is something wrong?
- No, it's just an arrest.

356
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,278
- But we heard gunshots.
- None of your business, carry on.

357
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,509
Go on!

358
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,192
Move along.

359
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,479
Get going!

360
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,270
Dragon Ma, I'm going to kill you.

361
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,831
- Move it.
- Hurry it up.

362
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,188
I think this is
what you're looking for.

363
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,191
Chun, why the hell are doing this?

364
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,193
I'll tell you, you have your
conditions and I have mine.

365
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,590
Thank you. This is the one.

366
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,636
Yan-kit, why did you betray us?

367
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,392
You bastard!

368
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,919
So what? I'm merely carrying out
my duty to arrest rebels.

369
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,479
What do you want?

370
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,433
- Chun.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,832
- Your reward.
- Thank you, sir.

372
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,673
- And the others?
- I'll take them back with me.

373
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,320
- The boxes are ready, sir.
- Damn you, Chun!

374
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,952
- You were saying?
- Do you know what you're doing?

375
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,469
- What are you suggesting?
- You won't get away with this.

376
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,596
Don't worry, I will get away with it.

377
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,468
What have you got against me?
You were against me from the start.

378
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,519
I've nothing against you personally,
but you keep interfering.

379
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,158
And you had my men arrested.

380
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,313
The longer I let you live,
the more problems you'll cause me.

381
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,914
I was just doing my job
as a policeman.

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,790
You're a good cop, I'm a bad cop,
so we're never going to see eye to eye.

383
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,395
It's either you or me.
Do you understand?

384
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,473
That's enough. I'm not interested in
listening to your stories.

385
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,155
That's right. You'd better leave
before the night market starts.

386
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,231
But I don't want that man around.

387
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,154
Of course, I intend taking care
of him after you leave.

388
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,956
- Get on with it.
- Let's do it.

389
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,273
- Help!
- Maggie.

390
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,271
- Shut up!
- She knows nothing.

391
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,636
Forget her. I have something
special in mind for you.

392
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,280
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir. Move!

393
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,032
- Move it!
- Stop that!

394
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,232
Throw him in there.

395
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,069
- Go help the others.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,876
Yan-kit, switch it on.

397
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,159
Don't think you can get out of there.
It's impossible.

398
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,998
This batch of soy sauce
will be delicious.

399
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,878
Our company is famous for its sauce
and it's for export only.

400
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,159
Your flesh and blood will be in every
bottle, all to be shipped overseas.

401
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,549
Isn't that wonderful? Well?

402
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,313
You're doing fine.

403
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,718
Let's see how long
you can keep it up.

404
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,438
I think we need to add a little oil.

405
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,070
A little more there.

406
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,598
- He's escaped!
- After him!

407
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,753
Run!

408
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,830
Get the notebook.

409
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,309
Come on, hurry. Use the stairwell!

410
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,316
- What's up?
- It's a dead end.

411
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,958
Come on, this way.

412
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,399
Hurry! This way.

413
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,796
Hurry!

414
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,274
- Hurry up!
- Get a move on.

415
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,232
Don't let them escape.

416
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,833
You'll have to climb down.

417
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,035
- It's all right. Don't be afraid.
- No.

418
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,398
Take the basket.

419
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,598
- Come on.
- Hold on.

420
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,911
Just do like I do. I'll go first.

421
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,759
I'll catch you on the ground.

422
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,236
Go on, jump!

423
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,033
- You're safe. You can get off me.
- Quick!

424
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,159
This way.

425
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,191
Come on. Quick, but be careful.

426
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,748
Quick! Help her.

427
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,188
Help!

428
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,438
Try to find a foothold. Hurry up.

429
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,359
Give me your hand.

430
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,317
Don't come any closer.

431
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,559
Hold on tight!

432
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,156
Jump, I'll catch you.
No. Wait a minute, I'll get a board.

433
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,670
Go on, jump!

434
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,799
Let go! Come on!

435
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,518
- Take the notebook.
- You keep that. I can't make it.

436
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,556
Take the notebook and leave here.

437
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,033
We'll never escape.

438
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,354
- All right.
- Go!

439
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,472
Keep an eye on those two.

440
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,437
Block the exit.

441
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,752
Dragon Ma?!

442
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,477
- Give us the notebook.
- I've eaten it.

443
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,872
- Give it back and we'll let you go.
- If I'd wanted to go, I'd be gone.

444
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,393
Enough talk.

445
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,949
- We'll give you one more chance.
- No thanks. I don't need any more.

446
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,834
Get him!

447
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,273
- It's fits me.
- Get going.

448
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,032
- How do I look?
- Get going.

449
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,468
Go on.

450
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,795
Go to hell!

451
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,911
Luck is on my side.

452
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,833
Get the notebook.

453
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,639
Have you got it?

454
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,597
What are you doing?

455
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,352
Why did you hit him?

456
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,633
Get him!

457
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,269
You go that way.

458
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,479
Go back!

459
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,719
- Go and block his exit.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,277
Dragon Ma is not our friend.

461
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,673
But if you lay a finger on him,
we won't be very happy.

462
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,875
That's right.

463
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,676
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

464
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,715
Chief, Mr Chun has the situation covered.

465
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,028
Hold it!

466
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,076
- It's the warden.
- Bastards!

467
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,391
Excuse me, I have an appointment.

468
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,636
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

469
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,669
Hold it, Chun!

470
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,993
Here's your money.

471
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,268
Don't pull the rope
or the whole thing will come down.

472
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,829
Look out, it's falling.
Get out of the way!

473
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,278
Make sure Dragon's all right.

474
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,911
Thank you, whoever you are.

475
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,069
He's all right!

476
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,151
Chun's under there!

477
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,711
- Let my men go free.
- Why?

478
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,634
I'm a representative of
the Ching Government.

479
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,314
My men were acting in self-defence.

480
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,755
They must be allowed to leave.

481
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,599
What did you say?

482
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,310
- Did you hear that?
- No, sir.

483
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,914
- You hear what he said?
- Not a thing.

484
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,752
That's just what I thought.

485
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,952
- Dragon, are you all right?
- Yes, sir.

486
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,393
You're finished!

487
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,158
Let them go.

488
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,755
- Thank you.
- No need, I owe you one.

489
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,956
Dragon, what's going on here?

490
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,792
Dragon Ma.

491
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,516
- Do you remember why we came here?
- Yes, we do.

492
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,160
He's dead. Let's go.

493
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,234
- Dragon, who are they?
- Just some friends.

494
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,710
- You didn't introduce us.
- That's because I don't know them.

495
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,199
Dismissed!

496
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,951
Dismissed!
