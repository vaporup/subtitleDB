1
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,309
- Give me a hand here.
- I'm coming.

2
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,395
How is he?

3
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,472
- Get him out of the water first.
- Gator! Gator!

4
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,634
- Gator's dead.
- We're in Hong Kong.

5
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,635
When we were at sea with San-po,
we wanted for nothing.

6
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,518
We had everything. Now look at us.

7
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,431
We're washed up here like driftwood.

8
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,351
Who did all this to us?

9
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,556
Dragon Ma, I'll rip you into pieces.

10
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,712
Right, let's all make a solemn oath.

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,195
We're all agreed -
Dragon Ma must die.

12
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,559
Good morning, Mr Chun.

13
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,433
- This way.
- Morning.

14
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,033
- Morning.
- Morning.

15
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,189
Please sit inside.

16
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,316
- The usual?
- Yes, thank you.

17
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,552
- The bill.
- Bill, please.

18
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,912
They're prepared to go to jail.
Their families will be compensated.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,514
- And the reporters?
- They're upstairs.

20
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,512
- We're ready when you are.
- Let's order some food.

21
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,072
The stuffs upstairs.

22
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,037
- I'll get it for you.
- Thanks.

23
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,156
- Please wait here.
- Help yourself.

24
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,757
- Don't move! This is a stick-up!
- Don't move!

25
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,356
- No!
- My money!

26
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,117
My money...

27
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,076
- Don't move!
- It's time to leave.

28
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,710
Stop them!

29
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,990
- Robbery!
- Check it out.

30
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,111
Police, hold it!

31
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,994
Sir!

32
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,070
- Take them away.
- Go check out the shop.

33
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,679
Mr Chun.

34
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,557
Chan-jim.

35
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,756
- We're reporters.
- You're everywhere.

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,831
- We'll take a photo.
- Come on.

37
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,674
- Not for me.
- You caught the men so easily.

38
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,514
- Were you acting on a tip-off?
- No, I was just on my beat as usual.

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,751
Mr Chun, do you mind being called
Lightening Chun?

40
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,070
To tell the truth I'm very flattered.

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,948
- What are you charging them with?
- Robbery and assaulting an officer.

42
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,191
Let's take a photo.
Stand closer. Grab his neck.

43
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,830
Sir! The shop owner is dead.

44
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,272
- They should be charged with murder.
- I agree with you.

45
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,509
What?

46
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,272
We just did what you told us!

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,113
- We didn't murder him!
- Lock them up!

48
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,068
Stop there.

49
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,195
I only got $300! You promised...

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,359
They were escaping.
Take away the bodies!

51
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,956
Mr Chun, over here.

52
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,318
May I have an explanation?

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,359
We all knew that
Chun has been staging his arrests.

54
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,476
Now the public's aware of it, too.

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,755
If you hadn't pushed him so much,

56
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,434
he wouldn't have had to
falsify his arrests.

57
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,033
You gave him three districts!

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,317
Chun is the only Chinese policeman
who can carry a gun.

59
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,879
I knew this would happen.

60
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,839
- I'm against them carrying weapons.
- Are you against paying them, too?

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,629
The situation should dictate
which officer carries a weapon,

62
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,075
not the officer's nationality.

63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,276
And they should be
paid the same, too.

64
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,273
We'll address that another time.
Let's concentrate on Chun here.

65
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,558
He's responsible for three districts.
It's not easy to sack him.

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,749
We'll ease him out slowly,
starting with Sai Wan district.

67
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,512
But who'll replace him?

68
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,670
I have a man in mind.

69
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,957
The man who carried out
Project A so successfully.

70
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,039
Take them back!

71
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,391
Sir, but I'm not qualified.

72
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,597
No one knows that
and it's worth a try.

73
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,670
It'll be a change of scenery for you.

74
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,149
This is for your outstanding service.
Congratulations!

75
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,554
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

76
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,394
We'd also like to relieve you
of some pressure.

77
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,833
That's not necessary.

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,151
We don't want our top officer
overburdened.

79
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,916
So we're handing over one of
your districts to a new man.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,718
We've received some new guns.

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,634
Your gun's been in service a long time.
I want to have it checked.

82
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,995
See if you need a new one.

83
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,758
Reporting for duty, sir.

84
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,355
Dragon, now you're Chun's assistant
in Sai Wan district.

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,271
These are your official orders.

86
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,277
From now on,
you and Chun will work together.

87
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,238
If you've got any questions, ask him.

88
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,072
It's an honour to work with you.

89
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,711
Welcome, I'm quite sure you'll be
a valuable addition to the district.

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,836
Let me know if you need anything.

91
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,718
Chun, you may have lost
one district,

92
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,112
but the Commissioner
will see you gain another.

93
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,235
Really?

94
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,878
You never know.

95
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,118
I see. I see.

96
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,477
The corrupt Manchurian Government
has made our country poor.

97
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,030
- We have become an inferior race.
- Would you like to buy a flower?

98
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,954
If we want to save China,
we have to have the right attitude.

99
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,636
To enjoy a decent standard of living,
we have to overthrow the Government.

100
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,874
Dr Sun set up the "Revive China Society"
to support the revolution.

101
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,430
China cannot be saved
by speeches alone, we need action.

102
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,830
We need weapons
and the money to buy them.

103
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,148
Police.

104
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,438
Thank you for listening.

105
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,397
Would you like to buy a flower?

106
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,599
Maggie!

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,956
- Regina!
- Stop here.

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,510
- Where have you been?
- Were you looking for me?

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,875
- Not really. Where are you going?
- Sai Wan.

110
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,393
Hop in.

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,835
My cousin, Carina -
my classmate, Regina.

112
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,117
- Haven't seen you before.
- She's just arrived.

113
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,194
I'm having a party next week.
You're invited.

114
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,397
- Is it your birthday party?
- They're always such fun.

115
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,515
Bring Carina.

116
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,431
- Will you come?
- What will I wear?

117
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,511
- She'll lend you something.
- Sure.

118
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,115
Support the revolution
and buy a flower.

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,272
- No, thank you.
- Can I have one?

120
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,909
If he wants to save China,
give me one, too.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,151
- Good idea, I'll have one, too.
- Thank you, sirs.

122
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,398
- You're right. I'll have one, too.
- How much?

123
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,315
Sir, the revolution will succeed
if everyone was like you.

124
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,674
I hope so.

125
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,438
- Thank you.
- Where do you usually sell these?

126
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,557
Wherever there are people
to buy them.

127
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,432
Come on, eat.

128
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,709
- What is it?
- The police, hide the boxes.

129
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,953
You're spreading rumours,
disturbing the peace and racketeering, right?

130
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,190
- You have no proof.
- The flowers you have are the proof.

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,913
And look at the flowers you sold.

132
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,310
You men are my witnesses.
Did this woman sell you the flowers?

133
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,833
No.

134
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,075
What's that?!

135
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,277
What the hell are you doing
with flowers in your jackets?

136
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,990
We're pen pals meeting for the first time,
and as we don't know each other

137
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,392
the girls said they'd hold baskets
and we said we'd wear a rose.

138
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,517
We didn't see you there!
You should hold them higher.

139
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,874
Come on, sit down.

140
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,029
You look much prettier
than your handwriting.

141
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,398
Let me introduce everyone -
Mr A, I'm Mr B, Mr C, Mr D. Sit down.

142
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,311
Is it an offence to meet pen pals?

143
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,036
I must admit you won this time.

144
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,153
Watch out. Don't let me
catch you selling flowers.

145
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,038
And we're not used
to making idle threats either.

146
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,233
Some tea, miss?

147
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,835
I hate those who oppress us
on behalf of their foreign masters.

148
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,992
Right. They think they're wonderful
under that uniform.

149
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,913
- They're morons. Don't you agree?
- Not really.

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,958
There are cops who are honest
and hardworking.

151
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,554
- I've never met any.
- Yes, you have!

152
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,791
We're all policemen.
We've never oppressed anyone.

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,477
- So all of you are policemen.
- Excuse us.

154
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,713
Miss,
China depends on patriots like you.

155
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,756
Don't forget your money boxes.

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,596
Dragon, if they weren't so beautiful,
do you think you'd have helped them?

157
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,989
- Cheque, waiter.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,711
Those policemen were really kind.

159
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,519
If it wasn't for them,
we'd have been in trouble.

160
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,433
There aren't any good policemen.

161
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,432
- How many did you sell?
- Quite a few.

162
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,317
It's your lucky day.

163
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,072
- And you?
- Not much.

164
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,155
- Help!
- Help!

165
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,231
Come back!

166
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,032
No, you don't.

167
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,516
So it's you again.
What's going on?

168
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,832
- They tried to rob those ladies.
- Come on, make way.

169
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,796
- Really? What ladies?
- Make way. Come on.

170
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,235
Don't block our way. Move along.

171
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,276
Strange, where did they go?

172
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,991
- Officer, what's up?
- Nothing. Take them to the station.

173
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,753
You can tell me
what this is all about.

174
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,593
- I'd like to see the man in charge.
- He's talking.

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,557
- Sir?
- What?

176
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,276
- We work for Tiger.
- That's right.

177
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,590
- Still, that's no excuse.
- That's right.

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,240
- But we didn't rob those ladies.
- Really?

179
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,790
- How did you know they were ladies?
- Be quiet! Who asked you?

180
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,235
- Look, is Sergeant Chi here?
- Sergeant Chi?

181
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,629
You lost.
Do I place the same bet again?

182
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,513
- Make it a dollar.
- Really?

183
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,635
Yeah.

184
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,598
Wait, they want to see Sergeant Chi.

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,195
This way.

186
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,670
Right, you lot, sign here.

187
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,073
You shouldn't be messing
things up like that!

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,277
- We didn't, sir.
- Bullshit.

189
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,909
- 201, show these two out.
- Get out of here.

190
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,797
- Can I speak now?
- What do you want to say? Go ahead.

191
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,189
- I want to see your superior.
- Why?

192
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,232
I want to report
some police irregularities.

193
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,312
All right.
Shang, take them to the back room.

194
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,591
Wait! One at a time.
You come with me.

195
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,957
- Sung!
- Coming.

196
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,712
This way.

197
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,476
- So where is he?
- Our superior is right here.

198
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,836
Now what's this about police irregularities?

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,478
You can tell him.

200
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,553
You didn't expect your little show
earlier today would go unpunished?

201
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,636
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

202
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,517
No, help me. Can somebody help?!

203
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,471
Don't. Don't do that.

204
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,956
Stay right there. I'm the new
superintendent for Sai Wan.

205
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,076
Here's my appointment.

206
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,120
Superintendent, a terrible mistake.

207
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,272
If police officers believe
they can use their power

208
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,839
for personal attacks

209
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,071
and use their position
to protect criminals...

210
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,391
- that's also a mistake.
- Sir, you mustn't believe that.

211
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,516
I just saw it with my own eyes.

212
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,159
Who do you think you are?

213
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,391
If this is the way it's going to be,
then I'm quitting.

214
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,675
Right, you can do all our jobs.

215
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,430
So you've never made a mistake?

216
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,590
You really want
everyone here to quit?

217
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,113
All right, I quit!

218
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,829
What has got into you boys?
He's saying it's for your own good.

219
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,559
Please, don't take
any notice of them.

220
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,315
If every officer does his duty,
then I'll ignore what happened.

221
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,753
Hear that?

222
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,717
Welcome, Superintendent Ma!

223
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,719
A little welcome present for you, sir.

224
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,678
- From all the boys?
- Yes, sir.

225
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,232
So Sai Wan is a good place
to make money.

226
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,515
Just to show our appreciation.

227
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,388
But there's one constable who
refused to show his appreciation.

228
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,435
Who's that?

229
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,159
Constable Ho,
he's still out on the beat.

230
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,593
Send him in when he returns.

231
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,035
Yes, sir. Let me know
if you need anything.

232
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,872
All right.

233
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,398
Sir, that's a lovely flower you have.

234
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,559
Thank you.

235
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,152
Look. He's been
on the wanted list for three years!

236
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,949
He's the suspect for many recent cases.
He still lives in Sai Wan.

237
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,598
He's down as a suspect here.

238
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,514
So why haven't they arrested him?
Maybe they didn't want to.

239
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,349
- Superintendent. Constable Ho, sir.
- You didn't contribute. Why?

240
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,749
As I don't take bribes,
I couldn't afford to.

241
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,355
- So the others take bribes, then?
- I didn't say that.

242
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,273
If you don't wise up,
you won't stay in your job long.

243
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,272
My job is to serve the people
and uphold the law.

244
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,480
- I'd rather quit than accept bribes.
- You sound like an honest man.

245
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,599
Tell me about all these unsolved
cases where no one's been arrested.

246
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,515
Tiger Au's the kingpin around here.
I'd love to arrest him.

247
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,797
But I don't have the power.
He's got lots of guards.

248
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,270
- These criminals are his men.
- So where does he hang around?

249
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,158
He runs most of the illegal
businesses in Sai Wan.

250
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,356
He's usually at Po Luk Hotel.

251
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,477
Tell the other officers
to come in early tomorrow.

252
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,950
All right, as long as each of you
does your duty, I'll be happy.

253
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,076
I don't need envelopes.

254
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,590
Would you like to
live near a brothel?

255
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,037
Or see your own children
gamble or smoke opium

256
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,588
knowing the damage they do
to the family?

257
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,036
You wouldn't like it and neither
would Sai Wan residents.

258
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,510
But brothels, gambling
and opium dens exist everywhere

259
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,114
and you all know who owns them.

260
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,636
It is our duty to protect
this community and I intend to do it.

261
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,598
Therefore starting today,
we're going to clean it up.

262
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,835
Let's go.

263
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,230
Superintendent, if you've enough men,
I'll stay here.

264
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,038
- Can I have a day off?
- Why?

265
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,635
- Can I have a day off, too?
- Tell me why. One by one.

266
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,799
- My wife's pregnant.
- My sister's pregnant.

267
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,917
- What a coincidence!
- My sister is his wife.

268
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,672
- My wife is his sister.
- Yeah.

269
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,432
- Sir, can I resign now?
- For what reason?

270
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm the only child in my family.
So I'd rather not go.

271
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,871
Me, too. For what I'm paid,
it isn't worth the risk, so I quit.

272
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,520
- I quit, too.
- Me, as well.

273
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,634
All right, operation cancelled.

274
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,594
Dismissed.

275
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,189
But Dragon...

276
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,158
Come on.

277
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,754
Now you see why I'm so fed up.
They never want to do any real work.

278
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,717
They made Dragon cancel his plan.

279
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,236
What do you mean?
There are good reasons for that.

280
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,835
Maybe he wants someone
to check Tiger out first.

281
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,677
No. He's testing the men to see
who's brave and who's a coward.

282
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,399
Now he knows he can't trust anyone.
Am I right?

283
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,712
He's right. We've been with Dragon so
long now, we know how his mind works.

284
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,233
Oh, really?

285
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,471
- Right now it's not working.
- Are you kidding?!

286
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,996
If this operation fails,
we'll have to leave this place.

287
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,436
He's right.
We can't fail or we're finished.

288
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,117
Mars, I want you to take a note
to the marines.

289
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,157
- You're asking for a transfer back?!
- We'll go and arrest Tiger tonight.

290
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,311
Well, it's been ages
since we were all together.

291
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,992
To your health.

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,509
Tiger, I hear you have
a small job for us.

293
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,353
That's right.
I just met Chun.

294
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,228
His Sai Wan district
has been given to some new upstart.

295
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,192
We'll wait for Mars here.
You go check the place out.

296
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,235
Thank you.

297
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,519
We've changed clothes,
why are they staring?

298
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,272
Your hat's on backwards.

299
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,752
- How about now?
- That will do.

300
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,353
- What's this for?
- Here.

301
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,069
Forget that.
Let's get something to eat first.

302
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,072
Tiger, if we've lost
Chun's protection,

303
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,991
who'll look after our interests?

304
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,471
Since he's asking for a favour,
we have to help him no matter what.

305
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,590
As soon as this new guy shows
his face around these parts

306
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,477
we'll fix him permanently.

307
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,472
Why wait for him to come out?
Go fix him at the station.

308
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,031
Who is he anyway?
Is he some kind of monster or what?

309
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,951
Mars, over here.

310
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,715
I spoke to Ying.

311
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,678
She said the marines were
off training somewhere.

312
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,035
Is the operation still on?

313
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,635
- We'll do it on our own.
- We can't back down now.

314
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,393
Not much happening.

315
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,710
- What did you say his name was?
- Dragon Ma.

316
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,548
Dragon Ma?

317
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,359
Remember the one
that killed the pirates?

318
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,798
- Which one of you is Tiger?
- I am.

319
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,750
In that case, you're coming
down to the station.

320
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,276
- To the station? Who are you?
- Superintendent Dragon Ma.

321
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,310
You're wanted in connection
with 3 murders, 4 robberies,

322
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,914
one case of arson and 3 of assault.

323
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,911
This is the warrant.

324
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,797
I did all those things?

325
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,438
Let me see that.

326
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,991
Sorry, I missed.

327
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,111
Dragon, are we leaving?

328
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,393
Stop the music.

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,955
Stop it.

330
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,999
All right, we're police officers.
If you've no business here, out!

331
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,313
Time to go.
Come on, everybody. Come on.

332
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,192
Dragon Ma.

333
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,111
Nice of you to drop by.
I wanted to meet you.

334
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,954
Right, I've always wanted to meet
the famous Dragon Ma.

335
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,359
You must be after me.

336
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,228
Those two Causeway Bay murders,
I did both of them.

337
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,032
You'd better arrest me, too, because
I'm going to kill a policeman soon.

338
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,716
Dragon Ma, didn't anyone tell you?
You're dead.

339
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,872
One day I'll die for sure
like everybody else.

340
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,869
In the meantime, you're under arrest.

341
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,398
Dragon!

342
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,436
Dragon, the third unit are outside,
awaiting orders.

343
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,673
Dragon!

344
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,594
The other two units
are all in position.

345
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,838
No one told me about this.

346
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,388
Don't just stand there.
Get them in here.

347
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,277
- Get them in here.
- Right.

348
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,072
I'll tell them to charge.

349
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,473
They're all ready.

350
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,588
Forget it. No more bluffing,
we're all alone.

351
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,798
You've got courage.

352
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,637
You shouldn't be worried about
arresting anyone,

353
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,474
You should be more worried about
getting out of here alive.

354
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,436
- The doors.
- Right.

355
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,879
Steady.

356
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,313
- Steady.
- Steady.

357
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,993
- Steady.
- Steady.

358
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,953
Get out of here!

359
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,359
Steady!

360
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,313
What do we do now?

361
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,551
Now...

362
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,279
don't think
you're getting out of here.

363
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,435
Get them!

364
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,475
Look out!

365
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,157
Bastard! Let me teach you
a good lesson.

366
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,439
Bastard!

367
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,359
Arrest me?!

368
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,509
You'd need more lives
than a cat to arrest me.

369
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,116
- You four kneel down. Go get him!
- Right!

370
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,675
Had enough yet?

371
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,478
Don't forget my name is Wong.

372
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,717
Forward!

373
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,196
Upstairs. Spread out!

374
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,356
Dragon, are you all right?

375
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,916
Dragon, what a surprise!
I see you're hard at work.

376
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,278
How's it going?

377
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,477
They were resisting arrest.

378
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,553
Really? I see, take them away.

379
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,631
Hold it. What?

380
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,475
Are we pirates? Are we smugglers?

381
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,840
This is dry land,
you can't arrest us here!

382
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,708
I realise that, sir. But I suspect
there are pirates in this hotel.

383
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,999
Superintendent, please carry on,
I wouldn't want to interrupt you.

384
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,636
Lock them up.

385
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,395
Round them up,
take them back to the base

386
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,994
and question them
to see if they are pirates.

387
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,478
You. You. Round them up.
Take them back to the base!

388
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,471
Fall in.

389
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,275
Take them away.

390
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,360
- Are you all right?
- You could have come quicker.

391
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,271
- Move it.
- Come on.

392
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,113
- Thank you. I owe you one.
- They were out at sea.

393
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,873
They came as soon as
they got the message.

394
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,838
Dragon Ma!

395
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,478
- If it wasn't...
- Shut up!

396
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,559
Hold it!

397
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,391
Release these two.

398
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,394
If you two manage to walk
out of this place, you can go free.

399
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,078
Right, leave us.

400
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,593
You, too.

401
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,630
Lock them up!

402
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,034
You're still the same.

403
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,754
If police work was that easy,
I'd have taken your job long ago.

404
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,193
I know, sir.

405
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,480
Just remember,
you're still one of us.

406
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,391
We must go fishing again.

407
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,393
Dragon, Father says things are very
different on land, especially here.

408
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,357
You have to be careful.

409
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,231
Take them back to the station.

410
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,276
Move it! Go on!

411
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,190
- How was it?
- It's Dragon Ma for sure.

412
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,998
- Let's kill him!
- Let's do it.

413
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,389
How?
They've got an entire army out there.

414
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,550
The police were looking for pirates.

415
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,200
See? They've already
got wind of our plan.

416
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,555
- What do we do now?
- We can go to bed early.

417
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,313
- Where do we sleep?
- Where do we sleep?

418
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,914
We can't kill him now,
so we'll find a hotel.

419
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,274
We have to wait.

420
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,553
- You're here.
- Yeah.

421
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,039
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

422
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,918
- Chun, are you taking those files?
- I was going to.

423
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,675
- But I'll need them when I'm back.
- Really? When will you be back?

424
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,309
I believe it will be soon.
Not everyone can sit in this chair.

425
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,549
You're right, sir.

426
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,238
Find a place to store them.
He'll be back soon.

427
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,837
Sergeant, could you...?

428
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,958
Dragon Ma!

429
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,390
I've always wanted to arrest these
gangsters, and now you've done it.

430
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,993
- This is terrific.
- Thanks.

431
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,479
- Chun.
- Shut up!

432
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,312
- What do you mean?
- Lock them up.

433
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,960
- You've changed your tune.
- Take them away.

434
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,519
- Chun!
- Shut up!

435
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,076
Do you hear me?! Take them away!

436
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,916
Do you hear me? Take them away!

437
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,394
201.

438
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,948
Put Tiger in the security block.

439
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,598
267, 357.

440
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,240
Put Wong here in cell two.

441
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,037
282, take some men
and seal off the hotel.

442
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,039
Sergeant Ching.

443
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,874
Lock up the rest of this rabble
and take their statements.

444
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,474
The rest start working on
the wanted criminals.

445
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,391
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

446
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,433
Get to work.

447
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,434
Get going!

448
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,438
You've been working very hard.
Take a break.

449
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,599
See you later.

450
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,273
That's right, sir.
You put your feet up.

451
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,316
I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.

452
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,713
- These files, where do I put them?
- Idiot! Put them away.

453
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,557
Dragon, the Commissioner is extremely
pleased with the way the raid went.

454
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,439
Don't thank me.
And we can't give you any medals yet.

455
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,954
Remember, don't get carried away.

456
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,157
- No, I won't, sir.
- I'm here to make sure you don't.

457
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,675
Keep your eyes peeled at
the Commissioner's daughter's party.

458
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,318
I'll be on the alert.

459
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,958
That's not good enough.

460
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,919
You must anticipate
Chun's every move to cause trouble.

461
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,277
If anything goes wrong,
you'll be blamed.

462
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,998
Thanks for the advice, sir.

463
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,753
You'd better get
something smart to wear.

464
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,628
You and your men need new clothes.
This ought to cover things.

465
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,711
This rat won't even feed one of us.

466
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,633
Where are you going?

467
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,156
To rob a shop.
I want to eat proper food, not rats.

468
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,515
- We've got nothing to lose.
- That's true.

469
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,716
But we've come to kill Ma.

470
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,917
If we go out,
we'll be arrested in a matter of minutes,

471
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,912
then we'll never avenge
the death of our captain.

472
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,150
Shall I make rat soup?

473
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,708
I haven't eaten meat soup for ages.

474
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,995
Guys, I've talked to Chun.

475
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,675
I've agreed to steal a necklace
at the birthday party.

476
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,079
I don't get it.

477
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,628
We're not doing this for Chun.

478
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,951
We are doing this for the revolution.

479
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,838
He'll pay good money
and we can use it for weapons.

480
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,040
- Does Chun know your background?
- He knows I smuggle weapons.

481
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,759
- But he thinks I'm a thief.
- That's great.

482
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,478
I think we should give it a try.

483
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,030
By the way, before I left Canton,
Dr Sun gave me a warning.

484
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,554
After the murder
of the governor of Canton,

485
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,315
the dowager empress sent
secret agents to arrest us.

486
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,756
Tell Maggie and Carina
to be careful selling flowers.

487
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,476
Dismissed. Come with me.

488
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,198
- I found it.
- What did you find?

489
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,679
- Lobster.
- Really?!

490
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,513
- It's a lobster's shell.
- Only the shell.

491
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,114
- Here's some fish.
- That's nice.

492
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,951
- What did you find out?
- Normally...

493
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,953
they're spread out all over the city.
It's hard to know where they are.

494
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,953
But Carina's often seen around here
when she sells flowers.

495
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,439
We could start with her.

496
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,878
This time we must liquidate
all of them.

497
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,553
Yes, of course.

498
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,715
It's beautiful!

499
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,117
I feel stupid dressed like this.

500
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,236
- Don't be silly.
- But I do.

501
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,436
We'll change inside.

502
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,109
It's Mr B.

503
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,555
The invitation's for one person only.

504
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,478
It says here one person.

505
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,791
But can't she come with me, please?

506
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,794
Sure, I don't think
that will be a problem.

507
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,919
- Maggie. You finally turned up.
- You're late.

508
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,479
Come on!

509
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,713
Why are you late?

510
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,268
- You go first.
- Make it quick.

511
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,117
Come on, let's find you some dresses.

512
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,908
That gentleman wouldn't let my cousin
in without an invitation.

513
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,353
- And who are you?
- We're policemen.

514
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,233
We're here for security.

515
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,072
And what's your name?

516
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,718
This is Dragon Ma.

517
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,876
I forgot to give her the invitation,
may she come in?

518
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,109
Of course.

519
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,230
- Thank you. Come on!
- Thank you, Mr Ma.

520
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,276
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

521
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,315
Tell Mars to keep an eye on them.

522
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,195
- Who are they?
- The man's called Man.

523
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,511
- I don't know the woman's name.
- Beware of strangers.

524
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,639
Thank you.

525
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,153
She's very pretty.

526
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,674
- Do you know who she is?
- I've no idea, sir.

527
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,796
So no one can introduce me then?

528
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,871
I'll introduce her to you, sir.

529
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,880
She's not a friend of yours?

530
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,398
- Are you ready?
- Go ahead.

531
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,950
This way. The necklace is
in the office behind the painting.

532
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,156
- Breathe in.
- Nearly.

533
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,513
That should do it.

534
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,068
This dress is very tight.

535
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,912
They're all like that.

536
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,638
- Get the back.
- Don't move.

537
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,269
- That's enough. What do you think?
- Lovely!

538
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,194
So you were brought up in Shanghai,
but you don't have an accent.

539
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,193
Maybe I don't, but you don't have to
have athlete's foot to be an athlete.

540
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,235
Sorry.

541
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,279
Miss, you're really witty.
I like meeting people like you.

542
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,397
He says that to all the ladies.
Don't listen to him.

543
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,075
Your Excellency has found
a rare pearl indeed.

544
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,839
You look wonderful in this dress.

545
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,996
- Better stay alert.
- Right.

546
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,711
Daddy, do I look pretty?

547
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,360
Absolutely lovely, my dear.

548
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,192
And what about the dress?

549
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,475
But I was talking about the dress.

550
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,153
Let me have the first dance. Come on.

551
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,114
Miss, may I have the pleasure
of this dance?

552
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,873
- Go on. It'll be fun.
- May I have this dance?

553
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,199
I've never danced
with so many people before.

554
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,275
- Daddy, are you happy?
- Of course.

555
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,989
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- Why aren't you looking at me?

556
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,991
- Where do you live?
- James' Street.

557
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,674
It's a dangerous town,
you must be careful.

558
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,436
With policemen like you to catch
all the criminals, I feel quite safe.

559
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,229
Do you think Hong Kong
is a dangerous place to live?

560
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,038
Dangerous? Not really.

561
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,511
- What do you do all day long?
- Sit in my office and drink coffee.

562
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,990
When I leave the dance floor,

563
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,834
go upstairs with Carina
to distract the security guards.

564
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,956
Don't worry. We know what to do.

565
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,713
How can you say it's not dangerous
with all the crime?

566
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,395
If there wasn't any crime,
there wouldn't be any police.

567
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,550
Perhaps we could take tea together.

568
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,229
Excuse me,
did you have garlic for lunch?

569
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,550
The Commissioner's office
is opposite Maggie's bedroom.

570
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,918
I'll climb up outside.
Wait for me in her room.

571
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,319
Right.

572
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,039
In my spare time, I go shopping,
I go to theatre or I paint pictures.

573
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,634
You paint? I love painting.

574
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,715
- What is it?
- I've torn the dress.

575
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,074
What's up?

576
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,830
- Let's go and fix it.
- Excuse me.

577
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,757
Nobody has changed partners with us.

578
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,956
- Don't you like my company?
- Of course.

579
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,828
- But I have to use the ladies.
- All right, I see.

580
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,673
- Let me show you where it is.
- Thank you.

581
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,791
Right, let me fix it for you.

582
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,437
I can't see. Stop that.

583
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,117
- It's really hot.
- It's not.

584
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,112
- You're right, open the window.
- I'll do it.

585
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,431
The invitations are real,
but where did they get them from?

586
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,590
He's not dancing, do you think...

587
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,351
Tell me which one you like.

588
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,112
- It's lovely.
- Which one?

589
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,915
Be quiet.

590
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,955
What is it?

591
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,878
- Nothing. You have a lovely figure.
- Really? Thanks a lot.

592
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,154
- What's going on, Carina?
- Nothing.

593
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,194
Which one shall I wear?

594
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,269
Go!

595
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,312
I am sorry, I am so sorry. Please.

596
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,918
Daddy, I was thinking
about this one for the cake.

597
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,195
Why don't you ask my friend Miss Pak?

598
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,999
- You look pretty in anything.
- Thank you.

599
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,071
I liked the one you wore earlier.

600
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,831
Then maybe I'll put it back on.

601
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,717
These girls...

602
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,950
- Have you seen...
- I've seen nothing,

603
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,235
but you've seen my daughter undressed.

604
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,154
Being in charge of security doesn't
mean you can charge in anywhere.

605
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,916
He's out of his mind!

606
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,239
All right now, ladies.
Don't take too long.

607
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,553
My bedroom's here.

608
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,154
What does your bedroom look like?

609
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,316
Quick. They're waiting
for me for the cake.

610
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,468
Your room is huge!

611
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,473
I find it much too big
since my wife's death.

612
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,996
Please.

613
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,954
This is beautiful!

614
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,998
It's just a normal office
for a colonial service man.

615
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,756
I only own the paintings,
all the rest belong to the Government.

616
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,638
So you can't give me a souvenir?

617
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,994
I just bought them.
So they're not framed.

618
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,470
- May I see them?
- If you'd like to, sure.

619
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,475
Of course. I bought this in London.
I liked it very much when I saw it.

620
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,678
- I like it very much, too!
- I'm sure you'll like the other one.

621
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,113
Let me get it for you.

622
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,395
Besides being a collector,
do you paint?

623
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,756
Yes, I do. I paint sometimes.

624
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,037
But I'll be embarrassed
to show them to people.

625
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,873
And you? What do you like
to paint most?

626
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,750
- Chinese landscapes mostly.
- Really? I love Chinese landscapes.

627
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,592
But I don't know much about them.

628
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,753
I have two more somewhere,
but I can't remember where I put them.

629
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,792
They're not here.
They might still be in the box.

630
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,950
Don't worry if you can't find them.

631
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,589
We've got time,
the cake's not ready yet.

632
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,114
They're not here. Strange.

633
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,031
Maybe they haven't arrived yet.

634
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,273
Don't move!

635
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,396
- Hold it!
- What's going on?

636
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,916
- What's going on?
- Thief, sir.

637
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,753
What's happening?

638
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,719
- What are you doing?
- There's been a theft!

639
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,553
Damn!

640
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,995
What a lovely cake!

641
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,312
It's so big.

642
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,628
Yeah.

643
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,312
It's beautiful.

644
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,473
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,753
Stay where you are.

646
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,118
I'm sorry, everyone.

647
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,353
You're under arrest.

648
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,752
- Me?
- What's going on?

649
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,796
He can't deny it. I saw him
stealing something in the study.

650
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,919
Somebody's stolen the necklace
I bought for Regina's birthday.

651
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,955
He's the one.

652
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,998
You're accusing me of stealing?
And the evidence?

653
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,877
You better search him.

654
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,509
He has a number of accomplices,
I doubt he still has it on him.

655
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,391
Dragon, if you make accusations,
you'd better be able to back them up.

656
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,711
Ladies and gentlemen,
we don't like this any more than you.

657
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,392
But to prove your innocence,

658
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,472
I'm sure you won't mind
a search by one of my officers.

659
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,269
- You want to search me?
- If you're innocent, you won't mind.

660
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,476
Needless to say,
you'll start with me.

661
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,872
However, to be fair
I think we should start with Mr Ma.

662
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,632
All right.

663
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,280
Chun, can you search him?

664
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,511
Chief, it's better if you do it.

665
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,397
Right, if you wish.

666
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,676
It's part of the diamond necklace.

667
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,438
Where did you get this?

668
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,556
Someone must have set him up.

669
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,234
Mr Ma really is a wonderful actor.

670
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,632
Ladies and gentlemen, this was all
part of the evening's entertainment.

671
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,759
However Mr Ma is such a good actor,
he fooled everyone present.

672
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,354
I just hope everyone enjoyed it.

673
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,510
- Daddy!
- A surprise.

674
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,910
- You almost scared me to death.
- Let's have the cake.

675
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,156
You really arranged everything, sir?

676
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,515
Of course not. Where's the necklace?

677
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,874
I've no idea, sir.

678
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,520
Then what is this doing
in your pocket?

679
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,199
I demand an explanation!

680
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,428
So it wasn't a game?

681
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,876
- Did it look like a game to you?
- No, I suppose it didn't.

682
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,110
- What now?
- I should be asking that.

683
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,476
- You're the policeman.
- Arrest him.

684
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,710
- But, sir...
- Shut up! It's an order.

685
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,315
I expect you to get to the bottom
of this and quickly.

686
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,472
Take him away.

687
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,638
- You have to make a wish.
- All right.

688
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,358
Did you set Dragon up with
the necklace that night?

689
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,199
I don't know much about that,
but he's innocent.

690
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,952
He's a nice person.

691
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,635
We had to do it for the good
of the country, don't forget.

692
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,597
Hot dumplings!

693
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,319
- Do you want some dumplings?
- All right.

694
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,792
What do you want in them?

695
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,709
Carina.

696
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,192
Where are you?

697
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,032
Maggie, what's the matter?

698
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,830
- My cousin has disappeared.
- What?!

699
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,038
- She just disappeared into thin air.
- Really?!

700
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,992
She won't talk, but I found this.

701
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,958
Go to this address,
see if you find the others.

702
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,995
Yes, sir!

703
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,868
- You must avoid the police.
- Yes, sir.

704
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,077
You're in big trouble
if the Chief finds out.

705
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,832
Not if we find the necklace.

706
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,070
Why do you think Carina's involved?

707
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,118
She and Man were dancing all evening.

708
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,952
Sir! I have a release order here.
I'm allowed to take him out.

709
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,790
Is this your first day?
You've forgotten the handcuffs.

710
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,758
Sorry.

711
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,316
I'll keep this with me for safety.

712
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,317
- What's up?
- We don't have to show everybody.

713
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,676
Let's go and see the warden.

714
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,951
All I want is for the prisoner to be
taken down the road towards the sea.

715
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,430
After that,
you'll never need to work again.

716
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,557
- It's really that simple?
- It's that simple.

717
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,749
It's a deal.

718
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,113
Anyone here?

719
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,436
With any luck, she'll be back by now.

720
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,755
Be quiet!

721
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,911
Carina. Carina!

722
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,470
Oh, no. I can't find her anywhere.

723
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,758
- I wonder who kidnapped her.
- Sometimes it's better not to know.

724
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,434
It's her!

725
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,429
You two again.

726
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,671
- Right. Any news of Carina?
- She's not back yet. And you?

727
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,159
We're still working on it.

728
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,912
Hold on, I'll finish changing.

729
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,472
- Who is it?
- Dragon and his man.

730
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,869
It's about the necklace.
I'd better hide.

731
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,477
- Any ideas?
- It's linked to the necklace case.

732
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,710
- That's right.
- Are you involved?

733
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,075
That's what the Commissioner
told us to say.

734
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,709
- Does your cousin know a Mr Man?
- No, she doesn't.

735
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,992
Sit down, please.

736
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,511
- We're like brothers.
- Yeah.

737
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,751
- Do you need to go the bathroom?
- No.

738
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,035
- But you said you needed to.
- When?

739
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,236
Yeah, I did say that.

740
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,392
- Where's the bathroom?
- The bathroom?! Over there.

741
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,835
- Thanks.
- I only have one bathroom.

742
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,515
- We always go together.
- Yeah, since we were kids.

743
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,430
- All clear?
- They're in the bathroom.

744
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,351
All right. I'm leaving now.
