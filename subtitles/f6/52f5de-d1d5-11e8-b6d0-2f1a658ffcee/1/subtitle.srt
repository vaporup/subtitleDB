1
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,920
# Love

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,500
# Is a many splendoured thing

3
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,164
I'm going back to Australia,
I won't see you again.

4
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:13,283
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

5
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,083
But it's true.

6
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:20,212
I've had the best summer of my life.
Now I have to go away. It isn't fair.

7
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:34,101
- Danny, don't spoil it.
- Sandy, it's only making it better.

8
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,441
Danny, is this the end?

9
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,230
Of course not.

10
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,329
It's only the beginning.

11
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,909
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine,

12
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,608
beginning your day the only way.
Music, music.

13
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:48,248
Get out of bed, first day of school.

14
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:51,628
Don't be a slob, don't get a job,
go back to class, you can pass.

15
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:55,587
To start the day off nice and fine,
here's a new old favourite of mine.

16
00:01:56,387 --> 00:01:59,337
# I solve my problems
and I see the light

17
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,627
# We got a lovin' thing

18
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,136
# We got to feed it right

19
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:08,516
# There ain't no danger
we can go too far

20
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:10,685
# We start believin' now

21
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,895
# That we can be who we are

22
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,065
# Grease is the word

23
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,864
# They think our love
is just a growin' pain

24
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,074
# Why don't they understand?

25
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,873
# It's just a cryin' shame

26
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:30,622
# Their lips are lying,
only real is real

27
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:33,042
# We stop the fight right now

28
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:35,132
# We got to be what we feel

29
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:36,882
# Grease is the word

30
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:39,632
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

31
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:42,932
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

32
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:49,310
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,139
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

34
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,489
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

35
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,578
# Conventionality

36
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,448
# Belongs to yesterday

37
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,287
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

38
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,657
# We start believin' now

39
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:12,957
# That we can be who we are

40
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:14,417
# Grease is the word

41
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:17,336
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

42
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:20,476
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

43
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:26,635
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

44
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,904
# Now grease is the way
we are feelin'

45
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:34,223
# This is a life of illusion

46
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:37,073
# Wrapped up in troubles

47
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,653
# Laced in confusion

48
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:42,153
# What are we doing here?

49
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,113
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

50
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,323
# Conventionality

51
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,922
# Belongs to yesterday

52
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,081
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

53
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,171
# We start believin' now

54
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,260
# That we can be who we are

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
# Grease is the word

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,060
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,389
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

58
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,859
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

59
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,408
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

60
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:36,375
# Grease is the word,
is the word that you've heard

61
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:39,084
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

62
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,564
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

63
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:49,304
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

64
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,483
# Grease is the word,
is the word, is the word

65
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,711
- You don't eat this, you bury it.
- That's a home-made lunch.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,330
Your old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

67
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,590
- She does it first day of school.
- Big deal.

68
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,509
- Kenickie. Over here.
- Where you at?

69
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,309
We're right here.

70
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,109
- Where were you all summer?
- Are you my mother?

71
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,648
- Just askin'.
- Working. More than you can say.

72
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:35,198
- Working?
- Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City.

73
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,697
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

74
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,787
I'm saving up to get me some wheels.

75
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,657
- Wanna hear what I did?
- No.

76
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,996
Hey, there's Danny.

77
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:46,875
Danny! Danny!

78
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,804
You seen any new broads there?

79
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:06,473
Nah, same old chicks,
everybody's made them.

80
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,683
So what'd you do all summer?

81
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,482
I was hanging around at the beach.
You know.

82
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:14,532
It's tough with all those chicks
hanging around you.

83
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:18,701
The only thing
that hangs around you are the flies.

84
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,861
How was the action
at the beach, man?

85
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,491
Whew. It was flipping.

86
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,370
Yeah? Crazy?

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,880
I did meet this one chick.
She was sorta cool.

88
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,170
You mean she puts out?

89
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,469
Come on, Sonny,
is that all you think about?

90
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,299
- Freakin' A.
- (bell)

91
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,558
Hey, guys, wait up.

92
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:45,468
- Do I look OK, Frenchy?
- Sure, you look good.

93
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,937
- I'm really nervous.
- You look terrific.

94
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,976
- So, this is Rydell?
- Yep. You'll love it.

95
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:56,946
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

96
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,566
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

97
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:02,026
Why? You got psoriasis?

98
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:06,826
(car backfires)

99
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,183
Well, here we are again.

100
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:26,222
- But this time we're seniors.
- We're gonna rule the school.

101
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:28,232
(all laugh)

102
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,182
Jan, that is so adolescent.

103
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:33,851
- We are adolescent.
- We don't have to flaunt it.

104
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:35,531
OK, girls.

105
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,401
Let's go get 'em.

106
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,620
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

107
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,459
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

108
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,459
Oh, good, they'll be
nice and smudged.

109
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,338
Here we are. If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

110
00:07:56,717 --> 00:08:00,057
These are the schedules
we couldn't find last semester.

111
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,637
Next year,
you might find this semester's.

112
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:14,516
- I've got Kenickie again.
- He's been here longer than I have.

113
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:18,905
First day of school and already
my castor oil is missing.

114
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,444
How many days
till Christmas vacation?

115
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,694
86.

116
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,794
- 86?
- And counting.

117
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:29,993
- Can I help you?
- Yes, it's my first day.

118
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,713
- I'm not sure where I should be.
- Welcome to Rydell.

119
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,633
You'll have to fill out
these forms, but...

120
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,432
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

121
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:45,602
- Do you have a pencil, please?
- Yes, dear. There you are.

122
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,981
(bell)

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,870
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,449
You'll spend your time
in McGee's office.

125
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,748
- She'll wish she'd never seen me.
- Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

126
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,788
I just ain't gonna take her crap.
I don't take no crap from nobody.

127
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,218
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

128
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:15,428
- Shouldn't you be in home room?
- I was going for a walk.

129
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,718
- You were dawdling.
- Yes, ma'am.

130
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,387
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

131
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,926
(mutters in Italian)

132
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:27,605
Perhaps a session of banging erasers
after school would put you on track.

133
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,195
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:33,155
- Do you plan to stand there all day?
- No, ma'am. I mean, yes.

135
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,195
- Well, which is it?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,564
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

137
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:43,004
I'm glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

138
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,953
You would have told her off, huh?

139
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,173
Mr LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am...

140
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,293
Hey, Eugene.

141
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,413
How you doin'?

142
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:53,792
- Shake, buddy.
- (buzzing)

143
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:57,012
What's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

144
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,222
- I got an astigmatism.
- Too bad.

145
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:06,520
(students) # As I go travelling down
life's highway

146
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,689
# Whatever course my fortunes
may foretell...

147
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:15,269
(chimes)

148
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,109
Good morning, boys and girls.
Welcome to what we're sure will be

149
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,369
our greatest year at Rydell.

150
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,918
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire.

151
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:28,617
I want to see all of you students
out there,

152
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:33,506
with plenty of support for Coach
Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.

153
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:37,796
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

154
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,756
And now for the really good news.

155
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:42,885
One of the most exciting things

156
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,725
to ever happen at Rydell High.

157
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,645
National Bandstand television show

158
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:53,244
has selected Rydell as
a representative American high school

159
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:56,984
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

160
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,743
(cheering)

161
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,703
It is our chance
to show the entire nation

162
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,503
what fine, bright, clean-cut,

163
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:08,752
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

164
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,042
(screams)

165
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,310
# Ba, ba, bamba

166
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,390
# Ba, ba, bamba

167
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,310
# La, la, la, la, la bamba

168
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,900
Did you guys get a look
at Zuko this mornin'?

169
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,149
Lookin' pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

170
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,528
- That's ancient history.
- History sometimes repeats itself.

171
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,118
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

172
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:43,287
Go sit down.
This here is Sandy Olsen.

173
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:46,377
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this is Rizzo.

174
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:49,336
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

175
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:53,496
- How are things down under?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

176
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,385
Marty, are those new glasses?

177
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,515
Yeah, just for school.
Do they make me look smarter?

178
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,805
Nah, you can still see your face.

179
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:06,434
- How d'you like school, Sandy?
- It's different.

180
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:09,064
- Hi, kids.
- (all groan)

181
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,944
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell. Hi.

182
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:15,443
- I love the first day of school.
- The biggest thrill of my life.

183
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,282
- You won't guess what's happened.
- Probably not.

184
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:20,571
The nominees for Student Council
are out.

185
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,991
- Guess who's up for Vice President?
- Who?

186
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,871
Me. Isn't that the most?

187
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,991
- To say the least.
- The very least.

188
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:29,091
I hope I don't make a poor showing.

189
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,091
We wish you the best of luck,
don't we, girls?

190
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,961
I've got my fingers crossed.

191
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:38,970
Oh, you must think I'm a clod
for not introducing myself.

192
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,469
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

193
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,769
Welcome to Rydell. (squeals)

194
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,568
Will you be at cheerleader tryouts?
We'll be lifelong friends.

195
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:55,237
You guys, how do you like Sandy?

196
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,947
Do you think we can
let her in the Pink Ladies?

197
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:02,616
- She looks too pure to be pink.
- Ohh, double do-do!

198
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:03,866
What's up, doc?

199
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,706
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

200
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,665
Kenickie, want a piece of salami?

201
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,425
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

202
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,175
What a stink!

203
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:16,885
Hey, guys, look.

204
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade.

205
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,692
Look! You really put
your foot into it this time.

206
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:30,392
Try hopscotch, you hot dog.

207
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,362
What a gavone! Gumdrops, man.

208
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:41,032
Any of you guys see
that new chick in registration?

209
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,241
Sure beats
the foam domes round here.

210
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,001
Jugs bigger than Annette's?

211
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,420
Nobody's jugs
are bigger than Annette's.

212
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,389
Hey, guys. Hey!

213
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,308
Hi, girls.

214
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,598
You're a sick man, Putz.

215
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,067
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

216
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:13,237
- It was nothing.
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?

217
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,456
- You got in her drawers, right?
- Come on, tell us.

218
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:18,036
What did you do this summer?

219
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,446
I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

220
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,285
You hauled your cookies
to the beach for a guy?

221
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:27,795
- He was sorta special.
- There ain't no such thing.

222
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,594
It was really romantic.

223
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,043
Everything about it.

224
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:36,093
You don't want to hear
the horny details.

225
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,853
Alright, I'll tell you.

226
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:42,013
# Summer lovin', had me a blast

227
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:45,933
# Summer lovin', happened so fast

228
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:49,442
# I met a girl, crazy for me

229
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,861
# Met a boy, cute as can be

230
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:57,031
# Summer days, drifting away

231
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,400
# To uh, oh, those summer nights

232
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,580
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

233
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,290
# Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?

234
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:09,089
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Like does he have a car?

235
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:12,799
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
- # Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do

236
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:16,848
# She swam by me, she got a cramp

237
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,388
# He ran by me, got my suit damp

238
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:24,557
# I saved her life,
she nearly drowned

239
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:28,027
# He showed off, splashing around

240
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:31,526
# Summer sun, something's begun

241
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:34,236
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

242
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,025
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

243
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:40,164
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Was it love at first sight?

244
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:44,044
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Did she put up a fight?

245
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:47,834
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

246
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,214
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

247
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:55,683
# Took her bowling in the arcade

248
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:59,642
# We went strolling, drank lemonade

249
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:03,141
# We made out, under the dock

250
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,691
# We stayed out till ten o'clock

251
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:10,991
# Summer fling, don't mean a thing

252
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,620
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

253
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,990
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # But you don't gotta brag

254
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,999
# Tell me more, tell me more

255
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,949
# Cos he sounds like a drag

256
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,539
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop

257
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,258
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, yeah!

258
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:35,308
# He got friendly, holding my hand

259
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:39,557
# She got friendly, down in sand

260
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:43,226
# He was sweet, just turned 1 8

261
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,525
# Well, she was good,
you know what I mean

262
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:50,275
# Summer heat, boy and girl meet

263
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:53,325
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

264
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,115
# Whoa, whoa, whoa

265
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,915
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # How much dough did he spend?

266
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:03,204
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Could she get me a friend?

267
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:10,502
# It turned colder,
that's where it ends

268
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:15,712
# So I told her we'd still be friends

269
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:21,771
# Then we made our true love vow

270
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:29,070
# Wonder what she's doing now

271
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,069
# Summer dreams

272
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:38,449
# Ripped at the seams

273
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,579
# But

274
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:43,498
# Oh

275
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:48,667
# Those summer

276
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:53,256
# Nights

277
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:59,096
# Tell me more, tell me more

278
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,445
He sounds real nice.

279
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,994
True love and he didn't lay
a hand on you? Sounds like a creep.

280
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,493
He wasn't. He was a gentleman.

281
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:17,243
What was his name?

282
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,203
Danny. Danny Zuko.

283
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,743
(all giggle)

284
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:23,792
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

285
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,252
Maybe, if you believe in miracles,

286
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:30,092
Prince Charming will show up again
someday.

287
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,051
Somewhere unexpected.

288
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:34,851
See you later. Come on, girls.

289
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:40,400
- Do you really think so, Frenchy?
- Sure.

290
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,030
Erm, ... Sandy, I think
we oughta get to class.

291
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:08,387
(all) Do the splits, give a yell

292
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,417
Show a little spirit for old Rydell

293
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,717
Way to go, red and white

294
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:15,306
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

295
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:19,605
(fanfare)

296
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,224
And now...

297
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,154
Quiet, please.

298
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:35,153
Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls,
the man of the hour.

299
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,113
The coach we're all depending on

300
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:40,782
to pull Rydell out of
a seven-season slump,

301
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:43,712
our very own Coach Calhoun.

302
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:45,672
(cheering)

303
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,100
- Who's the best?
- (all) Rydell!

304
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,809
Give 'em hell, Rydell!

305
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:07,608
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up.

306
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,858
Because my boys are primed,
really primed,

307
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:13,868
because I primed 'em.

308
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:17,998
Not only primed, they're honed.
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

309
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:21,117
We're not just going out there
to win.

310
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:25,296
We're going out there for glory.
And when we get out there,

311
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,965
we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em

312
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,885
and rip 'em.

313
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:34,675
We'll take 'em and roll 'em around
and rip 'em up to pieces!

314
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,014
Then we're gonna slaughter 'em.

315
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,094
And after the slaughter is over,

316
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:43,603
we're gonna come back here
and ring that victory bell.

317
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,073
Like we always wanted to.

318
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,009
Watch this.

319
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,099
Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak
Brrr, nyik-nyak

320
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:19,099
Do a split, give a yell
Shake a tit for old Rydell!

321
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,948
Guys.

322
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:26,528
Be cool, huh?

323
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,407
Hey, watch out, pinhead!

324
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,076
Well, what do you think?

325
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,166
What a hunk of junk.

326
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,965
Wait till I give it a paint job,
soup up the engine.

327
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,345
She'll run like a champ.
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

328
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:50,384
- Thunder Road?
- Yeah. Wanna make something of it?

329
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:53,934
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

330
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:56,104
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

331
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:58,903
What are Scorpions doing here?
It ain't their turf.

332
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,022
- Think they wanna rumble?
- If they do, we'll be ready.

333
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,870
Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em!

334
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,500
- Hey, chicken.
- Whoo-hoo!

335
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,380
What you doing?

336
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,139
- Thanks, Frenchy.
- That's alright.

337
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,398
- You were great out there.
- I messed up, I was so nervous.

338
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:40,227
- Your split was divoon.
- Hi, Sandy.

339
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:43,277
- Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.
- We got a surprise for you.

340
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:44,777
- What is it?
- You'll see.

341
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,017
Right, Rizz?

342
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,736
Let me comb your hair down.

343
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,826
Where are we going?

344
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,696
Want a little lipstick?

345
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:56,075
If you fix up this car,
it could be make-out city.

346
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:59,575
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

347
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,085
You'd better believe it.

348
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,214
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

349
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:06,084
Oh, yeah?

350
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,554
Yeah.

351
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:12,463
- Sandy!
- Danny?

352
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:16,303
What are you doing here?
I thought you were back in Australia.

353
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,012
We had a change of plan.

354
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:19,842
I can't...

355
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:26,741
That's cool, baby. You know how it
is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.

356
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:29,491
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

357
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,871
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

358
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,071
What's the matter with you?

359
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:39,579
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

360
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:44,039
Well, I do not know.
Maybe there's two of us, right?

361
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,758
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad or...

362
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,178
...try the Yellow Pages?
I don't know.

363
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,147
You're a fake and a phoney.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

364
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,267
(all) Ooohhh...

365
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,436
I wonder if she carries
silver bullets!

366
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:06,356
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

367
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:10,655
I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

368
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:14,405
- Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember?
- Come on, Danny.

369
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:18,044
- Who's got beer money?
- I swiped my brother's ID.

370
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,763
He was so nice to me this summer.

371
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,922
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

372
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:33,972
Listen to me.
They're fleas on rats.

373
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:38,012
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

374
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:41,812
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

375
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:46,400
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

376
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,779
You know what you need?
A night out with the girls.

377
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,459
We're having a sleep-over
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

378
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:00,588
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

379
00:25:02,678 --> 00:25:04,008
Hey, look at Jan.

380
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:07,048
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new Ipana

381
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,267
# With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

382
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:13,637
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a,
New Ipana toothpaste

383
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:17,896
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

384
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,186
# Fast, fast, you sure are right

385
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,696
Turn it off.

386
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,435
- Hand me a ciggie butt.
- Yeah, me, too.

387
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,655
- Want one, Sandy?
- I don't smoke.

388
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:32,483
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya.

389
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:42,093
Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

390
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:46,463
Sandy, let me teach you how to
French inhale. It's really cool.

391
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:53,631
God. That is
the ugliest-Iooking thing I ever saw.

392
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,770
The guys really go for it.
It's how I got my nickname.

393
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,610
Sure it is.

394
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,059
OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party goin'?

395
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,409
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

396
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,739
I brought Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

397
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:15,788
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, Jan.

398
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,998
It says right here
it is a dessert wine.

399
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,707
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

400
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:25,457
- Oh, that's OK.
- I bet you never had a drink before.

401
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,717
I had champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

402
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,256
Ring-a-ding-ding!

403
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:32,546
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

404
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:39,314
Hey, Sandy. Would you like me
to pierce your ears for ya?

405
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,774
- (jeering)
- Shut up!

406
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,614
Isn't it awfully dangerous?

407
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:49,784
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to be a beautician.

408
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:52,614
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

409
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:56,583
- Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin.
- It's good for somethin'.

410
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,872
- It's not a good idea.
- It's OK.

411
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:02,582
My father won't like it. (screams)

412
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,131
Sandy, let's go into the bathroom.

413
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:09,181
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood on the carpet.

414
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,680
- It only bleeds for a second.
- I don't feel very well.

415
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,800
Don't worry. If she screws up,

416
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,970
she can fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

417
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:22,449
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

418
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,069
(screams)

419
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:26,609
Could you get some ice
to numb her ears?

420
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:30,738
Let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet.

421
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,247
Personally,
I'm getting rather chilly.

422
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:43,256
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

423
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:46,585
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a marine.

424
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:49,095
A marine? Whooo!

425
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,715
Wanna see a picture?

426
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:55,145
God. You're turning into
a one-woman USO.

427
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,145
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

428
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,484
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and... bleurgh!

429
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,563
You won't get your hands on my ears.

430
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:10,362
Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been
accepted to La Cafury Beauty School.

431
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,572
You're dropping out of Rydell?

432
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:17,501
I don't see it as dropping out. I see
it as a very strategic career move.

433
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,211
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in it.

434
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,720
Er, ... Sandy,
here's your toothbrush.

435
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,140
Thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

436
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,059
It's OK.

437
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,199
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

438
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,698
# Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee

439
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:48,527
# Lousy with virginity

440
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:52,276
# Won't go to bed
Till I'm legally wed

441
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:55,416
# I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

442
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:57,836
Watch it.

443
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,126
# Hey, I'm Doris Day

444
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:04,086
# I was not brought up that way

445
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:07,475
# Won't come across
Even Rock Hudson lost

446
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:12,644
# His heart to Doris Day

447
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:14,344
- # I don't drink
- No!

448
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,973
- # Or swear
- Oh!

449
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:17,933
- # I don't rat my hair
- Yeurgh!

450
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:21,073
# I get ill from one cigarette
(coughs)

451
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:25,362
# Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky drawers

452
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:28,162
# Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

453
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:34,621
# As for you, Troy Donahue

454
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,831
# I know what you wanna do

455
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:42,050
# You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust

456
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,460
# I'm just plain Sandra Dee

457
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,849
# Elvis! Elvis!

458
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,019
# Let me be

459
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:53,928
# Keep that pelvis far from me

460
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:58,807
# Just keep your cool
Now you're starting to drool

461
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:01,977
# Hey, fongool

462
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,647
# I'm Sandra Dee

463
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:12,336
Making fun of me, Rizz?

464
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,035
Some people are so touchy.

465
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:31,143
- # Later on they start to scratch...
- Shut up, you vultures.

466
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:32,933
I changed my mind. Let's go.

467
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,353
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

468
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,102
(squealing)

469
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:42,532
- They can't come. My folks'll flip.
- Putzie, you call her.

470
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:45,861
Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?

471
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:47,571
Shut up! Sit down.

472
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,371
You goody-goodies are too much.

473
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:55,660
I'm gonna get my kicks while
I'm still young enough to get 'em.

474
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,120
Is she gonna
shinny down the drainpipe?

475
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,299
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

476
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,828
You're doing that without a net.

477
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:12,848
Swell bunch, rushing to help a lady.

478
00:31:12,978 --> 00:31:15,688
- Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up!

479
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,987
- What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

480
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:22,856
- You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

481
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:27,985
- What say you, Zuke?
- You're lookin' good, Rizz.

482
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:31,865
- Eat your heart out.
- Sloppy seconds ain't my style.

483
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,124
You going to flog your log?

484
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:45,833
It's better than hanging around
with you dorks.

485
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,133
Your chariot, my lady.

486
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:03,101
I don't know what I saw
in Danny Zuko.

487
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:05,810
Don't sweat it, honey.
Have one of mine.

488
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,779
- There's so many of them.
- I know.

489
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,039
- How do you keep up with them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

490
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,379
Hopelessly devoted to every one.

491
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,558
What are you doing?

492
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:28,597
OK. What do you think this is?
A gangbang?

493
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,597
- You wish.
- (all laugh)

494
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,886
Hit the pavement.

495
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,436
You gotta be kidding.

496
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,636
- I said now.
- Alright.

497
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:38,516
Remember us in your will.

498
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:48,155
When a guy picks a chick
over his buddies, something's wrong.

499
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:51,504
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

500
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:55,874
Can I have some of that?

501
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:58,083
Sure.

502
00:32:58,213 --> 00:33:00,373
- Thanks.
- Wait.

503
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:08,642
(door closes)

504
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,330
# Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

505
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,369
# My eyes are not the first
to cry

506
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,748
# I'm not the first to know

507
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:41,757
# There's just no getting over you

508
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:52,396
# You know,
I'm just a fool who's willing

509
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:58,435
# To sit around and wait for you

510
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:02,405
# But, baby, can't you see?

511
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:07,824
# There's nothing else for me to do

512
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:14,703
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

513
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:22,131
# But now there's nowhere to hide

514
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:25,461
# Since you pushed my love aside

515
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:29,011
# I'm out of my head

516
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:34,901
# Hopelessly devoted to you

517
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:41,809
# Hopelessly devoted to you

518
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:51,288
# Hopelessly devoted to you

519
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:57,377
# My head is saying

520
00:34:57,507 --> 00:35:01,556
# Fool, forget him

521
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,716
# My heart is saying

522
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:07,266
# Don't let go

523
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,765
# Hold on to the end

524
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:16,225
# And that's what I intend to do

525
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:23,733
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

526
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:30,532
# But now there's nowhere to hide

527
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,872
# Since you pushed my love aside

528
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:37,702
# I'm out of my head

529
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:43,351
# Hopelessly devoted to you

530
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:50,010
# Hopelessly devoted to you

531
00:35:53,939 --> 00:36:00,658
# Hopelessly devoted to you

532
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,707
(radio) Is acne ruining your life?

533
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,366
Do you close your eyes when you
look in the mirror? Fear no more.

534
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,756
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

535
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,926
Help dry up unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

536
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:26,095
(grunts)

537
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:41,943
- Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

538
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:43,953
Oh, erm...

539
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,193
Betty.

540
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,953
Betty. Betty.

541
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:57,420
- Have you got something?
- Are you kidding?

542
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,099
My 25-cent insurance policy.

543
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:09,049
Big spender.

544
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,888
- What?
- It broke.

545
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:17,188
How could it break?

546
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,108
I bought it
when I was in seventh grade.

547
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,327
Ohhh...

548
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:39,044
What the hell?

549
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,134
(crash)

550
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:50,224
- What the hell are you doin'?
- It's a no-parking zone, creep.

551
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:54,443
The whole place is a no-parking zone,
crater-face.

552
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,613
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

553
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:00,822
(crash)

554
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:02,941
You're gonna pay for that.

555
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,201
I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

556
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,709
We just have to bang out the dent.

557
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,629
The problem's not in the dent,
it's this rubber-band engine.

558
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,468
- The problem's your mouth.
- Where you gonna get a carburettor?

559
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:31,978
- Ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

560
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,898
Hey, big stuff.
What do you drive, huh?

561
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:37,187
- I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

562
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,947
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

563
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:40,896
What about Doody?

564
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:43,655
- Well, I...
- That's what I thought.

565
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:49,655
C'mon, guys. This car could be
a major piece of machinery. Look.

566
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,335
This car could be systematic.

567
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,665
Hydromatic.

568
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,965
Ultramatic.

569
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:03,673
It could be Greased Lightning.

570
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:07,643
# You get some overhead lifters
and four-barrel quads, oh, yeah

571
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:10,062
# Keep talking, whoa, keep talking

572
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:13,222
# With fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah

573
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:15,932
# We'll get her ready
We'll get her ready

574
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:19,071
# With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door

575
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,821
# You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit

576
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,781
- # In Greased Lightning
- # Go, go, go

577
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,240

# Go, go, go, go-go-go-go

585
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:47,357
# With purple French taillights
and 30-inch fins, oh, yeah

586
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:52,856
# A palomino dashboard
and dual-muffler twins, oh, yeah

587
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:58,026
# With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks

588
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:01,106
# You know that I ain't braggin'
She's a real pussy wagon

589

602
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:05,618
Come on, guys. Let's get to work.

603
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,998
(yelling)

604
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:26,305
Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

605
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,975
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

606
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:34,195
- You nuts?
- No, I was just thinking.

607
00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:36,894
- Don't think so much.
- That's cool.

608
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:42,274
Hey, guys.

609
00:42:42,414 --> 00:42:46,193
- Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hangin'?

610
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,323
OK, the meeting is in session.

611
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:55,332
Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out.

612
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:59,761
- Everyone got hauled to the clink.
- No one'll catch Greased Lightning.

613
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:02,181
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

614
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:06,560
- Somebody snaking you, Danny?
- Bite the weenie, Rizz.

615
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,599
With relish.

616
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:16,939
- I don't know about these chicks.
- They're only good for one thing.

617
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:21,699
What do you do with 'em
the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day?

618
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,278
Does it only take 1 5 minutes?

619
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:29,377
Want some new music?

620
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:32,176
- Yeah.
- I'll need some money.

621
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:37,046
Thanks.

622
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:42,175
(wolf whistles)

623
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:45,095
I'll be right back.

624
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:52,394
Hi, Danny!

625
00:43:53,404 --> 00:43:56,074
- I can't talk.
- What are you doing later?

626
00:43:56,194 --> 00:43:58,773
- I can't talk, alright?
- Call me.

627
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,701
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

628
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:14,080
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

629
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,680
That's good.

630
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,300
Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

631
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,430
- What about?
- About the night at the bonfire.

632
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,930
The way I acted, that was terrible.

633
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,270
It wasn't me, you gotta know that.

634
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,969
It was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

635
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:35,358
You see, Sandy,
I got this image, right? And...

636
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:38,907
That's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

637
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:46,826
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

638
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,546
Jealous, are you?

639
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:54,126
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

640
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:57,465
What have you ever done?

641
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,924
Come on! I can run circles
around those jerks.

642
00:45:04,064 --> 00:45:06,224
I'll believe that when I see it.

643
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:34,581
Let's start with the first rule. Cut
it down to two packs a day. There.

644
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,839
What sort of athletics
are you interested in?

645
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,059
You like the rings?

646
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:47,398
Yeah, I installed a set
just a couple of weeks ago.

647
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:52,437
The first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

648
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,697
That's why I'm here, to change.

649
00:45:54,827 --> 00:45:58,157
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

650
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:06,916
Alright. Let's knock it off.

651
00:46:07,046 --> 00:46:12,745
Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man.
Danny. Let's give him a tryout.

652
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:19,014
- Better watch it.
- Come on. A little fire, here we go.

653
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,652
You have to dribble.

654
00:46:38,202 --> 00:46:40,282
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thanks, son.

655
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:42,781
Dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

656
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,910
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

657
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,080
- OK.
- Danny, over here. Danny!

658
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,759
Let's go.

659
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:55,089
That's it. Go, go, go.

660
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,509
Get him, Danny.

661
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:03,728
- (whistle)
- What'd I do?

662
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:06,607
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

663
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:14,567
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy.

664
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:18,156
Are you crazy?

665
00:47:18,286 --> 00:47:21,486
Come on, come on.
Let's start. Get in first position.

666
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:23,865
Danny, you get down.

667
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:26,375
OK, Andy, get down. Ready?

668
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:30,754
(whistle)

669
00:47:31,923 --> 00:47:33,463
Hold it, hold it.

670
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:37,213
Danny, you gotta try. Come on.

671
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:42,423
Alright, Andy, let's change
positions. You get down. Come on.

672
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,442
Alright. Ready?

673
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:51,281
(whistle)

674
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:54,231
- Give?
- Yeah, give.

675
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:55,691
Good.

676
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:01,830
He's a hitter.

677
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:09,459
You'll like baseball. It's not
that much of a contact sport.

678
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:12,049
Get in there and let's see
what you can do.

679
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:14,128
Throw the ball. Let's play.

680
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:17,418
Let's pitch this guy out.

681
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:20,308
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

682
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:23,437
- Strike.
- I told you. He doesn't even swing.

683
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,267
What kind of ball player are you?
Put it in here.

684
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,606
Strike.

685
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:35,655
Come on. A little fire in there.
Let's see you hit it.

686
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:41,654
Foul ball.

687
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:46,664
- Easy, easy.
- Now! Come on.

688
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:48,954
Put the bat down. Put the bat down.

689
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:54,173
There's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact.

690
00:48:54,303 --> 00:48:57,012
- Yeah, like what?
- Like track.

691
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,642
- What do you mean, running?
- Just like running?

692
00:49:01,602 --> 00:49:03,971
I mean something
that needs endurance.

693
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:08,901
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

694
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:11,270
Cross-country running.

695
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,860
- That could be cool.
- Good.

696
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,055
Danny.

697
00:49:48,025 --> 00:49:50,265
Danny, are you alright?

698
00:49:52,405 --> 00:49:54,235
Danny, talk to me.

699
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:58,815
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

700
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,744
The way I... ?
Sandy, I told you I was sorry.

701
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,613
Got you talking.

702
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:07,792
- You sure you're OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

703
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,382
- So, still dating that jockstrap?
- Well...

704
00:50:13,682 --> 00:50:17,591
- Is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

705
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:19,261
- On what?
- On you.

706
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,351
- On me?
- Yeah.

707
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:23,181
He can stag it.

708
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,650
Come on.

709
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,270
(horn)

710
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:35,319
(music plays in background)

711
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:45,748
- Sandy, let's go someplace else.
- Why?

712
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:49,916
We can't be alone here, that's why.

713
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,626
Danny.

714
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:54,926
OK.

715
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,856
You nearly pulled my arm out.

716
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:08,065
I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best one.

717
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:12,234
- What are you doing?
- I just want privacy.

718
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:15,783
- What'll it be, kids?
- Cherry soda, please.

719
00:51:15,913 --> 00:51:17,863
- Danny?
- I'm not very hungry.

720
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:22,372
Give me a double polar burger with
everything and a soda with ice cream.

721
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:24,542
Sounds good. I'll have the same.

722
00:51:24,672 --> 00:51:26,832
The same? You can eat a lot.

723
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:29,332
- You're funny.
- No, you are.

724
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:33,711
- How ya doing, Zuke? Nice!
- Hiya, Rizzo. How are you?

725
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,001
Peachy keen, jelly bean.

726
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,680
You got any quarters?
We could split an Eskimo Pie.

727
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:44,060
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

728
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,809
Greetings, pals and gals.
Anybody got 23 cents?

729
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,399
Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

730
00:51:50,529 --> 00:51:54,778
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here, 1 5 cents there.

731
00:51:54,908 --> 00:51:58,027
In a couple of months
Frenchy can take us all out.

732
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,907
A working girl with income.

733
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:03,127
Y'know, they don't pay
that much to start with.

734
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:07,297
It's more than we make. Ante up,
I don't get my allowance till Friday.

735
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,917
- You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy.

736
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,626
Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

737
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:15,635
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

738
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:19,714
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

739
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:26,144
I got so many hickeys
I look like a leper.

740
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:30,323
Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

741
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:32,683
You care enough
to send the very best.

742
00:52:34,323 --> 00:52:37,612
- You pig.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

743
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,952
My parents want to invite you
to tea on Sunday. Will you come?

744
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:47,331
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

745
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:50,251
Well, I don't like parents.

746
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,050
- Want some?
- Erm, uh-uh.

747
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,140
You sure are a cheap date.

748
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,299
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I understand.

749
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:03,938
- I always found you understanding.
- I am.

750
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:07,978
I also think
there's more to you than just fat.

751
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:10,818
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

752
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:12,988
- Got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

753
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:14,318
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

754
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:19,157
I'll be a senior forever if
I don't study for that algebra test.

755
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:22,156
You're in luck.
You got an armed escort home.

756
00:53:22,296 --> 00:53:26,455
It's not the arms I'm worried about,
Sonny. It's the hands.

757
00:53:26,585 --> 00:53:28,585
She loves me.

758
00:53:30,635 --> 00:53:32,925
- You coming, French?
- I don't think so.

759
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,134
- I think I'll hang out a bit longer.
- Alright.

760
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:41,144
I have been dieting all day long. My
mom's apple pie's better than this.

761
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:43,513
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

762
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:45,933
- Putzie.
- Yeah?

763
00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:47,693
1 5 minutes!

764
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:53,442
I'm worried about this dance-off. Do
they dance differently to back home?

765
00:53:53,572 --> 00:53:57,192
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

766
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:01,161
Let's get out of here, Sandy.

767
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,831
See you later.

768
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:05,740
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See ya, Sandy.

769
00:54:08,299 --> 00:54:11,589
Great. I'm stuck with the check.
Give me money.

770
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:16,499
OK, what's with you tonight?
You got the personality of a wet mop.

771
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,719
- Don't start with me.
- Fine. How about I finish with ya?

772
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,518
Finish this!

773
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:26,107
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

774
00:54:28,947 --> 00:54:30,857
Sorry, French.

775
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,286
(distant) Hey, Rizzo.
I want to talk to you!

776
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,285
No use crying over spilt milk shake.

777
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:45,165
Oh, I'll be OK.

778
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,924
You know it's near closing time?

779
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:51,124
Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?

780
00:54:51,264 --> 00:54:53,254
No, suit yourself.

781
00:54:53,384 --> 00:54:55,844
- Wow.
- What?

782
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:59,343
I hate to tell you, but your
hair looks like an Easter egg.

783
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,053
Oh, yeah.

784
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:05,522
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

785
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:08,932
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

786
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,401
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it'd be.

787
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,110
Nothing ever is.

788
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:24,580
Vi? Erm, ... I dropped out.
What do you think of waitressing?

789
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,670
You're too young to know.

790
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,219
Maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

791
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:35,218
No, I don't think I'd like to wear
those little things over my ears.

792
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:41,057
God, if only I could have a guardian
angel to tell me what to do.

793
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:44,807
Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy.
What do you think?

794
00:55:45,906 --> 00:55:48,576
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

795
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:07,544
# Your story's sad to tell

796
00:56:08,424 --> 00:56:12,123
# A teenage ne'er-do-well

797
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:18,801
# Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

798
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:24,641
# Your future's so unclear now

799
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:29,021
# What's left of your career now?

800
00:56:29,661 --> 00:56:37,370
# Can't even get a trade-in
on your smock

801
00:56:52,637 --> 00:56:54,877
# Beauty school dropout

802
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:59,177
# No graduation day for you

803
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:01,356
# Beauty school dropout

804
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:05,856
# Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo

805
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:09,075
# Well, at least
you could have taken time

806
00:57:09,195 --> 00:57:12,315
# To wash and clean your clothes up

807
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,855
# After spending all that dough

808
00:57:14,995 --> 00:57:18,034
# To have the doctor fix your nose up

809
00:57:18,164 --> 00:57:20,124
# Baby, get movin'

810
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,703
# Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

811
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:27,842
- # What are you provin'?
- # What are you provin'?

812
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:31,382
# You've got the dream
but not the drive

813
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:34,512
# If you go for your diploma

814
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:37,562
# You could join a steno-pool

815
00:57:37,682 --> 00:57:39,722
# Turn in your teasing-comb

816
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:42,851
# And go back to high school

817
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,529
# Beauty school dropout

818
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:52,989
# Hangin' around the corner store

819
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,949
# Beauty school dropout

820
00:57:56,749 --> 00:58:00,078
# It's about time you knew the score

821
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:02,918
# Well, they couldn't
teach you anything

822
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,117
# You think you're such a looker

823
00:58:06,677 --> 00:58:09,707
# But no customer would go to you

824
00:58:09,847 --> 00:58:12,467
# Unless she was a hooker

825
00:58:17,516 --> 00:58:20,556
- # Baby, don't sweat it
- # Don't sweat it

826
00:58:20,686 --> 00:58:23,945
# You're not cut out to hold a job

827
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:27,185
- # Better forget it
- # Forget it

828
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:30,404
# Who wants their hair done
by a slob?

829
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:34,063
# Now your bangs are curled,
your lashes twirled

830
00:58:34,203 --> 00:58:36,873
# But still the world is cruel

831
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,153
# Wipe off that angel face

832
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:41,613
# And go back to high school

833
00:58:43,383 --> 00:58:45,043
# Baby, don't blow it

834
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:49,722
# Don't put my good advice to shame

835
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:51,881
# Baby, you know it

836
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:56,470
# Even Dear Abby would say the same

837
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,930
# Now, I've called the shot,
get off the pot

838
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:04,609
# I've really got to fly

839
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:11,569
# Gotta be going to that malt shop

840
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:18,158
# In the sky

841
00:59:22,587 --> 00:59:25,507
# Beauty school dropout

842
00:59:25,637 --> 00:59:28,167
# Go back to high school

843
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:31,846
# Beauty school dropout

844
00:59:31,976 --> 00:59:34,595
# Go back to high school

845
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:38,184
# Beauty school dropout

846
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:42,354
# Go back to high school

847
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:57,582
- Lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

848
00:59:57,712 --> 01:00:00,082
- Give him a break.
- Oh, I will!

849
01:00:00,212 --> 01:00:02,781
No, we'll work on the brakes later.

850
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:04,581
Move over, slick.

851
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:06,671
Fruitcake, you got it on backwards.

852
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:09,471
- What car did you swipe it from?
- Your mother's.

853
01:00:17,939 --> 01:00:19,479
Rizz.

854
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:29,278
Can you believe it?
Nationwide television!

855
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:35,867
- How you doing?
- Still gonna go to the dance?

856
01:00:35,997 --> 01:00:39,167
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

857
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:43,795
Biggest thing to happen to Rydell
and we don't have dates.

858
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:46,925
- Maybe Rudi from the Capri Lounge?
- Get serious.

859
01:00:47,055 --> 01:00:49,675
- It's a suggestion.
- I already called him.

860
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:59,104
Relax. I think our luck is changing.

861
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:08,072
Do you know what you're doing?

862
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:10,352
What we're doing. Come on.

863
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:41,978
Hey, Marty. Lookin' good.

864
01:01:43,568 --> 01:01:46,437
Would you just excuse me one second?

865
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,236
Feelin' good, too, huh?

866
01:01:51,366 --> 01:01:53,946
Sonny. There he is. Vince Fontaine.

867
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:56,236
I seen better heads on a mug of beer.

868
01:01:56,376 --> 01:02:01,246
- Grow up. He's the living end.
- Yeah, if you like older guys.

869
01:02:14,603 --> 01:02:16,183
Danny, this is so exciting.

870
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:18,983
You gotta make friends
with the cameraman.

871
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:21,263
- You know him?
- His name's Ted.

872
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:24,112
Doody, how do I look?

873
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:27,902
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

874
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:32,861
You're late, fellas. Where you been?

875
01:02:32,991 --> 01:02:36,411
- The gym never looked so good.
- You bring the provisions?

876
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:38,780
Alright, kids. I want a big circle.

877
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,590
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

878
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:51,309
But first, some warm-up numbers
with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

879
01:02:59,357 --> 01:03:04,237
# Oh, baby, rock'n'roll
is here to stay, it will never die

880
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:09,237
# It was meant to be that way,
though I don't know why

881
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:14,365
# I don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

882
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:19,045
# We don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

883
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:23,214
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

884
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:27,713
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

885
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:30,423
# Come on

886
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:32,383
# Everybody rock

887
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:37,392
# If you don't like rock'n'roll,
think what you'd be missin'

888
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:42,182
# If you like to bop and stroll,
come on down and listen

889
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:44,691
# Let's all start to have a ball

890
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,111
# Everybody rock'n'roll

891
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,659
- What are their names?
- Fred and Ginger.

892
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:00,588
Fred and Ginger.

893
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:28,695
- I hope I don't get camera fright.
- Don't worry, we'll be cool.

894
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:30,695
- Yeah?
- Don't worry?

895
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,655
Good. Come on, let's go.

896
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:39,034
# What's that playing on the radio?

897
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:43,003
# Why do I start swaying to and fro?

898
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:46,833
# I have never heard
that song before

899
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:50,502
# But if I don't hear it any more...

900
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:52,802
Why not let me lead for a change?

901
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,972
I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'.

902
01:04:55,102 --> 01:04:56,642
OK.

903
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:02,401
Doody, can't you
turn me around or something?

904
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,980
Don't talk, Frenchy.
I'm trying to count.

905
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,909
# A melody

906
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,689
# That's never the same

907
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:12,619
# A melody
that's calling your name...

908
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:15,749
Have you thought
of singing professionally?

909
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:17,919
# (off key) Come back to me-e-e

910
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:20,619
- # Please...
- Hey, Zuko! Zuke!

911
01:05:20,759 --> 01:05:23,328
I want you
to meet Cha Cha di Gregorio.

912
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:25,757
- How you doing, baby?
- Fine.

913
01:05:25,887 --> 01:05:26,967
Who is she?

914
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:31,306
They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm
the best dancer at St Bernadette's.

915
01:05:31,436 --> 01:05:34,596
With the worst reputation.

916
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,716
Let's go, Sandy.

917
01:05:36,856 --> 01:05:40,855
- Who's that girl?
- Just a girl I know, that's all.

918
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,704
Hi.

919
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:51,494
I'm Vince Fontaine.

920
01:05:52,334 --> 01:05:55,664
Do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

921
01:05:55,794 --> 01:05:57,953
Over KZAZ, that is.

922
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,163
I'm judging the dance contest.

923
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:05,012
I don't think I'm entered.

924
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:08,092
A knockout like you?
What's your name?

925
01:06:08,222 --> 01:06:10,551
- Marty.
- Marty what?

926
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:14,100
Maraschino. You know, like in cherry.

927
01:06:37,837 --> 01:06:40,507
- What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

928
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,917
# You don't remember me

929
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:47,506
# But I remember you

930
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,426
# It was not so long ago

931
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:52,556
# You broke my heart in two

932
01:06:52,686 --> 01:06:55,355
# Tears on my pillow

933
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:57,895
# Pain in my heart

934
01:06:58,025 --> 01:07:01,355
# Caused by you,
you, you, you, you...

935
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:03,444
How do you know her?

936
01:07:03,574 --> 01:07:06,984
Erm, she's an old friend
of the family, that's all.

937
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:10,313
# Love is not a toy

938
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:13,163
# When you find the one you love...

939
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:16,072
- Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

940
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,881
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

941
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:22,541
# If we could start anew

942
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,711
# I wouldn't hesitate...

943
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:30,141
When I hear music,
I can't make my feet behave.

944
01:07:30,271 --> 01:07:33,051
- Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

945
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:36,100
# Pain in my heart

946
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,189
# Caused by you

947
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:40,979
# You-ou-ou-ou

948
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:45,688
Sshh.

949
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,068
The Rydell fight song!

950
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:14,145
When you are finished...

951
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:19,804
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

952
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:27,602
I think we all owe
a round of applause

953
01:08:27,742 --> 01:08:31,362
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik
and committee

954
01:08:31,502 --> 01:08:33,822
for their beautiful decorations.

955
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:36,082
Let's hear it for the toilet paper.

956
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:45,000
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High,

957
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,379
God help us, and I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

958
01:08:49,519 --> 01:08:51,509
No heinie-biting.

959
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:54,929
And now, here he is,

960
01:08:55,059 --> 01:08:56,889
the Prince of the Platters,

961
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:59,478
Mr Vince Fontaine.

962
01:09:06,117 --> 01:09:08,787
Mr Vince Fontaine?

963
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:23,165
(drum rolls)

964
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:36,523
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

965
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:40,693
What's your name, sweetheart?

966
01:09:43,653 --> 01:09:46,113
And now, for the rules.

967
01:09:49,162 --> 01:09:53,031
Game rule one.
All couples must be boy-girl.

968
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:55,290
Too bad, Eugene.

969
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,000
Alright, alright. Come on.

970
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,000
Game rule two.
During the dance contest,

971
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:08,559
if you're tapped on the shoulder,
leave the floor, or else. I mean it.

972
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:11,718
And rule three,
anyone doing tasteless

973
01:10:11,848 --> 01:10:15,188
or vulgar movements
will be disqualified.

974
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:17,228
That leaves us out.

975
01:10:20,987 --> 01:10:23,447
Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean.

976
01:10:23,577 --> 01:10:25,867
20 seconds.

977
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:29,446
Thank you, fans and friends.
Now a few words to the wise.

978
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:31,236
You are my best pals.

979
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:35,285
To look your best for the contest,
just have a ball, that's all.

980
01:10:35,415 --> 01:10:37,664
Forget the camera, keep on the beat,

981
01:10:37,794 --> 01:10:41,244
give the folks at home a treat.
Keep dancin', that's showbiz.

982
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:44,134
If I tap you, step aside.
Let the others ride.

983
01:10:44,764 --> 01:10:47,084
Ten seconds. Nine, eight,

984
01:10:47,224 --> 01:10:50,804
seven, six, five, four,

985
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:54,303
three, two, one. On the air.

986
01:10:54,983 --> 01:10:58,682
Welcome to National Bandstand,
live from Rydell High School.

987
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:01,601
This is what you're waiting for,
the dance-off.

988
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:05,151
Away we go with
Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

989
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:09,440
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

990
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,620
# Cryin' all the time

991
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,830
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

992
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,660
# Cryin' all the time

993
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,799
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

994
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:22,879
Look. There's the camera!

995
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:33,728
That's Putzie and Jan.

996
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:50,075
# Said you was high class,
that was just a lie

997
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:55,445
# Call yourself high class,
that was just a lie

998
01:11:56,295 --> 01:11:58,864
# Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit...

999
01:11:59,004 --> 01:12:01,633
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1000
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:03,803
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

1001
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:05,383
# Cryin' all the time

1002
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,972
# Cryin' all the time

1003
01:12:11,102 --> 01:12:14,802
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

1004
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:20,231
(song ends)

1005
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:24,030
Now the event you've all been
waiting for, the national dance-off.

1006
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,110
Some guy and gal will get
some fantabulous prizes.

1007
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,740
Don't feel bad if I tap you out.
It don't matter if you win or lose,

1008
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,629
it's what you do
with your dancin' shoes.

1009
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,239
Does everybody here know Marty?

1010
01:12:38,419 --> 01:12:41,878
OK, cats, throw your mittens
round your kittens. Away we go!

1011
01:12:46,137 --> 01:12:48,376
That wasn't supposed to happen!

1012
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:51,006
Let's go, let's hand-jive!

1013
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:55,396
# Before I was born late one night

1014
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:58,816
# My papa said everything's alright

1015
01:13:00,116 --> 01:13:01,946
# The doctor made my ma lay down...

1016
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:04,446
Guy with the girl in red,
throw 'em out.

1017
01:13:07,414 --> 01:13:09,704
# Cos the bebop stork
was about to arrive

1018
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,954
# Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

1019
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:15,493
# I could barely walk
when I milked a cow

1020
01:13:17,003 --> 01:13:19,463
# When I was three I pushed a plough

1021
01:13:20,553 --> 01:13:23,222
# While choppin' wood
I'd move my legs

1022
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:27,392
# And I started dancin'
while I gathered eggs

1023
01:13:28,352 --> 01:13:30,311
# Townsfolk clapped, I was only five

1024
01:13:30,431 --> 01:13:33,011
# I'd outdance 'em all,
I was born to hand-jive

1025
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:36,861
Yes, split 'em, buddy.

1026
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:39,610
Go, go, go, go.

1027
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,700
Shake it. Shake it.

1028
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,730
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1029
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,329
Attagirl!

1030
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:49,699
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:53,668
Everybody!
# Born to hand-jive, baby

1032
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:57,827
# Born to hand-jive, baby

1033
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:01,377
Here we go.

1034
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:04,297
Hey, break it up! What is that?

1035
01:14:09,937 --> 01:14:11,426
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1036
01:14:12,686 --> 01:14:14,845
C'mon now, shake it!

1037
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:16,355
Yeah.

1038
01:14:17,405 --> 01:14:18,814
Twist it!

1039
01:14:28,953 --> 01:14:30,283
Alright, get it!

1040
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:03,728
# How low can you go?

1041
01:15:03,868 --> 01:15:05,608
# How low can you go?

1042
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,318
# How low can you go?

1043
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:38,904
There you go!

1044
01:15:41,034 --> 01:15:43,023
C'mon now, hand-jive!

1045
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:07,589
That's the stuff!

1046
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:12,269
Do it, baby!

1047
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:15,979
Do it!

1048
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:29,447
That's the hand-jive grand-jive!

1049
01:16:49,274 --> 01:16:51,644
Yeah, let's bring it up now!

1050
01:16:52,104 --> 01:16:53,184
Bring it on up!

1051
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:57,273
Higher!

1052
01:16:57,403 --> 01:16:58,983
Higher.

1053
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:02,613
Higher and higher!

1054
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:06,372
# Now can you hand-jive, baby?

1055
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:09,871
# Oh, can you hand-jive, baby?

1056
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:12,210
# Oh, yeah

1057
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,580
# Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah!

1058
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,550
Oh, yeah!

1059
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,840
Here they are, the new champs.

1060
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,130
Come on up here.

1061
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,268
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko.

1062
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:35,688
- We'll do it now.
- Where's Marty?

1063
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,277
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.
- Whose?

1064
01:17:40,737 --> 01:17:43,907
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1065
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:49,746
- # Blue moon
- # Blue, blue, blue, blue moon

1066
01:17:49,876 --> 01:17:53,705
# You saw me standing alone

1067
01:17:56,675 --> 01:18:00,805
# Without a dream in my heart

1068
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:07,054
# Without a love of my own...

1069
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:11,343
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

1070
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:13,723
# Blue moon...

1071
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,651
Who's that on the right?

1072
01:18:20,741 --> 01:18:24,161
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

1073
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:28,751
Just because it's not your faces
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1074
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:32,921
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington,

1075
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:38,249
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1076
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:43,128
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1077
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:08,705
C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands.
Move it out.

1078
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:11,205
I feel like a meatball in here.

1079
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,455
Let's go find the chicks.

1080
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:16,004
Marty. Marty.

1081
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:24,342
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1082
01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:27,762
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey. What's happening?

1083
01:19:29,062 --> 01:19:31,102
There's nobody here.

1084
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:37,992
Come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone I was sorry.

1085
01:19:38,112 --> 01:19:41,321
- I know you did.
- You believe me, don't you?

1086
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:44,650
Yes, but I still think
you and Cha Cha went together.

1087
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,619
We did not go together.
We just went together.

1088
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:51,749
- It's the same thing.
- No. No.

1089
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,946
- (screams)
- Ohh!

1090
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:17,736
Sandy, I'm sorry.

1091
01:20:27,044 --> 01:20:28,864
Sandy...

1092
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:32,413
Would you wear my ring?

1093
01:20:32,543 --> 01:20:35,003
Danny. I don't know what to say.

1094
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:37,213
- Say, yes.
- Yes.

1095
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:47,262
Danny, this means so much to me.
Cos I know now that you respect me.

1096
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,520
Hey, Rizz?

1097
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:58,070
Watch it.

1098
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,069
- What's with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1099
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,779
- I skipped a period.
- You think you're PG?

1100
01:21:05,919 --> 01:21:07,369
I don't know. Big deal.

1101
01:21:07,499 --> 01:21:10,369
- Was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1102
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:12,298
Rizz, look, it's OK.

1103
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:16,338
I caught Vince Fontaine putting
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1104
01:21:16,468 --> 01:21:17,468
Hey.

1105
01:21:17,598 --> 01:21:22,467
- Marty, you won't tell no one?
- Sure, I'll take it to the grave.

1106
01:21:26,477 --> 01:21:29,976
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1107
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:35,305
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1108
01:21:35,445 --> 01:21:37,274
Rizzo's pregnant.

1109
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:44,994
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1110
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:58,132
Rizzo's knocked up.

1111
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:04,391
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1112
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:07,721
You do?
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1113
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:10,650
Why didn't ya tell me about it?

1114
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,940
What's it to ya?

1115
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:16,190
- I might be able to do something.
- You did enough.

1116
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:21,079
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1117
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:25,278
Don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1118
01:22:30,918 --> 01:22:32,748
Thanks a lot, kid.

1119
01:22:33,717 --> 01:22:35,457
Any time.

1120
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:43,595
- (sneezes)
- Are you getting a cold?

1121
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:48,385
No. It's probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1122
01:23:00,744 --> 01:23:03,113
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy...

1123
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:05,283
Danny, what are you doing?

1124
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,572
Don't worry, nobody's watchin'.

1125
01:23:07,712 --> 01:23:11,122
- Get off me.
- Sandy, what's the matter with you?

1126
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:14,871
I thought I meant something to you.

1127
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:20,221
Think I'm gonna stay with you in this
sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin!

1128
01:23:21,181 --> 01:23:23,670
Sandy, you can't walk out
of a drive-in!

1129
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:36,359
# Stranded at the drive-in

1130
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:40,948
# Branded a fool

1131
01:23:41,828 --> 01:23:44,288
# What will they say

1132
01:23:45,577 --> 01:23:48,456
# Monday at school?

1133
01:23:56,006 --> 01:23:58,046
# Sandy

1134
01:23:58,176 --> 01:24:00,256
# Can't you see

1135
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:03,096
# I'm in misery?

1136
01:24:04,565 --> 01:24:06,605
# We made a start

1137
01:24:06,735 --> 01:24:08,884
# Now we're apart

1138
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:12,224
# There's nothing left for me

1139
01:24:13,523 --> 01:24:15,563
# Love has flown

1140
01:24:15,693 --> 01:24:17,573
# All alone

1141
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:21,832
# I sit and wonder why-aye-aye

1142
01:24:21,952 --> 01:24:25,372
# Why you left me

1143
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:28,202
# Oh, Sandy

1144
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:32,041
# Oh, Sandy

1145
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:34,251
# Maybe

1146
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:36,131
# Someday

1147
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:39,380
# When high school is done

1148
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:44,340
# Somehow, some way

1149
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,389
# Our two worlds will be one

1150
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:51,568
# In heaven

1151
01:24:51,688 --> 01:24:53,737
# Forever

1152
01:24:53,857 --> 01:24:57,277
# And ever we will be

1153
01:24:58,367 --> 01:25:01,657
# Please, say you'll stay

1154
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:04,987
# Oh, Sandy

1155
01:25:08,377 --> 01:25:10,946
Sandy, my darling,

1156
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:13,125
you hurt me real bad.

1157
01:25:14,215 --> 01:25:16,255
You know it's true.

1158
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:20,014
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say...

1159
01:25:21,804 --> 01:25:23,844
...I'm helpless without you.

1160
01:25:24,724 --> 01:25:26,803
# Love has flown

1161
01:25:26,943 --> 01:25:28,763
# All alone

1162
01:25:28,903 --> 01:25:32,943
# I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye

1163
01:25:33,073 --> 01:25:36,902
# Why you left me

1164
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:40,242
# Oh, Sandy

1165
01:25:42,372 --> 01:25:44,411
# Sandy

1166
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:48,991
# Sandy

1167
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:57,129
# Why-aye-aye-aye?

1168
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:00,678
Oh, Sandy!

1169
01:26:05,398 --> 01:26:07,358
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1170
01:26:14,488 --> 01:26:16,607
Well, the crate shaped up.

1171
01:26:16,737 --> 01:26:20,076
- It's as hot as the parts on it.
- We didn't steal all of it.

1172
01:26:20,206 --> 01:26:23,826
- Some of it was donated.
- Just wait till Thunder Road.

1173
01:26:23,956 --> 01:26:26,535
Right. You could still
change your mind.

1174
01:26:26,665 --> 01:26:30,335
- The flag is in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

1175
01:26:30,465 --> 01:26:33,294
- You coming?
- My boys won't let me down,

1176
01:26:33,424 --> 01:26:35,294
and I won't let them down.

1177
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:40,084
I wanna talk to you.

1178
01:26:42,313 --> 01:26:45,763
Those guys at Thunder Road
don't fool around, you know.

1179
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:48,813
You want me to punk out?

1180
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:52,192
No, I'm not saying punking out,
I'm just...

1181
01:26:53,492 --> 01:26:55,532
You know what I mean.

1182
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,071
Hey, Danny, erm...

1183
01:26:59,201 --> 01:27:01,361
We been friends a long time, right?

1184
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,660
Yeah.

1185
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,539
You remember the drive-in
the other night?

1186
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:11,169
The movie with the duel,
the guy's best friend went with him

1187
01:27:11,299 --> 01:27:13,419
as his lieutenant, his second?

1188
01:27:13,549 --> 01:27:15,379
Yeah. So?

1189
01:27:17,469 --> 01:27:22,048
Well, I thought that... you could
maybe be my second at Thunder Road.

1190
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:25,557
What, you want me
to drive with you or what?

1191
01:27:37,156 --> 01:27:39,735
Listen, I'll pick you up at three,
alright?

1192
01:27:40,825 --> 01:27:44,325
Open up the door.
What are you sitting around for?

1193
01:27:44,455 --> 01:27:47,464
Take the can off
the front of the car, you putz.

1194
01:27:53,974 --> 01:27:56,633
Hello, Rizz.
Are you going to Thunder Road?

1195
01:27:56,763 --> 01:27:58,093
Not a chance.

1196
01:27:58,223 --> 01:28:00,383
I have to go.
I have to talk to Danny.

1197
01:28:00,523 --> 01:28:03,852
Without wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1198
01:28:03,982 --> 01:28:07,682
We haven't been friends,
but if there's anything I can do...

1199
01:28:07,812 --> 01:28:11,860
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes along.

1200
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,150
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1201
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,940
Hey.

1202
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,870
Thanks.

1203
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:36,058
That's the one
I was telling you about.

1204
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:41,257
# There are worse things I could do

1205
01:28:42,147 --> 01:28:45,646
# Than go with a boy or two

1206
01:28:46,936 --> 01:28:49,096
# Even though the neighbourhood

1207
01:28:49,236 --> 01:28:52,406
# Thinks I'm trashy and no good

1208
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:56,285
# I suppose it could be true

1209
01:28:56,955 --> 01:29:00,655
# But there are worse things
I could do

1210
01:29:01,334 --> 01:29:06,294
# I could flirt with all the guys

1211
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:13,583
# Smile at them and bat my eyes

1212
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:19,761
# Press against them when we dance

1213
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:23,311
# Make them think they stand a chance

1214
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:26,721
# Then refuse to see it through

1215
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:30,481
# That's a thing I'd never do

1216
01:29:31,151 --> 01:29:36,320
# I could stay home every night

1217
01:29:37,829 --> 01:29:42,159
# Wait around for Mr Right

1218
01:29:44,918 --> 01:29:48,338
# Take cold showers every day

1219
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:51,337
# And throw my life away

1220
01:29:52,007 --> 01:29:55,097
# On a dream that won't come true

1221
01:29:57,227 --> 01:30:02,386
# I could hurt someone like me

1222
01:30:04,936 --> 01:30:10,315
# Out of spite or jealousy

1223
01:30:12,035 --> 01:30:15,314
# I don't steal and I don't lie

1224
01:30:15,454 --> 01:30:18,784
# But I can feel and I can cry

1225
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:23,043
# A fact I'll bet you never knew

1226
01:30:26,632 --> 01:30:31,172
# But to cry in front of you

1227
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:36,182
# That's the worst thing

1228
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:40,351
# I could do

1229
01:31:25,195 --> 01:31:28,394
- You guys think you got a winner?
- That's right.

1230
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:31,613
Takes more than a coat of paint
on Thunder Road.

1231
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:34,853
- Oh, yeah?
- Not thinking of changing your mind?

1232
01:31:34,993 --> 01:31:37,823
- No way.
- Good. Cos we're racing for pinks.

1233
01:31:37,953 --> 01:31:39,453
Pinks?

1234
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:42,153
Pinks, punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1235
01:31:46,002 --> 01:31:48,751
Stop. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1236
01:31:50,261 --> 01:31:52,301
Hey, get the dude, man.

1237
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:03,309
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair. From her chest.

1238
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:07,639
Poor Kenickie.

1239
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:14,318
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1240
01:32:14,448 --> 01:32:16,278
Gimme that.

1241
01:32:18,907 --> 01:32:21,697
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1242
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:25,997
- She's gonna.
- I brought you this for good luck.

1243
01:32:26,127 --> 01:32:27,456
Gee, thanks.

1244
01:32:27,586 --> 01:32:29,296
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get it.

1245
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,924
You putz!

1246
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:39,894
Put this under his head.

1247
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:44,564
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1248
01:32:44,694 --> 01:32:47,774
Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy.

1249
01:32:48,324 --> 01:32:49,944
You OK?

1250
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:53,193
Yeah. I'm OK.

1251
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:55,072
I'm fine. (groans)

1252
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:58,612
- You can't drive.
- No, really, I'm alright.

1253
01:32:58,742 --> 01:33:00,901
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1254
01:33:02,421 --> 01:33:06,121
- Hey, you want me to drive for you?
- Huh?

1255
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:08,750
Yeah. Yeah.

1256
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:11,090
Alright. Help him up.

1257
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:14,340
Marty, give me a hand.

1258
01:33:20,439 --> 01:33:22,849
(car engines start)

1259
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:30,858
Hey.

1260
01:33:30,988 --> 01:33:33,197
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1261
01:33:33,327 --> 01:33:36,197
To the second bridge and back.
First one back wins.

1262
01:33:37,957 --> 01:33:39,696
Haul ass, kid.

1263
01:33:59,354 --> 01:34:01,593
You ain't gonna see me
for dust, Zuko.

1264
01:34:34,559 --> 01:34:35,759
Come on, baby.

1265
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:27,923
# For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1266
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:32,263
# For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

1267
01:36:34,103 --> 01:36:36,762
# Look at me

1268
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:39,892
# There has to be

1269
01:36:40,442 --> 01:36:42,392
# Something more

1270
01:36:42,522 --> 01:36:45,311
# Than what they see

1271
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:48,561
# Wholesome and pure

1272
01:36:48,701 --> 01:36:52,230
# Oh, so scared and unsure

1273
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:57,109
# A poor man's Sandra Dee

1274
01:36:57,249 --> 01:36:58,579
Danny won.

1275
01:36:58,709 --> 01:37:01,158
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

1276
01:37:03,298 --> 01:37:05,828
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1277
01:37:05,968 --> 01:37:10,008
Not really. But I think I know a way
I could be. Could you help me?

1278
01:37:10,598 --> 01:37:12,758
- Of course.
- Can I come to your place?

1279
01:37:12,888 --> 01:37:14,518
Sure. Come on.

1280
01:37:19,146 --> 01:37:24,105
# Sandy, you must start anew

1281
01:37:24,855 --> 01:37:29,235
# Don't you know what you must do?

1282
01:37:29,365 --> 01:37:31,605
# Hold your head high

1283
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:36,124
- # Take a deep breath and sigh...
- Come on, Sandy.

1284
01:37:36,244 --> 01:37:38,244
# Goodbye

1285
01:37:38,374 --> 01:37:44,543
# To Sandra Dee

1286
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:02,061
Attention, seniors.

1287
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:05,309
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1288
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:08,649
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell High

1289
01:38:08,779 --> 01:38:11,869
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1290
01:38:11,989 --> 01:38:16,619
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1291
01:38:16,749 --> 01:38:19,159
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1292
01:38:19,289 --> 01:38:21,618
And among you young men,
there may be

1293
01:38:21,748 --> 01:38:25,087
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

1294
01:38:25,217 --> 01:38:28,087
or even a Vice President Nixon.

1295
01:38:28,217 --> 01:38:33,256
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1296
01:38:33,386 --> 01:38:36,306
Rydell forever. Bon voyage.

1297
01:38:37,356 --> 01:38:39,515
(chimes)

1298
01:38:42,855 --> 01:38:45,435
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1299
01:38:50,444 --> 01:38:52,274
(cheering)

1300
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:29,319
- How many?
- One.

1301
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:32,078
(bell rings)

1302
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:36,537
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

1303
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:38,207
How did I flunk phys ed?

1304
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:39,907
Did I take phys ed?

1305
01:39:41,547 --> 01:39:44,996
Step right up here!
It's for a wonderful cause.

1306
01:39:45,136 --> 01:39:49,676
The Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Give 'em a pie in the puss.

1307
01:39:49,806 --> 01:39:52,046
Coach, how could you flunk
the T-Birds?

1308
01:39:52,186 --> 01:39:56,135
Don't worry. You'll get diplomas.
Just come back to summer school.

1309
01:39:56,265 --> 01:39:58,725
- Summer school?
- Look out!

1310
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:04,404
If you'd come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1311
01:40:04,524 --> 01:40:06,934
Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach!

1312
01:40:08,903 --> 01:40:11,233
Why, you couldn't pitch one inning.

1313
01:40:16,162 --> 01:40:18,401
- What's your name? I want you.
- Eugene.

1314
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:21,251
- You're a great pitcher.
- Thank you.

1315
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:33,810
Rizzo! Rizzo!

1316
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:36,339
Get off of that. You got a condition.

1317
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:40,309
Forget it. It was a false alarm.
I'm not pregnant.

1318
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:42,068
Whoo-hooo!

1319
01:40:45,358 --> 01:40:47,768
I'Il, erm,
make an honest woman of you.

1320
01:40:48,318 --> 01:40:51,607
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1321
01:40:52,497 --> 01:40:54,237
That's a bona fide offer.

1322
01:40:54,367 --> 01:40:57,037
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses,
but...

1323
01:41:05,216 --> 01:41:08,715
- Hey, there's Zuko.
- You gotta be kidding, man!

1324
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:14,794
- What is this? Halloween?
- Where did you swipe the sweater?

1325
01:41:14,934 --> 01:41:18,724
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1326
01:41:18,854 --> 01:41:21,563
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1327
01:41:21,693 --> 01:41:24,892
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1328
01:41:25,032 --> 01:41:27,902
You guys can't follow a leader
all your lives.

1329
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:32,282
Come on, you know you mean
a lot to me, but Sandy does, too.

1330
01:41:32,412 --> 01:41:34,782
I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her.

1331
01:41:39,172 --> 01:41:41,241
(wolf whistles)

1332
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,339
Sandy?

1333
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:51,709
Tell me about it, stud.

1334
01:41:59,858 --> 01:42:01,818
# I got chills

1335
01:42:01,938 --> 01:42:03,898
# They're multiplyin'

1336
01:42:04,237 --> 01:42:08,697
# And I'm losing control

1337
01:42:08,827 --> 01:42:10,867
# Cos the power

1338
01:42:10,997 --> 01:42:12,986
# You're supplyin'

1339
01:42:13,116 --> 01:42:15,526
# It's electrifyin'

1340
01:42:22,255 --> 01:42:24,125
# You better shape up

1341
01:42:24,675 --> 01:42:26,914
# Cos I need a man

1342
01:42:27,884 --> 01:42:30,373
# And my heart is set on you

1343
01:42:31,343 --> 01:42:33,503
# You better shape up

1344
01:42:33,643 --> 01:42:35,433
# You better understand

1345
01:42:36,983 --> 01:42:39,133
# To my heart I must be true

1346
01:42:39,273 --> 01:42:42,773
# Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do

1347
01:42:42,903 --> 01:42:45,522
- # You're the one that I want
- # You are the one I want

1348
01:42:45,652 --> 01:42:47,442
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

1349
01:42:47,572 --> 01:42:49,861
- # The one that I want
- # You are the one I want

1350
01:42:49,991 --> 01:42:52,071
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

1351
01:42:52,201 --> 01:42:54,660
- # The one that I want
- # You are the one I want

1352
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:55,990
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

1353
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,000
# The one I need
