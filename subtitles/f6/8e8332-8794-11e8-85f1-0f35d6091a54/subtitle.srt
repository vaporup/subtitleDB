1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,642
Its body is armored
in iron and concrete.

2
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,376
Its mind is wrapped in
computers and high technology.

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,312
This is the city and
the time we're living in.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,291
But most people ignore
the unexplainable or mysterious.

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,530
Those things that we can't
figure out through ordinary logic.

6
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,899
Around these ordinary people,
following common rules...

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,664
all the while seeking out
strong desires and pleasures...

8
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,131
and hanging on to
a little happiness...

9
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:58,711
there exists a vast and fearful world
of darkness beyond our time and space.

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,585
I'm afraid I know all about it.

11
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,102
Taki, here you go.

12
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,876
I lost the bet, so I have to pay.

13
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,715
You just guessed wrong.

14
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,914
Yeah, but I've been a
bartender for a long time.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,455
I've never seen a girl whose kept
her guard up as much as Kanako.

16
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,755
How could I have imagined
that she'd accept your offer.

17
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,787
Tough Luck! I'll keep this.

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,862
Well, she's sure taking her time.

19
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,047
Thanks for waiting.

20
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,853
Here she comes. 10,000 yen.

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,691
What do you mean 10,000 yen?

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,829
Well, it's none of your business.
Is it Taki?

23
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:20,856
Right.

24
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,961
Oh, don't be so secretive.
Alright, I'll find out tomorrow!

25
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,428
Let's go!

26
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,570
So long Ken. Get back to work!

27
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,367
Got it.
See you.

28
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,205
Hey Taki, why don't we bet on
the Giants and Tigers game, next?

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,885
A re-match?

30
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,546
I accept!

31
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,589
That night, I was happy.
Like I fell into rapture.

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,959
She was the girl that I liked, at the
bar I frequently visited for 3 months.

33
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,055
Finally, she asked me
to come to her place.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,962
This was a surprise.
What made you change your mind?

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,480
Well...

36
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,680
You live in this luxurious place?

37
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,577
Isn't that a little too bold?

38
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't you like impatient girls?

39
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,356
Yeah, but I am more of
a romantic than I look.

40
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,636
You're so strong.
I'm so attracted to it.

41
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,845
This woman has a devil inside.

42
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,517
She completely changed
from how she was at the bar.

43
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:26,055
It was very different than what I'd
expected, but I'm not complaining.

44
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,259
You...

45
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,330
You realized a little too late.

46
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,033
You're of no use to me anymore.

47
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,986
Don't worry.

48
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,855
I'll relieve you right now.

49
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,556
It's OK.
I already got what I wanted.

50
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,194
What did you do to Kanako?

51
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,565
You're so worried about the girl?

52
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,969
I didn't kill her.

53
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,374
I just made her sleep in
the restroom, at the bar.

54
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,213
See you soon.

55
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,192
What is going on?

56
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,866
There's not much time before
the signing of the peace treaty.

57
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:36,711
WlCKED ClTY

58
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,727
Yes, you're right... yes...

59
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,065
Oh, of course I do.

60
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,926
Yes sir, I will do it.

61
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,765
Yes, thank you very much.
I'll talk to you later.

62
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,609
Mr. Taki, the President
wants to see you.

63
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,533
Sure.

64
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,148
Oh, I guess your playboy lifestyle
has caught up with you.

65
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,076
Take care of yourself.

66
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,513
Thanks for your concern.
It pierced my heart.

67
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,321
Hey Taki, you want to join us today?

68
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:19,361
Mah-jong? Sounds good!
But I'm completely broke.

69
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,662
You better look for another sucker.

70
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,673
There's no bigger sucker than you.
See ya!

71
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,504
You guys are all the suckers.

72
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,108
I'm Renzaburo Taki.

73
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,773
I work at the sales department of an
electronics company in Shibuya, Tokyo.

74
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,183
This is my official job.

75
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,478
Mr. Taki from the
sales department is here.

76
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,723
Let him in.

77
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,428
It's a MacGreggor, isn't it?

78
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,723
Yes. I finally got it.

79
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,729
The grip and hit are really nice.
It's perfect, just what I expected.

80
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,170
I like it.

81
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,699
By the way, I heard you
had a strange experience.

82
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,376
I guess we can't trust
the peace treaty.

83
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,315
Is it those extremists?

84
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,785
It seems so... but for now, I filed
a complaint with their leaders...

85
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,649
through the Vatican.

86
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,561
Well, you better be careful
which women you date.

87
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,432
Your biggest weakness is women.

88
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,169
Any reason for them to
be taking action now?

89
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,797
The signing ceremony date for the next
peace treaty has been moved up.

90
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,345
It will be held tomorrow, in Tokyo.

91
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,138
That's very sudden.

92
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,510
Investigations has discovered that
people from the other side...

93
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,014
have illegally infiltrated this side
by using a shield breaker.

94
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,585
We must take care of this quietly.

95
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,017
As you know...

96
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,395
I have no doubt, that when this
peace treaty is signed...

97
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,629
it will start a new era in the
relationship between both sides.

98
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:04,367
The terms of this treaty will continue
the peace for another 500 years.

99
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,805
Anyway, a V.I.P. is arriving at
Narita airport, 7 p.m. tonight.

100
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,840
He's attending the signing ceremony.

101
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,810
So I want you to guard him
until tomorrow.

102
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,450
For the Black Guard,
Mr. Renzaburo Taki.

103
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,357
The Black Guard,
that's my other face.

104
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,494
Your life is always
in danger with that job.

105
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,707
Who is he?

106
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,066
Giuseppi Mayart.

107
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,036
You must have heard of him.

108
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,808
He's finally coming here?

109
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,249
We can't close the
peace treaty without him.

110
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,845
Please guard him closely.

111
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,382
He' II be the main target of the
extremists who are against this treaty.

112
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,521
Thank you for giving me
such a thoughtful assignment.

113
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,392
I'll do my best.

114
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,658
Oh, one more thing.

115
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,628
They want to assign you a partner.

116
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,267
Her skills are the very best and
I hear she's good looking, too.

117
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,701
Well.

118
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,934
She' II be waiting for
you at the airport.

119
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,541
Look for the best
looking woman there.

120
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,942
One more thing.
She's from the other side.

121
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,846
A Black Guard from
the other side?

122
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,385
Yes, so don't get any
strange ideas.

123
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,986
Don't worry. I know,
more than anybody...

124
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,886
how scary the women are
from the demon world.

125
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,840
There is the world where humans live,
and then there's another world...

126
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,839
...the demon world.

127
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,880
We've been in contact with
each other throughout our histories.

128
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,278
The two worlds have sought interaction,
harmony, and coexistence...

129
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,181
Still, there have been
fierce and bitter battles...

130
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,552
fought between our worlds,
again and again.

131
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:14,525
Finally, the heads of our two worlds
made a treaty for coexistence.

132
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,996
It was a kind of a secret deal.

133
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,236
The truce is renewed
every couple of hundred years.

134
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:27,610
And now, as we approach
the end of the twentieth century...

135
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:32,151
these two worlds are trying
to close the new peace treaty.

136
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,095
I guess we can't resolve this
with friendly conversation.

137
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,685
Do you think that toy
will work on us?

138
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,493
Don't worry, this toy
isn't what you think it is.

139
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,291
That sounds good.

140
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,979
I'll get you this time.

141
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,333
Shit.

142
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,858
You're very cute.

143
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,228
But you don't look
good in this world.

144
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,101
Good bye.

145
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,816
I guess you're my partner.
You saved my life.

146
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,918
For a skilled guard of this side,
you're still quite a wimp.

147
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm much obliged by
your honest opinion.

148
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,223
I'm...

149
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,225
Renzaburo Taki, 25 years old.

150
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:46,269
Height 180 cm, weight 65 kg,
blood type AB.

151
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,773
Official job is a salesman of
an electronics company.

152
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,339
Monthly salary is 230,000 yen.
Single.

153
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,306
Bingo!

154
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,878
And you? Don't forget to include
your measurements, too.

155
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,180
I'm Makie, no last name.

156
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,686
My job on this side is as a model.
But I've got no reputation in that job.

157
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,654
The sponsors don't like me because
I scared off all the other models.

158
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:14,699
I see. Your beauty is too perfect.
It's almost unreal.

159
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,359
Thank you for the compliment.

160
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,736
Now we have to hurry.
He will be arriving soon.

161
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,005
Your dedication to the job
is such a sad thing.

162
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,906
But it's nice too meet you.

163
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,456
What kind of person
will we be guarding?

164
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,960
Giuseppi Mayart.

165
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,267
A traditional demon emissary
and a great medium...

166
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,162
I believe he had retired and was
living in the ruins of Pompeii...

167
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,009
or at the heart of the Apollonian Mountains,
after he attended the signing ceremony...

168
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,275
of the last treaty in 1851.

169
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,607
I heard he's the key person
for the signing ceremony.

170
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,412
Anyway, I hope everything goes smoothly.

171
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,649
But why did they choose
you as my partner?

172
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,086
I guess you must have great skill.

173
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,227
You mean you don't trust
women from the demon world?

174
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,758
Almost never.
I've had a very bad experience.

175
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,168
You probably deserved it.

176
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,632
I guess so.

177
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,367
This partnership is not
what I wanted either.

178
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,975
But I just follow my
superior's orders.

179
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,509
It doesn't matter. We have to stick
together until this assignment ends.

180
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,704
I agree.

181
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,533
Shit! They really did it.

182
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,008
This is too much to do,
just to kill one person.

183
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,875
It's terrible.

184
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,178
Indeed.

185
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,778
I had sensed danger,
so I moved up to an earlier flight.

186
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,017
I guess I was right.

187
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,684
Who are you?

188
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,419
I'm Giuseppi Mayart.

189
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,659
Nice to be with the
two of you tonight.

190
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,300
Well, I was told that a woman from
the other side would be guarding me.

191
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,397
But you're much more
beautiful than I had expected.

192
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,274
Don't be rude!
What did you just do to me?!

193
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,680
You're the rude one.

194
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,710
What do you mean?!
This is a greeting in the human world!

195
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,187
Mr. Mayart, I think it's good
that you're so lively...

196
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,155
but you have to be a little discreet.

197
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,557
Even though it's
just for tonight...

198
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,100
she and I have been
assigned to protect your life.

199
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,269
You can do anything you want after
the treaty is signed tomorrow...

200
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,299
but until then, I want you
to follow our rules.

201
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,339
What's the big deal? She's just a
woman of the demon world.

202
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,706
Who knows what kind of real form
she has under that beauty.

203
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:22,314
You already must know what happens
to the people who sleep with them.

204
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,223
They all became zombies after their
life energies were sucked out.

205
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:31,419
Do you know why so many people
still want to have sex with them?

206
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,158
Because of how it feels.

207
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:40,232
People feel such incredible ecstasy,
it can't even compare with human sex.

208
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,107
You should be careful too, because...

209
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,102
You should watch your tongue, sir.

210
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,614
I don't feel confident
protecting you by myself.

211
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,519
You don't have to worry about that.
A job is a job.

212
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,620
I will protect anyone,
even at the risk of my own life.

213
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,886
Oh, those words make me feel
really secure.

214
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,555
Then I leave the matter
to both of you.

215
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,425
Please make sure that
no danger comes to me.

216
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:13,805
But, I still want to taste this
special ecstasy at least once.

217
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,477
Anyway, where are you taking me?

218
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,886
A special hotel built
with an energy barrier...

219
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,519
to shield us from the demon world.

220
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,893
It was made for the safety
of special V.I.P. like yourself.

221
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,628
This place seems boring.
I came all the way to Tokyo.

222
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,866
Can't I visit some hostess club
or a massage parlor?

223
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,867
I was looking forward to going there.

224
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,734
I want you to stay in this room.

225
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,439
What a musty smell in here.

226
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,105
I've been waiting for you.
I'm the owner of this hotel.

227
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:35,114
You must be exhausted after
such a long trip to come here.

228
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,917
As you can see, our hotel
is not luxurious, but...

229
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,018
...please hold out for a while.

230
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,324
We will provide the
best service we can...

231
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,864
Long time no see.
Are you doing well?

232
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,694
Yeah. I've heard you
are doing well too.

233
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,998
How are the guest
arrangements today?

234
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,139
Don't worry,
it's just you guys.

235
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,981
It seems like a big terrorist group on
the other side wants to destroy this.

236
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,413
We should be careful, even if this
area is protected from invasion.

237
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,815
The barrier's resistance level has
been increased by three times.

238
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,849
Don't be so nervous!

239
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,021
How's he doing?

240
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,421
He's pushing me to take him out
and have some fun.

241
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,265
Mr. Mayart.

242
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,231
Oh, Taki.
This woman is so stubborn!

243
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,006
Look at this.
Massage Parlor Playboy.

244
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,477
They provide so many good
looking women. Let's go there!

245
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,180
You can't go anywhere.

246
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,316
Oh... you don't like that place?

247
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,287
How about this one?
Cabaret Club Queen Mate!

248
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,058
This must be the place for us!
Let's go to this place!

249
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,820
I will go with you wherever
you want, after this assignment.

250
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,857
Damn you. You're so picky.

251
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,926
How about this!?
And don't complain anymore!

252
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,769
Fashion Massage Love.

253
00:22:58,944 --> 00:22:59,694
Mr. Mayart!

254
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,004
I can not give you permission
to go outside of this room.

255
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,806
This is an order!

256
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,012
Damn it. You're stubborn, too.

257
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,080
You will sleep with us
in this room tonight.

258
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,686
No way. I certainly object.

259
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,652
I'll sleep with that woman,
but never with you.

260
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,993
I can't sleep with a
man being next to me.

261
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,696
Then you don't have to sleep.

262
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,695
Wh...wh-wh-what?!

263
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,798
Who do you think I am?

264
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,840
This peace treaty doesn't
conclude without me.

265
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,277
In spite of this, you still trap
me in such a crappy hotel.

266
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,269
This is outrageous!

267
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,842
This hotel is located above the
point where the most powerful...

268
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,549
spiritual energy can
be transmitted in Tokyo.

269
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,515
There is no way for them to enter.
They can't even come close.

270
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,219
Then, why is that woman here?

271
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,516
She is a member of the
Black Guard from the other side.

272
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,889
She has been trained
for this situation.

273
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,594
All right, if I can be alone with her,
I'll stay here.

274
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,001
Why don't you sleep in the hallway?

275
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,168
OK, I'll stay with you Mr. Mayart.

276
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,042
This is my chance to try a
woman of the demon world.

277
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,076
Keep your eye on him.

278
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,587
If he does something strange,
just tie him to the bed.

279
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,417
D...don't be rude!

280
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,252
What the hell are you telling her?

281
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:27,757
You fool!

282
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,258
You nincompoop!

283
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,521
Idiot!

284
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,060
The guest upstairs is a
truly important person.

285
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,626
Do you know him?

286
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,265
Giuseppi Mayart...

287
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,535
He came to Japan,
incognito, 20 years ago.

288
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,940
He hasn't changed much
since then, but...

289
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,101
What's wrong?

290
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,673
I wonder a little,
if he's for real or not?

291
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,776
It's just my intuition,
but in my humble opinion....

292
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,851
he might be a decoy.

293
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,884
That might be possible.

294
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,484
They use a decoy freely, to attract
the enemy's attention on us?

295
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,157
Oh, well.

296
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,224
Anyway, are you still single?

297
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,499
What kind of question is that?

298
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,301
Can't you tell by
just looking at me?

299
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,870
How about the lady
you came with?

300
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,699
Don't joke. She's a woman
from the other side.

301
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,510
You can't have children,
but I hear the sex is incredible.

302
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,679
Well, I've never thought I would hear
such words coming from your mouth.

303
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,146
Is that so?
It's just what I hear.

304
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,155
Do you like your job?

305
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,023
I don't know.

306
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,426
You must be proud of your work.

307
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,228
It's very honorable to have such an
important job, protecting both worlds.

308
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:17,836
Is it? I don't know if it's worth
protecting human or demon society...

309
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:21,105
by risking my own life.

310
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:28,976
It's because you still don't
have anything to truly protect.

311
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,374
You better find something fast,
then you'll understand its meaning.

312
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,380
Something to protect?
Is it that simple?

313
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,548
It is.

314
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,851
Checkmate.

315
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,663
Here, let's have one more game.

316
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,195
Old man, you never give up.

317
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,577
Don't complain!
I'm helping you kill time.

318
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,355
It's them!

319
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,026
Bastards! They're trying
to break the spiritual shield.

320
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,427
It can't be... there's no way
for them to enter here!

321
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,279
Here they come!

322
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,234
Mr. Mayart, don't leave there.

323
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,168
G...get them.

324
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,220
Makie, it's me.

325
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,166
Jin?

326
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,337
You look nice, wearing
the clothes of this side.

327
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,302
Very attractive.

328
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,545
I guess you've joined hand
in hand with the humans.

329
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,677
Traitor!

330
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,152
Why did you betray us?
Tell me!

331
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,159
Humans are such lowly
creatures compared to us.

332
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,366
They will just have to serve us.

333
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,569
There's no reason to be equal or fair.

334
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,804
I don't even want you
to understand.

335
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,385
You're as stubborn
as you used to be.

336
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,451
I should have made you
sleep with me back then.

337
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,222
Do you think you can take
my heart, if you take my body?

338
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,092
That's just the way you think.

339
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,362
Would you like to try?
I'II make you crazy.

340
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,953
Master.

341
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,625
Don't worry, they only got my
fake hand. You should go upstairs.

342
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:08,083
How's this? Your body is
more honest than you are.

343
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,067
Y...you!

344
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,575
Don't bother.
You can't use that trick.

345
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,855
Are you all right?

346
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:44,896
Yes.

347
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,322
Where is Mr. Mayart?

348
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,364
He's hiding in the bathroom.

349
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,012
What kind of emissary is he?

350
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:08,079
Sorry Taki. I relied on this
spiritual barrier wall too much.

351
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,246
Can you find Mr. Mayart?

352
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,420
Don't worry, I have an
idea where he's going.

353
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,232
This is paradise. I could never
imagine such a great place.

354
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,096
I'm glad I've lived long
enough to experience this.

355
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,234
I'm getting so full of energy,
because you are so pleased.

356
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,872
I'll give you the full treatment.

357
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,471
Here, why don't you lie
down on your back.

358
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,906
Here you are.

359
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,850
Oh, Sir, you have so much vitality!

360
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,146
I can even outlast young men.

361
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,060
Sir, how old are you?

362
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,521
I've been living so long,
I don't remember anymore.

363
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,093
But I am well past 200.

364
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,931
No way! Nobody your age
can keep it up like that.

365
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,500
We both have had a very long life.

366
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:12,279
Anyhow, you have marvelous breasts.
They're like art that God created.

367
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,322
Oh, you look like a baby doing that.
You don't look 200 years old at all.

368
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:25,822
Huh?

369
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,624
I swallowed something.
What was that?

370
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,969
What are you talking about?
I haven't had a baby yet.

371
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:32,997
There's no milk.

372
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,400
Here, let's continue.

373
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,613
Paradise, paradise!

374
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,151
Wha...
What the hell is this?

375
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,456
I'm going to take you to the
real Paradise, Giuseppi Mayart!

376
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,628
Y...you're a terrorist from
the demon world?

377
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,110
Mayart...!?

378
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,451
If you kill me, the old man dies too.
Do you want that?

379
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,484
Taki, rescue Mr. Mayart.

380
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:54,212
Both of your lives will end tonight,
no matter how far you escape.

381
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,949
You're the one
whose life will end.

382
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,066
This isn't good.
His life force is almost drained.

383
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,434
We have to give him
spiritual treatment.

384
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:16,871
Where are we going?

385
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,298
A spiritual treatment hospital.

386
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,439
It will take one hour
no matter how fast I drive.

387
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,910
I hope he can hold out until then.

388
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,791
There's no reaction to
my psychic powers.

389
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,760
He may not last
more than 30 mutinies.

390
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,029
He's caused a lot of trouble.

391
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,300
What's the matter?

392
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,613
They are trying to take us
into demon space.

393
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,772
Now what?

394
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,203
We've been transported
into demon space.

395
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,366
We're completely trapped.

396
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,042
Stop the car.
It's no use driving anymore.

397
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,682
What are you going to do?

398
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:42,293
Stay here with Mr. Mayart.
I will break the barrier.

399
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,823
That's too dangerous.

400
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,562
I told you. I'm willing to risk
my life for this assignment.

401
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,131
But I haven't heard your
measurements yet.

402
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,868
Mr. Mayart!

403
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,311
What's wrong?

404
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,451
Shit! That soap girl was a parasite.

405
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,164
What's going on?

406
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,609
Makie!

407
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,112
Taki... run away, hurry!

408
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,115
Please protect Mr. Mayart.

409
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,580
The demon space barrier
is about to open.

410
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,549
Hurry... hurry up and run...

411
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:23,812
Makie.

412
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,778
We're in Motoakasaka...
Still far away from the hospital.

413
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,514
Makie is gone...

414
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:36,824
She used up all her energy and power to
break through the demon space barrier.

415
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,492
She might have been blown up
when the barrier was broken.

416
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,004
She helped us by sacrificing herself.
A woman from the demon world.

417
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,809
I hope she's still alive.

418
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:12,824
SPIRITUAL TREATMENT CENTER

419
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,666
How is his condition?

420
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:26,010
His life force is incredible. I think
he'll recover in less than 30 minutes.

421
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,808
I want to make sure this place
has enough protection.

422
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,846
The spiritual barrier here is
20 times stronger than usual.

423
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:39,254
It's totally different from
the Teito Hotel in Hibiya.

424
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:46,693
We've been fighting with them for
5,000 years. We've learned a lot.

425
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,359
That sounds good.

426
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,356
Doctor!

427
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,526
What's the matter?

428
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,893
They're here! We're completely
surrounded by a demon space barrier...

429
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,030
within a radius of 5 kilometers!

430
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,304
Increase the barrier's strength.

431
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,076
Send a request for help to
India, Tibet, and Mt. Koya...

432
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,241
to strengthen the spiritual wave.

433
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,618
Mr. Mayart, you still
have a lot to go through.

434
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,319
Can you hear me,
Renzaburo Taki?

435
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,167
I have something interesting
to show you.

436
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,312
Makie!

437
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,031
How do you like it?

438
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,106
Look at this well.
This is the end of a traitor.

439
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,578
She is a resident of the demon world.

440
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,711
Despite that, she assisted
this deceptive peace treaty.

441
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,885
In addition, she's killed her ex-lover.
There is no way to forgive her.

442
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,556
I will let her serve the
desires of these men.

443
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,623
After that, I will torture her slowly.

444
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,499
Mr. Taki, don't you want
to rescue her?

445
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,066
You may be able to do it.

446
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,234
What do you think of that?
Why don't you come here?

447
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:38,904
Where are you?

448
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:39,877
Wait!

449
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,041
Don't go! This is a trick!

450
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,709
But they have clearly
challenged me!

451
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,086
Are you serious?

452
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,454
What do you think
will happen to me?

453
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,955
As a Black Guard,
you're supposed to protect me.

454
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,426
As long as you stay here,
they can't even touch you.

455
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,705
Is she that important to you?

456
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,636
Important enough to go and
save her by leaving me here?

457
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,272
Don't forget! She's a woman
of the demon world!

458
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,545
She's not human.

459
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,044
She sacrificed herself to save you.

460
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,815
Of course she should!

461
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,816
I'm an irreplaceable
Demon Emissary in this world.

462
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:31,456
The peace treaty of the two worlds
can't be signed without me.

463
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,932
Don't even compare me
with that monster bitch!

464
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:44,570
She deserves to be raped and
tortured by her fellow monsters.

465
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,404
She might even be enjoying herself.

466
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,353
I accept your challenge.
Let me go there.

467
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,195
My pleasure.
I will guide you.

468
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,058
Wha...what did you say?!

469
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:13,026
Y...you would leave me here?
I haven't given you permission!

470
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,401
Do you think you know
what you're doing?!

471
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,967
As a professional Black Guard,
you're acting ridiculous!

472
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,668
You fool!

473
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,876
Damn you!

474
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,650
Black Guard, Renzaburo Taki.

475
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,457
My sworn enemy has
fallen into our hands.

476
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,060
Don't even think that
I'll let you die so easily.

477
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,886
The woman... let Makie go.

478
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:52,299
Are you in love with her?
Do you want to sleep with her?

479
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,168
Don't express your
own dirty thoughts.

480
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,168
It doesn't matter.

481
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,406
I will test your ability
as a man, right now.

482
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,681
I will ask your body how
much you're involved...

483
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,986
with this disgusting
conspiracy that's going on.

484
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,949
What are you talking about?

485
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,642
Come to me. Inside my body...

486
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,683
No man can resist this.

487
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:20,584
Come on...

488
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:25,628
I will suck everything from you.

489
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,357
Hurry...

490
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,797
Come on! Hurry.

491
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,410
How's this?
Incredible, isn't it?

492
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,589
You will do anything I want.

493
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,329
Tell me about the
conspiracy on your side.

494
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:06,326
That woman... Makie.
Did you sleep with her?

495
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,479
Kill him.

496
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:44,532
Makie.

497
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,138
Taki...

498
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,648
Is he the prince who came
here to save the princess?

499
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,219
Your fantasy ends here.

500
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,710
The assimilation seems
like it's finished.

501
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,246
Do you understand...

502
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,950
what has just happened
to the men you beat?

503
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,785
Shoot!
Shoot as much as you want!

504
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,779
Renzaburo Taki,
this is your end.

505
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,207
Bastard!
How come you have so much power?

506
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,033
Are you all right?

507
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,047
You have a deep wound.

508
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,384
Thank you. I'm so happy.

509
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,852
I never thought that you would
have come here to save me.

510
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,123
You're my partner.
Of course I'll save you.

511
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,562
I became the enemy's hostage.

512
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,470
You abandoned your post,
right in the middle of an assignment.

513
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,375
We' II both be fired
from the Black Guard.

514
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,441
There's something
that worries me more.

515
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,848
What's this conspiracy they
were asking me about?

516
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,180
Why did they want to know
if I slept with Makie?

517
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,123
Is there a secret
conspiracy going on...

518
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,489
behind the peace treaty
being signed tomorrow?

519
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,796
Was the man who came to
the hotel, your ex-boyfriend?

520
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,793
That's history.

521
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,768
He completely changed after being
brainwashed by the terrorists.

522
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,136
He was a nice person before.

523
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,945
I had no choice but to kill him.

524
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:19,206
Don't worry.
That's the way our job goes.

525
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,387
Why did you become a Black Guard?

526
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,652
There are so many people
who want peace in both worlds.

527
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,187
Both worlds need to coexist
with each other.

528
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,598
For that to happen,
somebody has to do this job.

529
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,397
Is Mr. Mayart well?

530
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,031
He's being protected at
the spiritual hospital.

531
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,639
Do you want to pick him up?

532
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,804
Can you move?

533
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,039
Your psychic powers have
healed me well. I'm already cured.

534
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,376
But, you' II get cold
dressed like that.

535
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,705
What do you think?

536
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,678
You look great.

537
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,679
Now I can imagine that you
were working as a model.

538
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,283
You told me before,
I have unreal beauty.

539
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,124
I don't feel that way anymore.

540
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,762
You just have perfect beauty.

541
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:43,926
Really?

542
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,232
Sure, perfect.

543
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,470
Oh, I'm glad.

544
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,248
Already acting like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

545
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,385
You guys must've had
lots of fun, didn't you?

546
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:14,022
Your job is supposed to
be guarding Mr. Mayart!

547
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,627
How could you walk away from it,
just to do the things you want?!

548
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,993
You have disgraced me!

549
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,100
You guys are so happy-go-lucky.

550
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:27,740
You must've went to a love hotel
and made out. You rat!

551
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,539
Both of you are already dismissed.
Please leave here.

552
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,480
I will send you
a formal notice, later.

553
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:38,979
Go! Go! I'II have nothing to do with
incompetent people like you two.

554
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:40,053
Bye-bye.

555
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,423
Mr. Taki.

556
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,562
You have disappointed me.

557
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,961
You had a lot of potential to
become a great Black Guard...

558
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,034
but you're too much of a romantic.

559
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,170
That is your biggest flaw.

560
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,408
Is that you?
I've made a mess.

561
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,009
I underestimated him a little.

562
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:40,784
I'm sorry. I should have
finished him off, that last time.

563
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:46,150
We're the only survivors.
There's no time to call for backup.

564
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,519
Go and finish him, no matter what.

565
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,659
Yes. I got the result of his
body fluid analysis.

566
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,789
We were right.

567
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,666
He has the DNA?

568
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,465
Yes.

569
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,031
It will take a while for me
to regenerate. You take over.

570
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,537
I will take care of it.

571
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,554
Taki.

572
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,063
Don't say anything.
It's not your fault.

573
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,568
I did everything on my own.

574
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:40,338
I guess a romantic
isn't right for this job.

575
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,539
That's true.
Especially not me.

576
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,308
Well, I am quite a romantic myself.

577
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:49,540
Mr. Mayart!

578
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,708
Why did you follow us?!

579
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,877
Well, there are no sexy nurses
in that hospital.

580
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:02,455
All of them are rough men.
It felt so stuffy being there.

581
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,560
That isn't a good excuse!

582
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,655
Hey, hey. Can we go to a place
called "Cabaret Club" next?

583
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,626
Don't joke!

584
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,033
We got fired from being
your babysitter!

585
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,601
Don't be so hard on yourself.

586
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:22,640
Let's just do what I want to do,
and I'll take all the blame for it.

587
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:27,547
Mr. Mayart, don't you realize,
you have a very important job?

588
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,883
I know, I know!
I certainly know that!!

589
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,016
But I still have a
little time until then.

590
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,352
I refuse!

591
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,887
I will take you back
to the Teito Hotel.

592
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,355
It's much closer than taking
you back to the hospital.

593
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:44,358
Fine! Do that!
I can escape from there anytime.

594
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:51,571
Taki!

595
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,060
Makie, are you all right?

596
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:21,402
Yes.

597
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:22,899
She's coming.

598
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,688
Nice to see you again.

599
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,245
Taki!

600
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:11,749
Makie.

601
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:13,814
Traitor!

602
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,159
How could you fall
in love with a human?

603
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:23,299
People who love each other
can die together.

604
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,095
What an envious ending!

605
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:30,139
I'll chop up both of
your cursed bodies.

606
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,529
Who the hell are you?!

607
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,856
Taki.

608
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:10,958
Is this a dream?

609
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,299
If this is a dream,
I don't want it to end.

610
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:26,837
Tears...

611
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,007
This is strange...

612
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,074
We, who live in the demon world,
shouldn't have tears.

613
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:39,455
Why do I have
tears inside of me?

614
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:54,363
Whatever happened...
I guess we're still alive.

615
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,670
I wonder who brought us here?

616
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,537
Maybe God.

617
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,537
I'd love to think that.

618
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,763
Be careful.
They're very close.

619
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,107
Giuseppi Mayart!

620
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,536
What are you doing?
The enemy is behind you!

621
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:26,453
Perfect! I've finally encountered
my real enemy!

622
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,362
You guys have to hurry and go.

623
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,499
Go? Where should we go to?

624
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,509
To the signing ceremony of
the peace treaty, of course.

625
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,108
That's where you should go!

626
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,305
Both of you are the ones who must go.

627
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,474
Us?

628
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,640
You still don't realize it?

629
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,253
It wasn't you two
who were guarding me.

630
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,352
I was called here
to guard you two.

631
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,528
Then it was you who carried
us here and healed us?

632
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,560
Yes. I used my psychic powers
to heal both of you.

633
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,069
What's this all about?

634
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,505
I'll explain.

635
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,676
To insure a lasting peace...

636
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,345
we felt that some kind of
spiritual exchange was needed.

637
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,580
Something representing
the spiritual wave...

638
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,874
between the human world
and the demon world.

639
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,985
But the biggest barrier that kept
our two worlds from interacting...

640
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,657
is that there's no way to mix
the blood of each other's race.

641
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,200
However, after a few thousand
years of our effort...

642
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,664
some spiritual mutation had occurred.

643
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:47,868
There are still very few, but...

644
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,703
...we've produced some subjects whose
DNA can be mixed with each other.

645
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:54,041
And the scientists of both worlds
selected the best couple.

646
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,508
You and Makie are the first couple.

647
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:03,013
You two can have a child who bears
the gifts from both worlds.

648
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:08,025
And it's that child who will
become the leader of a new world.

649
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,327
Our...

650
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:13,560
...child?

651
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,026
Indeed.

652
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,569
These terrorists are afraid of that,
and have tried to kill you.

653
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,015
You doddering old fool!

654
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,548
How much more
will you interfere with us?

655
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:36,050
Oh, it's you. Still alive?
What are you made of?

656
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,760
We both should have taken
each other more seriously.

657
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:41,730
Let's bring this to an end.

658
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,136
Go and eat him up
until he's just bones!

659
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,600
Our power is far beyond
any humans' ability.

660
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,672
Y...you bastard!

661
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,522
Bastard!!!

662
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:17,345
Taki, are you all right?

663
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,789
I used too much power.

664
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,076
Are you still trying to regenerate?

665
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,288
I guess rapidly regenerating in his
condition must have some side effects.

666
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,118
Don't shoot!

667
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,254
The piece of meat will
just keep on regenerating.

668
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,470
Well, here we go!

669
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,180
Come on and fight me!
I'll turn you into a puff of smoke.

670
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,160
Makie.

671
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:39,660
Is she...?

672
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,724
What a miracle!

673
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,828
This is the effect of the mutation.

674
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:50,731
She has definitely conceived.
This power is the best proof.

675
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,605
Makie is already pregnant
with your baby.

676
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,580
I've never imagined the symptoms
would come so quickly.

677
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:10,422
There was one condition needed in
order for Makie to conceive a baby.

678
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:15,994
The laboratory concluded that in order
to conceive and transfigure the DNA...

679
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,599
the couple had to have
a spiritual bond of love.

680
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,666
That's why I made you go
through all this effort.

681
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,098
In order to bring out
your love for each other.

682
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:26,705
I don't believe this.

683
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,273
There was no other way
under such a tight schedule.

684
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:32,837
Forgive me.

685
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,445
You're a big fool!

686
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,078
Everything was planned ahead?

687
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,782
I'm afraid so.

688
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:44,616
However, nobody could predict if the
two of you could love each other.

689
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,428
I feel like beating you up.

690
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,957
Weren't you serious when
you made love to Makie?

691
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,268
Unfortunately...

692
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:58,937
Is it?

693
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,251
I thought so...

694
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:11,918
...at first.

695
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:14,254
Taki.

696
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,893
Do you believe a woman
of the demon world?

697
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:27,500
Those tears you had.
I believe they were real.

698
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,741
My, my...the results have
exceeded our expectations.

699
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,982
Maybe, Taki won't beat me up.

700
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,477
Well, shall we go?

701
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:49,718
A new treaty, the start of
a new life and a new world.

702
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,274
He's quite a character.

703
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:24,892
The long night ends.
A bright day breaks.

704
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,528
Just like the man at
the hotel told me...

705
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:32,228
Someone whom I should protect
is in my arms, right now.

706
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,372
And there is my child...

707
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:46,748
who doesn't even have shape,
but is inside of her.

708
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:53,751
This child may create a new future
for both worlds someday.

709
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,753
But...

710
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,228
my job...

711
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:06,997
as a Black Guard won't end
until that day comes.

712
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:35,362
