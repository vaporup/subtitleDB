1
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:37,022
The Nuclear Explosion
has ruined the city.

2
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:39,325
Also, changed our destiny.

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,934
Radiation has contaminated the water.

4
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,472
This unprecedented catastrophe.

5
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:51,169
It gives birth to an ambitious genius.

6
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,745
Who invented
the Water Purification System.

7
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:56,474
The basic need of mankind is in his hand.

8
00:00:56,684 --> 00:01:00,051
He vows to rule the world.

9
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,134
I haven't seen my two good friends
for a long time.

10
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:21,466
We'd accomplished
many great tasks together.

11
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:25,239
The Nuclear Explosion dispersed us.

12
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,907
The whole city is
in the state of ferment...

13
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:31,876
robbery, riots, bloodshed...

14
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:35,316
People are killing each other,

15
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:36,821
for survival.

16
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,685
For all my effort.

17
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:41,057
I just manage to ensure the donation...

18
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,187
the medicine is safely sent to the needy.

19
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,240
What a huge tank of water? Where to go?

20
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:39,470
I wasn't told.

21
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,877
"Clear Water Corporation."

22
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,494
Water bandit again!

23
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:18,916
Stay away.

24
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,599
Hired to kill me?

25
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,237
He's too poor to hire.

26
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:41,136
We're told to explode all the tanks,

27
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:42,607
if we're being mugged.

28
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:46,110
Thanks for giving a hand.
Or I'll return with bare hands.

29
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,908
So, how about a 50/50 share.

30
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,853
I knew you're mean.
I didn't call for your help.

31
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,579
Ungrateful chick.

32
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:56,883
There's no free lunch.

33
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,251
Bye!

34
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:16,071
I work hard for money, what you for?

35
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:17,539
50/50.

36
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,806
30/70.

37
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:21,876
50/50.

38
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,182
A deal! 50/50.

39
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,417
I changed my mind.

40
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:34,322
60/40 mine 60. Yours 40.

41
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:35,860
It's unacceptable.

42
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:38,827
Not to someone apathetic.

43
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:42,362
Scoundrel!

44
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,097
You'll take the small one.

45
00:05:58,886 --> 00:05:59,944
Water!

46
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:03,715
Come. It's from Clear Water Corporation.
Water!

47
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,770
About the water bandit incident today.

48
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,771
Spokesman of
the Clear Water Corporation alleged,

49
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:23,843
the government is incompetent
to protect them.

50
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:26,844
So they consider a price raising.

51
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,038
If they succeed.

52
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,150
It'll the fourth times this fall.

53
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:31,849
Here is the special news.

54
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:33,815
Damn! Price raised again.

55
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:36,956
Mom, is it?

56
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,258
What is it?

57
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,790
A fish.

58
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,127
Fish has no legs.

59
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,365
Then, how can a fish walk?

60
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,691
Let mom show you.

61
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:55,905
Once upon a time, fish swam in the water.

62
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:57,810
It's cute.

63
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:02,113
Mom, I've a tooth loosen out today.

64
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:06,548
Can I hide it for a wish?

65
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,516
Where do you like?

66
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,321
Are you serious?

67
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,054
Please.

68
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:18,558
This is the last time.

69
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,015
Is it fun?

70
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,311
Yes. One more time.

71
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:39,316
Please, no.

72
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,216
One more. Please.

73
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:45,522
Ching.

74
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,119
Dong Dong.

75
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,961
Auntie San.

76
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,194
Cindy, a peach for you.

77
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:18,651
Have this.

78
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,389
Taste it.

79
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:25,062
How a woman uses Ku Fung to please kid!

80
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:28,101
Auntie, have you ever met Wonder Woman?

81
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:31,729
How about you?

82
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:35,838
Mom said Wonder Woman had a Wonder Baby.

83
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,776
She's too busy,
no time to show up anymore.

84
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,106
Really?

85
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,540
Are you hungry? I'll get some bread.

86
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,114
Let's wait for Chat.

87
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,316
See what I've got.

88
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,313
Water.

89
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:53,153
Hurry up. Let's bath.

90
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,224
Move, have a good bath together.

91
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,059
Kiddie, come.

92
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,290
Terrific.

93
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,091
I knew you did it in the afternoon.

94
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,498
So what?

95
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:06,664
You may spare some for the needy.

96
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,635
Mom, it's fun.

97
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,767
Come.

98
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:11,876
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

99
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:13,341
Let's celebrate.

100
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,844
You're hopeless.

101
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,081
It's damn good.

102
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,481
Don't talk indecent in front of kids.

103
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:21,912
It's your fault.

104
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,353
Kids reminds us of our age.

105
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,755
Let me see.

106
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,156
You're still in good shape.

107
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:29,488
Sure!
I keep fit.

108
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:30,358
Really.

109
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,122
No! It hurts!
Stop.

110
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,528
The Spiritual leader of
White Solar Society.

111
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,167
Daddy's on TV.

112
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:38,202
Denouncing the water scheme is inhumane.

113
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:41,899
He aims to provoke the crowd.

114
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:45,176
If there's clean water, there's way.

115
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:47,673
I've enough of the news.

116
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,748
Kiddie. Turn it off.

117
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,977
Not seeing doesn't mean not happening.

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,781
Though the country is
in a state of ferment,

119
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:56,082
chances of grasping money is abundant.

120
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,053
If three of us cooperate,

121
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,589
we'll make a lot of money.

122
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,353
No way.

123
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,961
Go to Auntie Chat.

124
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,658
Come here.

125
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,284
30,000 people will come
for Chong Hon tonight.

126
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:34,952
We must have them under surveillance.

127
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:39,326
Last the gathering convert into riot.

128
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,594
All of us must alert.

129
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:46,670
My fiancee gave it to me.

130
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:55,806
I haven't slept for three days.

131
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,148
I'm dying.

132
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:02,411
You aren't the only one.

133
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:08,926
Stay.

134
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,428
Are you deaf, stay.

135
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,597
Get her.

136
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,278
Why they want us to die?

137
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,612
In fact, there's no any clean water.

138
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,378
Why keep sending us out?

139
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,923
Chong Hon said
territory is all contaminated.

140
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,457
Your Water Scheme is deceptive.

141
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:42,128
Put down your gun first.

142
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,387
Stay.

143
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:47,898
No!

144
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:51,898
I pleaded my husband not to go.

145
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:56,167
It's wise to stay here.

146
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:57,674
At least, there's no radiation.

147
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,569
We may live longer.

148
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:22,423
Let me talk to Daddy.

149
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,127
She wants to talk to you.

150
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:25,636
The crowd will revolt
in the Square tonight.

151
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,307
Don't wait for me. I'll be on duty.

152
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:29,533
But give my girl a kiss, please.

153
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,372
Merry Christmas...

154
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:35,074
Let me talk to Daddy.

155
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,913
Liar! He said he'd come home for Xmas.

156
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,616
Daddy told me to give you a kiss.

157
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,692
And Merry Xmas too.

158
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:52,923
Dad's kiss is different, he'd beard.

159
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,130
- Too bad.
- What's the matter?

160
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:59,100
- Dad can't have the roasted chicken.
- That's right.

161
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:40,077
Objection!

162
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,943
Chief, all units are ready.

163
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,173
Roger.

164
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:45,549
Report to me when Chong Hon arrives.

165
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:51,818
Which fairy fanned.
To cover the earth with snow.

166
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:55,691
Help! Give me back.

167
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,723
It's my water.

168
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:00,962
Scum! Give me back.

169
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,342
Mom, you're wonderful.

170
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,948
Marvellous!

171
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,813
Don't let Daddy know.

172
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,286
Thank you.

173
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:23,682
No problem.

174
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:33,859
- All units, standby.
- Yes.

175
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,134
Calling Team One.

176
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:42,802
Lot of people died of radiation
for waters.

177
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,775
We like to confer with the Government.

178
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:56,888
Stay calm unless I give my order.

179
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,752
Yes.

180
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,261
Where is Daddy?

181
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:05,726
Let's go there.

182
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,090
Good.

183
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,167
They said out there are clean headwaters.

184
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:19,506
But, the expedition members died
one after one.

185
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,007
Why did they die of radiation?

186
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:26,484
Why?

187
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,781
Blasphemous! Show me the headwaters then.

188
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,823
Mrs. Lau, why so late?

189
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:33,688
Where's the Commissioner?

190
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:35,351
- There.
- Thank you.

191
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,127
You said your guns.

192
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,561
It's used for protecting us.

193
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:43,964
Why do you point them to us now?

194
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,331
Compel us to
look for nonexistent headwater?

195
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:51,136
Whose order to fire?

196
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:52,711
Chong Hon, run!

197
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:55,679
Why? Why fired? Why?

198
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:00,816
Cindy!

199
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:02,922
Don't panic.

200
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:10,796
Send more assistance from Headquarter.

201
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,573
They killed our people.

202
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:35,881
Release tear gas!

203
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:59,841
Cindy!

204
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:06,749
All squads cease firing.

205
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,684
Husband!

206
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,357
Why are you here?

207
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,120
Cindy is lost among the crowd.

208
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,691
Why do you bring her along?

209
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:17,125
What a mother you are?

210
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:32,568
Mom!

211
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:41,218
Don't cry! Let me take you to your mom.

212
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:45,717
Cindy...

213
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,827
Mom.

214
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:52,658
"The for seasons compose a saga."

215
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:57,132
"With ups and downs."

216
00:17:57,337 --> 00:18:01,296
"They interchange like a windmill."

217
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:06,003
"And make your heart tremble."

218
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,112
Where's the roast chicken, mom?

219
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:15,986
Dumped.

220
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:18,090
Remember our promise?

221
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:20,383
Go.

222
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:24,390
Bye. Dad.

223
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:34,837
"Which fairy fanned..."

224
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:40,378
"To cover the earth with snow."

225
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,349
"An ant has its cave.
A house has a door,"

226
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:48,216
"from where one hears the wind blow."

227
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,356
He hasn't any record
in the military file.

228
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:51,888
Will that be Chong Hon's conspiracy only?

229
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:54,322
An anti-government emotion
by firing someone.

230
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:55,295
Anyway.

231
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:56,956
Spread out his photos immediately.

232
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:58,325
Can I talk to you alone?

233
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,363
- Please leave the room.
- Yes, Colonel.

234
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:06,196
Lately I've been thinking.

235
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,205
Who will sacrifice his life
for the country.

236
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,506
You're the one.

237
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:13,972
What can I do?

238
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:15,775
Assassinate Chong Hon.

239
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,348
He's getting influential,

240
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:22,015
our Government will be overthrown soon.

241
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,587
Casualties will be enormous then.

242
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:25,621
If Chong Hon dies.

243
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:27,292
Chaos will not last long.

244
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:31,888
And the society will soon back to normal.

245
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,894
I'll give you time to think it over.

246
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,730
But reply me before New Year Eve.

247
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,570
Because Chong Hon
has gathered some crowds.

248
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:45,076
It's a mourning ceremony on New Year Eve.

249
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:49,446
I'm afraid, he'll make use of the crowds.

250
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,581
Send five cartons of medicine
to the South.

251
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:54,846
Are you going?

252
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,548
I'll join you later.

253
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:06,431
You should know me.

254
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,498
The President's deputy.

255
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,501
I'm ashamed of the title.

256
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:14,764
Even though I'm so close to him.

257
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:15,908
I can't give him any advice.

258
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,043
It's hard to control famine people.

259
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:19,473
I've got the right person.

260
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,441
What do you want from me?

261
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,548
To form an expedition team,

262
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:23,807
to look for clean headwaters.

263
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,385
You still believe it
after so many deaths?

264
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,383
Yes.

265
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:30,623
I'll prove to you later.

266
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,688
Some officers conspire to kill Chong Hon.

267
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:34,793
But they should consider the consequences.

268
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,020
I need someone trustworthy
to convince him,

269
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,660
his goals can be achieved by
co-operating with the government.

270
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:41,992
Goals?

271
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,867
People talk dull in places like this.

272
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,944
Nothing but money can amuse you.

273
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:53,805
What's that?

274
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:00,110
The blood stains on the stole,

275
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:02,550
remind us of our path of glory.

276
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,815
What do you want to tell?

277
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,157
To search the clean headwaters.

278
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,763
I strive for nothing but money.

279
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:14,297
Sorry, I took a pledge to my husband.

280
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,801
Then the stole means nothing to us.

281
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,063
No!

282
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:03,508
Don't!

283
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,077
If you really want us to die with you,
I'll.

284
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:08,047
If an oath becomes a burden,

285
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,621
it's inept.

286
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,773
How long
do the Nuclear Catastrophes last?

287
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,737
It's inept for a Wonder Woman now.

288
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,913
But the baby needs a mother completely,

289
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,608
to help her to go through hurdles.

290
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,284
I pledge to you.

291
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:45,082
I'll be a good wife and a good mother.

292
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,589
Never ever a Wonder Woman.

293
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,630
I prefer gold not cash.

294
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,068
You can refuse.

295
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,702
You'd better be smart.

296
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:13,311
Be good in jail.

297
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,639
Take him away.

298
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:18,881
You aren't allowed.

299
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,313
The Chief is my good friend.

300
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:21,748
Let me in.

301
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:24,053
Shift. Come on.

302
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,154
Chief.

303
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,054
Go to hell.

304
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:40,272
You'd seen something confidential.

305
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,034
Did he agitate the riot in the Square?

306
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:43,902
I'll find him for you.

307
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,874
You are the head-hunter, Chat.

308
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:51,276
Sure I am, the best.

309
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,049
$300,000. Enough?

310
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,785
It deserves $400,000 at least.

311
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:58,749
If you catch him alive,
I'll pay $800,000.

312
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,256
Gold.

313
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:01,786
Attractive!

314
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:03,991
So what?

315
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,290
Let her take it.

316
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:08,934
Look forward to my good news.

317
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:16,165
You aren't allowed unless I call you.

318
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:18,573
May I know who starts shooting.

319
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:19,802
Who did it in the Square?

320
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:22,073
How dare you disparage me.

321
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:24,808
I raise you
up to represent righteousness.

322
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:28,044
For justice I fight with the government,

323
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:30,415
until the right at the Square.

324
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,057
I begin to wonder...

325
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,054
I'm inducing the bloodshed.

326
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,025
You're powerful enough,

327
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:39,098
to compel the government
to make concessions.

328
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:40,963
What a holy man you are!

329
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,431
Delighted in being a spiritual leader?

330
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,332
Are you feeling like a Savior?

331
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,105
- I don't.
- You do.

332
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,240
Never try to supersede me.

333
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,343
Your hands are trembling.

334
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:58,074
I chose you,

335
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,811
because the mobs like handsome looking.

336
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,879
What should I do now?

337
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:06,820
As you think you're brainy,

338
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:11,761
do whatever you like to.

339
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,729
You may go now.

340
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:16,192
- Mr. Kim.
- Out.

341
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:24,773
I really want to see
what's inside his brain.

342
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:34,275
It's over. He's deviated.

343
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,549
I hope our next generation.

344
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,590
They're able to live in genial planet.

345
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:44,494
For this operation.

346
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,791
You're responsible solely.

347
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,758
As usual, I'll accuse you.

348
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,735
This is a secret even to your family.

349
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,242
When times comes, you'll be retaliated.

350
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,989
Don't kill him.

351
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:25,868
Why do you want to kill me?

352
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,973
Assassination is not a solution.

353
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,607
You're wrong.

354
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:57,898
What're you looking?

355
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:33,905
Why he's being tailed so easy?

356
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,869
Isn't it strange?

357
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,766
He's mine.

358
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,279
I've been following him whole day.

359
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:44,476
A dummy indeed.

360
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:49,612
Stay.

361
00:28:58,731 --> 00:28:59,493
Give me.

362
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:00,994
For what?

363
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,615
Bitch.

364
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,289
You can't take him away.

365
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:30,862
Piss off!

366
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:32,893
A bomb?

367
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,023
My treat!

368
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,100
A bomb!

369
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,230
Disperse.

370
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:40,533
No back door?

371
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,571
Still some thugs?

372
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,748
Pain in the ass!

373
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,882
I've been tracing the gunman.

374
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,384
But stupid Chat
has caught him last night.

375
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,555
What coincidence of the Press Conference.

376
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:01,421
The Chief, Chong Hon all take place here,

377
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,088
the gunman set up as being caught.

378
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,393
Somebody uses Chat.

379
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:09,329
They're connected each other somehow.

380
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:10,628
I'm sure.

381
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:13,870
Wash your hands after drawing.

382
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,335
Yes, mom.

383
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,273
"Out of order."

384
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,648
I knew you can't refraining
from hearing this,

385
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,254
because you're incorrigibly nosy.

386
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:30,183
You deserve it.

387
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:32,857
I know I've been hot-tempered lately,

388
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:37,890
and given too little care
to you and Cindy.

389
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:40,897
Sorry.

390
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:46,265
Often, and old couple finds
talking candidly difficult.

391
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,906
I just want to confess to you,

392
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:53,809
having you and Cindy,

393
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,380
is the greatest accomplishment
in my life.

394
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,911
I love you!

395
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:05,414
Thanks for your effort of expediting.

396
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,149
Our liaison with Chong Hon.

397
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:12,723
We may have a drink after the conference.

398
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:17,428
This the permit.

399
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:19,399
As Chat brings along the gunman,

400
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:21,096
stay close to her.

401
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,036
Forestall any intruders.

402
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:44,523
Welcome, Mr. Chong Hon.

403
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,460
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

404
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:47,996
Husband.

405
00:31:57,676 --> 00:31:58,938
You may escort the President out here.

406
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:01,806
Not until it's completely safe.

407
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,141
Chong Hon's here.

408
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,517
Chat is coming soon.

409
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:11,990
Get off!

410
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:15,493
Damn you!

411
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,423
Give me your hand.

412
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,067
A permit from the Deputy.
I'll take him with me.

413
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:24,527
Yes.

414
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:26,662
Go.

415
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,300
Hand him over to me.

416
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:31,376
You may have the money.

417
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:32,703
For the safety of Chong Hon.

418
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,779
He'll show up only
when the meeting begins.

419
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:40,509
Husband.

420
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,047
What brings you here?

421
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:52,524
I've heard the tape. I'm sorry.

422
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,528
Hello... yes...

423
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,939
Ok, Chat's here.

424
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:09,979
Stop feigning.

425
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,082
Is the trip alright?

426
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,410
Don't pretend you know everything.

427
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:13,883
- You caught him in vain.
- You're poisoned.

428
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,680
Who care? I got my money.

429
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,312
You're immutable!

430
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,386
The Chief likes to see you.

431
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:20,989
Wait here.

432
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:23,091
From now on,
he's not allowed to leave the room.

433
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:24,320
Yes, Chief.

434
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:28,164
If I get into trouble, you too!

435
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:31,303
I hope you may
cancel the press conference.

436
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:34,406
Because the Press Conference
and the gunman,

437
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,473
they're plotted insidiously.

438
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:38,234
Chong Hon's rarely willing to make peace.

439
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:40,038
We can't cancel it, no way.

440
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,147
If anything happens,
I'll take the responsibility.

441
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,748
No one can take that.

442
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:46,341
What will happen?

443
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:48,679
I, Chat, will bear sole responsibility.

444
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:52,886
Commissioner, press are all here.

445
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,557
Let's go.

446
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:03,969
Husband.

447
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,133
Take care.

448
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:09,364
I'll be fine. You go home.

449
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,849
Don't worry.

450
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:36,263
Where's Colonel? I need my money.

451
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:39,128
We're pleased to
have Mr. Chong Hon today,

452
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:42,569
to present for the peace talk.

453
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,438
The gunman in the Square
has been arrested.

454
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:53,511
Sorry, you shouldn't disrupt the meeting.

455
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,565
A present from Mr. Kim.

456
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:27,380
Stop the President from leaving.

457
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,750
Run.

458
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:33,825
You arranged the peace talk.

459
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,519
People will blame you
for Chong Hon's death.

460
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:40,291
- Run...
- Run before it is too late.

461
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,663
This's Colonel.

462
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:50,775
Kill the Chief, the Commissioner.

463
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,657
Where's my husband?

464
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,924
The Colonel took him away.

465
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,658
You said I'll be alright.

466
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:14,261
The Congress House is out of control.

467
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,867
According to the report,
the missing Commissioner

468
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:20,700
Mr. Lau,
is responsible for Chong Hon's death.

469
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:23,842
Chong Hon
has embarrassed the Commissioner.

470
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:27,002
Because of his discontent
with the Government.

471
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:30,245
Daddy.

472
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,916
- Cindy, where's Mom?
- She's out.

473
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:33,745
Where's she gone?

474
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:38,981
You are betrayed.

475
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:41,321
The Colonel has ordered to perish you.

476
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:45,427
Run at once.

477
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,061
Tell my wife to meet us at the station.

478
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:51,827
Aren't we waiting for Mom?

479
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,802
I'll tell her.

480
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:57,833
Thanks.

481
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,163
Colonel, we lost the target.

482
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,026
Please leave the station.

483
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,031
Mom, a few tickets left.

484
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,732
It rumors people congregated
are to be arrested.

485
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,672
The government is insane
for killing Chong openly.

486
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,076
There's curfew after midnight.

487
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:37,546
This is the last train.

488
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,246
Tickets all sold out.

489
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:51,655
The Government is keeping the tickets.

490
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,265
Where's Mom?

491
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:17,817
Let me get in.

492
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,432
Go.

493
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:44,382
I ain't going without Mom!

494
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:45,914
I'll come back later for her.

495
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,881
No!

496
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:49,111
Stop that!

497
00:38:50,188 --> 00:38:51,450
Cindy.

498
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,602
Mom...

499
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:08,766
Cindy.

500
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:14,804
Mom...

501
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,540
Cindy, don't go.

502
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,045
Attention.

503
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:28,455
Mom.

504
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:33,390
Where have you gone? You'll kill us.

505
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:42,568
Daddy.

506
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,161
"All mortal pursue loves with loves."

507
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,910
"Finally find a flame passion
lurks pathos."

508
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:29,686
"Blessed are the impersonate,
yet lacks fullness."

509
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:36,859
"Love mellows
without grudge of fretfulness."

510
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:45,626
"My loved one
once shared his reminisce,"

511
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:52,938
"all loves had resemblance."

512
00:40:53,912 --> 00:41:00,181
"The day I was stricken by the feel."

513
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:07,456
"I saw a magnetic field."

514
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:13,865
Imprison those alive as rioters.

515
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,860
Burn the corpses.

516
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:22,638
"Be incredulous to a vow of fidelity."

517
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:30,570
"The reign of love has no fairy tale."

518
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,720
Thank you.

519
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,365
Things happened as your calculation.

520
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:51,900
People're terrified,

521
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:53,968
they deeply recanted the government.

522
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:56,538
It's time for next step.

523
00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:59,875
But they begin to be dubious about us.

524
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,639
Action must be imminent.

525
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:03,907
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

526
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:05,140
Ok.

527
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,012
Wait, I had a dream last night.

528
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:10,145
Dreadful!

529
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:11,986
Really.

530
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:15,924
The president's dead in my dream.

531
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:20,461
You're in charge
and practiced militarism.

532
00:42:21,032 --> 00:42:24,001
Still I were a faceless man
who hid in shadow.

533
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:26,401
You and I are inseparable.

534
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,973
Your money and intelligence,

535
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,742
will my military power,

536
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:33,210
it makes us the best rulers.

537
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:38,912
The world is belonged to us soon.

538
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,780
You and me?

539
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:47,257
Me and you?

540
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,329
Me and me!

541
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,102
I hope to expedite the burial,

542
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:07,869
but we don't have enough hands.

543
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:11,380
Chances of finding your friend here
is lower.

544
00:43:57,629 --> 00:44:00,996
Mom...

545
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:03,167
It's late when I got to the station.

546
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,269
I could only find Cindy.

547
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:09,999
He makes use of Chong Hon's death,

548
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,273
as an excuse for military dictatorship.

549
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:14,412
He planned it all.

550
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:17,308
Shit! I took his money!

551
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:19,512
Give my parents back.

552
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,483
Cindy, be quiet!

553
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,157
Stop the bullshit.
You're the President's man.

554
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:30,227
Find Dong Dong for us.

555
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:31,895
I'll pay whatever it costs.

556
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,229
I'm sorry.

557
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,867
If I clash with the military now.

558
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:39,263
It's just worsen the situation.

559
00:44:40,438 --> 00:44:41,598
You're a big shot!

560
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:43,434
It's just a piece of cake.

561
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:44,870
Chat.

562
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,511
I'll look for her secretly.

563
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:49,671
Time is running out.

564
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:51,679
We must get clean water at once.

565
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,011
Or the people will stir up.

566
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,381
Give me three days.

567
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,784
If we don't hear Dong Dong, we'll go.

568
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:00,153
I'm out of your plan.

569
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,259
I go nowhere without Dong Dong.

570
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:27,978
Dong Dong...

571
00:45:36,261 --> 00:45:38,024
Are you Dong Dong?

572
00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:23,231
The prisoners are very hostile to us.

573
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:25,774
And no intention to
cooperate with the government.

574
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,335
Besides,
we don't have record of your friend.

575
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:31,182
Let me find her.

576
00:46:31,382 --> 00:46:32,144
Stop meddling.

577
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:33,784
The place is under the military.

578
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:37,443
Being agitated, your friend
will be endangered.

579
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:39,022
Also, Dong Dong may riot be here.

580
00:46:40,492 --> 00:46:48,558
Mom...

581
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:52,765
I won't give up.

582
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:53,904
Don't go.

583
00:46:57,842 --> 00:46:59,104
Stay calm.

584
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:04,613
Damn! I'm an asshole!

585
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,853
Dong Dong will be fine.

586
00:47:17,595 --> 00:47:20,564
I can't believe that the Colonel,

587
00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:22,165
hands in glove with Mr. Kim.

588
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,667
We have disappointed many people.

589
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:31,931
I'll call a meeting to dismiss Colonel.

590
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,508
It's too risky.

591
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:36,941
Most of the military force is his men.

592
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:39,412
You think he'll organize a coup d'etat?

593
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:48,620
This's the Congress House area.

594
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:50,351
All vehicles must stop for inspection.

595
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,656
Stop.

596
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,879
Colonel, we've occupied the lobby.

597
00:48:18,022 --> 00:48:19,683
Only some are defending.

598
00:48:20,124 --> 00:48:22,092
- Seize the place.
- Yes.

599
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:42,944
Cover me,
I'll safeguard the President to leave.

600
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,045
Good.

601
00:48:48,086 --> 00:48:49,144
Mr. President, we must evacuate.

602
00:48:49,254 --> 00:48:50,812
The Colonel has seized our building.

603
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,024
Inform all units,
the President's receding.

604
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:57,020
Calling all units,
Mr. President is receding.

605
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:15,777
Go.

606
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:30,790
Back off. Cover President.

607
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,158
- Call Doctor!
- Yes.

608
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:17,872
How's the President?

609
00:50:18,743 --> 00:50:21,906
The stake is handsome for this battle.

610
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,347
I think I'll modify our plan.

611
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:33,049
You distract them
with the President's double.

612
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:36,426
Until you find the headwater.

613
00:50:36,594 --> 00:50:37,561
Be careful.

614
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:38,787
Go.

615
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:07,519
Get him.

616
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:23,465
Get on.

617
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:33,750
Kau, get on!

618
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:44,187
Kau!

619
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:51,363
Kau.

620
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:19,587
- Send President away.
- Yes.

621
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:30,102
I need to keep it secret.

622
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:31,773
Sorry, everyone.

623
00:52:37,682 --> 00:52:39,547
I don't like you. Let me go.

624
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:41,549
I'm in a bad mood.

625
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,781
- I'll punch you.
- Let me go.

626
00:52:45,189 --> 00:52:45,951
What's up?

627
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:48,388
She hates me. Why I bring her along?

628
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:55,928
She...

629
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,967
Come here.

630
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:00,001
There're two points on the map.

631
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:02,365
You'll meet your guard at Point 1.

632
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,906
Point 2 shows where the water is.

633
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:06,734
Going with her?

634
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:08,809
Yes! Bring her.

635
00:53:08,913 --> 00:53:10,073
She's much safer with you.

636
00:53:10,214 --> 00:53:11,476
All people died during the course.

637
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,014
You want me to bring her along?

638
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:15,352
Take a look.

639
00:53:17,221 --> 00:53:18,279
Fish?

640
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:19,286
That's right.

641
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:20,424
Is there really having water?

642
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:23,322
They were found
at the last expedition team.

643
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,460
We still have hope.

644
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,789
You're more competent
for this mission than me.

645
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:30,193
They want me to stay.

646
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:34,066
I only care about finding Dong Dong.

647
00:53:34,305 --> 00:53:37,172
Dong Dong, can you face her?

648
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:40,307
Cindy, be good.

649
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:41,604
If you find the water,

650
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,146
Mom will be very happy.

651
00:53:45,383 --> 00:53:47,851
Ok! I'll go.

652
00:54:42,873 --> 00:54:45,239
Walk fast!

653
00:54:58,289 --> 00:54:59,449
Watch out.

654
00:55:02,994 --> 00:55:05,554
Shit! Are you the guard?

655
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,063
Exactly.

656
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,835
Damn! Kiddie, let's go.

657
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,268
Do you know the route?

658
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:15,737
Of course, I never fail.

659
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:19,107
Don't be obstinate!

660
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:20,938
You've a girl with you.

661
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:24,414
I won't be merciful,

662
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:26,014
even though you're San's friend.

663
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:28,085
I don't give a damn.

664
00:55:28,552 --> 00:55:30,713
I just do what I think.

665
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:33,354
To hell with your arrogance.

666
00:55:33,557 --> 00:55:34,717
If you're as mighty as you think.

667
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:36,450
Why you need me?

668
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:39,956
- I'm Tak.
- I'm Cindy.

669
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:41,965
- Cindy.
- Uncle Tak.

670
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,265
Nice to meet you.

671
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:48,533
We've things to do.

672
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:49,797
It's not a party.

673
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:52,075
You can't find the water without me.

674
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:55,576
Don't think I'll be nice to you.

675
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:57,607
Kiddie, let's go.

676
00:55:58,316 --> 00:55:59,476
Make no haste.

677
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:02,844
Let's wait here for a while.

678
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,578
- Why?
- It's hot!

679
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:08,223
You may go on your own way.

680
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:10,954
- Cindy.
- Kiddie. Come over to me.

681
00:56:12,963 --> 00:56:13,725
Cindy,

682
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:15,696
can you tell me why you're so beautiful?

683
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:17,026
Don't look at him.

684
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,636
I found some water.

685
00:56:58,642 --> 00:56:59,404
Drink.

686
00:56:59,543 --> 00:57:00,407
Thanks.

687
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:03,704
Let's go.

688
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:11,921
Stop.

689
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:36,236
The President?

690
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,041
I'll report to the Colonel.

691
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:46,320
Mr. President, please alight.

692
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:50,021
Don't move.

693
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:51,656
Gun's down.

694
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:56,633
Walk.

695
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,530
- Fill the tank.
- Yes.

696
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:26,120
Tak, what are we waiting for?

697
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,490
Some friends.

698
00:58:27,898 --> 00:58:30,458
Are they with us?

699
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:39,834
What?

700
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:41,740
You're telling people where we are.

701
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:43,976
Tak, see.

702
00:58:52,156 --> 00:58:53,123
Who are they?

703
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:55,485
Same as us looking for water.

704
00:58:57,595 --> 00:58:58,459
Let's go.

705
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:00,461
Why?

706
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:01,758
Wait!

707
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:14,938
Let's go, Cindy.

708
00:59:19,283 --> 00:59:20,443
Go.

709
00:59:20,851 --> 00:59:22,113
Ok.

710
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,419
You use their death to feign ours.

711
00:59:27,658 --> 00:59:28,716
What a scumbag!

712
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:30,756
They volunteer to protect us.

713
00:59:30,928 --> 00:59:33,294
So they think the expedition team's dead.

714
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:36,889
Be careful until we find the water.

715
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:43,833
- Cindy, let me help you.
- Thank you.

716
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:51,473
What're you waiting?
Want me to hold you?

717
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,287
Relax, Mr. President,
this is a secret cellar.

718
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:01,424
The Colonel should never know
we're hiding here.

719
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:05,424
President's double
had out the West already.

720
01:00:05,963 --> 01:00:07,123
Hope they can make it.

721
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:08,562
Chat has set off.

722
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:13,027
If she loses,
we'll never able to leave here.

723
01:00:17,174 --> 01:00:18,732
Radiation is high here.

724
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:20,101
Stay.

725
01:00:23,647 --> 01:00:24,909
Put them on.

726
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:34,419
Tak, what's up?

727
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,991
No gas. We have to walk.

728
01:00:37,227 --> 01:00:38,694
Tak, look!

729
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:44,598
Damn! Watch out the thorns.

730
01:00:45,235 --> 01:00:46,600
It's gamma rays.

731
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,135
Don't get pierced.

732
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:49,499
Watch out!

733
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:52,676
Keep off. It's fatal!

734
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,570
These traps mean something.

735
01:00:55,746 --> 01:00:57,714
It seems
we're getting close to the water.

736
01:00:57,848 --> 01:00:59,008
That's right.

737
01:00:59,383 --> 01:01:00,441
Watch out!

738
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:53,431
The President!

739
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:56,530
Get off!

740
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:18,721
I'm exhausted.

741
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,116
I don't want to die.

742
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,158
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

743
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:24,556
Stop using me as a bait, ok?

744
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:29,530
If not,
the President will be jeopardized.

745
01:03:41,845 --> 01:03:43,107
How brave!

746
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:45,241
Aren't you afraid?

747
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:57,017
Damn! It's a long time.

748
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:01,061
Smell it.

749
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,357
Yes! Fragrant!

750
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:07,198
You...

751
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:11,906
Look there.

752
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:22,519
The headwater is there.

753
01:04:22,653 --> 01:04:24,314
Is this the headwater?

754
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:26,889
The grass tells the water is unpolluted.

755
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:29,252
The headwater is underneath.

756
01:04:29,893 --> 01:04:31,258
Go ahead! Jump!

757
01:04:31,395 --> 01:04:32,453
You go first.

758
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:36,023
Why not you first?

759
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:37,395
I can't swim.

760
01:04:41,171 --> 01:04:43,435
You can't! Why are you here?

761
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,002
If I know I need to swim.

762
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,268
I'd have learnt when I was a baby.

763
01:04:54,885 --> 01:04:57,547
Cindy, you stay here.

764
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:00,785
Until I come back.

765
01:05:04,228 --> 01:05:07,129
Before I jump I must let you know,

766
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:08,322
you like me, I can tell.

767
01:05:08,465 --> 01:05:10,729
Say yes before I jump.

768
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:14,568
Not now.

769
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:17,231
You want to die?

770
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:18,499
Of course.

771
01:05:18,909 --> 01:05:19,967
Like this?

772
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:21,305
Why not?

773
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:23,512
Let me tell you.

774
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:26,342
Row like me in the water?

775
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,110
Hold your breath!

776
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:31,849
What are you doing?

777
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:33,047
You have to wait here.

778
01:05:33,223 --> 01:05:34,884
No, I'll go too.

779
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:39,424
Like mother, like daughter.

780
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:41,428
Grapple my hand when we jump.

781
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:42,696
Go.

782
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:39,315
The gate must lead to the water source.

783
01:06:39,456 --> 01:06:40,923
How's your foot?

784
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:43,292
Don't breathe deep.

785
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:46,723
The air is not enough.

786
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,597
Three of us need more.

787
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:49,757
Can we go on?

788
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,461
But you broke your leg.

789
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,598
It's too far to swim back.

790
01:06:55,672 --> 01:06:58,641
If we go on we may find an exit.

791
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:01,704
Bet or not?

792
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,577
I do.

793
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:06,413
Honestly, I love you.

794
01:07:07,184 --> 01:07:08,242
So do I.

795
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:10,644
Say it again.

796
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:12,146
You jerk!

797
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,720
Uncle Tak?

798
01:08:29,099 --> 01:08:30,760
He can't make it.

799
01:08:35,238 --> 01:08:36,796
Damn! Useless!

800
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:41,337
You almost made it.

801
01:08:44,548 --> 01:08:45,810
I want Uncle.

802
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:49,979
Uncle's dead.

803
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,883
We can't leave him here.

804
01:08:54,157 --> 01:08:58,617
Cindy, Uncle died for us.

805
01:08:58,929 --> 01:09:00,794
He wants us to find the water.

806
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:03,757
Now I only have you.

807
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:06,128
Let Uncle's will come true.

808
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:10,497
Be good!

809
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:45,890
Why did she show up again?

810
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,837
People want to be hero in time of chaos.

811
01:10:50,974 --> 01:10:52,441
She's just a woman.

812
01:10:52,676 --> 01:10:59,343
A woman? Masked like me?

813
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,019
Don't neglect
the strength of a faceless person.

814
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:10,720
Maybe we can make friends. Just kidding.

815
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:18,630
I didn't mean to kill him so soon.

816
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,934
But he made me mad.

817
01:11:23,373 --> 01:11:25,933
When will you give me her head?

818
01:11:26,142 --> 01:11:27,609
It won't take long.

819
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:31,240
What's in it?

820
01:11:38,421 --> 01:11:40,082
Maybe her head!

821
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:44,189
Maybe anyone's who betrays me!

822
01:11:47,564 --> 01:11:49,828
Maybe mine!

823
01:11:57,641 --> 01:12:00,109
Only if I kill the President,

824
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:04,144
and put your face on mine,

825
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:08,482
and explore more clean water.

826
01:12:09,252 --> 01:12:11,413
I'll be a Savior.

827
01:12:11,755 --> 01:12:14,019
Your face and my wisdom.

828
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:18,058
It's a perfect president!

829
01:12:53,797 --> 01:12:55,856
Tell me. Why do you kill Lau, the Chief?

830
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:58,125
He killed Chong Hon. He deserves it.

831
01:12:58,335 --> 01:13:00,098
Stop insulting him.

832
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:19,143
Wonder Woman!

833
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:26,887
How dare you assassinate an officer?

834
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:29,060
I do it for revenge.

835
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,860
Why did you kill him?

836
01:13:31,267 --> 01:13:34,327
For the country.
Everyone has to sacrifice.

837
01:14:20,784 --> 01:14:25,448
Great!

838
01:14:30,193 --> 01:14:34,061
"Modest sun and light breeze
send up sprouts."

839
01:14:34,197 --> 01:14:39,260
"Larks sing for Spring is coming."

840
01:14:40,804 --> 01:14:44,763
"The dreamer wakes up to find..."

841
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:50,108
"The butterfly has flown away."

842
01:14:53,383 --> 01:14:57,342
"Gleefully rowing a gondola
beneath the bridge,"

843
01:14:57,487 --> 01:15:03,357
"not knowing snow
has covered the bridge."

844
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,828
"Sing a folklore..."

845
01:15:08,031 --> 01:15:13,799
"When the lotus blossom unknowingly."

846
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:20,370
"The four seasons compose a saga,"

847
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:24,774
"with ups and downs."

848
01:15:25,081 --> 01:15:29,040
"They interchange like a windmill,"

849
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:33,020
"and make your heart tremble."

850
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:35,955
Cindy.

851
01:15:36,192 --> 01:15:38,660
Auntie Chat, I'm tired.

852
01:15:38,862 --> 01:15:39,920
Come on.

853
01:16:11,628 --> 01:16:13,892
Damn! A brick wall!

854
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,793
What does it mean?

855
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:19,828
Auntie Chat, what's it?

856
01:16:30,914 --> 01:16:32,176
Moss?

857
01:16:32,515 --> 01:16:35,484
There is hope. We made it.

858
01:16:48,665 --> 01:16:52,123
Damn! This wall killed many people.

859
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:01,572
Clean water.

860
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:09,343
Shit! Let's run, Cindy.

861
01:17:35,044 --> 01:17:36,306
It's Chat,

862
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,044
she found the water.

863
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,910
Mr. President.

864
01:17:43,953 --> 01:17:45,011
You may go now.

865
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:46,212
Thank you.

866
01:18:04,807 --> 01:18:06,274
I know you could make it.

867
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:07,774
Why did you kidnap the President?

868
01:18:11,214 --> 01:18:13,375
It must implicate
with my husband's death.

869
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:27,029
Chat will tell you later.

870
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:27,964
No way.

871
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,829
San,

872
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:31,398
give us the President.

873
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:33,762
He's mine.

874
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:06,793
Bitch!

875
01:20:20,343 --> 01:20:22,903
For the President's safety.

876
01:20:23,012 --> 01:20:24,377
Trust me if we're still friends.

877
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:31,918
Our Excellence!

878
01:20:32,121 --> 01:20:34,487
Mr. Kim, San is being tailed.

879
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:35,955
We'll soon find out
where the President is.

880
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,628
- Get lost.
- Yes.

881
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,996
Perfect timing.

882
01:20:55,611 --> 01:20:57,169
The bomb that hit me didn't ignite.

883
01:20:57,346 --> 01:20:58,813
Perhaps it's God's will.

884
01:20:58,981 --> 01:21:00,846
Let me wait till Chat returns.

885
01:21:12,328 --> 01:21:14,592
What's happening? How is your friend?

886
01:21:14,797 --> 01:21:16,059
I saw them.

887
01:21:16,232 --> 01:21:18,291
But people chased after us.

888
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:19,968
We hardly can talk.

889
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:40,849
Dong Dong, no!

890
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:47,026
Why don't you tell me you're hurt?

891
01:21:47,296 --> 01:21:49,662
I'm afraid you won't let me go.

892
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:51,834
Mr. President.

893
01:21:52,835 --> 01:21:54,393
He's President's double.

894
01:21:55,538 --> 01:21:58,006
The real President is safe.

895
01:21:58,207 --> 01:21:59,469
Why didn't you tell me?

896
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:00,633
I don't want too many people knowing.

897
01:22:00,776 --> 01:22:03,244
Chat is out for the water.

898
01:22:03,646 --> 01:22:04,704
Chat?

899
01:22:05,481 --> 01:22:06,948
Does she worth your protection?

900
01:22:07,717 --> 01:22:11,175
If it was me, you'd do the same thing.

901
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:14,480
Besides, she's with Cindy.

902
01:22:14,657 --> 01:22:17,023
San, what's really going on?

903
01:22:19,762 --> 01:22:21,525
Go to your mother.

904
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:40,544
Mom.

905
01:22:42,418 --> 01:22:43,783
Cindy.

906
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:46,719
Mom.

907
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,333
The death of Mr. Lau and Chong Hon,

908
01:22:58,834 --> 01:23:01,598
is plotted by the Colonel
and Clear Water Corp.

909
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:06,171
San tried to distract other attention.

910
01:23:06,876 --> 01:23:08,741
She used the double
to protect the President.

911
01:23:13,516 --> 01:23:16,280
She also gave me a chance to reciprocate.

912
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:20,151
I'm an idiot, I'm so sorry for it.

913
01:23:21,424 --> 01:23:23,289
But I found the clean water.

914
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:42,173
Is it still an oath?

915
01:23:58,127 --> 01:23:59,890
We're friends forever.

916
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:17,205
You're all here.

917
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,348
Faceless monster! Go to hell!

918
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:20,379
Jibber!

919
01:24:51,514 --> 01:24:52,674
Asshole!

920
01:25:23,813 --> 01:25:24,575
Run!

921
01:25:28,717 --> 01:25:30,480
Auntie San.

922
01:25:48,704 --> 01:25:50,069
Come over.

923
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,005
San.

924
01:26:31,413 --> 01:26:33,381
Stay away.

925
01:26:37,419 --> 01:26:38,977
No.

926
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:06,477
Ching.

927
01:28:02,471 --> 01:28:06,931
You jerk! So persistent!

928
01:28:12,715 --> 01:28:14,478
A special announcement.

929
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:17,243
The missing President wishes to tell.

930
01:28:17,519 --> 01:28:18,383
As the legitimate ruler of the nation.

931
01:28:18,587 --> 01:28:19,952
Listen! The President.

932
01:28:20,089 --> 01:28:23,991
I solemnly reveal the truth to you.

933
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:28,160
We're deceived by Mr. Kim,
the Clear Water Corp.

934
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:31,829
Our water hasn't polluted by radiation.

935
01:28:32,268 --> 01:28:36,034
It's Mr. Kim who contaminated the water.

936
01:28:36,739 --> 01:28:39,003
But, nightmare is over.

937
01:28:39,808 --> 01:28:42,868
Try to turn on your tap.

938
01:28:43,379 --> 01:28:47,338
You may have the clean water back.

939
01:29:19,848 --> 01:29:21,406
Long live the President!

940
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:24,143
Who's calling President?

941
01:29:24,753 --> 01:29:27,813
Who's calling me?

942
01:29:28,657 --> 01:29:32,320
My name? I'm the President.

943
01:29:37,733 --> 01:29:40,293
It's mine. Give it to me.

944
01:29:40,469 --> 01:29:41,834
You'll never be a president.

945
01:29:43,505 --> 01:29:44,972
You dream is over?

946
01:30:01,724 --> 01:30:02,986
Run.

947
01:30:30,219 --> 01:30:31,880
- Your Mom.
- Mom.

948
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:33,681
Cindy.

949
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,016
Mom.

950
01:30:36,692 --> 01:30:38,057
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

951
01:30:40,963 --> 01:30:42,225
Thank you.

952
01:30:42,498 --> 01:30:44,261
We didn't do it for you.

953
01:30:45,334 --> 01:30:46,995
We did it for friends.

954
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:49,130
Let's go.

955
01:30:54,243 --> 01:30:55,904
How is Auntie Chat?

956
01:30:57,813 --> 01:31:00,873
Some mistakes... have no remedy.

957
01:31:01,817 --> 01:31:03,478
But, it may depend on us.

958
01:31:03,619 --> 01:31:05,484
The sincerity of our friendship.

959
01:31:06,655 --> 01:31:07,917
So?

960
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:10,256
Except any daughter.

961
01:31:11,293 --> 01:31:13,158
I only have you.

962
01:31:14,696 --> 01:31:15,856
You're not coming?

963
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,160
We're leaving.

964
01:31:21,937 --> 01:31:25,703
You kiddie! Always giving me hard times?
