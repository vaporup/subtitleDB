00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:32,892
Ancient tombs found
in Yanbian, China

7
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:40,934
Estimated to date from Goguryeo
Era, perhaps 2,000 years ago

8
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:46,600
North and South Korea to form
a joint-excavation party

9
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,188
Hi!

10
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,390
It's been a while, man.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,897
Ah, the lovely scent of perfume!

12
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,604
Girls, here comes Chul-soo,
your prince!

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,705
- Let's go.
- Come on!

14
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,978
She looks hot.

15
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,177
'Blue Marine'?

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,789
How did you know?
Oh my!

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,194
You're the cutest guy
I've ever seen!

18
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,595
Where did you buy
that perfume?

19
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,004
I'd like to get it

20
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,902
for my girlfriend

21
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,202
She's your type.
Say hi.

22
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,377
Hi there.

23
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,582
She's way past her expiration date.

24
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,588
Hey cutie, where's your table?

25
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,486
Hey, good-looking!

26
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,289
Wow, Chul-soo, she's a fox!

27
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,496
She's mine, boys.

28
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,598
Come on.

29
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,905
How's it going?
What's this?

30
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,406
- What are you doing?!
- A piece of string!

31
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,409
So long.

32
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,803
Let's light it!

33
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,893
Let me set you on fire tonight.

34
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,604
They made it to the finals
through harsh competition.

35
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:49,807
Now the final round begins!

36
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,994
Let me read the question.

37
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:17,098
In 1975... our Great Leader,
Comrade Kim II Sung...

38
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,009
...visited an industrial site

39
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,910
and gave a speech.

40
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,179
What was his teaching
on that day?

41
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,291
A Great Leader of
the Korean peoples...

42
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,994
A forerunner that leads

43
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,901
the history of Asia...

44
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,805
A respected revolutionary...

45
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,208
The Sun of the race,

46
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,872
Lantern of Asia...
He got it wrong?

47
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,075
The order's mixed up.

48
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,187
- 'Lantern of Asia' comes first.
- That's right!

49
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
In the course of his life,
his only concern was...

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,691
...to make our lives better off.
He couldn't put more emphasis...

51
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,890
...on increasing the output
of cereals, and...

52
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:19,198
He's wrong again!
It's grains, not cereals.

53
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,909
You're joking, aren't you?

54
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,102
You're so funny.

55
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,803
I need to look for a job.

56
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,077
There's no way
I'm going to Yanbian.

57
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,587
Mr. Chul-soo Kim. Do you think you could
find a job in the real world?

58
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,484
What a mean thing to say!

59
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,183
You're too mean.

60
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,386
Hi. What's your name?

61
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,689
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

62
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,389
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

63
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,791
What do you want a job for?

64
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,197
What?

65
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,601
I'm not gonna be a bum
after I graduate.

66
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,901
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

67
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,378
You crack me up!

68
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,680
I know.

69
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,481
Forget about it.

70
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,783
Because you're not graduating!

71
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,793
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,590
A supreme commander
of the armed forces...

73
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,598
The almighty leader of
the Korean peoples...

74
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:27,604
General Kim Jong-il...

75
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,506
...has made our military invincible...

76
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,511
...on the road to completing

77
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,084
- the revolution.
- Not a single mistake!

78
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,278
The hardest part is over.
She's going to win!

79
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,683
The morale of our military
soars high to the sky...

80
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,884
...and our passion reaches
every corner of the world...

81
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:55,399
...like the violent waves
of the oceans!

82
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,482
- Mr. Chul-soo Kim.
- Yes?

83
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,587
This is your last chance.

84
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,890
- If you go to Yanbian...
- What?

85
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,891
...I'll let you graduate.

86
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,691
I'm not going!

87
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,993
You'll be the representative.

88
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,103
No way!

89
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,499
No? That's a shame.

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,007
I thought you might
be interested.

91
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,704
I've got to get going.
Bye.

92
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,573
Screw the tombs!

93
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:51,179
I'm busy enough trying
to dig up chicks in Seoul.

94
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,789
You'll be going with college girls

95
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,202
Our Great Leader,
Comrade Kim II Sung...

96
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,398
...designed this competition
for college students.

97
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:16,004
And the Kim II Sung Award goes to...

98
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,878
...an archeology major
at Kim II Sung University...

99
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:28,590
...Comrade Young-hee Oh!

100
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,181
You can't film here!

101
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,880
This is the National Intelligence Service!

102
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,788
No filming the NIS!

103
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,795
Dad!

104
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,988
Calm down.

105
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,191
You're totally mistaken.

106
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,595
Mistaken, my ass!

107
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:18,909
Dad... you really hit me...
in my stomach... hard...

108
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,309
I meant to!

109
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:26,578
I might as well disown you,
you pathetic Casanova!

110
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,084
Put it down.

111
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,679
Going to Yanbian for what?

112
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,189
To pick up girls?

113
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,192
Is that the latest hot spot for
hooking up or something?!

114
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,491
Dad!

115
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:49,697
Relax, okay?

116
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,004
Like I said, you totally got it wrong.

117
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,704
Save it!

118
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,180
I don't want to hear it.

119
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,079
I'm not lying!

120
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,686
Why did you take it off?

121
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,187
Because I'm hot!

122
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,188
If not for girls, what would

123
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,293
you go there for?

124
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,689
- Dad!
- Don't 'dad' me!

125
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,297
In this building,

126
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,096
I am an NIS director!

127
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,102
It's to graduate!

128
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,540
That's why I'm going!

129
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,565
To graduate?

130
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,109
That's right!

131
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,112
I'm shy of some credits
to graduate.

132
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,182
They'll give me credits
for going there.

133
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,081
I swear it's not about girls.

134
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,485
What are you doing?

135
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,287
Anybody there?

136
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,394
So, it's for credits?

137
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,498
Dad, let's have some tea.

138
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,311
Sure.

139
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,082
You must be really close.

140
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,590
I mean, hugging like that.

141
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,990
Huh?

142
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,699
You're a carbon copy of
your father.

143
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,599
So handsome!

144
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,779
He looks more like
his late mom.

145
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,614
Are you okay?

146
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,379
God, you've got coffee

147
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,487
all over your legs.

148
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,590
Miss Kim, get me
a glass of water.

149
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,284
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you...?

150
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,892
Sorry I lost it there.

151
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,298
And I'm about to!

152
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,798
To graduate?

153
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,803
If you're lying,
you're dead meat.

154
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,178
Hi, Professor. Lee.
This is Chul-soo's dad.

155
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,879
How are you?

156
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,087
Let me ask you something.

157
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,890
Does my son have to go

158
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,094
to Yanbian?

159
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,699
What happened to that
glass of water?

160
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,495
Thanks. Bye.

161
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,704
Start packing!

162
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,207
If you mess up again...

163
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,004
I will bury you next to that tomb!

164
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,288
I should've sent him
to the military academy.

165
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,495
Young-hee.

166
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,902
I'm so proud of you!

167
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,005
Suitors will be

168
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,100
lining up after you.

169
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,873
You must be tired. Go to bed.

170
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,776
- Goodnight, father.
- You, too.

171
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,586
Why'd you bring it up?

172
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:43,604
She's still too young
to get married!

173
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,504
Don't be like that.

174
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,614
It's for her sake.

175
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,184
Have you forgotten?

176
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,085
When you proposed to me...

177
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:02,385
...you said love was all
that counted.

178
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,986
Give her some space.

179
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,099
Pipe down!

180
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,803
I'll make sure she marries

181
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,401
only the best.

182
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,106
Just watch!

183
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,901
'Screams echo away
as waves in the ocean...'

184
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,702
'A beautiful youth,
beautiful memories...'

185
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,402
Gosh, I missed it again!

186
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,911
I can't breathe, singing this!

187
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,884
This is way harder than
memorizing speeches!

188
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,895
Isn't that Young-hee Oh?

189
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,797
Right!

190
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,895
An archeology major
at Kim II Sung University

191
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,607
Who's going?

192
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,814
- Why don't I...
- No way!

193
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,481
Don't you have some things
with you from Japan?

194
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,487
You give it a shot.

195
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,587
She won't fall for them.

196
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:47,392
Every girl is materialistic.
It's a piece of cake.

197
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,999
Let me go talk to her.

198
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,008
Aren't you Young-hee Oh?

199
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,478
You won the Knowledge

200
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,879
Competition, didn't you?

201
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,885
How'd you know?

202
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,280
I thought so.

203
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,785
I was in the competition, too.

204
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,696
I didn't do well, though.

205
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,392
I see.

206
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,408
Young-hee.

207
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,581
This is for you.

208
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,476
Wow, isn't this Coke?

209
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,486
This is so hard to get around here.

210
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,193
No thanks. I can't take it.

211
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,196
Please, I want you to!

212
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,192
And... Young-hee...

213
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,706
Can I see you tomorrow?

214
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,400
Why don't we...

215
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,374
You pathetic player!

216
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,780
You gotta study harder.

217
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,890
Wow!

218
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,492
Young-hee!

219
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,092
Sorry I'm late.

220
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,693
What's that boy doing
on the ground?

221
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,704
Beats me, Hae-young. He was there
when I got here.

222
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,486
Is that true?

223
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,088
Don't be too excited.

224
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,385
I'd never send you to Yanbian.

225
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,798
But it's a direct order
from our Great Leader.

226
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,095
I couldn't say no to him.

227
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:13,100
I'll do my best as the leader
of the excavation party.

228
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,186
Keep this in mind.

229
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,484
There'll be boys from the South.

230
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,994
So behave yourself.
Okay?

231
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,391
Don't worry.

232
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,592
I won't let you down.

233
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,200
- Father.
- What?

234
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,103
Thank you so much!

235
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,006
What are you doing?

236
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,702
Stop it!

237
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:59,081
Don't thank me.
Thank our Great Leader.

238
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,300
Eat well

239
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:52,103
and be a good girl.

240
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,881
Where the hell is he?

241
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,578
What the...

242
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,687
This is... Aren't you hot, Mr. Kim?

243
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,372
Welcome!
We've been expecting you.

244
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,982
Thanks.

245
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,005
Girls of Yanbian...

246
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,709
Here I am!

247
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,109
Others are coming tomorrow.

248
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:06,374
It's small, but you'll find it
to your liking.

249
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:11,287
If you need anything,
call me at the embassy.

250
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,389
Thank you.

251
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:25,494
This is so exciting!
Let's unpack.

252
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,778
Do you like you room?

253
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,486
Let's go.

254
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,187
I've once dug up a tomb twice

255
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,698
the size of a mountain.

256
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,598
No big deal, though.

257
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,103
That's a primary school.

258
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,400
3 years ago...

259
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:09,811
...we found one, 10 times
bigger than a pyramid.

260
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,781
You can count on me.

261
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,582
You got yourself an expert.

262
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:22,284
In Yanbian, Il-Pyong is known
as Mr. Tomb!

263
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,793
Who's that?

264
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,592
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

265
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,701
My name's Il-Pyong Kang.

266
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,701
Look,
Il- Pyong.

267
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,704
Don't mind the tombs.

268
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,003
Your job is to dig up
chicks for me. Okay?

269
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,307
What, aren't you a guide?!

270
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,971
I am.

271
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,477
You can go home now.

272
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,485
I'm off to do market research.

273
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,991
What a self-absorbed ass!

274
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,990
That way goes to the park,
not any markets.

275
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,086
The scenery is breathtaking,

276
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,200
you idiot!

277
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,479
Help me!

278
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,685
Help!

279
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,393
I can't swim!

280
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

281
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,497
I can't swim!

282
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:56,612
He's here.

283
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,182
Come on in!

284
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,784
What do you want?

285
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,284
You ditched me like I was...

286
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,981
What on earth are you
giggling about?

287
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,185
Find a girl for me.

288
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,387
A girl?

289
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,091
That's right!
That's an attitude, man.

290
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,895
What girl?

291
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,903
I ran into her today.
She's gorgeous.

292
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,000
Where?

293
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,899
At the park.

294
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,012
Talk about a needle in
a haystack...

295
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,909
What does she look like?

296
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,575
Long-nosed like me...

297
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,084
Her thick lips were so sensual.

298
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,986
About 170-cm-tall...

299
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,683
Kind of slim, but graceful.

300
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,691
For instance...

301
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,791
Like this lady!

302
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,897
Let me see.

303
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,905
You've got unique tastes
in women, Chul-soo.

304
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,010
You're into middle-aged

305
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:03,012
Just the style, man!
She's my mom!

306
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,276
She looks so generous.

307
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,785
As you know,

308
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,789
this kind of thing costs...

309
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,291
- Right!
- the more, the better.

310
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,091
- Yes.
- Some more.

311
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,799
Don't worry about it.

312
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,894
What's this?

313
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,406
Am I looking for a dog?
This is a joke.

314
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:37,778
Let me give you some more.

315
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,012
Here you go.
This is like 30 dollars.

316
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:47,581
What is this shit?
Excuse my language.

317
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,287
You go find her,
you ignorant cheapskate!

318
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,294
I thought that was a lot

319
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,093
for you guys here.

320
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,702
What the hell...

321
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,501
This is what I'm taking about!

322
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,506
Fork it over, nitwit.

323
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,007
Hang on.

324
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,204
You want South Korean money?

325
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,577
It costs a lot of money
to find a person.

326
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,081
Hold on!

327
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:18,281
Yanbian isn't the boondocks.
This is more like it, dolt.

328
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,983
Stop calling me names!

329
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,994
This is Yanbian, and

330
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,590
I'm much older than you.
I can call you whatever

331
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,603
I want to. Okay?
I'll find her for you.

332
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,401
Don't you worry a thing.

333
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,306
Where the hell is she?

334
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,875
Hey!

335
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,881
Where have you been all day?

336
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,884
Sorry, Hae-young.

337
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,280
Have you eaten?

338
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,284
You haven't eaten all day?

339
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,088
Grab your bowl there.

340
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,579
Slow down, girl.

341
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,681
Happy to be away from

342
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,879
that 'get married' garbage?

343
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:34,087
Even rice tastes better here.
It's sweeter than honey!

344
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,202
The North Koreans are running late.

345
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,604
They'll be here shortly.

346
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,704
Just my luck!

347
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,281
I can't believe the professor

348
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,883
is the prettiest woman here.

349
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,076
Yes? Got a question?

350
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,679
Of course not.

351
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:04,693
I'm so getting back at him!

352
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,990
Oh, they're here!

353
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,595
Who?

354
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,996
What?

355
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,800
He's so cute!

356
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,106
Cute? Please!

357
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,087
We should've sat in the back.

358
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,789
Why don't you guys say hi

359
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,590
to one another?

360
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,405
It's a stone tomb from

361
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,099
the Goguryeo Era.

362
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,800
Relatively small,

363
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,004
but its historical value...

364
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,082
...can't be overemphasized.

365
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,882
This project is very significant.

366
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,080
Why is he staring at us?
He must have a crush on me!

367
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,690
This tomb...

368
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,088
very important...

369
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,586
My heart's pounding so hard!

370
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,197
He's looking at the professor.

371
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,890
I'm telling you!

372
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,901
He's checking us out.

373
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,595
You've got to be watch him!

374
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,705
Many ancient Goguryeo tombs

375
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,502
have been found here.

376
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,407
In this circled area alone...

377
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,277
...more than 10 of them have
been unearthed over the years.

378
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,975
Don't be shy,

379
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,882
you cutie you.

380
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,682
A military post stood here
during the Japanese rule.

381
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,884
So, be cautious at all times.

382
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,994
Chul-soo Kim from South Korea?

383
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,791
Yes, ma'am!

384
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,900
I'm the party leader.

385
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,094
He's the leader of the South?

386
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,205
Good for you!

387
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,798
Young-hee Oh from North Korea?

388
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,410
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,370
Let's work hard together

390
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,779
to find the tomb.

391
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,887
It will be a step toward
reunifying the two Koreas.

392
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,785
Step forward, please.

393
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,788
Shake hands.

394
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,902
Your hand is so soft.

395
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,808
Please...

396
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,795
Young-hee!

397
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,299
That's your name, right?
I was wondering...

398
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,995
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

399
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:04,199
You came all the way here
to hit on girls?

400
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,607
You think you're hot stuff?

401
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,476
You totally got me wrong.

402
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,484
As leaders of both parties,

403
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,280
we've got things to discuss.

404
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,184
Zip it up!

405
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,687
Zip up what?

406
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,984
Hey. You.

407
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,094
Don't forget what you're here for.

408
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,593
Later!

409
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,898
Young-hee, let's go.

410
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,294
I know what I'm here for!

411
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,301
Lord almighty...

412
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,202
The wind feels so creepy,

413
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,503
doesn't it?

414
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,505
- Look, Chul-soo.
- What?

415
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:45,377
You know the girl
you asked me to find?

416
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,381
- Yes.
- I found her.

417
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,678
Where?

418
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,079
Look straight ahead.

419
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,084
- She's the one, isn't she?
- Right.

420
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,785
I thought so.

421
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,190
Check out that bomb

422
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,696
next to her.

423
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,994
Getting rid of her
won't be easy.

424
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,800
You can say that again.

425
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,201
Any ideas?

426
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,404
No matter how bad,

427
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,675
there's always a way out.

428
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,886
Let me tell you.

429
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,282
I was with the bomb squad...

430
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,391
...serving in the Chinese

431
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,690
People's Army...

432
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,995
...defusing bombs...

433
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,205
Oh, that!

434
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,308
You're a fast learner, Huh?

435
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,205
I'm smarter than you think.

436
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,874
Whatever.
You know what?

437
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,374
It might look easy to you.

438
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,388
But a bomb like her is very
hard to defuse.

439
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,186
Yes. But...

440
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,988
Give me a little more.
You won't be sorry.

441
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,690
Can I write this off?
Just kidding!

442
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,894
This is enough.

443
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,004
This'll help me...

444
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,698
disarm her.

445
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,503
I'm counting on you.

446
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:24,874
Chul-soo, trust me.
We're compatriots.

447
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,179
I'll blow her into pieces.

448
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,980
She's done for.

449
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,189
They've got everything

450
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,095
here in Yanbian.

451
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,692
So do we in the Republic!

452
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,101
- Young-hee.
- What?

453
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,905
Look!

454
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,970
Isn't that a dance club?

455
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,676
Let's go there tonight

456
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,482
and have some fun.

457
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,191
Comrade, are you nuts?

458
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,295
That's a symbol of
corrupt capitalism.

459
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,689
Stop calling me comrade!

460
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,891
It's so embarrassing.

461
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,904
Stop yelling at me.

462
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,005
This is China.

463
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,098
Whatever I call you,
they don't understand.

464
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,505
Please, go.

465
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,082
Think of it as studying,

466
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,776
experiencing new things.

467
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,287
Over my dead body!

468
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,584
Fine! Let's not!
Don't be upset.

469
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,495
Hae-young.

470
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,195
Do this for me. Please!

471
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,980
Putting on lipstick is
harder than studying.

472
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,282
Everything is hard at first.

473
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,189
I'll help you put it on in a minute.

474
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,992
Get over here and help me

475
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,999
fix my lips now!

476
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,300
I thought you didn't want to go?

477
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,310
Okay, I'll do it now.

478
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,778
Look.

479
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,991
What's the matter now?!

480
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,393
What if diplomats or other
students see us?

481
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,302
No diplomats here!

482
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,908
And the others won't rat on us...

483
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,909
...because that means
they were here, too.

484
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,476
Forget about them
and let's have fun.

485
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,173
Still...

486
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,784
Stop being a party pooper!

487
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,888
Keep your mouth shut

488
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,990
and follow me!

489
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,206
So many cute boys here!

490
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,872
You call that dancing?
They dance like zombies!

491
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,777
I'll get you girls a table.

492
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,698
Even the waiters are cute here!

493
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,801
Right here, girls.

494
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,495
Have a seat.

495
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,297
What can I get you?

496
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,401
Chinese beer. You?

497
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,513
- Beer from Pyongyang.
- I'll be right back.

498
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,680
- Look who's here!
- What are you doing here?

499
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,688
Mind if we sit?

500
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,586
You already have!

501
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,490
Who would've imagined
running into you here!

502
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,395
This club rocks!

503
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,292
Yes, sir?

504
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,803
A bottle of whiskey...
Some beer?

505
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,908
- 10 bottles!
- You heard the man.

506
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,506
Shake a leg, okay?

507
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,306
On the double.

508
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,477
Bite it hard!

509
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,074
Let's party like there's no tomorrow.

510
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,880
Wow, that was quick.

511
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,997
How'd he do that?

512
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,186
Awesome!

513
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,291
Are you guys ready?

514
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,689
You bet!

515
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,090
Here we go.

516
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,704
Grab your...

517
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,878
She must be a drinker.

518
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,992
That's good for us.

519
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,601
What's up with you?
Slow down.

520
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,099
What a finish!

521
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,796
Are you okay?

522
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,184
What are you doing?

523
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,185
It's called a 'Cannon Shot'
in the Republic.

524
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,089
Go ahead.

525
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,794
Me?

526
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,007
My stomach...
I need to hit the head.

527
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,609
What a wimp!

528
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,079
Where are you going?

529
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,079
Is she okay?

530
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,391
Never been at a disco with a man.

531
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,101
I have, but not with a pretty

532
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,196
girl like you.

533
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:36,006
Let's get to know each other better.

534
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,875
Stop peeking.

535
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,880
But they Look so good.

536
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,186
You scared me!
This is the Ladies' restroom.

537
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,880
I know.

538
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,788
It's kind of getting late,

539
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,385
and I'm bored.
Let's get out of here.

540
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,701
Don't mind them.
Keep dancing.

541
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,400
What are you talking about?

542
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,910
You jerk!

543
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,579
Ohh...

544
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,089
You jerk!

545
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,496
Not again!

546
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,192
I saw this coming.

547
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:42,203
Take good care of yourself.

548
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,008
Are you okay?

549
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,906
Thank God she didn't kill you!

550
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,717
But I see she beat the crap
out of you.

551
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,584
She's such a cutie.

552
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,381
You sure this will work?

553
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,184
Trust me on this, man.

554
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,783
Never seen any North Korean
say no to this.

555
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,590
Some want this for a dowry.

556
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,698
Come on.

557
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,392
- For a dowry?
- Sure!

558
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,396
We...

559
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,200
Let's make up.

560
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,211
After me!

561
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,978
Come on, take it.

562
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,581
Is this to make up?
Or to hook up with us?

563
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,680
If possible, for both.

564
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:38,090
What's this?
It smells great.

565
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,478
What do you take us for,
beggars?!

566
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:03,782
You boys are so senseless.

567
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,489
Didn't her mom teach her

568
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,784
not to play with food?

569
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,384
What a waste!

570
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,697
It's hopeless.

571
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:26,899
Chul-soo, don't give up.

572
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,084
I'll work things out.

573
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:40,679
So you're looking for a way
to hook them up?

574
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,088
That's right!

575
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,286
Any ideas how to get them

576
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,798
as close as we are?

577
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,496
I have an idea!

578
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,899
You do? What is it?

579
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,402
Give me your ear.

580
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,370
What an idea!

581
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:07,074
You're not only pretty,

582
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,276
but very smart.

583
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,081
Wish you hadn't blown

584
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,385
into my ear, though.

585
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,392
In fact, I'm smarter
than Young-hee

586
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,395
That's what I think, too.

587
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,898
Chul-soo has bad taste
in women.

588
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,595
You really think so?

589
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,899
Of course!

590
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,400
If I'm

591
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,406
lying to you...

592
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,511
...may I be struck by lightning

593
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,877
and my lips fried.

594
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,476
I'm so flattered.

595
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,177
Umm.

596
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,484
At the zoo across the street...

597
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:51,993
...there's this secluded spot.

598
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,089
Why don't we go over there...

599
00:48:55,232 --> 00:49:00,397
...and enjoy some privacy?

600
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,005
What do you say?

601
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:23,884
Comrades, gather up!

602
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:32,195
What's going on here?

603
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,102
Our Great Leader sent us

604
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,502
to excavate these tombs.

605
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,401
And this is how you repay him?

606
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,776
Shame on you!

607
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,077
We should find the tomb

608
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,085
before they do.

609
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:54,588
What's wrong with that bitch?

610
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,183
She has no idea
what's more important.

611
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,193
Stupid cow.

612
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,093
Unit 1 here, and Unit 2

613
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,598
takes the other side.

614
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,903
Unit 3 comes with me.
Got it?

615
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,597
Okay.

616
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,208
Back to work!

617
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,588
I got them for you.

618
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:32,193
Another magic trick?
Quite a few this time.

619
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,696
What? That's...

620
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,200
Just kidding.

621
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:42,795
I've never received flowers
from a man.

622
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,800
Very sweet of you,

623
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,308
but I can't go out with you.

624
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,276
What the...

625
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,682
A respected revolutionary...

626
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:55,785
- What's next?
- Asia!

627
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,978
Lantern of Asia,

628
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:02,387
The sun of the race...
And the protector of the universe...

629
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,686
The successor to our
Great Leader...

630
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:09,595
General Kim Jong-il once said...

631
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,191
'The healthy love of
young couples...'

632
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:17,295
'...brightens the future
of the Republic.'

633
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,704
Take these and give me a hug.

634
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:25,072
I'm not going out with you.

635
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,884
Come in with me then!

636
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,183
Go after her.

637
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,887
He's a nice guy.
I'd date him, if I were you.

638
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,690
Have you forgotten?

639
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,392
He's from South Korea.

640
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,696
It's impossible.
It's just dating,

641
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,604
not like marrying him.

642
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:56,405
And we're in China now.
I don't see why not.

643
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,479
Hae-young, are you out
of your mind?

644
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,084
We're not here to meet guys,

645
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,982
but excavate the tomb!

646
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,488
I can't wait to go back.

647
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:12,694
What are you yelling at me for?

648
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,697
Whatever!

649
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,800
I don't care.

650
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,401
Maybe I should give up.

651
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,708
Chul-soo, you know what?

652
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,874
What she wants most is

653
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,585
to find the tomb, right?

654
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,280
You should find it before her.

655
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,983
And use it as bait.

656
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,493
Tell her you wouldn't mind...

657
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,993
...letting her receive credit
for finding the tomb.

658
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,895
See what I'm getting at?

659
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,000
She would be so touched...

660
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:02,305
...that she'd lie down
with her legs wide open.

661
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,879
That's it!
That's a good idea!

662
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,778
You're a genius!

663
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,985
I'm so impressed!

664
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,189
Cut it out, man.

665
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,188
You know what?

666
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,694
When you see a doctor,
That's a good idea!

667
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,289
In this case, I was...

668
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:28,598
I got it.

669
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,196
I'm not that stupid.
I have it right here.

670
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,503
Show me the money.

671
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,509
Where is...

672
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,577
I don't have any.

673
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:44,676
No money?
You left it in the room?

674
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:55,196
I'm exhausted!
Let's take a break.

675
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,096
Comrades, take a break!

676
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,693
Stop playing with that flashlight.

677
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,803
- What's wrong?
- What?

678
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,899
- Have you gone insane?
- This just isn't you!

679
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:13,082
Staying at a luxurious hotel
has messed up your head.

680
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:13,978
Hey!

681
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:17,280
We have to find the tomb

682
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,480
before they do!
Got that?!

683
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:24,287
Okay, good luck to you.

684
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,985
Keep digging.

685
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,097
He's gone crazy, girls.

686
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,698
Leave him alone.

687
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,701
Hey, where are you going?
It's not there!

688
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,398
Why don't you eat?

689
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,474
What's wrong with her?

690
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,980
Eat with us, my friend.

691
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,278
Who says I'm your friend?
Out of my way!

692
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,683
We're eating here, man!

693
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:55,484
No work, no food!

694
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,198
Look at this dust!

695
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,498
Hae-young!

696
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,906
Get over here.

697
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,775
Why can't a girl eat in peace?

698
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,280
Don't eat mine.
Sure.

699
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,178
Out of my way!

700
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:33,189
Leave him be.
He's gone crazy.

701
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,491
Jesus, it's gotten all dusty.

702
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,295
- Min-chul!
- What?

703
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,405
I found the tomb!

704
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,597
Really?

705
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,800
He found it!

706
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,484
Hae-young!

707
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,282
I think you dug too much.

708
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,788
You should've eaten
instead of digging this far.

709
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,795
Back up!

710
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,889
Stop pushing me!

711
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,500
It feels like we're in

712
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,673
'Indiana Jones.'

713
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:29,274
I'm not quite sure if this is it.

714
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,579
What do you think?

715
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,383
Give it here.

716
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,692
Is this the tomb?

717
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,495
- I Don't think so.
- Shit!

718
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,693
Nothing but a mural painting.

719
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:51,000
I know. It's a couple
getting married.

720
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,105
Maybe it's a sign that
I should get married, too.

721
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,577
Really?

722
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,979
Should I set you up with a girl?

723
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,981
I'd appreciate it, man.

724
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,779
Hey, get over here.

725
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,980
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. Come on.

726
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,791
You'll make a great couple.

727
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,996
- Damn!
- What the hell?!

728
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:22,900
- Chul-soo.
- God, you scared me!

729
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,097
Don't be.

730
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,708
Keep your voice down.

731
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,176
What am I doing here

732
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,373
in the dead of night?

733
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,383
Don't chicken out now.

734
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,283
It was your idea.

735
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,289
Stupid! You got me wrong.

736
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,928
I meant do it during the day.

737
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,831
Look at all these bugs!

738
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,696
You should've told me so.

739
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,700
Stop making faces at me!

740
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,901
Why didn't you tell me

741
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,405
to wear long sleeves?

742
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,704
Stop complaining. You just
loaf instead of working anyway.

743
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,178
I dug all day long!

744
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,578
Isn't that Chul-soo
and Il-Pyong?

745
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,680
Yes.

746
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,589
Who's that crazy woman, running
so fast over there?

747
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,594
That's Young-hee!

748
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,788
What!

749
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,394
One of them is going to die tonight.

750
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:28,401
What are they doing?

751
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,005
No!

752
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,106
Dibs!

753
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,602
I called it first!

754
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,711
I got here before you.

755
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,372
What are you talking about?

756
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,483
I called it first!

757
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,983
You said nothing but 'Dibs'!

758
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,586
Don't you know what it means?

759
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,288
This is mine!

760
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,686
What the hell!

761
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,193
You see any 'dibs' here?

762
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,990
Make some sense!

763
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,292
You don't know
what you're talking about!

764
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:01,096
I won it fair and square!

765
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,705
You shameless piece of trash!

766
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,703
What'd you just say?

767
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,275
Oh. Mom...

768
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,383
God... my balls...

769
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:24,389
I'm really worried.
What if they kill each other?

770
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,188
Hae-young, my sweetie,

771
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:29,489
don't worry.

772
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,294
What do you mean?

773
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:35,996
They're alone inside.
Isn't it obvious

774
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:39,404
what they'll be doing?

775
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,409
Why don't we...?

776
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,170
You're embarrassing me.

777
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:50,483
Let's get out of here, and...

778
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,988
...see if we're a good match.

779
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:19,879
Young-hee!

780
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,574
Young-hee, don't move.

781
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,082
Look out!

782
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,790
What happened?

783
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:39,391
I think it's collapsed!

784
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:54,171
Get off of me right now.

785
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,979
I know what I'm doing.
Keep your head down!

786
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,182
My knees...

787
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,193
and my head
are pounding like hell.

788
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,993
We're trapped in here.

789
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,394
What?

790
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:15,698
No! No!
Anybody out there?!

791
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,502
Help me!
Get me out of here!

792
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,608
Help!

793
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:26,772
Stop making a fuss.
Let's think of a way to get out.

794
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,875
I'm making a fuss?
Get your butt over here!

795
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,888
It's like I've dug a tomb
for myself.

796
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,492
You call that a fuss?
What the hell!

797
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:40,494
You do the thinking, bitch.

798
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,098
Get me out now!
Shut the fuck up!

799
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,093
You're using the 'F' word now?

800
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,795
I'm trapped in here
because of you!

801
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,805
Are you saying it's my fault?

802
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,499
You bet your ass it is!

803
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,406
What does my ass have to do
with anything?

804
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,070
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you!

805
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,183
Just looking to get your
tiny dick wet?

806
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:07,979
What?! I've got a small dick?

807
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,388
What do you know?

808
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,687
I'm sure no girl wants you

809
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,694
because it's so freaking small!

810
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,096
You're unbelievable.

811
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,998
I've been trying so hard
to win your heart...

812
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,399
...and this is what I get?

813
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,098
My package is big enough!

814
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,004
Stop yelling at me.

815
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,906
And don't lie...

816
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,481
I've never seen you
with any packages!

817
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:36,278
That's not what I mean!

818
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,081
You sure you speak Korean?

819
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,884
You don't understand jack!
I speak Korean, just fine!

820
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,391
All you do around here is

821
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,587
chase after skirts!

822
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:52,190
Surprise!

823
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:55,099
You just drove a spike
deep into my heart, bitch!

824
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:58,503
Don't point at me!
I'm not a frigging carpenter.

825
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,201
And don't call me names!

826
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,575
Now you use violence?

827
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,683
Got a problem with that?

828
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,480
You do the same then!

829
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,681
Enough of this chitchat,
go make a tunnel.

830
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,089
On my mark... 1, 2, 3!

831
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,888
I'm not a mole!

832
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,997
Doesn't it run in your genes?

833
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,599
I know you North Koreans

834
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,601
are good at making tunnels.

835
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,999
You made a lot of them
under the DMZ...

836
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,197
...to infiltrate into the South, right?

837
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,003
At least three of them!

838
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,304
You know what?

839
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,470
When I was in primary school...

840
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,479
...we'd go see them

841
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,176
on school field trips.

842
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,777
What?!

843
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,585
Our Republic made tunnels
to invade the South?

844
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:50,384
Right!

845
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,290
You're saying our Republic

846
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:57,991
did such a dirty trick?
You're a damned liar!

847
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,795
Come on!

848
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,699
Let's get it on!

849
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,399
What are you doing?

850
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,906
Timeout!

851
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:11,070
It's been a while

852
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,779
since I took on a chick.

853
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,179
I got you!

854
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,083
Stop it!

855
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:26,389
What's this, a game?

856
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:32,935
You stupid liar!

857
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,699
You stupid liar!

858
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,678
Dickhead!

859
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:49,376
You beat the shit out of me.

860
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,782
I'm the one
who should be crying.

861
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,889
Is that true our Republic

862
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,488
made those tunnels?

863
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,695
I know YOU didn't, okay?

864
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,000
So sensitive.

865
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,798
As a matter of fact...

866
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:16,310
...we made many tunnels, too...

867
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,170
...for the subway.

868
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,875
I'm sure North Korea did it
for the same purpose.

869
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:25,986
It'd be great if we had subways
running through the DMZ.

870
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,783
Don't you think?

871
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,389
So I could come to see you

872
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,591
anytime I wanted.

873
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,396
Yeah, that'll be the day.

874
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,005
Laughing now?
Don't you know the old saying?

875
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,906
'Laughing when crying
makes the asshole hairy.'

876
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,270
Where are they?

877
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,073
Where are my shoes?

878
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,584
They must've been buried.

879
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,882
I'll go find them.

880
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,876
Nothing.

881
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:28,379
Stay here. Let me look
for them again.

882
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,180
It's okay.

883
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,184
I knew you'd say so.

884
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,983
I'll find them later...

885
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,093
...like that prince did

886
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:41,890
for Cinderella.

887
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,290
Cinderella?

888
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,692
Who's that?

889
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,996
What?

890
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,003
You don't know?

891
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:58,674
'Cinderella, Cinderella,

892
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,782
all I hear is Cinderalla...'

893
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,484
No?

894
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,786
Let me tell you the story.

895
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,489
Once upon a time, there was

896
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,682
a pretty girl named Cinderella.

897
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:13,283
She had two stepsisters

898
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,693
who were like...

899
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:16,991
...so ugly and mean.

900
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,296
One day, there was a party

901
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,903
at the kingdom's palace.

902
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,199
A fairy changed a pumpkin

903
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,104
into a carriage...

904
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,507
...and gave Cinderella a gown
and glass slippers, for free.

905
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,670
Her and the prince danced
like crazy...

906
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,476
...until the clock struck midnight.

907
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:38,178
She ran home so fast, she

908
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,084
lost her glass slipper.

909
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:44,488
The prince found it, and
visited every home in the realm.

910
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,687
Didn't he come by your house, too?

911
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,492
They were reunited and

912
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,999
lived happily ever after.

913
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,104
Look out!

914
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,677
They should be okay, right?

915
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:11,174
It's quite spacious in there,
enough oxygen to breathe.

916
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,880
Let's be hopeful.

917
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,581
Young-hee, are you okay?
What a cutie!

918
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,801
What's this?

919
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,005
Let's see... we're done

920
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,668
with the Cinderella story...

921
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,975
Should I tell you about
animation characters?

922
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,282
Astro Boy or Golden Bat...

923
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,183
What about a superhero...

924
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,882
No, you don't want to hear it.

925
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,585
It's okay.
Save your strength.

926
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,791
Why isn't the rescue party

927
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:58,593
here yet?

928
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,906
I hope

929
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,710
they don't find us.

930
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,080
Just a thought.

931
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:16,378
What are you talking about?

932
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,980
I'm just saying that...

933
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:27,696
...the later they find us...

934
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:33,097
...the longer we can be

935
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,308
alone together.

936
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:16,002
Check this out!

937
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,371
What's going on here?

938
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,083
Trying to see whose lips
are thicker?

939
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:26,079
You could've taken your time.

940
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,487
Should we have waited
for a few days?

941
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,183
We should have!

942
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,890
Let's get out of here.

943
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,192
Easy.

944
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,169
- Here.
- What a night!

945
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:52,774
God, I'm tired.

946
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,786
Come on.
Get in.

947
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,685
Take care of yourself.

948
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,286
I hope they're okay.

949
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,690
Goodnight.

950
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:14,996
What?!

951
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:15,804
I saw this coming!

952
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,102
I saw this coming!

953
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:24,479
I can't let my girl ruin her life

954
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,683
over some South Korean asshole.

955
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,081
Send her back right now!

956
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,783
No, wait.

957
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:40,887
I'll send my men out there.
Keep an eye on her.

958
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,400
What does your dad do?

959
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,670
He's a powerful man.

960
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,976
Yeah? So you're strong
after your dad, huh?

961
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:04,085
Does he work in the mining
or something?

962
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,382
Ever hear of the Ministry of
the Peoples' Armed Forces?

963
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,582
Yeah!

964
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,888
He's the Secretary.

965
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,293
How about your father?
What does he do?

966
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:26,000
Huh? He's a director of National...
uh... Gardens...

967
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,200
What's that?

968
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,677
Sorry. I'll look it up.

969
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,980
So...

970
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,383
He just...

971
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:45,690
He takes care of gardens.

972
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,588
You know, gardens.

973
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:52,497
For instance...
Like National Parks!

974
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,296
But a lot smaller in size.

975
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,997
That's what he does.

976
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,307
Oh, I see.

977
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,973
He looks after beautiful
flowers and trees.

978
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,175
What a nice job he has!

979
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,378
Not really.

980
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:17,385
Not only are you pretty,
but so naive!

981
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,285
Let's go.

982
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:37,876
Sorry!

983
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:42,882
I lost it right there. Stop it.
There are people watching us.

984
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,979
I know you liked it.

985
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:52,586
Where do people go
on dates in North Korea?

986
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,593
To a cafe like this?

987
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,699
We're too busy studying
to date.

988
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:02,099
We don't fool around
like you do in South Korea.

989
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,398
Did you have a boyfriend?

990
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,607
Boyfriend? That's...

991
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,971
Boyfriend?

992
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,880
You mean a stud that I do
the mattress mambo with?

993
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,577
So many guys have wanted to

994
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:21,587
lead the Ilama to my lift shaft...

995
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,588
but no one's 'buried the burrito' with me, yet.

996
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,995
My cherry hasn't been popped.

997
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,495
Wanna slip me the sausage?

998
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,902
You!

999
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,005
Who taught you those
expressions?

1000
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:42,906
How about my expressions?

1001
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,981
One of the girls from the South.
I bought her coke in return.

1002
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,577
Oh God!

1003
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,078
Listen to me very carefully.

1004
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,684
Listen.

1005
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,183
Even in the South, no decent

1006
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,091
girls say those things.

1007
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,789
Who was it?
Give me the name!

1008
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,991
Watch what you're saying!

1009
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,202
I didn't know!

1010
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,306
I just wanted to impress you.

1011
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:19,573
Sorry. I lost my cool.

1012
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,679
You've put your father

1013
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:27,186
in a awkward situation.

1014
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:32,091
It's none of your business.

1015
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,776
Young-hee!

1016
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,478
What's wrong?

1017
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:04,286
I'll be okay. It's just a cramp.

1018
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,687
Wanna watch me change my pad
or something?

1019
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,900
You were faking it?!

1020
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:37,481
Does it take this long
to change pads?

1021
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,195
Il-Pyong, help me.

1022
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,600
What are you doing?

1023
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,402
Run like hell!

1024
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,376
Go! Damn!

1025
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:05,876
Is your house that way?

1026
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:16,187
Wish I could come with you.

1027
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,891
I wanted to show you.

1028
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,389
Chul-soo,

1029
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,294
you found it!

1030
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,794
Let's go inside.

1031
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:37,370
It's a great mural painting
from Goguryeo.

1032
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:44,084
Not that I know much about art.
Just a little bit.

1033
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,388
- Chul-soo.
- What?

1034
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:51,982
The couple in the painting
are not from Goguryeo.

1035
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,889
This painting is

1036
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:59,797
A Baekje girl and a Shilla man
getting married.

1037
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:04,201
Why'd they have a wedding

1038
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:08,105
in Goguryeo then?

1039
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:13,481
I think they fled to Goguryeo.

1040
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,877
Fled?

1041
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:19,077
Back then, Baekje and
Shilla were at war.

1042
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:24,288
Yeah, that's right.

1043
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:29,291
They must've loved each other so much.

1044
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:36,493
Enough to flee to Goguryeo...

1045
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:41,200
...to stay together?

1046
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:50,883
When I was in middle school...

1047
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,183
...my mom died of cancer.

1048
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,885
And...

1049
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,397
If she were alive...

1050
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,405
...she would like you a lot.

1051
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,675
You know what?

1052
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,590
Let's run.

1053
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,990
Like that couple

1054
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:37,189
in the mural painting...

1055
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,302
What do you say?

1056
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,402
You don't love me enough?

1057
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,296
Young-hee...

1058
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,803
I love you.

1059
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:15,387
'Dear Chul-soo, as you know
I'm from North Korea...

1060
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,390
...and there are still a lot of things
left to be done for my country

1061
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,086
I know you are a good fellow

1062
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,789
And I liked you from the beginning

1063
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:28,091
but I don't think that
we're meant to be together

1064
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,101
I'm sorry and

1065
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,999
I wish you the best.

1066
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,175
From Younghee'
Have you ever had Coke?

1067
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:44,775
Why would I drink the black
water that Yankees drink?

1068
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,183
Makes sense.

1069
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,488
Are you expecting anyone?

1070
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:56,897
What do you want?

1071
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,795
I'd like to see Young-hee.

1072
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:03,197
Young-hee, it's him.
Go see him.

1073
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,999
She's out now.

1074
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,109
I'll wait for her then.

1075
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:09,608
Hey!

1076
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:11,879
You!

1077
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:14,379
This isn't the right thing to do!

1078
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,780
You piece of crap!

1079
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:20,181
Didn't you hear him?

1080
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:23,779
This is a diplomatic residency.
You're asking for trouble!

1081
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,187
I'd like to see her

1082
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,186
one more time.

1083
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,589
Stop!

1084
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,601
Worm!

1085
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,397
What are you, deaf?

1086
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:39,198
Leave before I blow
your head off.

1087
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:40,599
I'm not armed.

1088
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,575
Get the hell out!

1089
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:46,771
I'm not going anywhere!

1090
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,473
Or... you're dead.

1091
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,291
- Young-hee!
- Dog!

1092
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,390
Young-hee!

1093
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:08,797
Young-hee, do you love

1094
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,304
this South Korean man?

1095
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,774
This dog!

1096
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:27,085
Do you love him?!

1097
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:37,191
Are you in love with
this piece of trash?!

1098
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,204
Just amoment!

1099
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,705
- Asshole!
- Young-hee!

1100
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:50,770
Young-hee!

1101
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:54,081
Young-hee!

1102
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:04,489
You stupid prick!
Stop right there!

1103
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:10,394
Take one more step,
this dog is dead!

1104
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:15,494
I don't love him.

1105
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,305
I never did.

1106
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,700
Young-hee...
Please

1107
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,674
Young-hee!

1108
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,884
Young-hee!

1109
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:34,381
Wait... wait!

1110
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,968
Sons of bitches!

1111
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,774
How could they do this?

1112
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:39,786
Are you okay?

1113
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,580
Does it hurt a lot?

1114
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,384
Let me tell you.
You should start working out.

1115
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:52,192
I know some great gyms
in the area.

1116
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,898
Aren't you hungry?

1117
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:57,004
You need to eat well if you

1118
01:27:57,138 --> 01:28:00,904
want to get back at them.

1119
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,977
Let me

1120
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,875
go grab some stuff

1121
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,881
to eat for you.

1122
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,586
Jesus!

1123
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,188
What are you doing here?

1124
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:23,287
Chul-soo!

1125
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:34,797
I'll go buy some food.

1126
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:42,174
What took you so long?

1127
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:48,983
It took time for the pumpkin
to change into a carriage.

1128
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,970
Young-hee...

1129
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,880
You can go now.

1130
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,680
Gosh, look at you!
They messed up your face.

1131
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,382
Young-hee, I'll be okay.

1132
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,288
I don't want you to get

1133
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:29,089
in trouble for this.

1134
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,494
Go now.

1135
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,994
Chul-soo!

1136
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:37,104
They're in the lobby!

1137
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,597
Who?

1138
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:40,605
Those goon from North Korea!

1139
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:43,370
Get out of here now!

1140
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:46,275
They'll kill you!

1141
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,380
Get out of here!

1142
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,782
Get out of here now!

1143
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:56,488
Young-hee, leave now.

1144
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,588
Go!

1145
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,894
Why can't you ask me
to come with you?

1146
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,502
Don't you love me?

1147
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:13,505
I can't pass a moment
without thinking of you.

1148
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:16,872
And you don't have guts
to take me away?!

1149
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,382
Chul-soo Kim!

1150
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,688
Stop right there!

1151
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:29,400
Back up!

1152
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,671
Stay away from us!

1153
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:45,291
Wait...

1154
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:48,088
Wait...

1155
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,895
Wait!

1156
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,839
Let's get started.

1157
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:11,279
Name?

1158
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:20,485
Your name!

1159
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,993
Watch your attitude!

1160
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,998
I'm chul-soo, Kim.

1161
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,493
Sir!

1162
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:14,975
Is it true that you're
stepping down?

1163
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:21,184
I apologize to my fellow Koreans

1164
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:23,688
for the actions of my son.

1165
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,292
As of today, I'm resigning
from the position of...

1166
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:30,292
...director of the National
Intelligence Service.

1167
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,905
Mr. Chul-soo Kim?

1168
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,700
Going back to Yanbian?

1169
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,472
You know you won't be
able to see her.

1170
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:48,775
Not enough space to stamp.

1171
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:51,280
This is my last trip.

1172
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,890
It's been over a year.

1173
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:11,203
Nothing you can do about it.
Forget about him.

1174
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:16,296
So lovely!

1175
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:20,491
Never seen a cuter girl than her.

1176
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:28,904
You.

1177
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:31,168
Jealous? Then get married!

1178
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:33,678
Stop drooling over my girl.

1179
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:34,872
I'm not.

1180
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:40,078
That's sexual harassment!
I can have your ass arrested for it.

1181
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:42,985
We're landing...

1182
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:47,082
in Pyongyang

1183
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:51,392
in 10 minutes.

1184
01:37:51,632 --> 01:37:56,194
Please, let us...

1185
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:59,306
Thanks for flying KAL.

1186
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,301
Have a good day.

1187
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,389
What I have to show you
today are...

1188
01:38:52,526 --> 01:38:55,689
...ancient remains found
at a construction site...

1189
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:58,798
...in Shinheung, North Korea.

1190
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,800
They're believed to be
from the Goguryeo Era...

1191
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:04,996
...giving us an insight
to the Iron Age.

1192
01:39:05,339 --> 01:39:07,204
What is most noticeable
is that...

1193
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,901
...Shilla and Baekje remains

1194
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:12,570
were also discovered...

1195
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:14,874
...which is very intriguing.

1196
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,479
This mural painting was found

1197
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,785
5 years ago in Yanbian...

1198
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:29,384
...by a joint excavation between
South and North Korea.

1199
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,891
If you look at it closely...

1200
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:35,195
...it's a Baekje and Shilla couple

1201
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:37,702
getting married in Goguryeo.

1202
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:48,570
Recently discovered remains

1203
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,274
show us that...

1204
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:52,885
...as this mural painting does...

1205
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,181
...many Baekje and Shilla
couples fled to Goguryeo.

1206
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:57,984
In other words...

1207
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:01,686
...they deserted their homelands...

1208
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:04,093
...for love.

1209
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:11,400
Let me say that the power of love transcends...
...time and space.

1210
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,708
I bring this up, because...

1211
01:40:20,814 --> 01:40:25,183
...because I love a girl
who lives here.

1212
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,278
I once thought about...

1213
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:33,792
...fleeing to another country for love.

1214
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,493
Great Leader,

1215
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,496
do you remember me?

1216
01:40:39,633 --> 01:40:42,898
I was arrested for an incident

1217
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,902
5 years ago in Yanbian.

1218
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,304
I'm Chul-soo Kim, the son

1219
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,171
of a former NIS director.

1220
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:56,772
5 years ago... I fell in love with...

1221
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:59,283
...a girl from Pyongyang.

1222
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,779
We loved each other enough

1223
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:06,188
to give up everything.

1224
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:10,788
But we didn't run as that
couple in the painting did...

1225
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:16,292
...for I loved everything that

1226
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:19,895
she loved.

1227
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,600
So did she!

1228
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:25,575
Nothing can separate us!

1229
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:27,873
Today...

1230
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:30,681
...I'd like to ask a question...

1231
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:35,086
...to the love of my life.

1232
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:24,798
What took you so long?

1233
01:42:25,038 --> 01:42:30,169
It took time for the carriage
to change back into a pumpkin.

1234
01:42:31,912 --> 01:42:38,784
Don't ride anything that changes
from now on.

1235
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:48,194
Great Leader!

1236
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:53,095
Allow us to get married.

1237
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:58,096
Please, let us stay together forever.

1238
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:24,591
Thanks for watching.

1239
01:44:24,725 --> 01:44:27,592
I appreciate all the staff

1240
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,992
who worked so hard!

1241
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,688
Thank you!
