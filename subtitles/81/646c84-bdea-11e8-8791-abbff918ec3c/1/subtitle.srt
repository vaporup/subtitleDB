1
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,111
The city is shocked
by the missing babies.

2
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:32,621
Within 3 months,
18 babies had been stolen.

3
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,819
No findings
have been reported by the police.

4
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,029
But I'm most professional.

5
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,290
There we are! Stop!

6
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,961
I'm coming!

7
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,831
Something wrong!

8
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:51,739
Damn! Forget it.

9
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:53,810
Be careful.

10
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,812
Let's go to the wonderland.

11
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,709
Please.

12
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:01,976
This way please.

13
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,320
It's a handsome and quiet house.

14
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,555
There is no people nearby.

15
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,528
Only 5 minutes' ride to market.

16
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:16,125
So many merits?

17
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,598
Of course, there's some defects.

18
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:20,203
But not that bad. Follow me.

19
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,070
It's perfect except that...

20
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:25,437
there's not been much renovation!

21
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,608
You call that renovation?

22
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,740
But the structure is ok.

23
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,680
It's just a little fire.

24
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,246
Darling.

25
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,186
Let me show you something.

26
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,994
Nature!

27
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,536
You move in and will love it more.

28
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,933
What do you think?

29
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,876
Damn!
I did ask to have it renovated first.

30
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,140
Wasting my time!

31
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,678
I'm lucky!

32
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,479
Jesus, even a jerk won't buy this!

33
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,554
Let's go...

34
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,658
Stay!

35
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,428
Darling. Buy this house. I like it.

36
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:19,563
It has character.

37
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:22,564
Character? Really?

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,860
You know what kind of house I like.

39
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,092
I know.

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,532
- So, pay a deposit first.
- Quiet.

41
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,488
Stealing my car? You go ahead.

42
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:53,721
Ok... we go ahead.

43
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:55,825
Incredible!

44
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,831
Of course, my hubby is a cop!

45
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,435
- Keep going!
- I do.

46
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:07,700
18 babies
have been missing these 2 months.

47
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,742
It looks like the work of one person.

48
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,584
So far, no missing baby's family,

49
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,376
they have received any blackmail letter.

50
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:19,681
Nor has any group claimed responsibility.

51
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,720
Commander, this is bizarre.

52
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:24,460
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

53
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,062
Though she helped us before,

54
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,267
we still don't know who she is.

55
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:32,798
We can't reach her after all!

56
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,338
All missing babies are boys.

57
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:38,969
This shows it's not blackmail.

58
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,273
Maybe it has to do with evil religions.

59
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,696
Is anyone rushing out?

60
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:05,802
No.

61
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,396
Commander.

62
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,845
"Your son will be next."

63
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,560
Babies' ward is upstairs.
Operation Room over there.

64
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,597
I'm worried about our son.

65
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,604
Let's take him home now?

66
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:44,936
Lau!

67
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,770
If we bring away this new born baby now.

68
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,037
The doctor wouldn't
be responsible after discharge.

69
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,543
- Lau...
- Alright! Leave him here.

70
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,312
Why not call Wonder Woman for help?

71
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,980
Sorry we got no way to contact her.

72
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:57,247
I've sent more men here.

73
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,854
Things can go wrong anywhere.

74
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,617
- Please take care of my wife!
- Yes, Commander.

75
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,354
Come,
there was a traffic accident just now.

76
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:07,964
Warden said those beds might be needed.

77
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:09,292
He asked us to think about it.

78
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,161
You go out first.

79
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:18,631
Lau, it's my son they're after.

80
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,275
What about... Swopping?

81
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,648
Whose son?

82
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,214
That's too immoral...

83
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:28,911
It's your son they want.

84
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,451
Anyway, they will find him out.

85
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:34,250
Yes, if others know,
it'd be embarrassing!

86
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,619
Let's brace up.

87
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,490
Brace up...

88
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,859
Sorry.

89
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,230
Officer Lau said
no entry without permission.

90
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:46,503
Forget it!

91
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,077
What's wrong?

92
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,143
Catch them!

93
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,578
- My son!
- Take my son!

94
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,318
Which is our son?

95
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,081
Either can be!

96
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:40,581
Which?

97
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,143
Wonder Woman!

98
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,516
Wonder Woman!

99
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,146
Its blood is left on the wall.

100
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,994
Not ours!

101
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,262
It's a baby girl!

102
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,898
It's my daughter!

103
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,571
I'm scared to death...

104
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,238
Get somebody to collect blood sample.

105
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,641
Yes, Officer Lau! Come with me.

106
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:52,951
Tung, one more baby is missing.

107
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,817
I'll be back late tonight.

108
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,159
Alright.

109
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:57,484
Are you sad?

110
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,493
No! Mind your work.

111
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:01,157
Bye...

112
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,349
I'll chop your head off next time.

113
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:36,857
Guard the door.

114
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,609
Master, here is the baby boy you want.

115
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,460
Take the 19th prince inside.

116
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,741
With other princes together.

117
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:27,134
Yes, Master.

118
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:28,735
San.

119
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:34,081
Your heart is beating too fast.

120
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:35,742
Not quite.

121
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:42,052
Memory does you no good.
Feelings and emotions too.

122
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:43,250
I don't have any.

123
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,018
I'll wait for the next propitious day.

124
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:50,431
And among the babies.

125
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:54,404
Choose one to be the king.

126
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:01,567
China must have a King!

127
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,477
China must have a King!

128
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,317
China must have a King!

129
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,433
Either you climb up by yourself.

130
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,532
Or you fall down! No one can help!

131
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,342
Climb up!

132
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,912
Ching, climb up!

133
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,210
Don't fall down!

134
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,733
Having a nightmare again?

135
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,074
May I come in?

136
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,736
I'm working. Don't disturb me.

137
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,885
I've been always
dreaming of the invisible robe.

138
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,817
Last night, I dream it finally worked.

139
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,720
Has it always been kept in the safe?

140
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,093
Yes, why?

141
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,929
The police called today.

142
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:04,391
Ask me how one can be invisible.

143
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:10,539
Before the invisible robe is finished,

144
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,606
you don't want others to know about it.

145
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:16,341
I want to keep it secret forever.

146
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,242
Because this invention
may easily be used

147
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:20,641
as a war weapon.

148
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:22,913
Then why're you still working on it?

149
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:24,645
This invisible robe mean a lot to you?

150
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:26,722
When I'm glued to my work.

151
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,391
I feel happy.

152
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,127
Aren't you worried that I may steal it?

153
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:35,689
No! People don't steal from themselves.

154
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:40,468
- Some coffee?
- Yes, please.

155
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:41,722
Miss.

156
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,559
The dates of birth of those 18 babies...

157
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:46,727
Are they related in any way?

158
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,330
Strange!

159
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,698
They are have a royal destiny.

160
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,569
All fated to be emperor!

161
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:54,835
Emperor?

162
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,741
Who's caught so many little emperors?

163
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:01,877
Sister!

164
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,313
You want some? Come over then.

165
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:48,727
Come on!

166
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,431
Are you talking to me?

167
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:02,675
No!

168
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:14,718
Sister, may I kiss you?

169
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:23,323
Why are you smiling?

170
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,163
Am I? Not really!

171
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,608
"Chemicals Factory."

172
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:42,244
Go down...

173
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,423
God! Who are they, Lau?

174
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,089
3 armed robbers with criminal records.

175
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,627
Just robbed a cash escort car.

176
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,593
And were driven there.

177
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,926
8 hostages inside,
including drivers and guards.

178
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,430
So, what to do?

179
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,431
We've getting them out.

180
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:01,604
Give me one!

181
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,577
Get ready!

182
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,339
Fire!

183
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:16,744
Don't panic, tear bombs only. Wear mask!

184
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,719
Come out! Damn! Get out!

185
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:27,093
Give me the revolver!

186
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,130
Don't fire!

187
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,601
Listen.

188
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,136
There're many more hostages inside.

189
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,632
Get me a helicopter within 2 hours.

190
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,735
Or I'll kill one every 5 minutes.

191
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,297
Good morning everybody!

192
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,029
Who's she?

193
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:10,632
Professional shooter-Chat.

194
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:12,670
Sir, don't call me that way.

195
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,634
I only kill those that deserve.

196
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,045
Call me thief-catcher.

197
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,407
The police won't hire you.

198
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:19,548
Hire?

199
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:23,016
Sir, I do you a favor this time.

200
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:24,511
It's free!

201
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,224
Get them!

202
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,030
I turn in, don't fire!

203
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,435
Rescue the hostages!

204
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:28,684
Lie down...

205
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,324
Go and see if there's others.

206
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:50,830
I'm married.

207
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:55,368
Only I can get your son back.

208
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:57,710
Pay me 500 thousand if found alive.

209
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,880
150 thousand if you don't mind he's dead.

210
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,415
I only take gold. Ring me if interested.

211
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:04,244
My phone number!

212
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,910
"The mysterious man confides,"

213
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:38,511
"the 19th baby will be missing tonight."

214
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:41,988
"And the time of his next crime."

215
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:44,284
"Apparently challenge the police."

216
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:47,159
The newspaper has been used!

217
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,991
The one placed the ad.
was not here for babies.

218
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,599
- Ask the others to be alert.
- Yes, officer Lau.

219
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:51,791
Mrs. Lau, you may go.

220
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,961
Please show me your pass.

221
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:00,967
What brings you here tonight?

222
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,870
I promised the head nurse
to come and help.

223
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,742
The old lady up there...

224
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,940
Won't do physiotherapy until you come,
right?

225
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,208
So you know already!

226
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,552
I'm busy, can't take care of you.

227
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:12,749
- Do take care.
- You too!

228
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:53,390
You're the one who placed the ad?

229
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,723
You're a cop?

230
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:59,428
Listen,
I'm going to kill all babies tonight.

231
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,505
What are you doing?

232
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:14,683
No...

233
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:18,010
Stand still, or I'll kill her!

234
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:19,779
Calm down!

235
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:22,282
Drop that! Or I'll kill her.

236
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:24,250
You drop it first.

237
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,888
- I'll kill her!
- Okay! I drop it!

238
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:30,332
Go inside! I'll kill her!

239
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,194
Go inside!

240
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,195
Those doctors killed my son.

241
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:36,464
This is revenge!

242
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:39,436
I'll kill at the babies!

243
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,568
Doctor Wong,
please hurry to Casualty Ward.

244
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:47,142
I'll kill all the babies!

245
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,516
You're bleeding! Wipe it off.

246
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:51,851
I'm fine!

247
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:57,484
Do you think we can break the door?

248
00:24:58,127 --> 00:24:59,389
No way! It's so thick!

249
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:02,622
Let me try!

250
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,238
The keys are just outside!

251
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,313
Almost get them!

252
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,177
Keep cool!

253
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:25,715
The loony won't be back so soon.

254
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,719
I'm worried about the babies only.

255
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:32,654
You heard what he said just now?

256
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:34,721
Let me try!

257
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:56,542
Why don't you go?

258
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:12,899
Roger. Stay calm. Say it slowly.

259
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:17,136
- One only?
- Yes!

260
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,740
So late! New to here?

261
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:32,749
- Take him out.
- Yes!

262
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,586
Don't move! Get up!

263
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:37,988
I won't leave any baby alive!

264
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,491
Lau!

265
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,025
I subdued the loony already!

266
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,862
I know!

267
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:46,363
Thanks for informing me in time.

268
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:47,797
- I didn't come for nothing!
- Yes!

269
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:58,508
- Any reward?
- No!

270
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,717
Don't keep the old lady waiting.

271
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,784
Done already!

272
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:10,717
Naughty! Laughing at me?

273
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,158
Are you leaving with me?

274
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,696
No! The real one hasn't turned up yet.

275
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,764
What?

276
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:19,697
Why so surprised?

277
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,705
Busybody! Take you out for a ride!

278
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:29,369
Let's go!

279
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,779
Officer Lau, a baby is stolen.

280
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,059
Don't shoot! The baby might be there!

281
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:52,801
Attention. Don't fire!

282
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,861
Don't fire!

283
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:02,435
I'm leaving!

284
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:16,215
The thief-catcher?

285
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:25,797
Keep awake, more fun to come.

286
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:27,693
Isn't it fun?

287
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:33,832
So there you are? Follow me!

288
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,523
Take a rest first!

289
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:01,594
Can't believe it!
Lagging behind! What a shame!

290
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,578
So sinister, not even a noise!

291
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,481
A woman!

292
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:19,846
A bitch!

293
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:36,198
Why did you steal so many babies?

294
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:38,531
What? You blame me for that?

295
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:41,404
You look pretty smart...

296
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:42,902
So you're the Wonder Woman?

297
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:44,103
And you're the thief-catcher?

298
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:45,473
Don't get in my way then!

299
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:47,807
How can you use the baby as bail?

300
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,215
How despicable!

301
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:52,721
That's enough!

302
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,717
Put the baby down first.

303
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,921
Let's see if you can make me do so!

304
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,117
Warm-up just now. Ready?

305
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:40,895
Wait...

306
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:50,805
What's it?

307
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:54,742
The invisible thing?

308
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,477
One more?

309
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,010
It seems to be on my side!

310
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:33,079
The baby?

311
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,388
Be careful!

312
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:01,876
How's the baby?

313
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,287
Wait, who are you?

314
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,957
Everything's fine now.

315
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:27,141
Alright,
don't try my patience! Who are you?

316
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,376
Let's go, Chat!

317
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:29,702
San, it's you?

318
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:30,903
Let's go!

319
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,048
Don't pull me. I can walk on my own.

320
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,351
I suspect the thief-catcher you hire.

321
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:39,316
How do you know?

322
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:41,753
Ask her to bring the baby back at once!

323
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:54,829
Call the doctor.

324
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:59,069
How's the baby?

325
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,503
- Save him!
- Count on me!

326
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:02,635
To Casualty ward!

327
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:39,676
- Doctor, how's the baby?
- Sorry.

328
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,016
It's too late.

329
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:25,691
Call his parents.

330
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:26,954
Yes, Officer.

331
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,099
Ching, don't go!

332
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:35,299
Master hates dummies like me.

333
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:37,234
I'll miss you!

334
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,238
Take care of yourself.

335
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:42,205
Don't cry!

336
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,141
- Ching!
- Let her go!

337
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,511
Kneel down.

338
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:54,151
Tung, you must stay here.

339
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:58,151
And finish the task alone.

340
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:00,824
You're going to uphold justice for me.

341
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:02,628
On your own.

342
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:20,715
Tung, why are you crying?

343
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:22,677
No, I'm not.

344
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:25,513
Tell me why.

345
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:27,389
Nothing.

346
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,819
How's the case to-day?

347
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,594
The baby fell to death!

348
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:49,942
It's been 10 years. You're still great.

349
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:52,577
Where did that monster
get invisible robe?

350
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:56,279
He's behind all this.
Will you interfere?

351
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:58,043
No, thanks!

352
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:00,354
When I escaped from that cave,

353
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,721
you spared me though you caught me.

354
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,887
Now I take good care of myself.

355
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:07,295
Why did he catch so many babies?

356
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:10,623
He'll choose one to be king.

357
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:12,400
The rest to leave behind.

358
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:14,092
They'll become his killers, like us.

359
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,500
And turn them into our generation.

360
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:20,335
San, do them a favor. Simply kill them.

361
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,472
For 3 years, that monster corrupted me.

362
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:23,406
After I had escaped from him.

363
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:26,309
I spent 10 years returning to normal.

364
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't want all babies
becoming monsters.

365
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:30,778
Pretend that you know nothing at all!
Leave this case alone!

366
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:33,854
If Master gives orders.
I'll kill you as well.

367
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:35,620
Do it then!

368
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:41,022
You won't be lucky next time!

369
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:46,426
Can I pretend that I know nothing?

370
00:37:03,952 --> 00:37:05,317
You are not Ching anymore.

371
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:08,114
Start from today,
you are called San Chan.

372
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:23,838
Get the invisible robe within 10 days,

373
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:26,672
and kill the doctor.

374
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,104
Do it or you die.

375
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,735
"Copy"

376
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:40,316
What are you doing?

377
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:50,630
It's dangerous here. Go out please!

378
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,866
What's so dangerous? You're always here.

379
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:56,261
You're keeping something from me?

380
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:01,773
You knew everything already!

381
00:38:01,977 --> 00:38:03,239
The invisible robe is belonged to us.

382
00:38:03,745 --> 00:38:06,111
Yet I don't know that
it can stand UV light.

383
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:07,806
No, not now.

384
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:10,342
If it can,
you'll be the first one to know.

385
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:13,621
You kept your work secret these days.

386
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:18,686
I'm working on this plant.

387
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,290
They were dead before.

388
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,292
But they're alive again.

389
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:31,839
Any flowers?

390
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:33,668
Yes. In a month time.

391
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,538
Ching.

392
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,218
Will you put them under the sun everyday,

393
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:45,511
and water them at night for me.

394
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:50,491
Lucky stars,
you taught me how to make them.

395
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:52,686
You shall see the flowers bloom.

396
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,963
Get the invisible robe within 10 days,

397
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:04,572
and kill the doctor.

398
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,674
Do it or you die.

399
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:11,904
Your men kept me for over 2 hours!

400
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,139
Don't blame me. It's accident!

401
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,375
Accident? The baby died because of you!

402
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:18,577
What?

403
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,483
It's all the Wonder Woman's fault.

404
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:21,518
You may go now.

405
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,157
But you can't deceive yourself.

406
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:28,187
Don't make a scapegoat of me!

407
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:31,557
Ok, I'll keep an eye on it.

408
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,530
Mainly keep an eye on my son, Miss!

409
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,401
Don't worry. I'll help my client.

410
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:39,540
Thank you!

411
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,208
I'm asking for trouble!

412
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:09,962
Well done.

413
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:17,335
Why are there so many bird cages?

414
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:40,935
Oh no! That Monster's here!

415
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:25,304
You've got the needles.

416
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:45,690
Let's see how long you can stand!

417
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:53,305
You know who the intruder was?

418
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:54,673
No.

419
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:56,844
I have someone in mind.

420
00:41:57,445 --> 00:42:00,812
But she should have died 10 years ago.

421
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:04,009
Right! I killed Chat myself.

422
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:07,753
Now only Wonder Woman could get in.

423
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:10,522
She's been meddling with our plan.

424
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,419
She's probably the intruder.

425
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:14,459
Let me kill her, Master.

426
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:17,189
Leave such things to others.

427
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:18,766
Kau,

428
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:25,028
kill the woman and,
if necessary, die with her.

429
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:43,617
You monster!

430
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:45,822
I won't let the needles go up to my head!

431
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:13,350
This case is not related to the others.

432
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:16,046
We promised the Mayor that
it wouldn't happen again.

433
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:18,684
Here's your deposit!

434
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,922
What deposit?

435
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:21,119
I quit the case of your son's business!

436
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:24,265
We'll talk later, I'm in the meeting.

437
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:26,127
No! Let's cut it off.

438
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,695
You must have got hold of something.

439
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:30,902
For the babies' sake. Please tell us.

440
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:32,533
What good does telling you?

441
00:43:33,341 --> 00:43:35,104
If you can handle it you won't hire me.

442
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,508
For the justice you should...

443
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:39,409
To hell with justice!
I almost got killed!

444
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:06,867
You killed the child!

445
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:11,645
Tell me what you know!

446
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,238
You think I'll listen to you?

447
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:14,712
You will!

448
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,410
When that baby fell down just now.

449
00:44:16,718 --> 00:44:17,878
You saved it without a second thought.

450
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:48,275
Yes, I killed the baby.

451
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,345
But I'm dying too.

452
00:44:52,654 --> 00:44:53,916
Let break it even!

453
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:57,686
Won't you leave me alone?

454
00:44:58,093 --> 00:45:00,459
I only want to die peacefully here.

455
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,628
I want to know who snatched the babies.

456
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,291
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

457
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:09,296
She's only a puppet.

458
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:13,563
That old monster!
I won't let his needles killing me.

459
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:15,309
Don't do that!

460
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,040
Go away before I lose my mind.

461
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:22,783
No.

462
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:24,151
You'll die!

463
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,252
If for a good reason, it's ok.

464
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,721
I can stop the needles
from going further.

465
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:34,953
But I can't get them out.

466
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:38,859
OK! I'll help you to get the babies back.

467
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,227
If we are to succeed,

468
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:43,637
we must get San to help us.

469
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:44,667
The Invisible Woman?

470
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:47,341
Yes! Before I find her,

471
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:48,533
we must be careful.

472
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:52,509
Because he found me entering his cave.

473
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:53,939
He thinks that was you.

474
00:45:54,115 --> 00:45:55,480
So, he sends Kau out to kill you now.

475
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:16,967
A loony holds hostages in the station.

476
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:18,503
He has destroyed the computer system too.

477
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:21,072
A cargo train is dashing
toward the station now.

478
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,005
When will it be there?

479
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:24,369
In about 5 minutes.

480
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:25,513
I've got it.

481
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,759
All units get ready.

482
00:46:52,841 --> 00:46:54,001
Mind the mines!

483
00:46:56,778 --> 00:46:57,938
Don't step on it.

484
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,076
Don't move!

485
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:06,820
Be careful! There are mines!

486
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:20,096
Go now!
The train will be clash in one minute.

487
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:22,903
Go in! Save the hostages inside first.

488
00:47:29,444 --> 00:47:30,706
Why don't you go in?

489
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:57,395
Run!

490
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:27,868
It's coming.

491
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:32,239
Wait for me.

492
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:44,609
Go to hell.

493
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,074
Let's go!

494
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:12,406
Supervisor, how can we stop the train?

495
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:14,114
The loony's destroyed the computer.

496
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:15,873
Can't stop it now!

497
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:31,331
Run! The train is here!

498
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:02,287
Take this!

499
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:09,527
Let's go!

500
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:48,767
Hubby.

501
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:54,875
What did the doctor say?

502
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:59,580
If lucky, you could walk within 6 months.

503
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:01,615
Otherwise?

504
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:05,190
Otherwise...

505
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:08,955
You may become a cripple.

506
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:13,792
Cheer up!

507
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:16,494
As Wonder Woman's hubby,

508
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:18,667
I'll stand by you.

509
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,535
When did you find out?

510
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:24,137
At the station,

511
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:29,572
when you looked at me,
unwilling to go in.

512
00:51:35,356 --> 00:51:38,223
No more chuckling from now on,

513
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:41,953
and no more secret tears.

514
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:45,463
Just tell me everything.

515
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:54,799
Okay?

516
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:00,976
Oh, darling!

517
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:38,852
There's a flower bud!

518
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:51,064
What's wrong? Sit down first.

519
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:54,063
No, I just got a clue.

520
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:56,169
I must write it down now!

521
00:52:56,737 --> 00:52:57,897
Sit down first!

522
00:52:58,473 --> 00:52:59,531
Now, you go out.

523
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:14,748
How long have you known this?

524
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:17,081
I knew it.

525
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:20,656
When I was working on the invisible robe.

526
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:23,494
I found that it emitted toxins.

527
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:27,029
So I always tell you to stay out of here.

528
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:30,101
But the flowers have a bud already.

529
00:53:31,372 --> 00:53:34,535
It tells we'll be alright.

530
00:53:35,643 --> 00:53:36,905
Come on, get out of here!

531
00:53:37,845 --> 00:53:40,609
How can I leave you like this?

532
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,177
Where are my glasses?

533
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:48,046
You're wearing them!

534
00:53:56,898 --> 00:54:00,356
Before the robe is completed...
I will not die.

535
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:05,169
I can smell the fragrance of your hair.

536
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:29,826
"Don't cry"

537
00:54:34,902 --> 00:54:36,870
Let's look at the flowers outside.

538
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:50,279
I'll be alright. You get out of here!

539
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,187
Let me in!

540
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:04,662
I'll stay even if you can get in.

541
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:12,430
The robe will be ready
when flowers bloom.

542
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:15,500
You promised to
take care of them till then.

543
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:17,205
You forget that?

544
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:29,547
San.

545
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,154
You still go to see that monster?

546
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,718
Anyway, he won't let the doctor live.

547
00:55:35,396 --> 00:55:37,364
He'll kill him once the robe is finished.

548
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:39,424
You're poisoned by his needles?

549
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:43,431
If you help us.

550
00:55:44,105 --> 00:55:45,766
Wonder Woman and I may kill him.

551
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:08,253
If you fear death, so why help her?

552
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:10,363
I won't thank you anyway.

553
00:56:10,498 --> 00:56:11,658
You saved my life.

554
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,796
But to protect the doctor,

555
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:15,230
you let that monster control you.

556
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:16,734
You know you've harmed so many babies?

557
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:20,540
You can deceive others but not yourself.

558
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,806
Wonder Woman can help you now.

559
00:56:22,977 --> 00:56:24,945
See you at the same spot tomorrow.

560
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:26,508
I'll wait till you come.

561
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:31,346
Don't fool me!

562
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,123
I can't wait, hurry up.

563
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:46,831
I'll made it!

564
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:51,704
Ching...!

565
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:02,709
Lucky star!

566
00:57:03,284 --> 00:57:04,842
Ching, I make the invisible robe!

567
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:14,552
Why you still haven't got that robe?

568
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:18,425
It can't work under the sun yet.

569
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:20,834
Without it,
the king's army may be weakened.

570
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:23,628
It'll soon be finished.

571
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:26,239
Give the doctor a few more days.

572
00:57:27,374 --> 00:57:28,739
Get it anyway,

573
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,873
before tomorrow sunset.

574
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:35,506
Kau will help you then.

575
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:40,051
Master, in your plan, all my work,

576
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:41,549
it is so inconsequential.

577
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:46,058
If I find a king among those babies,

578
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,521
you'll be honored for your services.

579
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,703
All princes should be asleep.
You should go to sleep too.

580
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:15,351
If they can all be invisible,

581
00:58:15,856 --> 00:58:18,017
they'll be better fighters than Kau.

582
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:23,526
The world
will then be mine and the King's!

583
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:31,100
You see how important you are?

584
00:58:32,673 --> 00:58:33,731
Yes.

585
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,368
The 18th of September.

586
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,341
Today...

587
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:45,649
I finally solve the UV light problem,

588
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:53,624
but that's the end of my life too.

589
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:56,323
From the first working day,

590
00:58:57,865 --> 00:59:00,129
I knew I would die of toxins.

591
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:03,336
If Ching weren't here,

592
00:59:04,505 --> 00:59:06,166
I wouldn't be able to face my life.

593
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:11,173
If she knows that I only hope,

594
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:15,979
to take her hands
and see flowers with her,

595
00:59:17,184 --> 00:59:19,744
will she... still kill me?

596
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:27,354
The day will come soon.

597
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:30,463
Get the invisible robe anyway,

598
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,759
and kill the doctor!

599
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:53,818
Doctor, I'll never return to you.

600
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:57,150
I won't leave until I see you.

601
00:59:58,058 --> 00:59:59,025
Believe me,

602
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,091
you are in great danger.
Leave the lab now!

603
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:10,495
Damn it! Even the Wonder Woman is late!

604
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:14,172
I shouldn't say wait until they came!

605
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,307
Should I leave or not?

606
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:29,017
Great. Here you're!

607
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:30,655
Master sent me to kill you!

608
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:34,852
- Wait, San.
- Just do it.

609
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:36,791
I won't let you go this time.

610
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:39,027
You can do it without any conscience?

611
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,428
I must execute Master's order.

612
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:43,236
But I can promise you.

613
01:00:43,837 --> 01:00:45,702
I'll do you a favor after you die.

614
01:00:45,806 --> 01:00:48,969
Wait! The one to die... May be you!

615
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:51,039
Tell me your last wish now!

616
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:53,804
Take care of doctor then.

617
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:54,939
Doctor?

618
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:13,159
Save Doctor for me.

619
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:24,871
San, what're you doing?

620
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:27,110
She's not coming to kill.
She came to kill herself.

621
01:01:28,315 --> 01:01:29,680
You give up your life to save him?

622
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:30,908
My life?

623
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:34,051
I am just a beast to kill.

624
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:36,449
A beast won't have feelings.

625
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,553
Or sacrifice itself for another.

626
01:01:48,102 --> 01:01:52,163
Life is meaningful
if you can face yourself.

627
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:55,537
I simply can't face myself.
I can't face him either.

628
01:01:55,943 --> 01:01:58,207
San...

629
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:04,179
So you're all leaving?

630
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:07,213
Damn, can't you stay?

631
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:09,453
My own bike is better!

632
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:12,857
Wait for me.

633
01:02:17,998 --> 01:02:20,865
San! You can change yourself from now on?

634
01:02:21,468 --> 01:02:22,935
So what? I'm still San!

635
01:02:23,103 --> 01:02:25,071
You can be another Chat! Like her.

636
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:27,932
Too late! Leave me alone!

637
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:36,574
Shit! Even a bike can't catch them up?
Go!

638
01:02:42,122 --> 01:02:43,384
You've shunned the past.

639
01:02:43,524 --> 01:02:45,185
So this is your true self!

640
01:02:45,526 --> 01:02:46,788
I shan't live on then!

641
01:02:50,497 --> 01:02:51,759
No!

642
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:05,905
God!

643
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:12,242
You two are in great trouble!

644
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:14,847
So lucky. Brace up!

645
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,832
Tung?

646
01:03:31,705 --> 01:03:32,865
Ching?

647
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:37,039
Let go of my hand, or we'll both fall!

648
01:03:37,511 --> 01:03:38,671
No!

649
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:41,981
Hold it!

650
01:03:45,652 --> 01:03:47,017
I can't hold on any longer!

651
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:52,659
I won't let go! We must be together.

652
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:55,755
It's you!

653
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:57,690
You two knew each other?

654
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:02,762
I don't remember.

655
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,928
The past is not important.

656
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:06,139
But to-day, well lived.

657
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:09,769
Say! What do you want to do?

658
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:14,376
Master sent Kau to kill Doctor. Save him.

659
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:16,349
Doctor?

660
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:47,404
Give it to me.

661
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:18,606
The invisible robe is UV light-proof now.

662
01:05:19,346 --> 01:05:20,506
Nobody can find it.

663
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:23,743
No!

664
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:32,321
Ching, I want to talk to you.

665
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:34,887
All inside the gife box.

666
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:50,469
However hard you hit, it's useless.

667
01:05:50,644 --> 01:05:52,305
He'll stick to what he wants.

668
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:54,039
No!

669
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:00,644
You can't give him.

670
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:03,823
I've got nothing now.
I can't let him die!

671
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:22,976
Sorry!

672
01:06:24,077 --> 01:06:26,944
Master can't make you kill me.

673
01:06:43,997 --> 01:06:45,157
It's not that easy!

674
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:53,871
Wait...

675
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:24,898
Idiot, here's the tape. Come and get it!

676
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,840
Goodbye!

677
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,111
It's too hot to stay here.

678
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:08,944
It's better to have this thing destroyed.

679
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:10,450
Let's go!

680
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:17,724
You go first.

681
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:19,552
- What about you...
- Leave her alone!

682
01:08:21,495 --> 01:08:22,359
Where are we going?

683
01:08:22,963 --> 01:08:24,225
To save the babies from the cave.

684
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:27,629
Only two of us?
Let me get my stuffs first.

685
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:34,938
May I look at the blooming flowers?

686
01:09:18,452 --> 01:09:19,714
All the babies are here.

687
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,185
Don't touch anything.

688
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:23,856
Babies will die if there's a fight.

689
01:09:32,566 --> 01:09:33,828
Must have it done completely.

690
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:36,226
What are you doing?

691
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:38,099
It's a tragedy to see them grown up.

692
01:09:38,205 --> 01:09:41,663
They're no longer human beings.
They'll all be like Kau, the beast.

693
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:42,968
If I were them, I would rather die.

694
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:45,573
No time for mercy!

695
01:10:26,186 --> 01:10:27,448
Let's go!

696
01:10:54,714 --> 01:10:56,272
Monster, come and let die!

697
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,515
Beware, there is full of methane.

698
01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:08,027
Monster, like methane more than oxygen.
I'll kill you!

699
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:14,667
How dare you are to come here?

700
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,202
Attack her.

701
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:20,434
Supernatural power?

702
01:11:37,691 --> 01:11:39,852
You kneel down? Where's your guts?

703
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,626
I can't help it! My legs get limp!

704
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:46,757
You think you can beat me?

705
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:49,231
It's no use kneeling. Guards, go.

706
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:50,629
Yes.

707
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:51,771
We've got no exit now.

708
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:53,837
Let's you get Master, I handle others.

709
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,803
Go!

710
01:12:33,013 --> 01:12:35,573
It's an honor to die before me.

711
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:38,542
I'm excited. Is the methane caused it?

712
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:40,515
What to do? We can't get him.

713
01:12:40,587 --> 01:12:42,248
Don't let him concentrate.

714
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:44,623
I'll kill you this time.

715
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:06,205
Tung, go with Chat.

716
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,747
No, I'll fight to the end.

717
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:08,939
No.

718
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:11,276
You'll get poisoned if you stay.

719
01:13:12,385 --> 01:13:13,352
Go.

720
01:13:20,293 --> 01:13:21,954
Get some oxygen first.

721
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:45,809
Go to hell, all of you!

722
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:13,005
He's blown up to pieces this time!

723
01:14:16,082 --> 01:14:17,344
Why this one so late?

724
01:14:17,517 --> 01:14:18,541
He's still alive!

725
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:38,929
To hell with you!

726
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:45,869
He's afraid of light!

727
01:14:46,112 --> 01:14:47,272
Some more.

728
01:15:41,835 --> 01:15:43,803
Is my face still looking good?

729
01:15:45,972 --> 01:15:47,234
What?

730
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:49,942
I don't know if you're alright.
But you scare me!

731
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:07,953
He's not yet dead?

732
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:34,311
How can that be!

733
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,421
His body is gone,
but his mind still there.

734
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:03,113
He's gained control of me.

735
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:05,408
Let me help you.

736
01:17:05,551 --> 01:17:06,711
Don't get near!

737
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:13,652
I can't control myself.

738
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:22,657
Go. Quick!

739
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:51,925
- Go with Chat.
- That way!

740
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:09,639
Ching.

741
01:18:09,882 --> 01:18:11,543
Don't let me do it again.

742
01:18:12,218 --> 01:18:14,482
Shit!

743
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,623
Go to hell!

744
01:18:18,624 --> 01:18:20,285
Go!

745
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:23,689
You son of a bitch!

746
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:43,782
He's controlling my mind, go!

747
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:45,711
We won't leave you behind.

748
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:48,149
I feel so good to see you again!

749
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:51,583
Sorry!

750
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,119
San!

751
01:18:57,764 --> 01:18:58,924
- San!
- Ching!

752
01:18:59,098 --> 01:19:02,556
I'll die with you, monster!

753
01:19:02,635 --> 01:19:08,096
China must have a king...

754
01:19:16,282 --> 01:19:18,045
What's important is to-day, not the past.

755
01:19:18,184 --> 01:19:24,851
China must have a king!

756
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:33,798
We watch the flowers bloom together?

757
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:35,600
Doctor!

758
01:20:03,362 --> 01:20:04,522
Ching!

759
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,462
You won't die.

760
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:14,105
Get to the ground first.

761
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:15,638
Otherwise I'll die.

762
01:20:24,217 --> 01:20:25,479
Are you alright?

763
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:27,777
Where's Chat?

764
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:30,451
Get something good.

765
01:20:31,157 --> 01:20:33,921
Take one, or when the pass comes,

766
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:35,654
we'll look shabby!

767
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:38,191
Come on, put them on!

768
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:12,428
The police has solved the babies case.

769
01:21:13,132 --> 01:21:15,396
Most missing babies have been found.

770
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:18,200
Here's our live report.

771
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,502
We heard that 3 heroines solved it.

772
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:23,971
How are they related to the police?

773
01:21:24,443 --> 01:21:26,809
They are close friends of the police.

774
01:21:27,046 --> 01:21:28,308
What are their positions?

775
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:29,345
No comment.

776
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:31,881
When will they come again?

777
01:21:32,385 --> 01:21:33,852
When we are in need.

778
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:36,218
What are their names?

779
01:21:37,023 --> 01:21:38,285
Their names?

780
01:21:39,559 --> 01:21:41,117
They are called "The Heroic Trio".

781
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:44,323
When did we get that name?

782
01:21:44,864 --> 01:21:46,024
Where does the name come from?

783
01:21:48,134 --> 01:21:49,499
It's an improvisation only.
