1
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,951
Charlie.

2
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,665
Not again.

3
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,084
Come back to bed, baby.

4
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,422
l gotta go to work and you snoozed
on my alarm. l'm gonna be late.

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,343
Yeah, well, you peed on me,
so l guess we're even.

6
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,887
l have a weak bladder.

7
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,140
l can't go to work like this.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,808
You work from our kitchen.

9
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,063
Yeah, but my real job
is to change the sheets.

10
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,924
Oh, why is it coffee tastes
so much better when you make it?

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,262
Because l make it with love.

12
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,349
And l also make it with bacon.

13
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,867
All right, guys.
lf l were to add a C to this word...

14
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,410
...what word would l have?

15
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,079
- l know. l know.
- l know.

16
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,248
A lot of hands, l like it.

17
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,667
How about Hillary?
What do you got for me?

18
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,877
- Can.
- Can is correct.

19
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,338
Hillary, you won
an all-expense-paid trip...

20
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,924
...to the dry-erase board.
Come on. Have at it.

21
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,427
There's a washer-dryer combo in it.
Let's see what you got.

22
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,013
Beautiful C.
Come on, everybody, cheer her on.

23
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,850
That's just-- That's just good stuff.

24
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,853
All right, what's next?

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,105
Let's try another one. Okay.

26
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,484
Who's got another letter we can use
to make a word here?

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,570
Who's got it? Who's got it?

28
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,030
l'm coming for you,
Ramon Martinez.

29
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,615
What do you got?

30
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,368
- P.
- P is an excellent choice.

31
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,705
And what would that spell?

32
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,166
- Pan?
- Pan is correct, everybody.

33
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,960
All right, come on down, Ramon.

34
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,546
You got this. You can do it.
l believe in you.

35
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,841
Come on. Let's see what you got.
To the board. Put it there.

36
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,176
Okay, this is very exciting.

37
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,972
Look.
Oh, just beautiful penmanship by the--

38
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,688
Oh, God. l'm so sorry, you guys.

39
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,649
l'm so sorry you had to see that.

40
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,236
- Oh, my God.
- Miss Hannah.

41
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,821
Are you pregnant?

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,991
What?

43
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,494
My mommy threw up
when she was pregnant with my sister.

44
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,830
Are you pregnant?

45
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,958
Are you?

46
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,012
Yes.

47
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,224
Hello in there, you.

48
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,852
l felt you moving.

49
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,150
Vice Principal Davies will be able
to look after your class for the day...

50
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,861
...so that's one less thing
to think about.

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,658
l just feel awful for letting that happen
in front of the kids, you know.

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,701
Well, don't worry about it.

53
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,620
Kind of comes with the territory.

54
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,914
And those kids, they're pretty tough.

55
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,958
l'm sure they've seen plenty worse.

56
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:58,422
You know, l was never able
to have a child of my own and so....

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,009
Well, now l have about 200 of them.

58
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,178
Be careful what you wish for, right?

59
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,266
l'm so curious to know how it is for you
and how you're feeling--

60
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,894
- Oh, you know--
- And how excited you must be.

61
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,897
lt's--
l mean, it's hard to explain exactly...

62
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,482
- Yeah.
- ...how it is, but--

63
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,651
lt's a responsibility, isn't it?

64
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,739
Probably the biggest responsibility
that we have.

65
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,217
There's a....

66
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,221
Thank you.

67
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,559
Hang on. Hang on one second.
Everybody, please be good.

68
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:58,482
ls everything okay, Mrs. Hannah?

69
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,986
l just feel really embarrassed, but....

70
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:06,699
l feel a lot better
and l wanted to thank you, so....

71
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,409
Well....

72
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,787
l know you were drinking this morning.
l saw you.

73
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,624
What? No, no. What--?

74
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,794
Drinking when you're pregnant
is really dangerous.

75
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,839
l know that.

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,264
l'm not actually pregnant.

77
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,519
- What?
- lt's just-- l'm really hung over.

78
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,482
And the kids started asking me
questions and l threw up and l just--

79
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,192
l....

80
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,111
Okay.

81
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,821
That's....

82
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,156
That's not good.

83
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,407
l know. l know.

84
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,160
Please. Please don't say anything.

85
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,371
Just go home.

86
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,332
Get some sleep.

87
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,844
Next up, we've got Kate.

88
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,055
You got this!

89
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,048
- Yes.
- Yes.

90
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,217
Oh, it just fades out.

91
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,012
Yeah!

92
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,392
Okay.

93
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,811
Who's next?

94
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,063
Your turn.

95
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,443
Baby.

96
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,322
- Hey.
- That was great.

97
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
- You sound like an angel.
- Oh, really?

98
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,704
A drunk, drunk, drunk angel.

99
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,082
lf you were gonna write about me,
what would you say?

100
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,587
l would say that l have the sexiest...

101
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:29,550
...most amazing wife on the planet.
The entire planet.

102
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,262
Oh, and it'd be such a shitty article
and nobody would read it.

103
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,349
l gotta go. l got work to do.

104
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,853
You boys have fun.

105
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,396
- Goodbye. l love you.
- Bye.

106
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,732
Goodbye. l love you.

107
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,282
Hey, are you okay?

108
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,951
You know what, girl? l am not okay.

109
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,161
- You're not?
- No.

110
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,625
My bitch sister just-- She just took off
and left me here to go hook up...

111
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,543
...with this asshole.

112
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,962
And now l don't have a car.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,589
l don't have a ride.

114
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,717
- l don't know what to do.
- Man.

115
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,303
l mean, l guess--

116
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,140
You could give me a ride?
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

117
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,558
Thank you so much.

118
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,311
l was gonna say call you a cab.
l don't know you.

119
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,479
No, no, no.

120
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,232
No, l-- lt's very close.

121
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,568
Please?

122
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,158
You know,
you shouldn't drink and drive.

123
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,993
- l wasn't--
- l'm just kidding.

124
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,662
Can l have a sip?

125
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,623
l'm so thirsty.

126
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,999
lt's whiskey, so....

127
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,754
Fuck, yeah, it's whiskey.
l fucking love whiskey.

128
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,760
You are a hardcore drinking bitch
like me.

129
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,763
l don't know about that.
l don't know.

130
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,474
You're such a cute little bitch.

131
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,977
Thank you.

132
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,729
Hey, can l smoke in the car?

133
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,023
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

134
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,567
Can you just roll the window down?

135
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,570
Of course. l'm not uncivilized.

136
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,162
What--? That's not what l thought
you were talking about.

137
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,255
Do you want a hit?

138
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,549
Oh, what is it? ls it pot?

139
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,134
Of course not.

140
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,470
Do l look like a hippie? lt's crack.

141
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,847
Oh, shit.

142
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,891
- Shit.
- No, no, no. lt's good crack. lt's good.

143
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,561
- l have never done crack before.
- Really?

144
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,189
lt is amazing.

145
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,318
lt's gonna sober your butt up too.

146
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,488
- Just take a hit.
- All right. Okay, one puff.

147
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,615
You're so smart.

148
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,410
You're really a wise girl.

149
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,479
l feel like l know
what it's like to be homeless.

150
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,024
lf you saw me, you didn't know me,
we hadn't connected tonight...

151
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,652
...you might think, "There goes
some upper-class, NPR-listening...

152
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,448
...lazy, liberal, self-congratulatory,
never-been-through-anything--"

153
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,159
And it's not true. l grew up poor.

154
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,205
Single mother. Single mother.
There was this thing at McDonald's.

155
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,333
They'd sell 29-cent hamburgers,
39-cent cheeseburgers...

156
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,503
...and we would go there
and she would buy 20 of them.

157
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,962
That was the limit.

158
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,590
People like us,
we'd put them in a freezer.

159
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,468
And, yeah,
l had a weight issue in high school.

160
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,555
l did, l admit that. But when l started
drinking, l stopped eating so much.

161
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,642
What l'm saying is that you and me--

162
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,977
You and me,
we are not that different.

163
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,270
lt's okay. Go to sleep. lt's fine.

164
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,773
- lt's okay. lt's okay.
- Oh, babe.

165
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,194
l'm so glad you're okay.

166
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,161
Listen....

167
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,043
l don't think l can do this anymore.

168
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,130
l think l need to slow down.

169
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,800
- Yeah?
- And...

170
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,261
...l might need help.

171
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,096
Hey.

172
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,890
l'll help you.

173
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,269
Yeah.

174
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,855
All right,
l'm gonna tell you something.

175
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,650
But you have to promise
not to tell anybody, okay?

176
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,610
Okay. l promise.

177
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,696
l'm serious. Not even your brother.

178
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
Of course. What?

179
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,371
Last night, l ended up...

180
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,248
...kind of...

181
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,126
...smoking crack.

182
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,505
Wait. What?

183
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,883
There was this drunk girl
outside the bar. She needed help.

184
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,679
She needed a ride. l didn't know--
l ended up smoking crack.

185
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,180
Wait, wait, wait.

186
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,725
How does that even happen?

187
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,770
l mean, so you give someone a ride
and she rewards you with crack?

188
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,522
She seemed desperate, okay?

189
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,691
She's-- She needed a ride home.

190
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,318
Where? Where does she live?

191
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,195
Downtown. l think she....

192
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,157
Maybe she lived in a tent.

193
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,366
l don't know.

194
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,618
- What?
- l don't know.

195
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,622
She might have been homeless.
She might have been a prostitute.

196
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,707
Hey. Okay.

197
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,543
l'm just playing devil's advocate.

198
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,255
Maybe it's the crack smoking...

199
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,758
...you need help with
and not the drinking.

200
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,551
l'm just saying.

201
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,305
Well, the drinking is what led
to the crack smoking.

202
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,559
And the drinking is what leads
to everything stupid that l do.

203
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,686
Charlie....

204
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,859
Look, okay, we'll just....

205
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,864
We'll just chill out on the drinking,
okay?

206
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:37,412
We'll just be, you know,
wine-with-dinner people.

207
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,582
Yeah?

208
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,253
- We're good.
- Are we good?

209
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,839
- We're good. Go, go, go.
- Coming.

210
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,597
l want some gummy bears
on a snow cone.

211
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,475
Okay, l'll find you one.

212
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,936
That's a clown, babe.

213
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,106
- That was a clown. Did you see that?
- lt's a clown, babe.

214
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,275
- Watch out for the crack.
- Where? What crack?

215
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,112
Oh, l thought there was a crack
next to--

216
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,280
l don't know.
You must have smoked it.

217
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,618
Oh, you're so funny. You're so--

218
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,454
l was drunk, okay?
Get over it, Charlie.

219
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,792
Well, maybe you should go to one
of those-- You know, those meetings.

220
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,585
Remember when l went in there?

221
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:31,049
- Stole one of those Q&A pamphlets.
- Holy shit, yes.

222
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,969
And then we answered
all the questions "yes"...

223
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,723
...and at the end, it said, "lf you
answered these questions 'yes'...

224
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,143
...you might be an alcoholic."

225
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,730
- Hey, let's drink the tequila.
- Yes. l want some margaritas.

226
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,122
- Oh, you didn't.
- l did.

227
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,623
- l'm gonna get you.
- No.

228
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,585
- Yeah?
- No. No. No!

229
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,518
Charlie.

230
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:31,109
Come on, Charlie. Come on.

231
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,278
Come on.

232
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,864
- What's happening?
- You almost fell asleep.

233
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,910
- Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep.
- Yeah. No. l'm not, l'm not.

234
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,953
Okay. Okay.

235
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:47,769
Hi.

236
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,146
What?

237
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

238
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,421
l can't sell you these.

239
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,300
- Sorry, l can't.
- Why? Why? Oh, you can't tell l'm 21 ?

240
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,053
Come on. Come on,
l'm in here all the time. You know me.

241
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,306
Yeah, l know you and l like you.

242
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,559
But l can't sell you these
because it's too late.

243
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,313
Oh, well, we can just pretend
it's before 2, right?

244
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,899
Look. Look, it's only 1 :45.

245
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,568
- Stop. Stop.
- lt's totally fine.

246
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,281
- Come on, man, it's just a little wine.
- Seriously, it's not gonna happen.

247
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,409
l'm not even driving or anything.
Come on.

248
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,660
And you know what?

249
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,204
lf you give it to me,
l'll let you have a sip.

250
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,373
Gonna let you have a sip.

251
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,251
As enticing as that is, it's the law.

252
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,546
And l can't sell you alcohol after 2 a.m.
And you know this.

253
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,215
Then why don't you just give it to me,
okay?

254
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,802
Like a friend, a gift for a friend.
And that won't hurt anybody.

255
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,347
Because l don't wanna lose my job.

256
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,063
You, hey.

257
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,566
You. You. You distract him, okay?

258
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,779
Kate, why don't you get, like, a bottle
of water or a coffee or something?

259
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:26,034
- Water or coffee.
- Yeah.

260
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,371
Really? Really?
Because l won't suck your dick?

261
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,040
- Okay, you gotta go.
- Fuck you.

262
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,251
- No, that's enough. You gotta go.
- Fuck you, okay?

263
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,797
This is bullshit. So fuck you.

264
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,256
Oh, l have to pee.

265
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,467
- Kate. Kate.
- Oh, l have to pee.

266
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,177
Where are you going?

267
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,807
Shit. Come on, Kate.

268
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,351
Oh, it's locked. lt's locked.

269
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,397
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Sorry. l just--

270
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,566
l have to pee really, really bad
sometimes.

271
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,236
Just go, please.

272
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,657
Holy shit.

273
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,123
You seriously just pissed the floor?

274
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,919
Out.

275
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,594
Kate. What--? No. Hey, hey, hey!

276
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,553
ls everything okay with you?

277
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,683
l don't know.

278
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,270
No.

279
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,107
l mean...

280
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:07,946
...l puked in front of bunch of little kids
and told everybody l'm pregnant, so....

281
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,324
Yeah, l don't think that's really okay,
is it?

282
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,785
No, l don't think so.

283
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,000
l normally...

284
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,922
...don't tell people l work with
about this...

285
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:32,554
...but l'm a bit of an expert
when it comes to these things.

286
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,725
- You?
- Yeah, me.

287
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,311
l've lived a strange one.

288
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,940
l'm nine years sober, AA and NA.

289
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,904
l used to drink cocaine.

290
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,576
lt's really cheap in the Philippines.

291
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,246
Listen, Kate...

292
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,000
...l know meetings are weird.

293
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,668
Especially at first.

294
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,254
But if you want to--

295
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,091
l mean, you never need
to feel like you have to.

296
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,262
But the ones l go to are pretty small,
nice little groups.

297
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,265
So l'd be happy to take you.

298
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,437
No pressure, okay?

299
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,606
That shit saved my life though.

300
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,985
- Patricia.
- Oh, well, hello, Dave.

301
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,529
What are you up to today,
or dare l ask?

302
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,615
No good as usual.

303
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,452
l'm off to watch Miss Carol's art class
make some macaroni art.

304
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,872
- Pretty stoked.
- Oh, Dave.

305
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,166
- Have a nice day, ladies.
- All right.

306
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,460
- Hey, Kate, l got you something.
- Hey.

307
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,880
Yeah. Look at this.

308
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,175
- OJ. Folic acid.
- Right, right.

309
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:56,763
You need this right now.
lt's very important for that baby.

310
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,308
Boy. Well, your mom must be
just about over the moon right now.

311
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:05,396
l bet she's home making baby clothes
and planning a shower and--

312
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,734
Oh, my mom and l
aren't really that close, so....

313
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,819
Oh, you're not close with your mom?

314
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,113
- Nope.
- l'm sorry.

315
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,993
But you know what? Guess what's
gonna bring you closer together again.

316
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,330
- What?
- This baby.

317
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,423
- Hey.
- Hey.

318
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,467
How was your day?

319
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,719
What's that smell?

320
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:42,517
lt was all right.
Oh, sorry, l made ketchup soup.

321
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:46,437
Charlie, you have to eat.

322
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,730
What?

323
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,108
lt was tasty.

324
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:56,114
Hey, so l'm gonna go see that band
from lceland--

325
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,700
You know, with the triplets.
--play tonight.

326
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,369
You wanna go with me and Owen?

327
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,999
Sounds like a lot of fun, but....

328
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,378
Come on, it will be fun. Look, l'm
supposed to review the show for work.

329
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,714
Yeah, it's....

330
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,968
This guy that l work with,
Mr. Davies....

331
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,096
- The vice principal?
- Yeah, he--

332
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:27,395
lt turns out that he's sober
and he invited me to a meeting.

333
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,860
That's-- That's cool.

334
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,040
- Hey. Good.
- Hey.

335
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,751
So this is much more my speed.

336
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,254
l can assure you,
no one here is the slightest bit hip.

337
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,967
And l actually looked at this dog with
the intention of trying to explain it...

338
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,219
...and then realized
there was no way...

339
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:05,266
...that l could get it
through this dog's brain that he--

340
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,354
That what l was doing
was in his best interest...

341
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,274
...even though he couldn't understand
and that his brain was too small.

342
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,277
And when l got home,
both sets were in my bag...

343
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,654
...and l wasn't charged for both.

344
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,617
So l sat with it for a while.

345
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:27,997
And l lost sleep over it
because l didn't pay for it...

346
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,291
...and this is a program of honesty.

347
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:35,713
All l knew about taking care of myself
was fucking people over...

348
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,841
...lying to get by.

349
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,721
l had no idea
how to even look for a normal job...

350
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,723
...or pay my bills on time.

351
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,226
Hell, pay my bills at all.

352
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,603
Now l pay my bills online.

353
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,146
Yep.

354
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,982
l found a love in cooking.

355
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,319
l have my own
catering business now.

356
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:05,368
And maybe l have replaced alcohol
with chocolate-chip cookies...

357
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:09,122
...and vanilla wafers,
banana pudding...

358
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,834
...doughnuts,
jelly doughnuts to be specific...

359
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,004
...potato salad, shawarma...

360
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,925
...and nacho cheese.

361
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,928
Y'all know what l'm talking about.

362
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,098
- l kind of like her.
- lt's been years....

363
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,016
- You don't like her?
- l like her.

364
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,145
Oh, you do? Sponsor potential.

365
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,481
Get her number at the break.

366
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,066
But l'm glad.

367
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,236
- You're kind of like my wingman.
- But l have my wounds.

368
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:44,699
From now on,
l'm going to enjoy my doughnuts.

369
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,202
l prefer them over hangovers.

370
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,997
We'll now have a 1 0-minute break.

371
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:59,255
- l just-- l really liked your speech.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

372
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:04,927
All that dumb shit happened, so now
l'm glad it's at least entertaining.

373
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,557
- What's your name?
- Kate.

374
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,394
This is my first time
at one of these things.

375
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:18,399
l mean, at least it's my first time
that l'm not wasted, so....

376
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,528
Yeah. l remember doing
some of that myself.

377
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,911
l'm sorry,
l don't really know how this works.

378
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,414
Could l get your number?
l don't know if l'll need it, l just--

379
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,168
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
l'll be happy to explain it all to you.

380
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,505
And we can also just talk.

381
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,091
Cool.

382
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:49,972
Look, this is the kind of meeting
where anyone can share.

383
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,557
Sharing always helps me...

384
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,728
...so try introducing yourself
to the group.

385
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,443
l'm Kate.

386
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,820
l'm an alcoholic.

387
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,531
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Kate.

388
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,700
l'm sorry, l don't mean to laugh.

389
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,870
Those words are weird.

390
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,124
l mean, l guess l--

391
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,711
Yeah. l don't know if l'm an alcoholic,
really. l drink a lot.

392
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,298
And l've always drank a lot.

393
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,634
Everyone l know drinks a lot.

394
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,680
So l never really thought
it was a problem.

395
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,853
But lately,
it kind of seems like it is, so....

396
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,733
l wanna be able to have a beer
without it turning into 20...

397
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,153
...or wetting the bed.

398
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,784
lt seems like every time l drink,
something awful happens...

399
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,829
...and all the things
that used to be funny...

400
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,415
...are not really funny anymore...

401
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:03,671
...and things have gone
from embarrassing to scary, so....

402
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,717
So, yeah, l'm kind of--

403
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,720
l'm kind of scared.

404
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,351
l think we're four seconds in--

405
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,520
l'm in sixth place.
l'm making my move.

406
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,189
l'm getting serious now.
l'm getting serious.

407
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,526
Frightening. lt's a story about a--

408
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,033
Perfect, we're not.

409
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,638
Kate, alcoholic.

410
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,396
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

411
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,276
Here we are.

412
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,696
Excuse me.

413
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,907
l am really proud of you, Kate.

414
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,660
God.

415
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,162
l think the longest time
l've been sober...

416
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,706
...since high school was like a week.

417
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,669
My first three months
were such hell.

418
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,088
The only reason
l think l'm sober today...

419
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,716
...is l just never could fathom
going through that again.

420
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:36,597
Yeah. lt's so hard and weird,
and now that l'm not drinking...

421
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,433
...l have these other problems
l have to deal with.

422
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,437
lt takes time, right?

423
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,941
My ex-wife, she doesn't drink.

424
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,443
Well, not like us.

425
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:55,116
As soon as l got sober,
l started to change and she just didn't.

426
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,618
l didn't know you were married.

427
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,828
Yeah.

428
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:03,791
l was married once, in my other life.

429
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,964
You know, l shouldn't be talking to you
about this stuff.

430
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,716
Why?

431
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,176
l don't know.

432
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,929
Oh, right. Right.

433
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,808
l forgot that men stick with men,
women stick with women.

434
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,227
l don't get all that.

435
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,649
Well, if you were sitting
where l'm sitting, you'd understand.

436
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,488
Are you trying to tell me
you have a crush on me?

437
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,491
What am l, one of your students?
A crush?

438
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,827
Yeah, yeah, a crush.

439
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,205
l kind of do, yeah.

440
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,959
l have a crush on you.

441
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,005
l know that's wrong.
You're newly sober and married.

442
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,716
l shouldn't be thinking about you
like that...

443
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,218
...but, yeah.

444
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,555
l should put that out on the table.
Honesty.

445
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,099
Well, it's okay.

446
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,311
You know,
l think you're a really nice guy.

447
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,687
Oh, great.

448
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,232
Really nice guys are the nerds
who carry the pretty girls' books.

449
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,276
Oh, come on.

450
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,696
l think you're beautiful.

451
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,367
And smart and sexy and cool.

452
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,828
And l know it's wrong...

453
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,956
...but in meetings...

454
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,211
...l just stare at your lips
and your legs.

455
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,714
And l can't stop thinking
about fucking your moist pussy.

456
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,884
What?

457
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,012
- What? What?
- l don't know why l just said that.

458
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,723
l don't know why you just said that.
Oh, my God.

459
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,558
That was a bad thing to say.

460
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,728
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that was a really bad thing to say.

461
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,732
l am so, so sorry.
l am feeling really confused.

462
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,568
l'm just really not smart
at talking to women.

463
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,654
l mean, who says that?
Who says that?

464
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,531
"Fuck your moist pussy"?

465
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,158
Yeah, it sounds bad now
when you repeat it.

466
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,244
l'm gonna go inside...

467
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,454
- ...where l live with my husband.
- Yeah.

468
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,082
Okay? But thanks...

469
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,585
...for your creepy version of honesty.

470
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,381
l'm sorry.

471
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,301
What, did l--? Did l do something?

472
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,929
No, no. lt's....

473
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,558
We don't talk.

474
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,770
Well, we used to.

475
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:34,984
Yeah, but now you just come home
and go to the meetings.

476
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,279
- By the time you get back, l'm just--
- Kind of drunk?

477
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,449
No, l was just--
l was gonna say tired.

478
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,618
l'm....

479
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,913
l have some things
l have to do this weekend...

480
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,876
...and l think l'm gonna go up
to Lake Arrowhead.

481
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,797
To see your mom?

482
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,676
Why?

483
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,304
Do l need a reason?

484
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,681
With your mom?

485
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,516
Kind of.

486
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,393
Yeah.

487
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,773
- ls this the amends step?
- No.

488
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,236
Well, then why are you going?

489
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,656
l just....

490
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:26,327
We send her checks.

491
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,622
But we don't see her.
l mean, it feels like....

492
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,500
lt feels like l'm paying her
not to be in my life.

493
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:39,757
And l just think it would be nice
to go and see her.

494
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,677
Jenny said it would be a good idea.

495
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,181
- What?
- Nothing.

496
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,186
Now, do you do everything
your sponsor tells you to do?

497
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,939
- No.
- No?

498
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,025
What, you think l can't think
for myself?

499
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,611
Of course.

500
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,280
lt's just, you know...

501
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:09,495
...you haven't seen your mom
in a long damn time.

502
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,873
And you didn't listen to me
when l suggested...

503
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,376
...that we go visit her, so....

504
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,963
- Baby, l listen to you. l do.
- Yeah.

505
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,216
lt's just this feels like the right time.

506
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:26,762
You know, just with everything
that l'm going through, the changes.

507
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,348
Yeah.

508
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,019
l get it.

509
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,900
Well, do you think
l could come with you?

510
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,777
lf you come--

511
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,571
- Don't take this the wrong way.
- What?

512
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,742
--l would prefer it if you didn't drink.

513
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,110
Katie.

514
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,778
Hey.

515
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,447
What are you doing here?

516
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,906
l left you a message.

517
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:32,411
Oh, honey, l don't listen to that.

518
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,041
Hey there, Charlie. How are you?

519
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,959
Hey, Rochelle.

520
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,337
Whoa, this is a surprise.

521
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,884
l can't believe the two of you
came to visit. Hell has frozen over.

522
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,510
Come on.

523
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,139
This calls for a celebration.

524
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:56,310
Let's have some Bloody Marys.
Come on in.

525
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,981
Water's fine for me, Mom.

526
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,154
You wouldn't believe
how the neighborhood's changed.

527
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,866
When Mr. Baker passed away
and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home...

528
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,327
...the people that moved in:

529
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,289
There you go. Here, darling.

530
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,500
lf you ask me, it's a meth house.

531
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:24,546
They got these weird little 5-year-old
twins that are playing in the front yard.

532
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,924
But l'm pretty sure they're lookouts.

533
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,884
That's pretty wild, Mom.

534
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,511
Right?

535
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,972
What's the matter, honey?
You think l forgot how to mix them?

536
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,767
Oh, it's just l asked for water.

537
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,355
Please. No means yes where l'm from.
Am l right or am l right?

538
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:46,193
Well, that's kind of
why l came up here, so....

539
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,195
Yeah.

540
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,782
l stopped drinking.

541
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,871
- Okay.
- l did. l really-- l really did.

542
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,873
You bet.

543
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,542
Oh, are you pregnant?

544
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,335
- Mom.
- How exciting.

545
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,003
l'm gonna be a grandma.

546
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,549
Don't believe that thing about
not drinking when you're pregnant.

547
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,885
l mean, l drank plenty with Katie
when l was pregnant.

548
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,346
Mom, l'm not pregnant.

549
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,308
All right?
l stopped because l needed a break.

550
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,228
Well, good, honey, good.

551
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:25,149
- We'll see how long it lasts.
- Well, it's lasted a while.

552
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,654
You picked a good partner
for this little adventure.

553
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,739
Well, l'm not drinking--

554
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,617
Oh, Charlie, drink if you want, okay?

555
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,744
He didn't stop. l stopped.

556
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,330
l stopped for me.

557
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,709
And l'm going to 12-step meetings.

558
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,170
Oh, God, Assholes Anonymous.

559
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,966
Katie's father went to those meetings
a few years after we got married.

560
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,843
Dried up, left us.

561
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,470
You can see how well
that worked out for me.

562
00:41:55,638 --> 00:42:00,225
l raised her all by myself in this palace
while he was off in Florida...

563
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,937
...with his shiny new wife and kids,
the son of a bitch.

564
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,358
Be careful.

565
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,945
They can change, you know.

566
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,200
God, l kind of hoped
you'd be happy for me, Mom.

567
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,785
l am, honey, really.

568
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,124
Okay. l'm not being a good hostess.

569
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,920
l'll microwave you your favorite.

570
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,344
Do you wanna change the channel
or do you like these hairdos?

571
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,971
- Stick with hairdos.
- Oh, yeah.

572
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,100
- l had that.
- Did you really?

573
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,062
lt was not quite that big,
but it was pretty big.

574
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,492
Me and my Mom used to come here
to Santa's Village...

575
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,327
...every year around Christmas.

576
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,038
lt's like the one thing
we did together...

577
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,290
...that was actually fun.

578
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,213
Big-ass candy cane.

579
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,009
When you were younger,
did you ever just, like, sneak away...

580
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,429
...with young boys
and, you know, hook up with them...

581
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,932
- ...in the woods?
- What?

582
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,557
Surprise!

583
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,727
Oh, my God,
look at that expression.

584
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,563
Don't be mad.
l thought this would be good for you.

585
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,649
Listen, everybody here
wants to share in your happiness.

586
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,609
Right, everybody?

587
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,572
- This is-- You shouldn't have, really.
- We did.

588
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,575
Okay.

589
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,453
This is from-- This is from Rhonda.

590
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,372
Okay, Rhonda,
let's see what we got.

591
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,500
- Oh, Sad lsn't Bad.
- Another one of these.

592
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,546
- Oh, it's the same.
- Oh, hundred percent adorable.

593
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,424
Really pretty, really pretty bag.

594
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,760
Another cute-- Look.

595
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,553
Thank you, Angie.

596
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:45,140
That is just too cute.

597
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,893
lt's so moist.

598
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,614
Kate.

599
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,619
- Kate.
- What?

600
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,455
Listen, l am so, so sorry.

601
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,124
You have no idea
how much this is eating me up.

602
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,210
Look, l'm flattered, okay?

603
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:16,797
l'm flattered that you have feelings
for me, all right?

604
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,092
- But l'm married.
- l know.

605
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,886
Sorry.
l'll apologize to your husband--

606
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,473
No, no, no. lt's fine. l didn't tell him.

607
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,809
Just-- You can't--

608
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,896
You can't say that to a girl, ever.

609
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,982
Really, consider it a rule of thumb,
all right?

610
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,275
Okay.

611
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,570
Because l'm sure one day
you're gonna meet a nice...

612
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,781
...available lady.

613
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,493
But God, if you ever...

614
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,747
...ever say...to her...

615
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,334
...you will never ever, ever, ever see
that part of her body.

616
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,462
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

617
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,341
Thank you.

618
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,265
l feel like this was a really good talk.

619
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,269
That cake was really moist.

620
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,149
See you later.

621
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,154
No, l'm not a terrible....

622
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,577
You don't wanna get married?

623
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,579
No, fuck that, man.

624
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,126
- Hey.
- Hey.

625
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,794
What's up?

626
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,298
l saw you guys found the cake
Jenny and l baked.

627
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,593
Thanks. lt was so good, man.
You should go get a slice.

628
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,179
l just thought
we could all eat it together.

629
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,391
Oh, l didn't think about that, babe.
l'm sorry.

630
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,685
- ldiot.
- But, l mean...?

631
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,190
- Was it good?
- lt was good.

632
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,318
- lt was good.
- Good.

633
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,903
lt was really good.

634
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,405
Plenty of tequila
to make up for the cake.

635
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,575
Dude, you know, she doesn't--
Come on, man, she's in AA.

636
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,619
She hasn't drank in, like, forever.

637
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,204
- Right?
- That sucks.

638
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,914
Do you still smoke weed?

639
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,250
l was never really
a big weed smoker, so, no.

640
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,085
Not weed, but...

641
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,924
...crack.
He told me you smoked crack.

642
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,009
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

643
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,386
- You told me she smoked.
- You smoke crack?

644
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,766
No, no, my wife doesn't smoke crack.

645
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,935
l'm sorry, dude. No, look, she only--

646
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,772
You've only smoked it once, right?
l'm not saying you're a crackhead.

647
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,817
Thanks, Charlie.

648
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,281
- Babe.
- That was a secret, wasn't it?

649
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,077
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l was drunk.

650
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:56,623
Great. How about you guys just go
ahead and go on to the bar, all right?

651
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,500
- No.
- Get off me.

652
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,461
- Don't touch me. Don't--
- Hey.

653
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,798
Are you sure you don't want
to just come with me?

654
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:08,468
No! l don't-- l'm not going.
Get off of me.

655
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,720
You don't have to drink.

656
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,935
l'm sure there's near beer
or something. lt'll be-- lt'll be fun.

657
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,478
l'm staying in.

658
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,188
- Oh, you're staying in.
- Yeah.

659
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,608
Oh, you're staying in.
That sounds fun.

660
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:27,279
Bye. Okay, you're going.

661
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,823
- Goodbye.
- Just one.

662
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,116
Babe, come on.

663
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:32,659
Stop.

664
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,328
Just go, okay?

665
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,414
Just go.

666
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,124
l love you.

667
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,752
Okay.

668
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,925
Three plus four is...?

669
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,302
- Yes?
- Seven.

670
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:54,139
Nice. Three plus five is...?

671
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,975
Mrs. Hannah,
shouldn't you be more fatter?

672
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,351
What?

673
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,188
Because of the baby.
My mom got real fat.

674
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:09,029
Well, the correct way
to ask that question would be:

675
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,156
"Shouldn't you be fatter?"

676
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:15,702
So when you guys are
old and wise second graders...

677
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,371
...you will start learning
about multiplication.

678
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:23,043
Mrs. Hannah,
shouldn't you be fatter?

679
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,590
Well...

680
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,470
...l'm not gonna have a baby.

681
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,351
Okay, look. Look, l was pregnant...

682
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:44,397
...and then it turned out it just--
lt wasn't my time, l suppose, and--

683
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:49,027
Mrs. Hannah, did you kill the baby?

684
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,862
What?

685
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,239
No, no. No, of course not.

686
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,034
My mom said if you kill a baby,
you go to hell.

687
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,287
And you can't even go to church
to ask God for forgiveness.

688
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,539
Mrs. Hannah, are you going to hell?

689
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,168
No. l did not kill my baby, and--

690
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,337
We should not be talking about this.

691
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,006
Sometimes
when a woman is pregnant...

692
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,385
...she stops being pregnant
before it's even a baby.

693
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,595
She stops being pregnant, okay?

694
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:19,933
- Because a doctor murders it.
- No, not because a doctor murders it.

695
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,145
Okay.

696
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,940
lt's called a miscarriage.

697
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,109
And that means....

698
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,570
lt wasn't my plan.

699
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,782
lt's just what happened, okay?

700
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,078
So does anybody
have other questions for me?

701
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,959
All right, let's just get back
to subtraction and addition...

702
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,212
...and all that great stuff.

703
00:50:54,927 --> 00:51:01,641
l gotta say, this is most likely
the most boring meal...

704
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:06,730
...in the history of our planet, so....

705
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,982
That's exciting.

706
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,944
Right? We should celebrate.

707
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,157
Who are you texting?

708
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,325
Jenny.

709
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,995
Oh, she's like a parole officer, huh?

710
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,457
- She's my sponsor.
- Yeah.

711
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:31,004
l'm just happy to know
that every little fuck-up l make...

712
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:35,175
...is gonna become a topic
of conversation with some girl...

713
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,011
...that l don't even know.

714
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,432
Okay, baby...

715
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,934
...how was your day?

716
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,062
l just finished up some work.

717
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,483
And then l met up with Owen...

718
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,528
...and watched the game...

719
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,781
...turned in my story.

720
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,366
You do anything special?

721
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,286
Well...

722
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,206
...l lied to my class again.

723
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,208
l told them l had a miscarriage.

724
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,337
- lt's not funny.
- No, it's--

725
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:13,922
l mean, it's funny.

726
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,718
You know, telling fucked-up things
to kids is always funny.

727
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,514
- You know, in a fucked-up kind of way.
- Well, great.

728
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,099
l'm just glad we're not
actually having a baby.

729
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,976
Really, really glad.

730
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,395
Come on, Kate.

731
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,899
lt's not that big of a deal.

732
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,694
lt's not nothing.
l lied to little kids and to my boss...

733
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,656
...because l can't take responsibility
for my actions.

734
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:43,159
All right, well, you know,
why don't you do this?

735
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,538
Why don't you go up to the principal
and say:

736
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,332
"You know what?
l never actually was pregnant.

737
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,917
And the reason l puked...

738
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:55,255
...was because l was up all night
drinking."

739
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,424
Would that make you feel better
about yourself?

740
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,719
l've thought about it
and l think that it would--

741
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:07,183
lt would make me feel a lot better
about myself. Yeah.

742
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:11,062
Do it then, you know. Do it.

743
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,817
l mean, l guess you don't need a job.
We can just hang out...

744
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,444
...and make out all the time.

745
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,447
- lt'd be awesome.
- No.

746
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,242
God, of course l don't need a job,
right?

747
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,121
l could just stay at home, like you,
all day...

748
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:33,084
- ...and never do anything responsible.
- l don't ever do anything responsible?

749
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:38,715
Really? What about, l don't know,
buying this house that we live in?

750
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,675
Charlie.

751
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,847
Having rich parents
doesn't make you responsible, okay?

752
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,975
ln fact, l think it's done the opposite.

753
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:53,688
Oh, l'm sorry for having a family
that supports us.

754
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,065
You know,
and not the other way around.

755
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,484
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

756
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:04,657
l'm just saying that you can't be
mad at me for having a family...

757
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,452
...that has helped us out.

758
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:11,831
You know, you should be grateful
that we don't have to struggle.

759
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:15,710
Struggle? l wouldn't care
if we had to struggle with money...

760
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,047
...because l have struggled
with money my whole life.

761
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,175
l would rather worry
where my next meal is coming from...

762
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,093
...than in some drunken stupor...

763
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,055
...marry a man who just wants to party
and meet bands.

764
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,350
- What are you talking about?
- About you being a baby!

765
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,186
A selfish baby!

766
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,688
- You know what?
- What?

767
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,525
l fucking hate AA!

768
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,531
lt's just-- lt's turned you into a bitch.

769
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:50,203
A brainwashed bitch.

770
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:55,875
Well, at least l'm not drunk
all the time.

771
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,550
Everything is so fucked up
right now.

772
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,388
l don't feel normal.

773
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,975
Well, you're not normal.

774
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,643
Most of us aren't.

775
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,480
Okay, not everything is connected
to being an alcoholic.

776
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,068
l'm not just talking about alcoholics.

777
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,404
People are fucking weird.

778
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,741
We all have shit that we carry in our
heads that doesn't make any sense.

779
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:32,412
At least alcoholics have the tools
to work through it.

780
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,791
Steps.

781
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,043
And talking...

782
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,172
...listening, crying.

783
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,967
Yeah, l have the crying part
all worked out.

784
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,344
l know, right?

785
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,432
l think my first year...

786
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,103
...l must have cried tears
l'd been saving since l was like 8.

787
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:03,943
lt's hard to live your life honestly,
you know?

788
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,279
Yeah.

789
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:13,119
l received a call
from a very upset parent and....

790
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,956
Well, that's actually...

791
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,459
...how l found out.

792
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:24,464
l was surprised that you didn't feel
that you could come to me.

793
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:29,635
One of the kids asked me why l wasn't
getting fat and then another one...

794
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,263
- ...asked me if l killed my baby.
- Gosh.

795
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,639
- l just froze.
- Oh, no.

796
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,975
Oh, my God, well....

797
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:39,228
l'm so sorry
that you had to go through that.

798
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,690
That must have been very painful
for you.

799
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,152
Oh, my God, l feel awful.

800
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,072
l know this is a hard time,
you have to keep going.

801
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,406
You have to be strong.

802
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,825
l feel so awful.
l can't keep doing this.

803
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,412
lf you wanna take a day off,
maybe through the weekend.

804
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,456
No, l need to be honest with you.

805
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,502
Okay.

806
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,384
Principal Barnes...

807
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,639
...l was never pregnant.

808
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,520
But you vomited in class.

809
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,648
l know. l lied. l lied to you.

810
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,192
l lied to the class.

811
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,112
l lied because l was scared...

812
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,032
...and when that happened,
l panicked.

813
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,992
- The truth...
- Oh, my God, Kate.

814
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,038
...is something
that's really hard for....

815
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,165
Are you really sick?

816
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,876
No. No.

817
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,089
What is it?

818
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,385
l'm an alcoholic.

819
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,727
You're--? You're an alcoholic?

820
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:12,071
l'm an alcoholic, but l'm working on it.
l'm doing the steps and--

821
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:16,534
When that happened, the night before,
l had been out drinking...

822
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,246
...and l wasn't feeling too well.

823
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,248
And so you--

824
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:26,377
You vomited in front of children...

825
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,088
...because you were hung over?

826
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,007
Yes.

827
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:34,844
And then you lied to them
and told them that you were pregnant.

828
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,680
Well, one of the kids asked me
if l was pregnant...

829
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,516
...and, yes,
it just sort of fell out of my mouth.

830
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:44,520
Oh, naturally, of course.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

831
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,816
l-- l'm not--

832
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:53,196
l don't even know
what to say, Kate. l'm--

833
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,451
This is sickening.
l'm extremely disappointed in you.

834
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:03,039
l'm really sorry. l've been wanting
to tell you the truth for a long time.

835
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,125
Okay? Honesty is something
really important to me now...

836
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:10,129
...and l am going to meetings
and l have a sponsor--

837
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,298
Do you know what you've done?

838
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:17,929
Do you realize
how humiliating this is?

839
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,598
What you've done...

840
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,309
...is completely...

841
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,436
...and utterly irresponsible.

842
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:30,233
And l'm afraid that l can't have you
here at this school any longer.

843
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,359
What do you need?

844
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,488
Whiskey.

845
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,991
Double.

846
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,393
Can l get another one?

847
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,061
Sure.

848
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,272
Kate?

849
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,941
Kate, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

850
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,495
Oh, you gotta hear this hooked up
to the speakers.

851
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,538
lt's insane.

852
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,086
What happened to you?

853
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,798
l'm drunk!

854
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,592
l'm drunk.

855
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,428
- And guess what. l'm fired.
- Oh, no.

856
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,472
l'm fired.

857
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:11,685
Hey, say, baby,
have we got any drinks in the house?

858
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,272
You know, there's some soda.

859
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,316
Hey, babe, l can make some coffee.

860
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,611
Oh, don't be cute with me.
You know what l mean.

861
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:27,660
So you're not gonna do
the AA thing anymore, huh?

862
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,371
Baby, what gave that away, huh?

863
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,249
How did you know?

864
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,503
Oh, baby.

865
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,588
Hey, baby, come on.

866
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,800
Baby, let's do some shots.
Come on.

867
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:46,137
Let's do some shots.

868
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,847
What's going on?

869
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:53,060
Oh, l am celebrating.
What the fuck does it look like?

870
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,937
Hey.

871
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,525
So, what, are you gonna be
a little girl? You gonna be a girl?

872
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:02,361
Or are you gonna drink with me?

873
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,073
l don't think this is a good idea, baby.

874
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,034
Having a beer or something
is one thing...

875
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:13,789
...but l think you really may have
a problem, babe.

876
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,751
Well, thank you, baby.
Thank you so much...

877
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,881
...you know, for, like,
being there for me...

878
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:26,927
...when l was trying to get sober.

879
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,723
Hey, look. Hey, baby, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, l didn't realize.

880
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,600
You didn't realize?

881
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,394
Oh, yeah, you didn't realize.
You know why?

882
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,731
Because you don't fucking care
about me.

883
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,441
What are you talking about?

884
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:43,235
Hey, of course l care about you.

885
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,613
- l love you. l love you.
- l love you.

886
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,240
l love you, but you know what?

887
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,785
Love is the easy part.
Did you know that?

888
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,789
lt's the rest of this shit that's hard.

889
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,250
- Hey.
- Come on.

890
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,086
- Wait.
- Take off your pants. Come on, baby.

891
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,880
Come on, let's go.

892
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,132
Come on, Charlie.

893
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,135
- You should get some sleep.
- No, l don't wanna sleep.

894
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:10,554
l don't wanna sleep. l wanna fuck.
Come on.

895
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,432
- Hey, please. Please, will you just--?
- Come on.

896
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,934
Please.

897
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,311
l don't wanna sleep. l wanna fuck.
Come on.

898
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,897
Babe. Babe, just--
This is weird, okay?

899
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:24,026
- Just stop.
- Be a man and fuck your wife!

900
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:28,447
No. Jesus,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

901
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:33,285
What the fuck is wrong with me?

902
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,580
Nothing's wrong with me.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

903
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:40,501
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You know what? Because l try hard.

904
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:41,961
No, Kate.

905
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,797
- Kate, l need you to just--
- What about me?

906
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:48,259
What do l need, Charlie?
Because l can't--

907
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,720
l can't drink
because l'm crazy or something...

908
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,642
...and l can't stay sober
because of you.

909
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,478
You're blaming other people
for your problems.

910
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:04,316
Go.

911
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:17,413
l can't be sober and be with you.

912
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,628
At this meeting, we give cakes
to celebrate sober birthdays.

913
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,924
We have one birthday tonight for Kate,
for one year.

914
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,468
Jenny and Dave
are gonna give her the cake.

915
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,611
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

916
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,529
l'm so proud of you.

917
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,365
- Thank you.
- Oh, honey.

918
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,410
- You deserve this.
- Yeah.

919
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,664
Hi. Kate, alcoholic.

920
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,584
Hi, Kate.

921
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:08,130
One of the things l've heard is that...

922
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,967
...your best day drinking
is worse than your worst day sober.

923
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:16,055
Yeah, it's not true. lt's not true.
l mean, l had....

924
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,516
l had some amazing times
drinking and laughing...

925
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,228
...and just feeling
like the most adorable...

926
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,774
...charming girl in the world.

927
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,193
And l was adorable. l was.

928
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:32,196
l mean, l would piss my pants
and l was still cute.

929
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:37,951
Well, l was in North Carolina,
Durham, playing baseball.

930
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,828
l was-- l was getting hot.

931
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,414
And that's when l met--

932
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,750
When l met my girl,
my buddy Crash, here.

933
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,419
- Crash?
- Sent him to single-A ball...

934
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,588
...to teach me how to carry myself...

935
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,839
- ...as a pro.
- Yeah.

936
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,466
- Yeah.
- Show you the ropes.

937
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,009
- Show me the ropes.
- Yeah.

938
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,387
Me and him both fell
for the same woman.

939
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,889
- Classic.
- ln the end...

940
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,434
- ...he won it. He took it.
- God.

941
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,603
That's a crazy way to meet.

942
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,438
- Yeah, l know. lt is.
- Yeah.

943
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,650
lt's really similar
to a very famous movie.

944
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,527
- Probably not.
- Yeah.

945
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:16,782
When l first tried getting sober,
l figured that as long as l didn't drink...

946
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:21,787
...everything else would just
sort of magically work itself out.

947
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,498
But it didn't.

948
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,793
My marriage fell apart.

949
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,963
l lost my job.

950
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,300
And that shit happened sober.
You know, l didn't sign up for that.

951
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:39,138
l didn't read about that
in some pamphlet, you know.

952
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:45,519
Another pretty shitty slogan
l've heard is...

953
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:48,480
...when you're sober for a bit
and you drink again...

954
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:53,068
...the disease waits for you
and picks up where you left off.

955
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,904
l'm gonna say it. l hate slogans.

956
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,866
l think they sound
like bumper stickers.

957
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,496
But that one, for me,
was pretty damn true, you know?

958
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,875
When l drink...

959
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:11,754
...l become a completely
different person.

960
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,674
And that person
is a pretty big asshole.

961
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:20,095
Unless you wanna buy me drinks or
give me drugs, and then l'm awesome.

962
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,766
l'm sorry.

963
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:29,062
You seem like a lovely girl, it's just....

964
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,732
You have....

965
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,568
You have really pretty hands.

966
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,030
And you have really nice hair.

967
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,865
Thank you.

968
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,452
Yeah. l just....

969
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,373
l just-- l think l'm gonna go to the....

970
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,293
No, no, no. l'm just gonna--

971
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:54,379
Hey, l'm just gonna get out.
l'm gonna get out of here.

972
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,840
Hey, do you want a ride home?
l can....

973
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:02,679
My life is a lot different now
than it was a year ago.

974
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,225
l live alone.

975
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,729
l'm bored a lot more.

976
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,566
l have a job that pays a lot less.

977
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:20,739
But l'm so grateful...

978
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,451
...for the friends
that l've made in here...

979
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,247
...who took the time to help me
and just to give a shit about me.

980
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,797
And there are people
that used to be in my life...

981
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,592
...who l miss a lot.

982
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,302
But....

983
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,180
Yeah, l'm so thankful.

984
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,349
l'm so thankful...

985
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,436
...for this boring new life of mine.

986
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,065
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

987
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,816
Hey. How you doing?

988
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,236
Long time, no speak.

989
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:48,619
So l got into a little bit of trouble.

990
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,497
Drunk in public on a bicycle.

991
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,001
Yeah.

992
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,219
- Hey.
- Hey.

993
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:10,849
So you miss our house?

994
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:13,018
Yeah, sometimes.

995
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,355
You miss me?

996
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,569
Sometimes.

997
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,785
l'm a year sober.

998
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,037
Really?

999
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,664
Yeah.

1000
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,339
- They gave you this?
- Yeah.

1001
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,050
A couple days ago. Tuesday.

1002
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,390
Congratulations.

1003
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,851
lt's, really, really....

1004
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,937
lt's great.

1005
01:11:58,398 --> 01:11:59,856
l mean it.

1006
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,324
So are you dating anyone?

1007
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,284
Charlie.

1008
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:12,577
Are you?

1009
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,001
l just keep thinking how l....

1010
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,215
l wish l was meeting you
for the first time...

1011
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,135
...in a bar.

1012
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,513
And l didn't have any
of this baggage, and....

1013
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:37,936
And l could buy you a drink
and flirt with you all night.

1014
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,827
Have you been playing a lot?

1015
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,954
l haven't played in over a year.

1016
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,457
Then how are you beating me so bad?

1017
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,334
l don't know. lnnate talent?

1018
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,546
l haven't met anyone
vaguely interesting...

1019
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,215
...since we separated.

1020
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:13,305
How about we just stick to the game,
okay?

1021
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,475
- l've been masturbating a lot.
- Charlie.

1022
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,602
l miss you.

1023
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,812
Just stop.

1024
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,067
Okay. Fine.

1025
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,491
You could've been killed, you know.

1026
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,826
What?

1027
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,246
Riding your bike drunk.

1028
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,332
l worry about you.

1029
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,793
Yeah. Well, that's understandable...

1030
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,964
...because l used to worry about you
all the time, but....

1031
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,467
You know, now l don't have to.

1032
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,011
Because you're doing okay.

1033
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,847
And that makes me happy...

1034
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,684
...even though you're better off
without me.

1035
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:03,647
Just glad that you're doing well.

1036
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:12,364
Hey, would you move back in
if l came to meetings?

1037
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:17,369
You have to do that for you.
You can't....

1038
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,704
You can't do it to make me happy.

1039
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,540
Yeah, but would you?

1040
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,379
l'm not moving back in, Charlie.

1041
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:36,638
Can l at least
just take you out on a date?

1042
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:43,979
Okay.

1043
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,274
Last question.

1044
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,320
Can we just play one more game?

1045
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,824
You're kicking my ass
and it's embarrassing...

1046
01:14:55,992 --> 01:15:00,579
...and l would like to have a chance
to redeem myself.

1047
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,167
Please?
