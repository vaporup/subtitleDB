1
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:29,306
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2...

2
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,777
Hui, any plans after discharge
next week?

3
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,047
What? The first thing is
to fix that batch

4
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,185
Because of it, I've had to suffer for 5 years

5
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:46,127
Right. Let's have a good time, when we dig it out

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,462
Would you care to eat?

7
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,429
No, sir

8
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,002
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2...

9
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,774
Get going. Don't take yourself for big brother

10
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,166
The same food again

11
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,202
That should be donated to Ethiopia

12
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,175
Even they wouldn't care for it

13
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:33,971
Don't eat then

14
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:38,147
Even if I fast now,
I won't die in a week

15
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:42,747
Eat

16
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:51,625
Brother Sheng, brother Sheng

17
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:52,890
What is it?

18
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,529
When you check out next week

19
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,892
please tell my wife to see me

20
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,100
Okay, give me your address

21
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,003
To see you? Your wife has run away

22
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,236
Damn you. How do you know?

23
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,567
Your miserable looks show it

24
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:05,734
Hey, my food

25
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,277
They've taken it away

26
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:09,408
Who's taken away my food

27
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,944
It has been donated to Ethiopia

28
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,414
They've got so much food.
They must've taken mine

29
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,458
Don't bully us because you're permanent

30
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:20,920
Who did bully my friend

31
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,383
It's me, Piao

32
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:25,730
The doctor says I have malnutrition

33
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:26,932
Right, right

34
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:33,799
Forget it. It's been given to Ethiopia

35
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:37,799
Even the starving ones there won't care for it

36
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:38,866
Hit my friend

37
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,982
Stop, everybody! Stop

38
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:05,698
Sheng, come and lend a hand

39
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,144
Stop! Stop

40
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:20,851
All crouch down here

41
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,521
Crouch down, crouch down

42
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:28,184
Stop!

43
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,953
One more month's sentence for fighting

44
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:31,788
One more month

45
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,333
We don't even mind to be permanent here

46
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:34,992
You don't mind

47
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,267
Friend, you've dropped something

48
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:48,140
Thanks, thanks

49
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:49,374
How careless

50
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,824
Sorry, sorry

51
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,654
It's alright

52
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:04,524
It's alright

53
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:06,487
Do you need my help

54
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,257
For such heavy work I can do it myself

55
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:13,195
Sir

56
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,231
Is this purse yours

57
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,639
Thank you

58
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,972
Don't mention it

59
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,307
Take this

60
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:27,177
Sorry

61
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:32,557
An honest young man like you is rare

62
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:33,820
You're right

63
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:36,554
Such heavy work is unworthy of you

64
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:38,461
I don't mind

65
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:41,858
How about joining my Tourist Agency

66
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:42,729
Can I cope

67
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:43,267
Yes

68
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,703
Thank you, boss

69
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,637
Don't mention it. Excuse me

70
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,239
Thank you, boss

71
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,103
Bastard

72
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:31,442
My leg hurts

73
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:37,082
It hurts badly and is getting numb

74
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,519
Of course, it's mine

75
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:46,158
I've difficulty in breathing.
My heart's going to stop beating

76
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,662
Artificial respiration at once

77
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,212
Not this way. Hold me and
massage my muscles

78
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:03,443
How

79
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:04,443
I'll show you

80
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,980
Put your hands on my neck. 1, 2, 3

81
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:14,752
Let us try

82
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:17,693
Massage, massage

83
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:25,460
I feel good at the back

84
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:28,602
What has it to do with your back

85
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:30,533
You won't understand

86
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:37,948
Why didn't you warn me

87
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,979
You have no more breathing trouble

88
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,685
If you do, I'll take you to Casualty

89
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:42,917
No need, no need

90
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,115
Better take you home

91
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,126
Okay

92
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,158
Sorry, I've something urgent to do

93
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:53,728
What is it?

94
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,059
To talk business

95
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,360
But I worry about you

96
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,031
Give me your address.
I'll see you when I can

97
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:04,235
Are you serious

98
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,510
I live at No. 3 fat Kwong Street,
3rd floor

99
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:09,876
If I happen to be out

100
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:12,610
come to Chuan Chi Teahouse to see me

101
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:14,850
Are you sure you're alright

102
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:15,486
Yes

103
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:16,020
Goodbye

104
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,219
Goodbye. Be sure to see me

105
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,926
Good bye, goodbye

106
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,563
Detective work requires experience

107
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,199
First, fingerprints

108
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,003
Slender fingerprints mean you're pretty

109
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,606
Let's talk about this at dinner tonight

110
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,166
Do you have to talk about this at dinner

111
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:43,208
It's outdated to fool around during office

112
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:44,074
Yes, uncle

113
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,144
No, Director

114
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,074
Come in with me

115
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,189
What's so funny

116
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,463
Do you mean I'm clumsy

117
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,257
No, Uncle

118
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,057
No, Director

119
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,534
I knew you did it deliberately

120
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,433
Bastard, are you taking me for a moron

121
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,467
You knew I couldn't aim well

122
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,200
and you pretended to praise me

123
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,337
You've no judgment.
You can't be a private eye

124
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,276
Uncle, I only meant...

125
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:15,312
How long have you been here

126
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:17,308
One and half minutes

127
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,811
How long have you been
with that Detective Agency

128
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,252
Seven years

129
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:22,886
Seven years

130
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,821
Aren't you ashamed of sporting your books

131
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,592
No

132
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,225
It's a detective story

133
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,295
What have you learnt? Tailing?

134
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,293
No

135
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,089
Snapping

136
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,066
No

137
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:35,532
Eavesdropping

138
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,059
A little

139
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:37,864
Stealing

140
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:38,626
I dare not do it

141
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:39,962
What have you learnt then

142
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:41,097
English

143
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,572
Damn

144
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,401
If you're not my nephew, I should've fired you

145
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,173
How about the loot of Hang Pao Gold Shop

146
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,809
I've told Bonnie to investigate

147
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,243
Bonnie to investigate

148
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,442
When have you been promoted

149
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,915
Bonnie's new, you should work with her

150
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:55,919
I wanted to

151
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,984
But she insisted on acting alone

152
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:01,915
So she's quite smart

153
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,989
Commissioner, brother Kuang, want to see me

154
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,926
Yes. How's the Hang Pao Gold Shop's loot

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,661
I met one of the discharged robbers

156
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,068
That won't help

157
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,701
You must make friends with him

158
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,801
Most important of all, get his address

159
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,799
Stop acting for a while

160
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,079
Bonnie, don't worry.
A novice has difficulties. Take your time

161
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,212
Next time try to get acquainted with him

162
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,276
I've already got his address

163
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,183
Look, how efficient she is

164
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:38,490
Bonnie, don't you know I admire your efficiency

165
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:42,027
Let me stand you dinner to tell you my experience

166
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,531
This will be helpful to you

167
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,738
We can talk about it during office

168
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:51,737
What's so funny

169
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:54,539
It's alright now. Back to work

170
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,270
Yes

171
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,248
Hold it. Come back

172
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,843
Remember to give me a report every day

173
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,053
Note down carefully the characters

174
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:05,384
time and place of the happenings

175
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,788
That report is on the desk

176
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,117
Okay

177
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,189
This is the file

178
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,633
What do you mean by that? Feeling swell

179
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,797
Why are you dressed like that

180
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,404
To imitate Holmes

181
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,264
Take it off

182
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:29,871
Any new clues

183
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,142
Okay, I'll keep an eye on him at once

184
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,713
Listen, I'm going out to investigate

185
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:41,917
Work with Bonnie to get back the lost. Understand

186
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:16,726
How come

187
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,660
Impossible

188
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:23,226
Rocks? Why no trace of diamond at all

189
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,623
What? Why have you dug such a large hole?

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,136
Faster. We still have a lot of digging to do

191
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,444
Faster, faster

192
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:12,113
5143, 5144, 5148, push the wheels

193
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,276
Are you here on leave?

194
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,483
Coming

195
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,814
Harder. Chin Ta-chi is mad

196
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:19,816
Sure. Harder, or the wheels may turn back

197
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,187
Don't be lazy

198
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,722
Aren't we pushing now with all out strength

199
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:27,596
Sheng, damn you, you fought in jail
and got us involved

200
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,494
Push quickly. Don't relax

201
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:31,063
Let's endure for a few days

202
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,897
Sheng must be waiting for us with money

203
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,140
I endure it only for the sake of the future

204
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,206
When I go out, I must fly to

205
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,640
Pattaya to lap up the sunshine

206
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:43,576
Maniac, the sunshine's dazzling us here

207
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,884
It's okay here. Let's dig overthere

208
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:49,681
Over there

209
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:50,883
YES SIR

210
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:59,223
Don't be lazy. I'll be back soon

211
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:00,092
YES SIR

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,430
See how things are

213
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,197
Silk Road

214
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,168
Cheer up, cheer up

215
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,601
Sheng will get a Rolls Royce to pick us up

216
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:14,471
Level it first

217
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:17,944
How's the situation

218
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:18,981
Hold on

219
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,825
Hold on, hold on

220
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,221
Brother Hui

221
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:34,194
Come and help

222
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,497
Harder, hold it

223
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,896
Sheung, have you dug them out

224
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,164
Why? Have you disposed of them

225
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,242
Take gold, not cash to avoid counterfeits

226
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,168
Right, take gold

227
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,469
I've dug them out

228
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,274
Splendid

229
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,505
How much shall we get each

230
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,139
At least $3 million, right

231
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,375
$3 million

232
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,218
I've dug them out

233
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,017
But they've all turned into rocks

234
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,352
Sheng, you're tops

235
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:01,583
You really have a sense of humour

236
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:05,227
I'm serious

237
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:06,264
I'm not easygoing

238
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:07,320
Stop joking

239
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,995
I'm serious

240
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,466
How dare you make fun of me

241
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,829
They're there. Show them

242
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,298
They've really turned into rocks

243
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:13,963
Hell with you

244
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:16,869
I can't hold on

245
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:17,431
Get out ofhere

246
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:28,515
Sheng

247
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,751
Sheng, have you swallowed up my share

248
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,086
No, no

249
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:35,454
Follow him

250
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:40,590
Stop, stop

251
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:47,028
Let's go

252
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,918
Brother Hui, brother Hui

253
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:05,951
Where's Piao

254
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,048
I'm down below

255
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,260
I won't forgive you

256
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,735
Hello, whom you want to speak to

257
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,038
Is Sheng in please

258
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,242
Who's speaking

259
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,242
I'm Bonnie

260
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,239
Bonnie, speaking

261
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:34,581
Sheng, sorry for that accident.
Are you alright

262
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,619
Yes, but my back still aches

263
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:39,888
Can you come out to dine

264
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,016
I'd like to host steak dinner for you

265
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,364
Yes, the doctor wants me
to walk and eat more

266
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:52,632
Splendid. See you at the Flagpole in 30 minutes

267
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:53,529
Okay

268
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,739
I can escape after dinner

269
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,075
Help! I'll kill you

270
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:21,857
Right. Sheng lives in here, go in

271
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,028
What are you doing? Were's Sheng

272
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:03,800
How careless

273
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,666
Bitch, are you blind

274
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,068
She's charming. Let's rape her before killing

275
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:08,730
Okay

276
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,333
Will it work

277
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,039
Come on, come on

278
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:17,880
Go away

279
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:22,050
Want to test me

280
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:43,867
Bitch

281
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:49,510
What's wrong

282
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,251
Impossible. Lighter

283
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:03,923
It's wet, damn it

284
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:05,591
I'll try again

285
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:06,992
Take a bath first

286
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:08,758
Take a bath

287
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:12,967
Let me

288
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:22,270
Strip

289
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:23,341
She's shapely

290
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:24,143
Sure

291
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:25,210
Strip

292
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,686
Watch Enjoy Yourself Tonight

293
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,251
Enjoy Yourself Tonight

294
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,049
How can a blind person watch TV

295
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:32,612
Right

296
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,600
Miao-maio, come and see
Enjoy Yourself Tonight

297
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,470
Who's Miao-miao

298
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,240
Who cares

299
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:57,476
So it's a cat

300
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:00,916
Don't tease it

301
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,577
Come here, Miao-miao

302
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,451
It's more important to find it

303
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:25,900
I've found it

304
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,876
Help! I'll kill you, damn cockroach

305
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:31,409
You're not bad in acting

306
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:37,983
The gems are yours, the girl's mine

307
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,226
Small coins

308
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:47,662
Where are the diamonds

309
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:12,988
What an idiot,
I forgot to put on cologne

310
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:13,847
Go into hiding

311
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,956
Why is the door unlocked

312
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,461
I can't get the cologne without light

313
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:26,333
What a mess

314
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:27,928
Who is it

315
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,331
Your brothers of course

316
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,000
Sheng, hand over the diamonds

317
00:22:32,077 --> 00:22:33,544
or we'll be nasty

318
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,946
I really haven't got the diamonds

319
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:36,480
Don't lie

320
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:44,613
Where's that girl

321
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:48,750
Follow her

322
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:50,121
Don't! Piao's more important

323
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:55,790
The bill

324
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:57,063
$5, please

325
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,364
What will you have?

326
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:06,974
Milk with cream and egg

327
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,373
Brother Sheng

328
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,042
Brother Sheng

329
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:10,979
Chuan

330
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,174
Where have you been these years

331
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,344
I've had no news of you

332
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,451
I was in business overseas

333
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:21,650
Why didn't you write? I missed you

334
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,558
Mexico is a large country

335
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:27,227
I don't even know the Post Office there

336
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,859
Have you been there all these years

337
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:33,101
No, I've been to Bengal and
Moscow to talk business

338
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,470
That's most inconvenient then

339
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,367
No, one hour's flight will do

340
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,471
Bengal is in Asia and Moscow is in Europe

341
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,668
One hour's flight is incredible

342
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:51,981
Why don't you eat

343
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:53,616
I prefer to watch you eat

344
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:55,751
Let's eat together

345
00:23:58,897 --> 00:23:59,693
Is the food okay

346
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:01,230
Okay. Over...

347
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:06,226
Overthere we seldom tasted such good food

348
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,169
If you prefer, I'll cook for you everyday

349
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:14,267
No need. The food outside is better

350
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,377
So you have someone to cook for you

351
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:18,540
Don't get the wrong idea

352
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,813
I mean foreign foods in foreign restaurants

353
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,317
Let's go out to try them sometime

354
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,356
Come on, have some soup

355
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,025
Thank you

356
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:34,829
Sheng, let me do it for you

357
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:35,728
Okay

358
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,795
How's business lately

359
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:41,969
So so

360
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,340
How's your business in Mexico

361
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:47,438
Don't talk about it

362
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:50,546
Alright, if you prefer

363
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:54,916
I might as well tell you

364
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:55,842
How's it

365
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:00,656
It used to be okay

366
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,750
but recently we've had cash trouble

367
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,823
If we don't tide it over,
my years' effort

368
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:11,129
I'm going on 30

369
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,469
I decided to build up a career
to settle down, but

370
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,503
Have you got an objective

371
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,206
She was my childhood friend

372
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,604
But I know she looks down on me

373
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:27,740
Excuse me

374
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,565
Here's $10,000. Take it

375
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,395
If not enough, I'll borrow some for you

376
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,195
No need. I'll try to raise more myself

377
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,433
You took much time to save this. I...

378
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,940
Don't worry. We're friends

379
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,469
I wish you could succeed in your career

380
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,440
But somehow I can't understand

381
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:58,106
You've just been out of jail.
Why do you need so much money

382
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,273
How do you know that

383
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:01,642
Don't shilly-shally

384
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,319
Anyway, I'll lend you the money

385
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:05,419
Eat

386
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:16,025
Want to travel, sir?

387
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,901
Why not? Isn't yours a Tourist Agency

388
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:19,796
Yes, yes

389
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:20,927
Please come here. Come on

390
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:23,232
Please sit down

391
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,602
Where do you plan to go, sir

392
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,940
The farther the better

393
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:30,576
South Africa, Brazil -two tours next month

394
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:31,580
Next month? Sorry

395
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:33,848
What's the earliest flight to leave HK?

396
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:35,351
Earliest?

397
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,445
In 5 minutes. Cross the street to take it

398
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:38,145
What flight?

399
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,956
A helicopter to Kowloon

400
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:41,316
I don't mean that

401
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:42,825
I want to go abroad

402
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,659
It's now the boom season.
All flights are booked up

403
00:26:45,763 --> 00:26:48,231
Even to take a bath in Thailand,
you've to wait one week

404
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,863
One week? I'll be finished then

405
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:54,094
Can't you wait to take a bath

406
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,072
I am not going to have bath
but to find shelter

407
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:58,604
Spain is best then

408
00:26:58,676 --> 00:26:59,734
The cost of living there is low

409
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:04,546
The earliest flight for Paris
is the night after tomorrow

410
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:06,515
Thence you change flight for Spain

411
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:10,688
What's the earliest flight
for France, sir?

412
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:11,613
The night after tomorrow

413
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,316
He has been asking me the same question

414
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:15,516
So it's you

415
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,389
What a coincidence

416
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:17,750
Are you going to France

417
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:19,654
Yes, to visit my parents. And you

418
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,354
He hasn't made up his mind

419
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,366
I have. The night after tomorrow. And you

420
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:24,858
Okay

421
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:26,267
I'll go the night after tomorrow

422
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:27,201
I'll arrange that for you at once

423
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,002
The cheapest return ticket for Paris is $8,400

424
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:34,473
US$8,400

425
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:35,373
Lily, count them

426
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:35,969
Yes

427
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:36,713
Thank you

428
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,213
Don't mention it

429
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:41,878
I'm sorry about last time

430
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,182
Did I hurt you

431
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:50,316
It was only my fault

432
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,519
Why are you going to France

433
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:55,662
I...

434
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,758
To take shelter

435
00:27:57,235 --> 00:28:01,467
Nonsense. I go wandering. It's now the vogue

436
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,272
Reading is now the vogue

437
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:04,804
It makes no difference

438
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,410
Your receipts

439
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:09,246
The plane leaves at 10:30 p.m.
Day after tomorrow

440
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:11,110
Be at the airport before 9:30 p.m.

441
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:12,909
If you need any further info., ask me now

442
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:14,175
No

443
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:14,718
No, no

444
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:15,252
I must be off

445
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:16,180
Me, too

446
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:17,547
Thank you

447
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,149
Modern girls have no taste at all

448
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:30,157
Write me often when you get there

449
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:33,567
It must be snowing now. Wear more

450
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,840
Keep these 2 bottles of medicinal oil

451
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:39,937
Apply it when you feel sick

452
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:42,735
Even a doctor won't be much help

453
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,273
And turtle soup is nutritious

454
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,011
They say it's dry on the plane

455
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,047
Remember to drink it

456
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:51,285
What are you looking for

457
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,146
The counter

458
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:53,746
Counter

459
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:54,922
Bonnie

460
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,149
Where are you going

461
00:28:57,328 --> 00:28:57,919
So you're here

462
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:58,484
Yes

463
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,296
Have you completed the check-in

464
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,261
No, let's do it together

465
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:00,729
Okay

466
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,698
Sheng, you know her

467
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,235
We joined the same package tour

468
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,459
My cousin Chuan

469
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:07,463
Your name, please?

470
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,635
I'm Bonnie

471
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:10,737
The counter's overthere.
Let me hold it for you

472
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:11,502
No need

473
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:19,410
Show me the ticket. I'll fix your seat

474
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:19,882
Good

475
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:21,910
Do you know what seat she prefers

476
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:24,978
At most I'll give her my window seat

477
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:27,620
Sheng

478
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:28,420
What is it?

479
00:29:28,526 --> 00:29:33,327
When you fix everything there,
come back to pick me up

480
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:37,096
Don't put it this way,
people may misunderstand

481
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:38,628
I'm speaking the truth

482
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:41,002
Miss, what happened

483
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:43,335
Let me go and see

484
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,636
Please take a close look

485
00:29:49,814 --> 00:29:53,511
I've checked it, sir.
Your ticket is not confirmed, and invalid

486
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:56,444
Miss, I bought it at Chieh Tung too

487
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,613
So your situation is the same

488
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:00,418
What? It's hell

489
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,753
That Tourist Agency has cheated us

490
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,220
We've all been fooled. Let's contact them

491
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,855
That lady said our tickets are invalid

492
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,830
What then

493
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:13,431
Let's join them to take the matter up

494
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,095
Hurry up

495
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,741
The Chairman said the checks were paid in late

496
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,070
You'll get your pay tomorrow

497
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:20,633
Have tea, sir? Can we get our paid today?

498
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:21,643
Tomorrow, tomorrow

499
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:22,110
Tomorrow

500
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,212
Drink it tomorrow

501
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:25,677
There are clients. Keep busy

502
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,650
Who's the Manager here?

503
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:32,713
Tell him to come out.
We must settle with him

504
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,158
Excuse me

505
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:35,815
Miss, this is our Manager

506
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:37,323
What a hectic day

507
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:38,588
So it's you

508
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:41,423
Let's talk it over

509
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,591
We want a refund

510
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,892
The Airline says the tickets are invalid

511
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,103
There's no such flight

512
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:47,967
The Tourist Association says
it's not registered

513
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,097
Right, we want a refund

514
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:50,697
Quiet! Quiet!

515
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,874
Hurry up! Many people are here

516
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:56,838
Listen, I guarantee on my character that...

517
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:59,178
Bastard, you've taken away our money

518
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:01,584
Friends, I didn't cheat

519
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,314
Refund us the air tickets

520
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:05,116
Two

521
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:08,615
We'll break your bones if you don't

522
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:10,388
Buddy, be reasonable

523
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:13,019
I'm only an employee working for the Company

524
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,324
How dare you cheat me?

525
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,729
Right

526
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,164
Miss, when have I cheated you

527
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:20,170
He bought the airtickets

528
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,938
What do you mean?
Why scandalize me in public

529
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,597
I don't mean to

530
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:24,606
Bastard, go away

531
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,980
Open up, open up

532
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:39,647
So high

533
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,324
Retreat. I'm breaking it open

534
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,331
Break, break

535
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:51,892
Don't jostle, don't jostle

536
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:54,668
Bastard, stop

537
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:56,830
You can't get away

538
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:57,872
It doesn't concern me

539
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:00,669
Don't run, don't run

540
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:02,876
It's not my responsibility

541
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:03,838
Don't run

542
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:06,179
It really doesn't concern me

543
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,308
I must get hold of you

544
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:11,182
What's wrong? Don't do it here

545
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:14,747
You may ruin other people

546
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,824
Keep away

547
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:25,494
What's it

548
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:26,531
Nothing

549
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:27,495
Maniac

550
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:34,107
What's it

551
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,679
Do you know him

552
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:41,249
You're rich.
Make a call and you'll get $5000

553
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,950
Okay

554
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,019
Sheng, the Tourist Agency wants to see you

555
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:49,320
This is Chang Chin-sheng

556
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:52,456
You're Mr Chen. The money can be refunded. Pi Ching Bar

557
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,824
Okay, I'll be there

558
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:54,620
How's it

559
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,561
The money can be refunded tomorrow

560
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,065
When?

561
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:57,868
I forgot to ask him

562
00:32:58,302 --> 00:32:59,200
Listen

563
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,132
Hey, three o' clock, idiot

564
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:02,797
What?

565
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:03,464
Three o' clock

566
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,064
And

567
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:05,938
Idiot, he said

568
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,840
Idiot

569
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:12,748
Chuan, I can take care of it

570
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:14,177
Buy some underwear for me

571
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:15,913
I want you to go in with me

572
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,719
Be nice. We must fight for time

573
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:20,322
When I get the money,
I'll go to another Tourist Agency

574
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:20,982
Oh, no

575
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:21,956
Go ahead

576
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:27,629
Have you made reservations, sir

577
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:28,494
I'm looking for someone

578
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,156
Please go in

579
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,198
Sheng, here. Come up

580
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:36,631
Sheng

581
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:37,303
Sit down

582
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:41,070
The money

583
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:44,438
No hurry. Drink something.
I'll be the host

584
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:44,776
Thank you

585
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:45,440
Waitress

586
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:49,114
What will you have, sir

587
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:49,776
He wants

588
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:53,383
One mixed fruit fleecy, one French Toast

589
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:54,213
Good

590
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:56,886
You promised a refund

591
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:00,759
Yes, the cashier promised
to bring the money

592
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,759
I must call him. Wait here

593
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,028
There's a telephone overthere

594
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,534
This telephone stinks

595
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:10,465
What?

596
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:12,834
Couldn't be

597
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:27,048
He'll pay you when he sees you

598
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,317
He's coming, he's upstairs

599
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:30,616
Sit down

600
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:52,645
Buddy

601
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:54,781
It could be fatal

602
00:34:57,955 --> 00:34:59,650
Don't! Listen to my explanation

603
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:02,624
No more nonsense. Hand them over,
or I'll take your life

604
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,552
As he's giving us the location,
be easy on him

605
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:07,628
I really didn't take them

606
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,601
You still want to take them all
for yourself

607
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:13,932
Let me

608
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:23,677
There's a fight

609
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:30,082
Hui, stop him

610
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:31,814
Where's my money

611
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:33,851
Stop that

612
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,790
Stop acting. Refund me $5000

613
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:55,201
Let's go, Chuan

614
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,375
Let's go. We're not their match

615
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,474
Let's go

616
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:03,178
Follow them

617
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:05,787
Pay me. Don't go

618
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:06,380
Who say no

619
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:15,224
The things are broken and they're gone

620
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,231
Am I to charge them to your account

621
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,828
Sure, sure

622
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:22,028
Don't let me see you again here

623
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:26,942
I really have got no money

624
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,449
Going away

625
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:53,193
Bastard, you dared to fool me

626
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:56,698
I lured you out to collect the reward

627
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:57,536
The reward

628
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:57,937
Yes

629
00:36:58,108 --> 00:36:59,075
I'll give it to you now

630
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:04,878
Sister, have mercy! You may kill me

631
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,280
You asked for it. You nearly ruined me

632
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:09,382
I didn't know it was so serious

633
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,614
I won't dare to do it again

634
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,322
How dare you talk

635
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,786
To get the reward,
you may sell me out again

636
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:18,524
Once again? Don't

637
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:19,062
Let's go

638
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:25,325
Where's Sheng

639
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:26,667
How I won't be taken in

640
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,836
Pay me or I won't be taken in

641
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:29,864
What if I don't

642
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:33,873
Forget it. Let's have tea
some other day. Bye

643
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:37,475
Stop that, or I'll shout

644
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,277
Several men assaulting one?

645
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,482
Here's a $5000. Take us there

646
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,950
That's better. Follow me

647
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:53,929
It's up above there

648
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:55,724
Go up

649
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:10,470
See if you can get away now

650
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:15,178
Keep away! Keep away!

651
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,682
Keep away, or I'll jump

652
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,488
Sheng, let's talk it over

653
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:21,886
Go on. Excuse me

654
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,758
I've locked the door. He can't get away

655
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,189
Sheng, don't try anything foolish

656
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:31,259
Keep away

657
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:33,694
Sheng, come down first. Come on

658
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:34,666
Stop pushing me

659
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,398
Come down, you may tumble to death

660
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:38,304
Watch out

661
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:43,779
Pull him up

662
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,215
Sheng, take care

663
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,089
Why is it so heavy?

664
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:03,599
Harder

665
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:08,864
What are you doing?

666
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:10,165
Bonnie, lend a hand

667
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:15,500
Harder

668
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,510
Can I let go? I've acrophobia

669
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:20,941
No, or they'll pull us up

670
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:22,379
What are you doing there

671
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,078
Lend a hand at once

672
00:39:24,855 --> 00:39:25,480
I can't make it

673
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:29,283
Cut off the rope

674
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:32,256
Where are you doing

675
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,688
My pants are falling. Let go

676
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:38,063
Don't, or I'll get you

677
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:42,630
Oh, no my pants are dropping! Let go

678
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:53,239
What are you doing? My clothes

679
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:54,407
Chuan, are you alright

680
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:56,308
Yes. And you

681
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:57,212
I'm alright

682
00:39:57,788 --> 00:39:58,379
What happened

683
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:01,652
You're damned, you took away my pants

684
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:02,453
Sheng, how are you doing

685
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:05,088
They're coming soon. Run!

686
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:06,759
My car's in a next street. Let's go

687
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:07,522
Hurry up

688
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:18,065
Come in

689
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,681
Sit down. I'll bring you coffee

690
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:29,918
Thank you

691
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:33,916
You're beautiful and you've taste in decor

692
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,492
Right, it's better than
my Chuan Chi Teahouse

693
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:39,386
What has beauty to do with taste?

694
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,155
Why not?

695
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:42,189
The taste of the interior decoration

696
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:45,531
shows your own taste and beauty

697
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:46,335
what did you say

698
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:50,763
The decor here is beautiful

699
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:51,667
Is this flat yours?

700
00:40:51,775 --> 00:40:54,369
It's my uncle's, but his family has emigrated

701
00:40:54,444 --> 00:40:55,342
I'm watching the house for them

702
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:59,710
Are you sure the decor is okay?

703
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:00,975
He must be out of his mind

704
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:02,109
He thought the flat was yours

705
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:02,944
Damn you

706
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:05,784
Taste my coffee

707
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,352
Drink it

708
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,982
It smells good. Chuan, smell

709
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:12,552
I have nasal congestion

710
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:13,921
Two spoonfuls enough

711
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,225
No sugar. I must keep fit

712
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,765
No one has put sugar into mine

713
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:24,101
Let's change. I don't have to keep fit

714
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:30,545
Sheng, did those men bear you a grudge?

715
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,275
No, they're my friends

716
00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:35,974
They looked so tough

717
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:37,415
I don't think you're any good

718
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,580
Why did they push you so hard

719
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:42,153
Don't talk nonsense or I'll get you

720
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,425
They only wanted to see me

721
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:48,287
We missed each other for a long time

722
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:49,790
The way he looked

723
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,429
he was trying to take your life

724
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:53,263
Right, right

725
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,400
Take my life? Never

726
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:57,596
You know better yourself

727
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:58,971
There are usually three reasons

728
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:00,076
For honor, for girls or for money

729
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:01,103
None at all

730
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:02,375
Confess it

731
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:04,672
Lie again, and I can't help you

732
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:05,913
I didn't

733
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:06,706
Don't deny

734
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:09,478
The way you put the sugar shows

735
00:42:09,953 --> 00:42:12,012
you were hiding something

736
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,859
Sheng, tell them the truth

737
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:20,926
Okay, I will

738
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:47,921
You're late. Is there any clue?

739
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,358
Is the clue reliable?

740
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:00,361
Yes, but not as useful as yours

741
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:19,651
Chang claimed he didn't get the gems

742
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,548
So much the better

743
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:23,817
What do you mean

744
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:27,891
This is a normal phenomenon

745
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:30,299
Ho won't admit of course

746
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,361
Do you think it's true?

747
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,967
Absolutely, according to my observation

748
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,872
Have you observed Sheng?

749
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:41,905
You're responsible for tailing Hui

750
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:43,877
I mean I've observed you

751
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:44,571
What?

752
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:49,378
It's true on observation of both you & Chang

753
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:53,751
Could Ma Hui & his men have done it?

754
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:56,992
Have you discovered anything about them

755
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,529
Much

756
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:01,559
What

757
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,589
Ma Hui's looking for Sheng

758
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:10,472
Then they mustn't have done it then

759
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:12,499
Who then

760
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:15,142
What's on your mind

761
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:15,644
Chest

762
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:18,609
My mind is all blank

763
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:28,281
I've got an idea

764
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:29,815
What?

765
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,323
Let's deliberately provoke Ma & his men

766
00:44:32,562 --> 00:44:33,995
So they'll settle it with Chang

767
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,462
Then we can sit back & watch them flight

768
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,896
and see who's got the goods

769
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:57,776
You see what I mean?

770
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,286
Perfectly

771
00:45:04,528 --> 00:45:07,019
We're rich. I've long waited for you

772
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:07,629
No, no

773
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,432
A small fry swallowing a big fish

774
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:12,065
Show me. I didn't see it

775
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:13,961
How crafty you are

776
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:15,696
Are you still in the mood for fun

777
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:18,131
My money's all spent

778
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,140
As of today, we'll each go our own way

779
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:23,469
are we to let Sheng go like this

780
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:26,341
No, he's even cheated my ma out
of her funeral money

781
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,348
I'll never let him go

782
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:30,620
Since last time, We've been unable to find him

783
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,413
Don't forget we must eat

784
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,684
Don't blow up because you've lost

785
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:38,760
If I see him, he'll suffer

786
00:45:40,297 --> 00:45:43,391
Why has he become so sly after 30 years

787
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:44,365
It shows he has brains

788
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:46,600
You mean we have no brains

789
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,198
Not us

790
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:49,405
If not us, it means myself alone then

791
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,738
You said that

792
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,206
How dare you to taste me? Damn

793
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:52,831
Let go

794
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:56,102
It's no concern of mine

795
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:01,641
You want to know where Chang's hiding

796
00:46:02,486 --> 00:46:02,975
Yes

797
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:06,681
He's now at 17 Hsiao Lik Yuan
Village, Shatin

798
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:08,553
in his cousin Chuan's shop

799
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:10,016
Understand

800
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,591
Such a good job? Reserve it for me

801
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,600
I'll come right away. See you then

802
00:46:21,938 --> 00:46:22,836
Hui, where are you going?

803
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:23,931
I'm rushing to have an interview

804
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:27,003
Here's $1,000. Try your luck

805
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:34,706
50/50

806
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:36,311
You're smart

807
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,884
Have you noticed Hui's enthusiasm for work

808
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:42,323
Right. When in jail, we did everything

809
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:45,286
And he was so generous today

810
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:47,394
Right, we always had to ask him for it

811
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:49,158
Is he really going for an interview?

812
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:50,360
There must be something fishy

813
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:51,793
What shall we do

814
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:52,527
Tail him

815
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:53,562
Go then

816
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:59,336
he should be downstairs by now

817
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:11,082
Want bras, miss

818
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,018
Crazy

819
00:47:22,165 --> 00:47:22,824
What's there to see

820
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,366
You need psychiatric help, sex friend

821
00:47:26,203 --> 00:47:27,602
What are you doing

822
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,704
You think you can get bras of your size

823
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:34,235
Go and buy a pair of parachute

824
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:44,219
Taxi

825
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:47,654
Follow that red car in front.
Here's $100

826
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:49,021
Is that red car? Yes, yes

827
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:52,724
I haven't got in yet

828
00:47:54,297 --> 00:47:54,820
Taxi

829
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:10,341
I envy you, you have no worried

830
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:13,808
Why don't you leave Hui and his men

831
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:16,549
and start all over again

832
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,417
I can't. They won't let me go

833
00:48:20,557 --> 00:48:22,081
Do you expect me to hide here all my life

834
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,925
You want to hide? Never

835
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:32,193
Stay where you are

836
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:33,192
Stay where you are

837
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,761
Calm down. I'm only trying to help Sheng

838
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,362
Me

839
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:37,603
Don't say that

840
00:48:37,941 --> 00:48:39,841
You'll be doing him a favour
to leave him alone

841
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:41,741
I've come only by myself

842
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,778
Maybe. See what he has to say

843
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:46,680
Sheng, it's hard to find your place

844
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:50,846
Why is the atmosphere so tense here

845
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:51,746
Why are you here

846
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:53,111
To see Sheng

847
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:55,319
There's lots to eat

848
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,757
I'm both tired and hungry

849
00:48:57,794 --> 00:48:58,886
I haven't prepared your portion

850
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,420
Take my portion

851
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,765
What on earth do you want

852
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,059
I'm really trying to help Sheng

853
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:07,494
Sheng, let's go out for a chat

854
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:08,669
Oh, no

855
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:10,863
That would make me lose face

856
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:11,666
Let's go!

857
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,774
- Go on with eating. I'll come right away
- Okay

858
00:49:20,116 --> 00:49:20,810
I found you

859
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:36,063
Sheng, you'd better hand them over

860
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,001
Hui, I didn't take them

861
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:41,364
I can't help if you deny it

862
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:44,399
I'll let you go, but Chiang and Piao won't,
and Chiang can do anything

863
00:49:44,874 --> 00:49:46,739
Especially Ah Chiang, he will do anything

864
00:49:47,677 --> 00:49:50,145
You can't hide all your life

865
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,145
Hui, you've known me long enough
to doubt me

866
00:49:53,216 --> 00:49:54,478
Go back and tell them the truth

867
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:56,211
They won't listen to me

868
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,278
What then?

869
00:49:58,388 --> 00:49:59,252
The only way

870
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:09,289
Hui, what is it

871
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,630
I shouldn't help you

872
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:13,994
Please, Hui, I beg you

873
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,264
I really am innocent

874
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:21,168
Hong, go and clean the groove

875
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,111
The only way is to get out of here

876
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:30,683
and go as far as possible

877
00:50:31,354 --> 00:50:32,844
But I have no money

878
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:47,363
Help

879
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,964
I'm afraid

880
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:04,482
What are you doing there

881
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,249
Let's try the Water World here

882
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:10,993
There are still two overthere

883
00:51:11,428 --> 00:51:12,622
Okay, let's go

884
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:15,461
Try them yourself. All ruined

885
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:20,993
Bonnie, are you alright

886
00:51:21,404 --> 00:51:21,995
Yes

887
00:51:23,506 --> 00:51:24,564
You said you had no money

888
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:25,733
Sell the goods
and you'll have lots of it

889
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:26,867
I already said I haven't got it

890
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:29,270
Alright,
I'll raise travel expenses for you

891
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:29,935
Are you serious

892
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:31,345
I'm not sure if I can get it

893
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:33,409
Wait for me at Chung Ta Timber Mill

894
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:35,041
I really don't know how to thank you

895
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:35,743
Don't mention it

896
00:51:46,863 --> 00:51:47,352
Hello

897
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:48,122
Where are you now?

898
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:50,123
I'm following Chiang and see Hui's car

899
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,300
But now there's no trace of Hui

900
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:53,962
He's now going out. Follow him

901
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:54,967
Never mind Huo Chiang

902
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:56,202
Okay. Goodbye

903
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:07,948
Ma Hui couldn't have come here

904
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:09,842
Right. How could he be here?

905
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:10,849
Must be that fellow

906
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:11,716
That fellow

907
00:52:14,224 --> 00:52:15,054
All eaten

908
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:17,257
I'm not too hungry. You eat

909
00:52:20,697 --> 00:52:22,187
Whom were you talking about?

910
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,058
Whom?

911
00:52:24,334 --> 00:52:26,199
Well, whom?

912
00:52:26,836 --> 00:52:28,235
I mean her

913
00:52:28,705 --> 00:52:30,730
Don't talk nonsense. What's your proof

914
00:52:30,874 --> 00:52:32,808
Proof? Here are four persons

915
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,407
Not you, him or me

916
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:35,603
Who else, if not her?

917
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,969
You're being unreasonable

918
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:40,381
Never mind her. She's joking

919
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:43,481
You cover her up because you like her

920
00:52:43,753 --> 00:52:46,085
Look, what pretty chest she has

921
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:52,553
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

922
00:52:52,662 --> 00:52:53,492
Ain't I speaking the truth? Cut it out

923
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:56,688
Don't fight because of me

924
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,062
Bonnie, Bonnie

925
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:03,803
I'd better go. We'll keep in contact

926
00:53:03,873 --> 00:53:04,271
Goodbye

927
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,130
Goodbye

928
00:53:10,547 --> 00:53:12,139
Are you happy now?

929
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,107
Sheng, in fact I

930
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,718
Actually Chuan did that for you

931
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:21,384
Thank you.
Luckily she's broad-minded

932
00:53:22,926 --> 00:53:23,858
Is she

933
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:26,088
Quiet. Why did Ma come to see you

934
00:53:26,763 --> 00:53:28,492
We're after all brothers

935
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:31,291
Ma trusts me and has even promised

936
00:53:31,701 --> 00:53:33,396
to lend me money to go abroad

937
00:53:33,603 --> 00:53:34,035
Is it true

938
00:53:34,103 --> 00:53:37,129
Sure, we'll meet at Chung Ta tomorrow

939
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,068
He'll bring me money then

940
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,232
Isn't he friendly

941
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:42,206
Would he be so broad-minded

942
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:45,273
He did that to harm you.
He meant to mislead

943
00:53:45,582 --> 00:53:49,916
Piao & Chiang into belief
you've taken the loot

944
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:51,280
No more nonsense, please

945
00:53:51,754 --> 00:53:52,618
Once you go abroad, they'll surely believe

946
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:55,323
you've run away with the loot

947
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:57,154
It seems Ma's really trying to frame you

948
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:00,258
Right, you're smart

949
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,328
After you leave, Ma Hui may

950
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:04,031
say anything against you

951
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,032
And you've no way to prove your innocence

952
00:54:05,301 --> 00:54:06,962
Don't judge with a little man's mind

953
00:54:07,303 --> 00:54:09,203
The truth is once you're away

954
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:10,239
he can say anything against you

955
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:11,796
And you've no way to prove otherwise

956
00:54:12,275 --> 00:54:14,004
Thanks for reminding me of it

957
00:54:14,077 --> 00:54:15,237
Think carefully and you'll see

958
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:17,541
Why did he date you for such a quiet place

959
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,174
He must be up to no good

960
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,713
Don't try to be smart

961
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,142
Not everyone's as obstinate as you're

962
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,049
You meet everyone at star Ferry

963
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:27,218
lf he's up to no good, you'll be

964
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,457
in danger in a desolate place

965
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:33,694
The right place should be
the flagpole at Star Ferry

966
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:35,560
It's crowded and much safar

967
00:54:35,698 --> 00:54:38,064
Glad you understand. Think it over

968
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:38,862
Shut up

969
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,099
Think it over

970
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:43,399
You're right

971
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:45,474
You 're my good friend

972
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:46,437
What's the matter with you?

973
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,108
He's fight and I am wrong?

974
00:54:48,444 --> 00:54:49,604
Don't be biased against me

975
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:50,644
I'm not only biased but

976
00:54:50,947 --> 00:54:52,005
highly preiuiced against you

977
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:53,314
Because you irritated Bonnie

978
00:54:54,017 --> 00:54:55,348
You've gone too far

979
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:55,884
What's now?

980
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,615
Never mind her. It's her shop. She'll come back

981
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:09,889
Does your dog bite, old man?

982
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:13,966
My dog never bites. He's meek

983
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:19,738
You side he wouldn't bite, old man?

984
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:21,642
This dog is not mine

985
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,605
You're crafty

986
00:55:39,328 --> 00:55:40,295
Where's Sheng? Speak up

987
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:41,260
or I'll be nasty

988
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:45,358
He's at my home. I'll take you there

989
00:55:45,735 --> 00:55:46,531
Don't play tricks

990
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:50,136
Overthere

991
00:55:51,207 --> 00:55:53,072
It could be a trap

992
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:55,601
I won't walk into it so easily. Follow me

993
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,908
It's for you

994
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:06,922
Sheng? Liang

995
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,090
Tell Sheng Huo Chiang's caught me

996
00:56:10,426 --> 00:56:12,291
It's Chuan. She was caught by Chiang

997
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:13,921
Isn't she going to help to hang herself?

998
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,860
What a new gimmick she's got

999
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,025
She can't fool me

1000
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:21,437
Tell her to go to the old garage or

1001
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,395
He may disfigure me

1002
00:56:23,706 --> 00:56:24,365
That's what I'm going to say

1003
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:24,998
Wait

1004
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:28,541
He threatened to disfigure Chuan

1005
00:56:29,378 --> 00:56:29,969
Did he?

1006
00:56:33,616 --> 00:56:37,052
Chiang, don't hurt Chuan. I'll come at once

1007
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,152
Wait for me

1008
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:39,549
Get going

1009
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:44,151
Go and rescue Chuan now

1010
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:45,453
Don't think I'm as dumb as you

1011
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:47,828
It was only a trick

1012
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:52,062
Let me play along with her and keep her waiting

1013
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:58,804
They didn't sound like lying

1014
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:00,203
You'd better go and see

1015
00:57:00,643 --> 00:57:02,440
I have no time. You go yourself

1016
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:13,856
No, I must buy a newspaper

1017
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:18,288
Go now and you'll see

1018
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:19,325
Idiot

1019
00:57:21,097 --> 00:57:21,654
Go

1020
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:24,431
Lighter

1021
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:25,461
Shut up

1022
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,524
Why should I talk?

1023
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:29,271
Sheng's coming. When he's here,
you'll be finished

1024
00:57:29,772 --> 00:57:31,763
With you here, I'm not afraid of him

1025
00:57:33,543 --> 00:57:34,134
Overthere

1026
00:57:52,295 --> 00:57:53,023
Chuan, I'm hungry

1027
00:57:53,563 --> 00:57:54,825
Liang, here

1028
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:56,260
Are you alright

1029
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:58,462
Why is Sheng not coming

1030
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,168
Did he know Chiang's caught me

1031
00:58:00,403 --> 00:58:01,768
Yes, but he has no time

1032
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:04,068
He wouldn't care about my safety

1033
00:58:04,707 --> 00:58:06,572
I'm here to help you

1034
00:58:07,176 --> 00:58:09,371
Why is he not coming himself?
He doesn't care for me

1035
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:11,375
He does

1036
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:12,513
Why is he not coming

1037
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:14,309
He said only an idiot would trust you

1038
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:17,547
What? Did he say that

1039
00:58:18,154 --> 00:58:20,816
He didn't mean it. Why is it so hard

1040
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,321
You indeed are an idiot

1041
00:58:26,929 --> 00:58:28,294
What are you doing? Enough

1042
00:58:28,598 --> 00:58:30,566
Chuan, I'll protect you

1043
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:33,692
Liang, are you alright

1044
00:58:33,936 --> 00:58:35,733
Calm down. I'm here

1045
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:38,531
Enough. Put me down

1046
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:39,900
or I won't give you face

1047
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:41,567
Go now. You're not his match

1048
00:58:42,211 --> 00:58:44,179
Calm down. I'll get you out for sure

1049
00:58:45,615 --> 00:58:47,310
I'll count three and you put me down

1050
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,684
1, 2, 3

1051
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:54,914
Liang, are you alright

1052
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,420
I'm alright. I can hold on

1053
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:06,698
Don't hit him anymore

1054
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:07,493
Quiet

1055
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:09,931
I bet you to put me down to fight with you

1056
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:12,867
Don't hurt Chuan

1057
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:15,434
Liang

1058
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:19,715
Liang, go at once

1059
00:59:20,383 --> 00:59:22,078
You're not his match, Liang

1060
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,848
I won't let him hurt you

1061
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:28,251
Let me go, and I'll take you to Sheng

1062
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:29,754
Let me go

1063
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:31,523
Liang, Liang

1064
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:39,628
Liang, Liang, are you alright

1065
00:59:39,669 --> 00:59:43,867
Yes. Don't be afraid of him. I'll hit him

1066
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,067
Liang, Liang

1067
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:49,074
Can you beat me?

1068
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:07,661
Had I known sheng's so heartless

1069
01:00:07,763 --> 01:00:09,355
I wouldn't have played along with you

1070
01:00:12,268 --> 01:00:14,031
Liang, are you alright

1071
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:16,937
Chuan, let's run. Chiang's powerful

1072
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:18,940
Don't be afraid. I'm here

1073
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:24,211
How's Sheng overthere

1074
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:26,508
Don't be worry. I'll finish him off

1075
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:30,615
Too early

1076
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:37,352
Sir, I'm here to fix the room

1077
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,291
Will you speak Cantonese

1078
01:00:39,628 --> 01:00:41,323
I'm here to fix the room

1079
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,292
No need, no need

1080
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:45,058
A de luxe room is cleaned 3 times daily

1081
01:00:45,668 --> 01:00:46,794
Hurry up

1082
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:47,758
Hurry up

1083
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:48,201
Thank you

1084
01:01:01,384 --> 01:01:02,476
Here you are

1085
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:14,394
Let me

1086
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:19,468
Whom are you looking for

1087
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:22,198
Mr Chen, come and sit down

1088
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:25,036
So you're Mr Chin's friend. Have a cigarette

1089
01:01:25,408 --> 01:01:26,432
Our boss doesn't smoke

1090
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:28,173
Have a cigarette

1091
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:30,143
You may go out

1092
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:31,079
Boss

1093
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:34,173
Mr Chen

1094
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:35,008
Mr Chin

1095
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:36,515
None of you cares to smoke

1096
01:01:36,585 --> 01:01:37,449
Right, right. Go out

1097
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:38,114
Thank you

1098
01:01:38,354 --> 01:01:38,979
Please sit down, Mr Chen

1099
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:39,544
Thank you

1100
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,203
Mr Chin, our boss wants to see the goods

1101
01:02:01,377 --> 01:02:01,900
Okay

1102
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,280
We accept your price. We'll contact in few days

1103
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,879
Okay

1104
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:17,014
Don't plaster it

1105
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,320
It may bruise without plaster

1106
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:24,959
Brother Hui brought me that

1107
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:26,400
It doesn't concern him

1108
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:29,096
No? Maybe he colluded with Sheng

1109
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:31,562
I met that bitch after we parted

1110
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:34,003
That couldn't be a coincidence

1111
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,741
Don't you know your boss tried
to double-cross you

1112
01:02:39,915 --> 01:02:40,506
Who told you that

1113
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:41,072
Never mind

1114
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:43,709
He lured Sheng to talk at Chungg Ta

1115
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:44,581
Go at once

1116
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,445
Is that so

1117
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:02,997
Brother Hui

1118
01:03:03,305 --> 01:03:07,332
Sheng, I've raised $5000 for you.
Go tonight

1119
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:11,810
Since you're so friendly, I can't go away

1120
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:15,883
I've decided to follow you

1121
01:03:17,953 --> 01:03:20,421
Okay, I'll think it over

1122
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,009
Lend a hand

1123
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:53,249
Sheng, Sheng

1124
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:54,653
I'm here

1125
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,224
Why are you doing that

1126
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:03,626
You won't understand

1127
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:05,892
Let me

1128
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:14,107
Trying to kill yourself

1129
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:25,676
Are you alright

1130
01:04:25,754 --> 01:04:26,550
Yes Watch out

1131
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,517
Come up, come up quickly

1132
01:04:36,131 --> 01:04:37,098
He's trying to run against me

1133
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,101
Don't hit him

1134
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,293
Go away. Let me

1135
01:05:14,236 --> 01:05:14,827
How do you feel

1136
01:05:45,668 --> 01:05:46,635
Well, does it hurt

1137
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:47,669
Try

1138
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:51,000
It really hurts

1139
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,787
Good, I made it

1140
01:06:15,631 --> 01:06:17,155
Liang, are you alright

1141
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,758
It hurts

1142
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:32,237
Hui, don't be afraid. I'll help you

1143
01:06:36,885 --> 01:06:37,317
Stop

1144
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:42,756
Follow him, quick

1145
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:48,327
He fooled us. Why are you on his side

1146
01:06:48,397 --> 01:06:52,060
I fooled him too.
He fled because he's guilty

1147
01:06:54,737 --> 01:06:57,001
Right, he's exposing himself

1148
01:06:57,673 --> 01:06:59,231
What trick are you playing with Hui

1149
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:03,342
I'll tell you for sure.
He told me to run to frame me

1150
01:07:03,412 --> 01:07:04,106
Why should he do that

1151
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:06,612
Unless he's taken away the stuff himself

1152
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:09,050
We were in jail and discharged the same time

1153
01:07:09,351 --> 01:07:10,318
He couldn't have taken it

1154
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:11,350
Of course he could

1155
01:07:11,887 --> 01:07:14,856
He colluded with another man in jail

1156
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,513
Why are you here

1157
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,349
The same coincidence every time

1158
01:07:17,593 --> 01:07:20,687
You can't convince us you're innocent

1159
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:23,831
I've come to see Sheng

1160
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:24,956
Is that so

1161
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:27,934
Can you support what you said

1162
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:31,129
Of course. My partner will show you the proof

1163
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:34,567
Where are you

1164
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,678
I came to the timber mill without seeing you

1165
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:37,875
Where are you

1166
01:07:38,447 --> 01:07:39,641
Turn around

1167
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:41,644
You're all here

1168
01:07:44,153 --> 01:07:45,381
He's my partner Fu

1169
01:07:47,423 --> 01:07:51,052
This is my card

1170
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,127
So you're a private detective

1171
01:07:53,462 --> 01:07:54,224
Yes, yes

1172
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,225
You're his partner. How about Bonnie

1173
01:07:56,331 --> 01:07:59,562
The Underwriters appointed us
to investigate the case

1174
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:02,828
So you've been spying on me

1175
01:08:03,972 --> 01:08:04,563
Yes

1176
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:06,833
I sensed something was wrong

1177
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:10,776
You're pretty and you helped me

1178
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,408
In fact, you're a good man

1179
01:08:13,115 --> 01:08:14,514
Repeat it when there's a full moon

1180
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,180
I feel the heat now, if you don't

1181
01:08:16,351 --> 01:08:17,181
Show us the evidence

1182
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:19,182
Evidence? Sure

1183
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:28,121
Hui colluded with the jailor to double-cross us

1184
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:29,428
Can't I see it myself

1185
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:32,332
Who's the man who followed them

1186
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:34,599
Someone who bought the loot

1187
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:35,929
His name is Cheng Chung-pai

1188
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:36,896
You recognized him

1189
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:39,273
He's my ex-boss, a con-man

1190
01:08:39,508 --> 01:08:40,475
He has his own means

1191
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:41,770
to buy loots

1192
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,034
What is it?

1193
01:08:43,278 --> 01:08:43,607
Cheating

1194
01:08:44,012 --> 01:08:46,810
See what Chen is up to

1195
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:48,446
Don't let him swallow up the loot

1196
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:50,280
You must help us

1197
01:08:50,352 --> 01:08:50,784
Sure

1198
01:08:50,853 --> 01:08:52,821
The Underwriters want to recover the loot

1199
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:55,214
We have no reason to help

1200
01:08:55,624 --> 01:08:56,784
There's a reward

1201
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:57,683
How much

1202
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,349
10%

1203
01:08:58,861 --> 01:09:02,797
The reward is going to be handsome then

1204
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,294
They've got to make a move. Let's watch him closely

1205
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:09,461
What now?

1206
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:18,770
What are they doing

1207
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,179
Why have they taken so many police uniforms

1208
01:09:28,257 --> 01:09:29,281
Well, why?

1209
01:09:30,058 --> 01:09:30,717
Nonsense

1210
01:09:32,027 --> 01:09:32,652
Where are we going

1211
01:09:35,998 --> 01:09:37,829
On analysis of the data gathered by us

1212
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,366
this crafty old Chen Chung-pai obviously

1213
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:44,995
What are you trying to imply

1214
01:09:46,508 --> 01:09:48,738
He wants to double-cross us

1215
01:09:49,177 --> 01:09:51,145
What do you mean? Put it more plainly

1216
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,774
He wants to swallow up our share.
That's all

1217
01:09:55,017 --> 01:09:56,041
Nonsense

1218
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:57,378
I won't let him go then

1219
01:09:57,686 --> 01:09:59,745
Not so hard! It's my Uncle's table

1220
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:02,380
Bonnie, he's rude,
don't talk so loud to him

1221
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:02,923
Yes

1222
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:03,682
Forget it.

1223
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:04,190
Sit down

1224
01:10:04,293 --> 01:10:06,318
Crazy, you think I'm rude to everybody

1225
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:10,020
Sorry, Bonnie, next time I won't do it

1226
01:10:10,098 --> 01:10:10,621
Sit down, will you

1227
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:12,291
Okay, sit down. Calm down

1228
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:14,862
Since we know Chen's double-crossed us

1229
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,131
let's try to take care of them

1230
01:10:17,306 --> 01:10:19,297
I know. We should try to rob too

1231
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:19,839
Nonsense

1232
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:23,737
Don't be afraid.
At least Liang dare to speak out

1233
01:10:24,446 --> 01:10:25,003
Yes

1234
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,249
Right. Is it guilty to talk

1235
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,744
How dare you? I'll get you

1236
01:10:30,152 --> 01:10:32,882
Quiet! We meet to work out a counter-measure

1237
01:10:32,955 --> 01:10:34,718
Be free to express your views

1238
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:38,192
Do you accept Liang's proposal to rob?

1239
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:38,817
Yes

1240
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:39,622
What a good plot

1241
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,887
No one dare to touch because they play police

1242
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:44,655
What have we got

1243
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,231
You're smart, you're right

1244
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:48,662
What have we got? Force

1245
01:10:48,737 --> 01:10:49,328
Right

1246
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:51,333
Well, why not

1247
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:53,340
We're outnumbered

1248
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:55,566
We can only win by stratagem

1249
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:56,576
It makes sense

1250
01:10:57,145 --> 01:10:59,409
You always say 'yes'. You're a yes man

1251
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:01,346
Right, right

1252
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,208
Yes

1253
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:03,281
Right again

1254
01:11:03,952 --> 01:11:05,852
If you don't say 'yes', and I don't either

1255
01:11:06,088 --> 01:11:07,851
we'll get at nothing the whole night

1256
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,657
At least we now know force alone is impossible

1257
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,319
Let's play along with them

1258
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:17,492
I knew you'd say that

1259
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:23,400
- Want another glass of beer, sir?
- Okay

1260
01:11:30,612 --> 01:11:31,601
Do I look like a policeman

1261
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:35,279
Yes, but a short one

1262
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,384
Am I that short

1263
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,684
Come and contact us in time

1264
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:40,611
Let's go

1265
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:47,257
Go forward and watch

1266
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:56,969
This seems to be a small place

1267
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,568
I see

1268
01:11:59,975 --> 01:12:00,839
- Let's go out first
- Yes

1269
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:03,136
Please sit down, Mr Chen

1270
01:12:10,085 --> 01:12:10,642
Your goods?

1271
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:11,208
Overthere

1272
01:12:17,092 --> 01:12:17,649
Let's go and have a look

1273
01:12:31,373 --> 01:12:31,896
Scatter them

1274
01:12:38,714 --> 01:12:39,271
Overthere

1275
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,012
Why have we no assignments

1276
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:45,383
Who cares? We'll rob when the time's ripe

1277
01:12:47,456 --> 01:12:48,480
- Hope we can cooperate
- Yes

1278
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:50,081
Boss, we're being surrounded by police

1279
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:57,560
You fooled us. Let's go

1280
01:12:57,799 --> 01:13:00,893
Stop! We're police

1281
01:13:01,203 --> 01:13:01,692
Keep us covered

1282
01:13:02,104 --> 01:13:02,593
Keep us covered

1283
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:08,534
Make way, make way

1284
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:15,042
My Diamonds. Return me the gems

1285
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,616
Stop! Police

1286
01:13:15,717 --> 01:13:16,308
Stay where you are

1287
01:13:21,456 --> 01:13:23,754
We've surrounded the place. Give up

1288
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,059
Keep me covered when I break out

1289
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:42,566
That case

1290
01:13:42,677 --> 01:13:43,268
Going to hell

1291
01:13:43,678 --> 01:13:44,201
What now?

1292
01:13:44,312 --> 01:13:44,744
What shall we do

1293
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,672
Break out. I'll keep you covered

1294
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:55,182
I give up

1295
01:13:56,424 --> 01:13:56,947
Stay where you are

1296
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:58,782
Stir and I'll shoot

1297
01:14:00,028 --> 01:14:02,223
Okay, let's return

1298
01:14:03,765 --> 01:14:04,823
Let's return

1299
01:14:07,335 --> 01:14:09,326
Have you a light, sir?

1300
01:14:10,105 --> 01:14:10,628
Yes

1301
01:14:15,277 --> 01:14:16,073
Where's that beauty?

1302
01:14:16,845 --> 01:14:17,937
Are you going to lend me

1303
01:14:18,013 --> 01:14:18,536
No

1304
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:25,516
Let's return

1305
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:26,678
Let's return

1306
01:14:28,523 --> 01:14:29,547
It's the right time

1307
01:14:30,692 --> 01:14:31,215
Thank you

1308
01:14:31,493 --> 01:14:32,391
Thank you, thank you

1309
01:14:33,795 --> 01:14:35,990
Did we act well, boss?

1310
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:38,462
Where's that case?

1311
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:39,192
That case?

1312
01:14:40,368 --> 01:14:41,801
Overthere. Follow them

1313
01:14:42,637 --> 01:14:43,262
Stop them

1314
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:45,505
It's here. Come up quickly

1315
01:14:47,142 --> 01:14:47,699
Hurry up

1316
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:54,314
Go back

1317
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:56,283
How's it?

1318
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:56,976
Boss, they've got away

1319
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:00,922
Hong, have you seen our police van

1320
01:15:01,323 --> 01:15:02,051
Yes, we saw it just now

1321
01:15:02,724 --> 01:15:03,622
Let's proceed as planned

1322
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,148
Hey...

1323
01:15:05,227 --> 01:15:08,094
You turned brilliantly. Let me get out

1324
01:15:08,163 --> 01:15:09,221
I must stay alive to enjoy life

1325
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,286
Don't drive so fast

1326
01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:16,162
Let's overtake his car

1327
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:16,829
Don't regret

1328
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:17,461
Go on

1329
01:15:27,182 --> 01:15:27,739
What now?

1330
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:28,805
Sound the police siren

1331
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:33,852
I know

1332
01:15:34,856 --> 01:15:35,550
What does that mean

1333
01:15:35,624 --> 01:15:37,922
They know we're imposters

1334
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:39,557
Open up, open up

1335
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:45,396
Back out at once

1336
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,592
No, there's a truck behind

1337
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:49,798
What now?

1338
01:15:51,072 --> 01:15:54,803
Go up and run against it

1339
01:16:04,886 --> 01:16:05,477
Help

1340
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:07,050
Chuan, Chuan, where are you

1341
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:08,281
Don't make advances

1342
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:09,948
Don't touch, don't touch

1343
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,817
Don't touch

1344
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:15,752
Nonsense. Let's try to get out

1345
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:16,529
How about this

1346
01:16:17,098 --> 01:16:18,861
They ran against our car

1347
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:20,864
We can reverse it to

1348
01:16:21,136 --> 01:16:21,966
break it and get out

1349
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:23,730
If no one dares, I'll do it myself

1350
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:26,334
You're a girl. You mustn't do it

1351
01:16:26,808 --> 01:16:29,299
How stubborn. A girl's as capable

1352
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:32,277
Anyone who can drive, raise his hand

1353
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,845
So you can't drive then

1354
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:35,607
I've never learnt it

1355
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,111
Here's three toothpicks. Each draws one

1356
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:40,854
Anyone getting the longest one

1357
01:16:40,922 --> 01:16:42,446
Stop talking. Draw now

1358
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:53,928
You've finished drawing

1359
01:16:54,836 --> 01:16:55,996
See whose is the longest

1360
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:00,671
The longest one needn't go

1361
01:17:01,343 --> 01:17:02,503
See which of you has got the shortest

1362
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:07,077
Yours is the shortest

1363
01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:10,378
How even God knows who's the bravest

1364
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:14,587
Catch them

1365
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:16,054
Get back that stuff

1366
01:17:21,463 --> 01:17:23,021
There's still 4 there. Take them

1367
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:23,926
Let's go

1368
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:26,224
Hide under the car

1369
01:17:27,068 --> 01:17:28,194
They're hiding under the car

1370
01:17:30,972 --> 01:17:31,461
Follow them

1371
01:17:37,812 --> 01:17:38,210
Take him

1372
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:40,644
Quick

1373
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:51,453
What are you doing? Get in quick

1374
01:17:55,263 --> 01:17:55,729
It can't be opened

1375
01:17:57,198 --> 01:17:57,630
Follow them

1376
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,825
Go over at once

1377
01:18:01,503 --> 01:18:02,299
Go ahead

1378
01:18:06,341 --> 01:18:06,602
Go and get it at once

1379
01:18:09,677 --> 01:18:09,972
What now?

1380
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:11,305
Let's scatter

1381
01:18:14,516 --> 01:18:16,507
Let's overturn the car

1382
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:20,783
Fling the case

1383
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,598
Overthere

1384
01:18:59,260 --> 01:18:59,487
Overthere

1385
01:19:50,378 --> 01:19:51,208
The case is overthere

1386
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:55,443
Have you got it

1387
01:19:56,885 --> 01:19:57,476
Bastard

1388
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,609
Go now

1389
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,313
Get back the case first

1390
01:20:08,196 --> 01:20:09,322
Chuan, help me

1391
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:12,028
Bring in quick

1392
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:14,699
Sorry, it's blocked

1393
01:20:23,144 --> 01:20:23,701
Overthere

1394
01:20:31,085 --> 01:20:31,608
It's here

1395
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,817
Come over, come over

1396
01:20:41,262 --> 01:20:42,524
Chuan, help me

1397
01:21:00,548 --> 01:21:01,207
Are you alright

1398
01:21:01,516 --> 01:21:02,608
Let me give you a punch and see

1399
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:05,450
Get that case. I'll go and see Bonnie

1400
01:21:05,587 --> 01:21:05,951
Okay

1401
01:21:14,295 --> 01:21:17,628
So you're smoking here

1402
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:18,063
You

1403
01:21:18,299 --> 01:21:19,857
What? Whoever you are

1404
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,866
you mustn't be hiding here

1405
01:21:22,036 --> 01:21:25,301
You're paid all the same.
Aren't you ashamed

1406
01:21:25,974 --> 01:21:26,269
Sorry

1407
01:21:26,407 --> 01:21:27,135
Back to work

1408
01:21:27,308 --> 01:21:27,967
I'll go at once

1409
01:21:49,764 --> 01:21:50,230
Go now

1410
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,166
Stop

1411
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:34,903
You know what desperation is

1412
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:37,366
They don't

1413
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:39,872
We must be tough then

1414
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:45,341
I give up

1415
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,282
Toss the case over

1416
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:48,314
Go up

1417
01:22:49,023 --> 01:22:49,785
Go now

1418
01:23:12,013 --> 01:23:12,672
Toss the case over

1419
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:19,317
The case is overthere

1420
01:23:30,398 --> 01:23:30,989
Come up

1421
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:02,695
Go up and follow him

1422
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:28,588
Overthere

1423
01:24:31,459 --> 01:24:31,686
Go down

1424
01:24:34,228 --> 01:24:34,455
Watch out

1425
01:25:02,423 --> 01:25:03,890
I'm afraid

1426
01:25:05,126 --> 01:25:07,219
It's dead, don't

1427
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:07,590
Still alive

1428
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,839
Sheng

1429
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,964
Chuan, run

1430
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,298
Chuan, I'm here to help you

1431
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:54,807
Bastard

1432
01:25:55,309 --> 01:25:55,866
What are you doing

1433
01:25:55,977 --> 01:25:56,602
Come and help

1434
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,640
Can you fight? Come out when they finish

1435
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:00,539
Right

1436
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:03,808
Chuan, don't be afraid.
I'll vindicate you

1437
01:26:06,854 --> 01:26:07,445
Liang

1438
01:26:08,089 --> 01:26:08,885
I'm here to provoke a fight

1439
01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:26,495
Chuan, stand still

1440
01:26:38,452 --> 01:26:40,352
Stop now and get back that case

1441
01:27:29,904 --> 01:27:30,734
- Fix it yourself
- Come and help

1442
01:27:31,339 --> 01:27:32,237
Where are you going

1443
01:27:32,573 --> 01:27:33,164
Can't go up

1444
01:27:33,274 --> 01:27:34,206
Give me that case

1445
01:28:07,274 --> 01:28:08,138
We can't possibly find it out of so many

1446
01:28:08,509 --> 01:28:10,170
No more nonsense. Go on

1447
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:14,913
Open it and see

1448
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:19,484
It's worth the pains we've taken

1449
01:28:19,687 --> 01:28:22,053
No, we must hand it over to the police

1450
01:28:22,123 --> 01:28:24,887
We go to jail and you go to get it

1451
01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:26,618
No, it won't work anyway

1452
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,466
Watch out! They're armed

1453
01:28:39,306 --> 01:28:42,173
Listen, you've been surrounded

1454
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:50,174
It doesn't concern me

1455
01:28:50,317 --> 01:28:53,150
- I give you 3 seconds to give up with the loot
- What now?

1456
01:28:53,354 --> 01:28:55,754
1, 2, 3

1457
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:57,954
We give up

1458
01:28:58,059 --> 01:29:00,084
Give up

1459
01:29:01,829 --> 01:29:03,091
What are they doing

1460
01:29:04,598 --> 01:29:07,465
We're giving up. Don't shoot

1461
01:29:07,535 --> 01:29:08,160
Lay down your arms

1462
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:18,445
Stay where you are

1463
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:22,941
Stop! What are you doing

1464
01:29:25,352 --> 01:29:25,579
Stand still

1465
01:29:39,467 --> 01:29:40,331
Let's go Let go

1466
01:29:40,401 --> 01:29:40,890
Let's go

1467
01:29:43,971 --> 01:29:45,802
Get back that case

1468
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:51,568
Often I dream of the foamy sea

1469
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:55,940
Of the boat, of you and me

1470
01:29:57,384 --> 01:30:00,376
Afore day break comes along

1471
01:30:01,288 --> 01:30:06,225
I am the prisoner of your eyes

1472
01:30:08,462 --> 01:30:10,930
which light up, like thunder, like fire

1473
01:30:12,266 --> 01:30:15,292
The very eyes I have been seeking

1474
01:30:15,836 --> 01:30:19,465
My heart is swollen with love

1475
01:30:19,673 --> 01:30:23,109
It goes out to you, to you

1476
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:28,281
I live in memories sweet as honey

1477
01:30:30,584 --> 01:30:34,179
I shall find the nets meshed so fine

1478
01:30:34,522 --> 01:30:37,753
To keep the memories so divine

1479
01:30:37,925 --> 01:30:42,760
Hand in hand we look at the moon

1480
01:30:44,732 --> 01:30:50,068
I shall be with you all my life

1481
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:58,272
Like the drone to the queen of the hive

1482
01:30:58,612 --> 01:31:04,778
Together, all our lives

1483
01:31:06,187 --> 01:31:11,784
Come what may, ebbs ortides
