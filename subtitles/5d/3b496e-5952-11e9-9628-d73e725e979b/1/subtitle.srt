1
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,770
<i>Our sun is dying.</i>

2
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,340
<i>Mankind faces extinction.</i>

3
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,010
<i>Seven years ago, the Icarus Project
sent a mission to restart the sun.</i>

4
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,980
<i>But that mission was lost
before it reached the star.</i>

5
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>Sixteen months ago, I, Robert Capa,
and a crew of seven...</i>

6
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,790
<i>...left Earth frozen in a solar winter.</i>

7
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,690
<i>Our payload...</i>

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,800
<i>...a stellar bomb with the mass
equivalent to Manhattan Island.</i>

9
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,640
<i>Our purpose...</i>

10
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,870
<i>...to create a star within a star.</i>

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,900
<i>Eight astronauts strapped
to the back of a bomb.</i>

12
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,870
<i>My bomb.</i>

13
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,640
<i>Welcome to</i> Icarus II<i>.</i>

14
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,370
<i>Icarus</i>.

15
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,940
<i>Yes, Dr. Searle?</i>

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,610
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

17
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,420
<i>Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?</i>

18
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,720
Down.

19
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,730
Oh, my.

20
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,370
<i>Icarus</i>, how close is this
to full brightness?

21
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,870
<i>At this distance of 36 million miles...</i>

22
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,780
<i>...you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.</i>

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,170
Two percent?

24
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,310
Can you show me 4 percent?

25
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,920
<i>Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.</i>

26
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>However, you could observe
3.1 percent...</i>

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>...for a period of not longer than
30 seconds.</i>

28
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,510
All right. <i>Icarus</i>, I'm gonna reset...

29
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,800
...the filter to 3.1 percent.

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,810
Well, it's invigorating.

31
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,820
It's like taking a shower in light.

32
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,050
- You lose yourself a little.
- Like a flotation tank.

33
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,280
Actually, no.

34
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,160
Look, what is it, beef?

35
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,700
Chicken.

36
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,230
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,570
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

38
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,210
Testing total darkness
on flotation tanks.

39
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,240
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

40
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,250
You and the darkness are distinct
from each other...

41
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,510
...because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

42
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,710
But total light, it envelops you.

43
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,520
It becomes you.

44
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,030
It's very strange. I don't--

45
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,320
I recommend it.

46
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,330
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer...

47
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,830
...and I'm clearly a lot saner
than you are.

48
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,730
Good.

49
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,760
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

50
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,260
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

51
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,630
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

52
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,300
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference...

53
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,370
...and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

54
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,770
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

55
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,430
Possible?

56
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,240
Probable.

57
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,320
We'll finally be on our own.

58
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,750
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

59
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,090
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

60
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,320
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone...

61
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,900
...seven days sooner
than we thought.

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,270
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

63
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,570
...you should do it now.

64
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,680
Well, Mom and Dad.

65
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,980
I hope you're proud of your son...

66
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,990
...saving mankind and so on.

67
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,160
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,020
It came a little sooner
than we thought.

69
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,420
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

70
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,330
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

71
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,000
Because I know everything
you wanna say.

72
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,850
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

73
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,080
Which means you'll know
we've succeeded...

74
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,520
...about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

75
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,220
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

76
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,740
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day...

77
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,900
...you'll know we made it.

78
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,770
Okay.

79
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,880
I'm signing out.

80
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,210
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

81
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,790
<i>Icarus</i>, dial it down a little, will you?

82
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,230
<i>Yes, Corazon.</i>

83
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,040
Captain?

84
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,470
Captain?

85
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm guessing you've been
talking to Searle.

86
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,320
- So, do you have that report for me?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,790
Right here.

88
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,300
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

89
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,160
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

90
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,070
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

91
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,870
You're thinking about <i>Icarus I</i>.

92
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,700
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up...

93
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,850
...I don't think
it was a lack of oxygen.

94
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,020
Not on the outward journey,
at any rate.

95
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,150
Fuck.

96
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,690
Fuck.

97
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,090
- Mace.
- Mace.

98
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,230
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

99
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,300
- Fuck.
- Relax. Put it down.

100
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,530
You son of a bitch.

101
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,500
- <i>Fucker took an hour in there.</i>
- <i>Stop.</i>

102
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,010
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

103
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,580
- <i>Calm down.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.</i>

104
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,580
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

105
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,520
<i>What's up?</i>

106
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,810
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

107
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,850
So how does this work?

108
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
<i>Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?</i>

109
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,560
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

110
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,770
It's the time.

111
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,940
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

112
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,920
You just...

113
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,180
...lose track.

114
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,750
I know I fucked up.

115
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,730
From now on...

116
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,600
<i>...I'm not gonna lose track again.</i>

117
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,170
Prescription...

118
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,640
...Earth Room.

119
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,210
Two hours?

120
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,110
- And get a haircut, Mace.
- Yeah.

121
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,990
Bring back the waves.

122
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,070
<i>Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.</i>

123
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,900
The waves make me feel peaceful.

124
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,410
Again.

125
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,130
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

126
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,640
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

127
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,600
All right.

128
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,880
- Was that the apology?
- Yeah.

129
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,490
- Consider it accepted.
- Okay.

130
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,310
<i>It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant...</i>

131
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,650
<i>...which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.</i>

132
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,850
<i>None bigger than a raindrop...</i>

133
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,580
<i>...but we had 19 punctures...</i>

134
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,090
<i>...and a secondary contact
to the engine compartment.</i>

135
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,990
<i>Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.</i>

136
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,000
<i>Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.</i>

137
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,230
<i>I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.</i>

138
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,300
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was--</i>

139
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,840
<i>It was...</i>

140
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,940
<i>...beautiful.</i>

141
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,010
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was--</i>

142
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,540
<i>It was...</i>

143
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,850
<i>...beautiful.</i>

144
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,100
- <i>Mace?</i>
- Yeah.

145
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,240
<i>Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes...</i>

146
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,850
<i>...for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.</i>

147
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,940
Shit.

148
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,130
Guys...

149
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,170
...you wanna see something?

150
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,310
Well, I should have
a few words to say...

151
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,350
...but on reflection...

152
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,010
...what can one say?

153
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,380
Ladies and gentlemen.

154
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,410
Mercury.

155
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,050
Twenty-three hours ago,
on the comms systems--

156
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,920
While listening to your space music?

157
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,530
- -while scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

158
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,730
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

159
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,560
The iron content of the planet...

160
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,100
...is acting as an antenna.

161
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,760
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

162
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,740
<i>Icarus</i>, please play audio file 7-5/B.

163
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,010
<i>Yes, Harvey.</i>

164
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,620
End file.

165
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,230
What is it?

166
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,600
It's the <i>Icarus I</i>.

167
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,310
That signal is their distress beacon.

168
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,770
Jesus.

169
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,000
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

170
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,770
Clearly it's not impossible
because you can hear it.

171
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,970
- They're still alive?
- We don't know.

172
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,340
But they could be.
Oxygen is self-replenishing.

173
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,110
Water is recycled.

174
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,080
They have the solar power
they need.

175
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,950
What about food?
Their supplies couldn't last.

176
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,490
That depends.

177
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,290
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

178
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,360
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

179
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,530
We don't know what happened
to <i>Icarus I</i>.

180
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,830
There might have been an accident.

181
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

182
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,330
- Captain, do we know where they are?
- Well done, Capa. That is the question.

183
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,110
<i>Icarus</i>.

184
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,140
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

185
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,280
<i>Yes, captain.</i>

186
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,280
Now plot the source
of the <i>Icarus I</i> beacon.

187
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,460
Jesus. They almost made it.

188
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,100
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

189
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,400
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

190
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,070
We're gonna pass right by them.

191
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,570
Within 10 or 15 thousand miles.

192
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,730
Can anyone survive?

193
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,470
If the shield is intact.

194
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,910
We'll be able to see them?

195
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,250
Yes.

196
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,360
I'd need to look at all of this
pretty carefully. Very carefully.

197
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,760
But if I had to make a guess right now,
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

198
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,650
We could fly straight to them.

199
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,390
But we're not gonna do that.

200
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,840
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

201
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,430
Do I have to spell it out for you?

202
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,580
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

203
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,180
We're doing it
because that star is dying.

204
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,220
And if it dies, we die.

205
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,720
Everything dies.

206
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,680
So that is our mission.
There is nothing...

207
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,620
...literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

208
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,260
- He's right.
- He's right. Of course I'm right.

209
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,730
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

210
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,590
- May I put a counter argument?
- No.

211
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,130
Captain?

212
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,430
Go ahead.

213
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,300
It would, of course...

214
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,910
...be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the <i>Icarus I</i>.

215
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,440
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive...

216
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,980
...their lives are expendable
when seen in the context of our mission.

217
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,150
As are our own lives.

218
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,910
- Exactly.
- However...

219
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,320
...there is something onboard the
<i>Icarus I</i> that may be worth the detour.

220
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,120
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

221
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,320
A payload. Singular.

222
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,060
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload...

223
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,790
...is entirely theoretical.

224
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,630
Simply put...

225
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,170
...we don't know if it's gonna work.

226
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,570
But what we do know is this...

227
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,110
...if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

228
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,150
You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot <i>Icarus I</i>.

229
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,340
- Yes.
- Which is assuming...

230
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,980
...that whatever stopped them wasn't
a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.

231
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,130
- Yes.
- It's a lot of assumptions.

232
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,320
It is.

233
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,790
It's a risk assessment.

234
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,990
The question is:

235
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,100
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

236
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,640
- We'll have a vote.
- No, no.

237
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,480
No, we won't.

238
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,310
We are not a democracy.

239
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,850
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

240
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,480
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

241
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,960
Made by you, by any chance?

242
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,320
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities...

243
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,470
...of a payload delivery.

244
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,370
Our physicist.

245
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,040
Shit.

246
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,420
Okay, <i>Icarus</i>, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.

247
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,920
<i>Okay, payload delivery point reached.</i>

248
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,220
Detach the payload.

249
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,820
<i>Stellar bomb initiated and detached.</i>

250
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,430
<i>Crew and living section
have four minutes...</i>

251
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,430
<i>...to clear and commence
homeward journey.</i>

252
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,430
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

253
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,370
<i>Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.</i>

254
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,030
<i>Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.</i>

255
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,870
<i>Magnetic field structure open.</i>

256
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,610
<i>Temperature, 37,000.</i>

257
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,510
<i>Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.</i>

258
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,210
<i>Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.</i>

259
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,950
<i>Variables infinite.</i>

260
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,460
<i>Accuracy unknown.</i>

261
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,260
That's the problem right there.

262
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,800
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun...

263
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,800
...the velocity will be so great...

264
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,300
...space and time
will become smeared together.

265
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,600
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

266
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,570
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

267
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,740
- I need a decision.
- It's not a decision, it's a guess.

268
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,280
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

269
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,780
And?

270
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,250
Heads.

271
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,720
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

272
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,760
There's not gonna be
another payload.

273
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,170
The one we carry is our last chance.

274
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,100
Our last best hope.

275
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,070
Searle's argument is sound.

276
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,380
Two last hopes are better than one.

277
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,890
That's it.

278
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,500
<i>Slingshot complete.</i>

279
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,800
Icarus <i>leaving Mercury orbit.</i>

280
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,200
Hey.

281
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,200
Hey.

282
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
Good dream?

283
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,710
Let me guess.

284
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,020
The surface of the sun?

285
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,960
Only dream I ever have.

286
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,890
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

287
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,190
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

288
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,460
See if he can help you out.

289
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,700
Maybe.

290
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,610
I just wanted to let you know...

291
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,740
...I think you made the right decision.

292
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,380
Well.

293
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,420
Mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

294
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,060
Yeah...

295
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,220
...but I do.

296
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,990
- Get the alarm. What's going on?
- I screwed up.

297
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,090
It's not you. It's my responsibility.

298
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,490
- We shouldn't be straying.
- Trey, cut to it.

299
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,100
In order to change the route,
I had to manually override <i>Icarus</i>.

300
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,930
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double- and triple-checked them.

301
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,300
They all worked out.

302
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,440
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

303
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,800
What's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

304
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,240
The trajectory is good.

305
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,080
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1.1 degrees.

306
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,050
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

307
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,620
Jesus Christ, Trey.

308
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,960
I forgot.

309
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,960
My head was full of velocities and fuel
calculations and a million different--

310
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,930
I fucked up, all right?

311
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,440
People do shit.

312
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,340
They get stressed...

313
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,140
...and fuck up.

314
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,170
I fucked up.

315
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,180
Trey.

316
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,010
The fact is, we're still alive.

317
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,680
A hole hasn't burnt
in the side of the ship.

318
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,990
We don't have
a 10,000-degree climate.

319
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,030
- So, what's the actual damage?
- We don't know.

320
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,730
<i>Icarus</i> tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.

321
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,000
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

322
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,730
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

323
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,300
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

324
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,500
Okay.

325
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,510
I'll get suited up.

326
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,580
It's a two-man job.

327
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,350
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

328
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,510
- I volunteer.
- No, I volunteer.

329
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,420
Fine.

330
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,750
I volunteer Capa.

331
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,430
Sure.

332
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll do it.

333
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,630
Okay.

334
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,600
Okay.

335
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,970
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

336
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,240
Yeah.

337
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,140
You're gonna be fine.

338
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,340
Okay?

339
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,950
Okay, <i>Icarus</i>.

340
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm gonna be taking
control for a while.

341
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,600
- <i>Okay, Cassie.</i>
- I'm gonna be cutting speed.

342
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

343
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,270
- Do we understand each other?
- <i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

344
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,600
Rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose comm towers three and four.

345
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,270
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

346
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,140
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

347
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,340
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

348
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,150
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

349
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,480
All right, guys.

350
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,380
I'm opening up.

351
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,590
Okay.

352
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,650
<i>Helmet-cam operational.</i>

353
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,600
<i>Affirmative. Good image.</i>

354
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,030
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

355
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,870
<i>Affirmative.</i>

356
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,080
<i>Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.</i>

357
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,630
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

358
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,370
Okay, guys.

359
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,230
Nice and easy.

360
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,970
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

361
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,900
<i>Copy.</i>

362
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,410
Icarus<i>, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.</i>

363
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,750
<i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

364
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,390
<i>Establishing new alignment to sun.</i>

365
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,620
Jesus.

366
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,920
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

367
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,620
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

368
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,460
I know what it is, flyboy.

369
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,640
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

370
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,670
<i>Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.</i>

371
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,170
Copy, <i>Icarus</i>. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.

372
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,500
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

373
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,250
<i>You should see it up here, guys.</i>

374
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,350
<i>It's pretty impressive.</i>

375
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,570
<i>Okay.</i>

376
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,710
<i>There are four damaged panels.</i>

377
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,610
<i>They're about 300 meters out.</i>

378
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,630
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

379
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,530
Copy that, Cory.

380
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,870
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

381
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,030
Relaxed movement.

382
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,300
<i>Approaching the first panel.</i>

383
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,320
<i>We were lucky.</i>

384
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,790
<i>Can you guys see this?</i>

385
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,020
<i>We can see it.</i>

386
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,600
The hydraulics are burnt out.

387
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,060
<i>Let's get this closed.</i>

388
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,580
Okay, Mace.

389
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
That's it.

390
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,290
That's the first one closed.

391
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,060
You can do it?

392
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,530
<i>It'll take a while, but--</i>

393
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,460
Yeah.

394
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,300
We can do it.

395
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,110
Great job.

396
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,710
<i>Lots of smiling faces
in this room, guys.</i>

397
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,890
- <i>Great job.</i>
- <i>I love you, captain.</i>

398
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,760
<i>Moving to next panel.</i>

399
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,930
<i>Three to go.</i>

400
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,950
Hey.

401
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,580
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

402
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,860
What's going on, guys?

403
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,530
<i>The ship's moving.</i>

404
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,430
We're venting O2. Shit.

405
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,040
I think we're venting O2.

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,070

- Negative, <i>Icarus</i>.

<i>Fire in oxygen garden.</i>

416
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,960
No.

417
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,830
Seal oxygen feed.

418

- Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

- Seal sections five through nine.
- Sealing five through nine.

420
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,640
Kaneda, Capa,

421
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,220
Can't.

<i>Can't leave upright panels.</i>

423

<i>The ship will burn up if the shields

<i>Crew priority

<i>Get the fire out.</i>

445
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,630

<i>Hazard diagnostic complete.</i>

<i>Seventy-five percent chance of collateral

456
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,310
What are we gonna do?

457
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,220
- Flood it with O2.
- What?

458
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,760
It'll cause a flashover.
Make it burn itself out.

459
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,520
We'll lose the whole garden.

460
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,720
We already lost it.

461
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,260
<i>Jesus, Mace, I don't know.</i>

462
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,630

<i>Opening O2 tanks.</i>

465
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,140

00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,480

469
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,680
Please, I can do this.

470
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,980
Go.

471
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,500
Capa returning to airlock.

472
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,030

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,330
<i>Capa returning to airlock.

474
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,270
<i>Copy, Capa. Hurry.</i>

475
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,170
<i>Ninety-one percent of shield

476
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,310
<i>Ninety-four percent of shield

477
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,850
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

478
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,950
<i>Do you copy?</i>

479
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,860
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

480
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,330
<i>Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

481
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,560
Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.

482
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,060
You have to move now.

483
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,730
<i>Captain, it's right on you.</i>

484
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,430
- Kaneda's not gonna make it.
- <i>You have to move.</i>

485
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,570
<i>You have to move now.</i>

486
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,830
It's too far.

487
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,470
<i>Captain, move.</i>

488
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,570
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

489
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,710
<i>Kaneda.</i>

490
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,440
What do you see?

491
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,950
<i>Searle, tell our captain to move.</i>

492
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,220
Kaneda, what can you see?

493
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,190
<i>Searle, do you copy?</i>

494
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,510
Kaneda?

495
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,440
<i>Shield rotation complete.</i>

496
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,470
The breakdown is as follows.

497
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,470
Trey is sedated in the Med Centre.

498
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,300
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

499
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,780
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

500
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,720
As second in command,
I am now the captain of <i>Icarus II</i>.

501
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,220
Thanks both to Kaneda...

502
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,450
...and Capa, our shields are intact.

503
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,890
As is the payload.

504
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,830
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

505
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,170
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

506
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,900
As it stands now...

507
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,670
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

508
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,680
Let alone to survive
the return journey.

509
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,680
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

510
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,120
We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with <i>Icarus I</i>.

511
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,490
If we're gonna complete
the mission...

512
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,360
...the <i>Icarus I</i> is our only hope.

513
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,070
Technically, he made a mistake.

514
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,840
What are you trying to say, Cory?

515
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,680
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

516
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,880
But there is.

517
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,780
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

518
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,360
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

519
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,090
No.

520
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,290
And in any case...

521
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,290
...Trey wouldn't be enough.

522
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,700
We need to lose two more.

523
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,270
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

524
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,920
<i>Capa, it's me.</i>

525
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,090
It's different.

526
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,430
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

527
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,800
And then knowing that you won't.

528
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,470
Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from <i>Icarus I</i>.

529
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,170
No.

530
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,780
We're gonna die out here.

531
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,880
Like the other crew.

532
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,020
I know it.

533
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,750
So do you.

534
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,450
Are you scared?

535
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,560
When the stellar bomb is triggered...

536
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,370
...very little will happen at first.

537
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,740
<i>And then a spark
will pop into existence...</i>

538
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,780
<i>...and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...</i>

539
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,210
...it will split into two.

540
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,080
And those will split again...

541
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,160
...and again and again.

542
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,520
Detonation beyond all imagining.

543
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,160
A big bang on a small scale.

544
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,300
A new star born out of a dying one.

545
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,670
I think it'll be beautiful.

546
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,800
No. I'm not scared.

547
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,510
I am.

548
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,730
<i>Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.</i>

549
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,930
Okay, let's go.

550
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,070
Be careful, watch your step.

551
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,510
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

552
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,180
<i>Getting what?</i>

553
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,020
The air. It's full of dust.

554
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,860
Human skin.

555
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,120
What?

556
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,560
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

557
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,200
Sorry.

558
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,240
- No lights?
- No.

559
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,640
No surprise.

560
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,620
Anyone afraid of the dark?

561
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,540
We should split up.

562
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,310
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

563
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,150
Yeah, probably right.

564
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,490
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

565
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,100
<i>Icarus I</i> is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.

566
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,670
Okay. You're right.

567
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,230
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

568
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,900
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

569
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,940
Capa, aim for the payload.

570
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,680
I'll check the garden.

571
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,580
Let's keep in contact, guys.

572
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,720
Listen up, everybody.

573
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,960
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

574
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,520
<i>Can you see this?</i>

575
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,960
<i>It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.</i>

576
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,370
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

577
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,330
It's wonderful.

578
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,830
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

579
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,910
<i>Cory, look at the ferns.</i>

580
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,190
That's strange.

581
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,190
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

582
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,270
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

583
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,340
Got water.

584
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,770
Food.

585
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,690
No crew.

586
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,420
No bodies.

587
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,870
My God.

588
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,370
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

589
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,040
<i>I am Pinbacker.</i>

590
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,250
<i>Commander of the</i> Icarus I<i>.</i>

591
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,750
<i>We have abandoned our mission.</i>

592
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,720
<i>Our star is dying.</i>

593
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,750
<i>All our science...</i>

594
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,560
<i>...all our hopes...</i>

595
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,570
<i>...our dreams, are foolish.</i>

596
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,610
<i>In the face of this...</i>

597
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,140
<i>...we are...</i>

598
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,610
<i>...dust. Nothing more.</i>

599
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,990
<i>And to this dust, we will return.</i>

600
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,130
<i>When he chooses for us to die.</i>

601
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,530
<i>It is not our place...</i>

602
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,300
<i>...to challenge God.</i>

603
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,180
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

604
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,800
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

605
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,280
<i>That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.</i>

606
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,450
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

607
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,830
<i>Payload is fully operational.</i>

608
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,200
Say again, Capa?

609
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,070
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

610
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,050
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

611
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,850
No, we don't.

612
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,580
<i>Go ahead, Mace?</i>

613
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,220
I know what caused
the distress signal.

614
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,920
<i>There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...</i>

615
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,000
<i>...it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.</i>

616
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,600
<i>Without the mainframe, we can't fly.</i>

617
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,200
<i>It's been sabotaged.</i>

618
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,840
We should never have
gone off the mission.

619
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,060
I have something to say.

620
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,920
Found the crew.

621
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,250
What happened?

622
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,720
They had an epiphany.

623
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,780
They saw the light.

624
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,890
They burned themselves.

625
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,400
No shit.

626
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,930
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

627
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,400
If we weren't behind the screen
of <i>Icarus II</i>, we'd join them.

628
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,370
Ashes to ashes.

629
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,740
Stardust to stardust.

630
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,740
<i>Icarus!</i>

631
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,610
<i>Icarus</i>. Stabilizers.

632
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,930
- What was that?
- Guys, get back to the airlock, now.

633
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,970
<i>We have a major incident.</i>

634
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,940
<i>We are floating free from you.</i>

635
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,840
<i>Repeat, we are floating free.</i>

636
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,940
<i>All crew back to the airlock.</i>

637
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,050
- Cassie.
- <i>The airlock has decoupled.</i>

638
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,780
<i>We don't know why.</i>

639
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,620
<i>The locking system on</i> Icarus I
<i>is totally ripped open.</i>

640
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,990
I can hold our position but we aren't
gonna be able to dock again.

641
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,500
<i>There's another thing, guys.</i>

642
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,540
<i>You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.</i>

643
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,330
We're screwed.

644
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,370
No, we're not.

645
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,440
One of us isn't, anyway.

646
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,690
What happened?

647
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,860
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

648
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,850
- Why Capa?
- The rest of us are lower priority.

649
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,420
I'm not a low priority.

650
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,420
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

651
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,750
I am the captain.

652
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,990
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

653
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,100
Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of <i>Icarus</i> who can operate the payload.

654
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,690
There is no choice.

655
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,390
No, there's no choice for you.

656
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,400
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

657
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,610
Get out of the suit.

658
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,940
That is a direct order.

659
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,420
I assure you, when I'm onboard <i>Icarus II</i>
that I'll do everything within my power--

660
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,150
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

661
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,880
The airlock is ripped in half.

662
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,760
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

663
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,910
Cassie.

664
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,070
Go.

665
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,230
<i>Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.</i>

666
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,280
<i>So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?</i>

667
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,840
Right.

668
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,350
<i>If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.</i>

669
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,310
And so will we.

670
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,680
Without suits?

671
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,990
- Get as close as you can.
- You'll have 20 meters to cover.

672
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,790
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

673
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,770
It's gonna be cold.

674
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,110
But we'll make it.

675
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,310
Anyone got any better ideas?

676
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,850
Copy that.

677
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,030
Mace.

678
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,470
One problem.

679
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,970
The computer's down.

680
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,700
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

681
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,880
From inside.

682
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,040
Shit.

683
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,050
You're right.

684
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,250
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

685
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,390
I see. I get it.

686
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,900
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

687
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,060
No, Harvey.

688
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,260
It's me.

689
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,720
You okay?

690
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,790
Hey, Capa.

691
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,790
We're only stardust.

692
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,940
<i>Mace, we're lined up.</i>

693
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,240
<i>Everything's set.</i>

694
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,810
Searle, are you ready?

695
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,890
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

696
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,090
Cassie.

697
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,500
- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- Ready.

698
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,400
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

699
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,700
Copy.

700
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,310
Let's do it.

701
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,790
<i>Crew detected in airlock.</i>

702
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,490
<i>Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.</i>

703
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,220
<i>I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.</i>

704
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,890
- <i>Harvey's gone.</i>
- <i>Crew detected in airlock.</i>

705
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,830
<i>Sealing outer airlock door.</i>

706
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,410
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

707
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,740
Get my hand. Get my hand.

708
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,340
- Breathe, Mace.
- Capa?

709
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,340
You're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

710
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,070
- Capa, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

711
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,540
Let's get you out of here.

712
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,610
<i>Searle?</i>

713
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,250
<i>We're leaving now.</i>

714
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,790
<i>We're gonna complete the mission.</i>

715
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,790
<i>We're all thinking of you, Searle.</i>

716
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,190
<i>Searle?</i>

717
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,170
<i>We're gonna go now.</i>

718
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,040
<i>We love you.</i>

719
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,860
I've been through <i>Icarus's</i> activity file
and I checked it.

720
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,200
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

721
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,740
And it's the same results.

722
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:53,510
In other words, unless <i>Icarus</i> is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.

723
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,810
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

724
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:00,440
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

725
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,720
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

726
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,880
And I was with Capa and Searle.

727
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,890
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

728
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,700
Which leaves one possibility.

729
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,330
Trey.

730
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,170
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

731
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:22,040
He sleeps for 23 hours a day.
And he blames himself for everything.

732
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,770
- Why would he do it?
- We don't know.

733
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,710
The possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

734
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,210
By doping him up more?

735
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:34,450
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock.

736
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,890
There is something else too.

737
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,590
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

738
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,360
If Trey dies...

739
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,810
...we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

740
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,200
At least now we know what happened
on <i>Icarus I</i>.

741
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,640
- The same thing that's happening here.
- Fuck you, Capa.

742
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:01,010
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

743
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,410
I'll do it.

744
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,160
I'm not passing any bucks.

745
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,660
Do it how?

746
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,390
That's between me and Trey.

747
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,070
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

748
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,740
So you know where I stand.

749
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,970
And me.

750
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,320
What are you asking?

751
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,150
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

752
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,190
Kill him.

753
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,490
Cassie?

754
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,000
No.

755
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,640
- Cassie.
- I know the argument.

756
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,870
I know the logic.

757
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,810
You're saying you need my vote.

758
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,480
I'm saying you can't have it.

759
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,960
What do we do?

760
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,370
Oh, God.

761
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,900
I'm sorry, Cassie.

762
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,240
You make it easy for him.

763
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,420
Somehow.

764
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,320
Find a kindness.

765
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,180
Trey.

766
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,560
<i>Everybody get here now.</i>

767
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:18,900
He cut his wrists.

768
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,280
He took responsibility.

769
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:26,760
All these deaths.

770
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,360
Kaneda.

771
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,990
Searle. Harvey.

772
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,630
Trey.

773
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,920
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

774
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,530
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say shit.

775
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,870
I just want you to know that this...

776
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,030
...belongs here.

777
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,170
Fuck you.

778
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,630
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

779
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,560
- <i>Icarus?</i>
- <i>Yes, Capa?</i>

780
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,370
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

781
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,030
Check oxygen consumption.

782
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,340
<i>Checking.</i>

783
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,610
Thank you.

784
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,750
<i>Capa.</i>

785
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,720
- Yes?
- <i>You are dying.</i>

786
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,950
<i>All crew are dying.</i>

787
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,950
We know we're dying.

788
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,890
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

789
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:15,260
...we're okay with it.

790
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,020
<i>Capa, warning.</i>

791
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,140
<i>You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.</i>

792
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,960
Please clarify.

793
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,910
<i>Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.</i>

794
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,740
<i>Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.</i>

795
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,710
<i>Sixteen hours until death.</i>

796
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,370
<i>Journey time to delivery point:</i>

797
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,950
- <i>Nineteen hours.</i>
- Impossible. Corazon was certain.

798
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,450
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

799
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,560
<i>Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves--</i>

800
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:48,090
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

801
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,290
<i>Negative.</i>

802
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,400
Affirmative, <i>Icarus</i>. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.

803
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,590
<i>Five crew members.</i>

804
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,600
<i>Icarus?</i>

805
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,370
<i>Yes?</i>

806
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,180
Who's the fifth crew member?

807
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,180
<i>Unknown.</i>

808
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,850
Where is the fifth crew member?

809
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,820
<i>In the Observation Room.</i>

810
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,030
Are you an angel?

811
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,560
Has the time come?

812
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,040
I've been waiting so long.

813
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,710
Who are you?

814
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,050
Who am I?

815
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,960
At the end of time...

816
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,730
...a moment will come
when just one man remains.

817
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,270
Then the moment will pass.

818
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,110
The man will be gone.

819
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,780
There will be nothing to show
as if we were ever here...

820
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,190
...but stardust.

821
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:00,890
The last man, alone with God.

822
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:06,360
Am I that man?

823
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,240
My God.

824
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,280
My God, Pinbacker?

825
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,420
Not your God.

826
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,250
Mine.

827
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,770
<i>Icarus</i>. Full sunlight.

828
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:07,050
Anyone.

829
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,240
Oh, my God.

830
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,710
<i>Icarus?</i>

831
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,430
<i>Warning, you do not have
authority to remove...</i>

832
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,890
<i>...the mainframe panels
from the coolant.</i>

833
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:20,830
<i>Please return the panels
to the coolant.</i>

834
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,730
<i>I cannot locate
your biometric signs.</i>

835
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,210
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

836
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:53,600
You gotta be kidding.

837
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:12,550
My God.

838
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,800
A baby.

839
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,390
A beautiful baby.

840
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:29,060
<i>Icarus</i>, patch me through to Mace.
I have something...

841
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,760
...wonderful to show him.

842
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,430
Or Cassie or Capa.

843
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,900
<i>Icarus?</i>

844
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,720
Don't fight.

845
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,920
Don't fight.

846
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,850
Mace?

847
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,480
Capa?

848
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:00,520
Is anyone else getting silence
from <i>Icarus?</i>

849
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,000
Anybody?

850
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,880
Capa?

851
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,940
<i>Icarus</i>, why are we in orbit?

852
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,850
Respond.

853
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,210
What?

854
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,550
Jesus Christ.

855
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,950
Capa? Capa?

856
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,930
<i>In the suit.</i>

857
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,570
<i>Use the hard link.</i>

858
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,830
<i>In the helmet.</i>

859
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,590
Mace?

860
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,100
- <i>What the hell is going on?</i>
- Mace?

861
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,970
I can't talk to <i>Icarus</i>.

862
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,480
<i>Pinbacker is onboard.
He's trying to stop the mission.</i>

863
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:29,480
<i>He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.</i>

864
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,660
<i>Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.</i>

865
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,770
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

866
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,030
The mechanism is disabled.

867
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,970
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

868
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,010
Mace, repeat, please.

869
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,540
<i>Icarus</i> is gonna burn out.

870
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,610
Mace.

871
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,520
<i>Mace, come in.</i>

872
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,160
Come on.

873
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,500
<i>Capa.</i>

874
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,700
- <i>Capa.</i>
- Mace?

875
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:46,940
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

876
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:50,980
<i>I don't know if I can get her
back online.</i>

877
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:54,950
<i>You have to break us out
of orbit manually.</i>

878
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,680
<i>The only way to do that...</i>

879
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,830
...is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

880
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,790
<i>Force the bomb into the sun.</i>

881
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,030
Separate the payload.

882
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:10,060
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

883
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,730
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

884
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:17,010
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

885
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:19,840
<i>Okay.</i>

886
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,550
<i>I'm gonna do this.</i>

887
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:25,010
Copy, Mace.

888
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,180
Copy.

889
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,410
Capa.

890
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,610
My leg.

891
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,460
Oh, God.

892
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,100
Do it, Capa.

893
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,800
Do it.

894
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,080
Mace.

895
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,600
Come on.

896
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,320
<i>Only dream I ever have.</i>

897
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,100
<i>Is it the surface of the sun?</i>

898
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,840
<i>Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.</i>

899
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:01,550
Cassie?

900
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:11,660
Cassie?

901
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,100
We're flying into the sun.

902
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,110
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

903
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,750
Where is he? Is he here?

904
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:31,090
For seven years I spoke with God.

905
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:42,030
He told me to take us all to heaven.

906
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,300
No.

907
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:35,550
Finish it.

908
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:55,870
Let's say 25. Set at 25.

909
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,510
Please.

910
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,150
Please.

911
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,890
<i>Hi, sis.</i>

912
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,930
<i>Kiss the kids.</i>

913
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:17,940
You guys, come on.

914
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:20,440
It's time.

915
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:27,750
<i>So if you wake up one morning...</i>

916
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,320
<i>...and it's a particularly beautiful day,
you'll know we made it.</i>

917
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,450
<i>Okay.</i>

918
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,630
<i>I'm signing out.</i>
