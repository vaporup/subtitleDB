That's why I wanna put her

she's in misery?

that last bullet
for yourself?

Don't be telling me
how to do this, Maconel.

It's only because
you're lamer than I am,

00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,234
All the way.

351
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,734
You know, I just think
it's so great what you did.

352
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,334
Now maniacs will think twice
before going crazy.

353
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,300
[bell dings]

354
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,734
He's waiting for you,
Mr. Maconel.

355
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,400
It's right through
those doors.

356
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,801
 <i>** [Woman scatting]</i>

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,501
Oh, you can go right in,
Mr. Maconel.

358
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,200
Right through
those doors.

359
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,067
There he is.
Come on in, Bob.

360
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,501
I am so glad
to finally meet you.

361
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,701
Can-- Can I get you anything?

362
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,734
Something to drink?
A Pepsi or something?

363
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,968
Oh, Bob,
this is Maurice Gregory.

364
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,968
I brought Maurice in
to help the employees

365
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,367
work through their anxiety

366
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,701
during the healing process.

367
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,367
Maurice is a good man
and a gifted psychiatrist.

368
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,934
Psychiatrist?
Grief counselor.

369
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,801
Here, have a seat.

370
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,667
Have <i>my</i> seat.
[chuckles]

371
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,200
Sit down, sit down.

372
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,367
A lot of people asked
about you at the eulogy.

373
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,968
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I wanted to--

374
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,701
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You don't have
to explain yourself.

375
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,300
No, I'm sure this
has been a little bit
overwhelming to you.

376
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
It has.

377
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
But you've gotta
understand,

378
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,534
It takes a very
rare individual

379
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,801
to keep his head

380
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,133
and then take action

381
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,701
in the face
of certain death.

382
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,767
I'm a veteran.

383
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,534
I've had my scrapes,
let me tell you.

384
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,200
But I knew
who my enemy was.

385
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,734
I knew what I was getting
into on the way in.

386
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,567
These days...

387
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,367
it can come
from anywhere...

388
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,567
at any time...

389
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,033
from anyone.

390
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,667
That's true.

391
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,501
Forgive my morbid
curiosity,

392
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,767
but did you actually
see it happen?

393
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,534
I saw...

394
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,868
bodies hit the floor.

395
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,234
Jesus.

396
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,667
How did you manage
to not get shot?

397
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,767
Well, I was...

398
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,901
[clears throat]

399
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,801
I was-- I dropped
a paper clip,

400
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,567
so I was already
on the floor.

401
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, my God.

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,767
Can you imagine that?
A paper clip saved his life.

403
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,234
But then you saw
your fellow workers dying
right in front of your eyes.

404
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,801
It must have made you
feel terrible.

405
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,601
That was a really
stupid thing to say.

406
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,901
Of course
you felt terrible.

407
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,901
What am I thinking?
What else are you gonna feel?

408
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:04,267
But then you
pulled it together.

409
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,701
Right?

410
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,434
And you, um...

411
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,968
And, uh...

412
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,467
And, well,
here we are.

413
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:16,000
All right, enough of this
depressing conversation.

414
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,434
I'm sure that you
and Maurice

415
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,300
will hash out
that nightmare later.

416
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,334
Right now I want you
to come with me.
Come on.

417
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,234
Bob, come on.

418
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,467
I pride myself
on recognizing potential,

419
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:31,968
and as tragic
as this event has been,

420
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,901
it's opened my eyes
to a real talent

421
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:36,501
that's been going to waste
right beneath my nose.

422
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,033
I'm glad I met you.
Me?

423
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,567
And don't try to tell me
you're satisfied

424
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,000
with your present
position here.

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,133
Yeah.
I know, I know.

426
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,234
You feel wasted,
unchallenged,

427
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,567
like you've got good ideas

428
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,901
but no one
will listen, right?

429
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:48,567
Come on,
be honest with me.

430
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,934
It has been a long time
since anybody asked me
what I thought.

431
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah, well,
those days are over,

432
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,501
because from now on,
I want to know

433
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,734
what Bob Maconel
is thinking every day.

434
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,601
Welcome to your new
think tank.

435
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,901
So, tell me, Bob.

436
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,834
What are you thinking now?

437
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm thinking how
I requested a window
for years,

438
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,801
and they said they
didn't have any left.

439
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,534
Yeah, well, a few
became available
last week.

440
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:16,734
That's right.

441
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,601
This is the office
of one of the victims.

442
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,267
My personal assistant.
Vanessa Parks?

443
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,567
Vanessa died?

444
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,801
No, no.

445
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,000
But she won't
be coming back.

446
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,901
[click tongue]
Did you know her?

447
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,467
Just her smile.
[helicopter approaching]

448
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,167
Yeah, she could light up
a room with that.

449
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,000
Did you go to visit her
at Saint Michael's?

450
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,367
No.

451
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,033
No?

452
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,434
Bob.

453
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,501
You've got
to go visit her.
Why?

454
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,400
Why? Because you
saved her life.

455
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
My God, man, the woman
is probably desperate
to thank you.

456
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,534
She doesn't even
know my name.

457
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,701
I'm not suggesting it, Bob.

458
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:49,834
I'm telling you.

459
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,400
Go visit her today.

460
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,067
During work hours?

461
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,567
Think of it as
your first assignment...

462
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,801
as Vice President
of Creative Thinking.

463
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,033
You're gonna pay me
to think?

464
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,701
It's a crazy world.

465
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:06,934
Oh, oh, oh, Bob.

466
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:09,133
When you, uh--
When you go see Vanessa,

467
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,634
I want you to take
this with you

468
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,734
and give it
to her personally.

469
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:15,067
It's just some
final work papers.

470
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:17,501
Oh, wait, Bob.

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,467
Why don't you take
your company car?

472
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,434
[keys clatter]

473
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,234
[bell dings]

474
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:39,000
Christ Almighty,
it's Maconel.

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,467
You sly dog,
playing possum
all these years.

476
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,234
Certainly had me fooled.

477
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,801
You know, I heard you
were back, but I didn't
see you in the pit.

478
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,234
I'm upstairs now.

479
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:48,334
And rightfully so.

480
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,868
All right,
now the big question.

481
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,534
How many rounds

482
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,434
did you pump into that
sick-ass Coleman, huh?

483
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,667
Come on, Bob.
How many?

484
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,167
Two, three?
Five.

485
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,968
Five!

486
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,067
Pay up, sucker.

487
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,167
Hey, last time I doubt
this man's drive.

488
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,701
Oh, Bob.

489
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,100
You should join
our foursome.

490
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,667
We could use somebody
with your killer instinct

491
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,868
on the back nine.
Oh, man.

492
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,133
Cooper's guys would shit
if we brought him out.

493
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,734
Yeah.
[bell dings]

494
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,834
Hey, uh, happy hour
this evening.

495
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:15,934
Barney's.

496
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,567
It's right across
the street.

497
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,200
Lose the briefcase, Bob.
You're an executive now.

498
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:50,968
[alarm chirps]

499
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,367
I'd like to visit
Vanessa Parks.

500
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,367
That poor girl.

501
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,367
Your name?

502
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,467
 Bob Maconel.

503
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,767
Bob Maconel?

504
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,534
 <i>The</i> Bob Maconel?
Yeah.

505
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,567
Honey, you gotta learn
to speak up.

506
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,701
My husband thinks
you should run for mayor.

507
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,133
[chuckles]

508
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,234
Hey, Thelma!
Thelma, answer my phones.

509
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,234
I gotta take
Bob Maconel here
to visit Vanessa.

510
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,300
We were so proud to see you.
It's wonderful what-- 

511
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,267
It's this way--
It's wonderful
what you did.

512
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,868
In fact, we have your picture
hanging in the cafeteria.

513
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:34,801
And of course,
everybody wants you
to sign it.

514
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,334
How is she?

515
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,901
You haven't heard?

516
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:40,133
Only that she isn't
coming back to work.

517
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,601
That bullet was right
in her spine.

518
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,968
After the swelling went down
and they removed it,

519
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:47,000
the nerves never got
back together again.

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,334
What are you saying?
She's--

521
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,734
[whispers]
Paralyzed.

522
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:52,334
How much?
Like, her legs?

523
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,234
Vanessa?

524
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,901
There's a visitor here
to see you.

525
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,901
No, no.

526
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,267
Honey,
it's Bob Maconel.

527
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,300
It's the hula man.

528
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,234
[chuckles]

529
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,634
Be right outside.

530
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,167
So, you're the man
that saved me.

531
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,567
I guess so.

532
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:21,701
I've been wanting so much
to meet you.

533
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:25,667
Can you come here?

534
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,701
[whispers]
Closer.

535
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,000
Closer.

536
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,200
[whispers]
Closer.

537
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,901
[gasps]

538
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,100
Son of a bitch!

539
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,834
I was a goddess.

540
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,367
Now look at me!
I can't move!

541
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,801
I can't dance!

542
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,968
I certainly can't
fuck now, can I?

543
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,200
[grunting]

544
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,501
You should have let
Coleman finish the job!

545
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,901
You should have let me die!

546
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:17,000
Fuck You!
[sobbing]

547
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,801
I should have died.

548
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,834
You should have
let him kill me.

549
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,267
Fuck!

550
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,901
I hate you!

551
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,200
Hey, Maconel.
[rapping on window]

552
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,300
Just in time.
We're going to Barney's.

553
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,167
Come on.
Put it in park
and shake a leg.

554
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,868
It's happy hour.
I don't want to be happy.

555
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,968
Nonsense.
Everybody wants
to be happy.

556
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,801
I have to punch in
my time card.

557
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,601
What, are you nuts?
Executives don't have
time cards.

558
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,901
Come on.
I don't drink.

559
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:09,634
Great. It saves more
for the rest of us!
Right.

560
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,868
[crowd cheering]

561
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,868
Doesn't drink, my ass.

562
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,767
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

563
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:22,834
Oh.

564
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:23,901
That was six.

565
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,567
[crowd cheering]

566
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,968
Bob...

567
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,434
I gotta admit...

568
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,801
that day...

569
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,000
I about shit my pants

570
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
when I saw Coleman
raise that gun at me.

571
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,267
Cliché as it sounds,
my whole life flashed
before my eyes,

572
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,434
and I can't say
I'm proud of much of it.

573
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,367
But you-- God.

574
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,901
You.

575
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:56,601
You're standing there
cool as ice...

576
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:01,400
staring that guy down
one-on-one.

577
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,834
It's amazing.

578
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,534
It's fucking amazing.

579
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,467
Yeah, but there's--

580
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,901
There's one question
that's been stuck
in my brain.

581
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,901
If you had a gun,

582
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:18,000
why did you wait till
the shooting stopped
to use it?

583
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
[crowd cheering]

584
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,634
Hey, forget it.

585
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,400
You know,
the important
thing is...

586
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,767
that I didn't get
my ass blown off
that day,

587
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,801
and I know
I probably have you
to thank for it.

588
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,033
Uh, another round here.

589
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,467
Ugh, no six.

590
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,767
Oh, shit.
There he is.

591
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:37,834
The Mind Fucker.
[laughing]

592
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,467
I need to go home.

593
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,067
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey.

594
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:44,067
Oh, hey, Bob.
You okay?

595
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,334
Man, he's
fucked up!

596
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,267
Uh, somebody ought
to drive him home.

597
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,434
Yeah, well,
I'm in the other
direction.

598
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:54,801
I'll take him home.

599
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,767
[Paula]
Now, I hope you didn't

600
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,100
take what I said
last week too seriously.

601
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,033
I mean, a girl's got
to protect herself

602
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,834
from getting stuck
with a loser.

603
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,267
You know,

604
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,234
a guy with no future,

605
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,801
no balls.

606
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,367
It's not you, Bob.

607
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,334
I mean, everyone knows that
you've got a great future.

608
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,734
Now, as for the balls...

609
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,667
you've certainly
proven it.

610
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,434
Ugh.
You've got a great
big set of those.

611
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:29,868
I'd be more than honored

612
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:33,667
if you'd like to take
another look down my blouse.

613
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,000
Actually....

614
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,167
No!

615
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,367
Oh, fuck!

616
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,767
** [pop]

617
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:46,200
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

618
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,100
[Man]
Hey, nice tits!

619
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
[honking]
Fuck you,
asshole! Fuck!

620
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,634
Hi.

621
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,868
[Fish]
Hello? Hey, Shithead.

622
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,701
Get up.

623
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,634
Wake up!

624
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,734
Christ Almighty.

625
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,467
The master lives.

626
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,234
Now, could you feed us
before we all die?

627
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:16,434
You'd better hurry,

628
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,968
Stripes is rolling
for the third time.

629
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:22,567
You happen to see the lady
that brought me here?

630
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,667
Don't work
that way, Bob.
[grunting]

631
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:28,334
You don't see it,
we don't see it.
Remember?

632
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,067
[clears throat]
Nice tits, though.

633
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,000
[breathing heavily]

634
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,234
Bob.

635
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,834
There he is.

636
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,601
My best
drinkin' buddy.

637
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:42,601
So, uh, Bob,

638
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,934
was it hot, huh?

639
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,601
Was she everything
she thinks she is?

640
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:46,901
I honestly can't say.

641
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,434
Okay, a gentleman.
[chuckling]

642
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,200
Okay.
We're going to have
to work on that.

643
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,834
Have you seen her?
No.

644
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,300
Not yet, but, uh,

645
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,767
I did see Mr. Shelby. 
He's looking for you,

646
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,234
some important assignment

647
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,701
you were supposed
to take care of?

648
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,167
[whispering]
Yes.

649
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,667
I got to go.

650
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,667
Hey, Bob.

651
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Bob?

652
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,667
[whimpering]

653
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:16,033
[tires squealing]

654
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,467
I need to see
Vanessa Parks.

655
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,968
Oh, that poor girl,
are you a relative?
No.

656
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,901
Well, only relatives
are allowed in during
non-visiting hours.

657
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm Bob Maconel.

658
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,667
Oh, I don't believe
you're here--

659
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,934
I know I upset her before--

660
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:30,667
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.
What?

661
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,868
Vanessa. She wanted
to see you again.

662
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,567
 <i>[Woman on intercom]</i>
 <i>Dr. Steven Chang</i>
 <i>to Cardio-Path Lab,</i>

663
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,601
 <i>Dr. Steven Chang...</i>

664
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,801
Hi.

665
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:45,300
Can you close
the door, please?

666
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,000
Certainly was fast.

667
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,968
Actually, I was
coming to see you.

668
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,133
I was supposed to give
this to you yesterday.

669
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,033
[door closes]
It's from Mr. Shelby.

670
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm sure he would
have delivered it
himself, but uh,

671
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,601
he's been real busy
with everything
that's happened.

672
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,868
I'm sure.

673
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,501
I could open it
and read it to you.

674
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,400
No.

675
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:13,434
Well, where would you
like me to put it?

676
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,200
How about straight
up his ass?

677
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,267
Okay.

678
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:19,234
[sighing]
I'm sorry, I--

679
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:20,901
I didn't mean
to snap at you.

680
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:24,133
It's okay.
No, it's not.

681
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:27,367
I want to apologize
for the way I treated
you before.

682
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:32,067
It was completely unfair
to blame you for my...

683
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,567
for my condition.

684
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,100
You risked your life
to save me.

685
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,701
You had no idea
I'd end up like this.

686
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,367
Maybe you would've
acted differently

687
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:44,000
if you knew I'd never
be able to use another
body part again,

688
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,367
or that I'd have to rely
on people for the rest
of my life

689
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,400
to feed me and clothe me...

690
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,067
and diaper me.

691
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:55,601
You think you would have?

692
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,834
Would have what?

693
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,167
Acted differently.

694
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,334
Yes.

695
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:08,100
I knew it, I knew you
were a compassionate man.

696
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,167
That's why you're the only one
that I can ask this favor of.

697
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,767
I want you to finish
what Coleman started.

698
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,701
Bob,

699
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,868
I don't want
to live this way.

700
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,801
I can't live like this.

701
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:35,133
My spirit will die
a million times every day.

702
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,300
If you have any feelings
for me at all,

703
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,834
you'll help me
through it.

704
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,567
[whispering]
Please.

705
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,234
I can't do this anymore.

706
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,400
You're asking me
to end your life?

707
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,567
[sighing]

708
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,601
It's already over.

709
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,901
I get released

710
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,200
to home care
Wednesday at five.

711
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,767
If I don't see you then,
I-- I'll understand.

712
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:28,400
[knocking]

713
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,701
There you are.
Mr. Shelby.

714
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:30,834
Sit, sit, sit.

715
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,033
So, did you complete
the assignment?

716
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,033
I delivered it
to her personally.

717
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,367
Excellent.

718
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,767
Did she say anything
when you told her
it was from me?

719
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,100
No.

720
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,701
Did she open it?

721
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,567
Vanessa's a quadriplegic.

722
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,968
She's completely paralyzed.

723
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,167
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

724
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,801
I'm, uh, just having so much
trouble accepting this.

725
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,033
I had no idea
that losing her

726
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,634
would affect the company
the way it has.

727
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,667
She did more than just
brighten this place up.

728
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:03,601
She did the little things
that nobody else will.

729
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,934
I feel a little bit
lost without her.

730
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,200
Well, if you...

731
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,601
need any help filling
in the gaps, I can try.

732
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,567
You wouldn't mind?

733
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,667
It might help
with my thinking.

734
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,801
All right, then.

735
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:22,434
I guess you could
take this over, hah.

736
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,868
It's my wife's latest
attempt to get published.

737
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,400
We need 50 copies of that
by tomorrow to send out.

738
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,334
Oh, and um, when you
finish with that,

739
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,300
could you pick up
these suits at Armine's?

740
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,567
They, um...

741
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,200
close at three.

742
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,467
Bob, Bob.

743
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,467
When are you
coming to see me?

744
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,400
I have to get
these copied.

745
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,634
Uh, can I help you?
I got it.

746
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,300
Hey, have you ever
used this machine?

747
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,567
A copier's a copier.

748
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,300
Ha, look,

749
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,901
I know you're the "big hero"
around here, having shot
the bad guy and all,

750
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,067
but operating the 349
isn't as easy as pointing
and pulling a trigger,

751
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,968
you know what
I'm saying, Bob?

752
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:19,300
These have
to be perfect,

753
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,868
they're for
Mr. Shelby himself.

754
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:23,267
I'll be gentle.

755
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,200
I hear you've been
looking for me.

756
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,167
Oh.

757
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,367
Quite a night,
wasn't it, hm?

758
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,601
What happened?
You don't remember?

759
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,767
[chuckling]
Well, I, uh,

760
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,200
I know now why you're
such a quiet man.

761
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,834
Why?

762
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:44,000
Because you
don't have much
to talk about...

763
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,300
down there.

764
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,901
[giggling]
Don't worry, baby.

765
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,601
[whispering]
It'll be our little secret.

766
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,234
[laughing]

767
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,701
It was supposed to be you.

768
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,968
[continues laughing]

769
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:08,033
Vanessa Parks is paralyzed
because she looks like you.

770
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,667
What?

771
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,167
Coleman made a mistake.

772
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,868
Okay.
[chuckling]

773
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,334
You just dissed
Paula Metzler.

774
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,267
You really are
a bad-ass.

775
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,200
[Bob]
She doesn't know
how lucky she is.

Just ask Vanessa.

Shut up!

792
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,467

00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,334
How appropriate,

Yours?

800

What else did Shelby
give you of mine?

801
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,901
Your office.

802
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,801
I think your job.

803
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,367
Well, whatever you do,
don't sleep with him.

804

I won't.

805
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:48,567
Okay, let me see
how to do this.

806
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,601
All right?
Yup.

807
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,801
That's it.

808
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,634
This one around
my chest, here,

809
00:44:02,634 --> 00:44:04,200
there's this clip
in the back.

810
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,634
All right.

811
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,767
You going
to be all right,

[clearing throat]

813
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,133
Don't worry,
I won't feel anything
if you touch me.

814
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:29,567
[mumbling
indistinctly]

815
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay.

00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,667
Uh, well, maybe--

818
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:39,868
maybe not everything.

Now what?

827
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:08,367
Just get me
out of here.

828
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,501
[Vanessa]
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

829
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,801
and I think
I've figured out
a way for you to do this

830
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:18,167
without getting
any blood on your hands.

831
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,501
The last thing I want
is for you to get into
any trouble over this.

832
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,234
Legally or spiritually.

833
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,234
And I'm not taking
any bullshit pills either.

834
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,701
I'm going out
the same way I came in...

835
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,634
dramatically.

836
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,767
There's a station
on the Red Line,

837
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,834
one where
the South Express
doesn't stop.

838
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,701
The concrete
in the waiting area
is sloped, not very much,

839
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,033
but it's smooth
all the way down.

840
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,167
So, just position me
at the top,

841
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,467
and when we feel
the train coming,

842
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:50,400
just let me go,
and gravity will take over.

843
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,767
What station?

844
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:57,534
Franklin Street.

845
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:59,300
The one by
the Crown Superstore?

846
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,901
Yeah.

847
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,267
Is it a busy station?

848
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,634
Yeah, but it clears out
at about midnight or so.

849
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,033
You hungry? You want
to get something to eat?

850
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:14,033
Are you asking me
to dinner, Bob?

851
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,634
I guess.

852
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:17,567
[laughing]

853
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:20,767
There's a...

854
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,801
Sizzler up here
a little ways.

855
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,968
Sizzler?

856
00:46:24,968 --> 00:46:27,200
Look, Bob, if this
is going to be
my last meal,

857
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,133
I'd like it to be
something special.

858
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,734
I don't get out much,
Sizzler's all I know.

859
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:39,434
Then this will be a treat
for the both of us.

860
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:43,300
Right, this way, sir,

861
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,000
we have a lovely table
for you, hidden away
in the back.

862
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,934
[bang]
Oh.

863
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,067
Six months I've been
trying to get a table here,

864
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,400
you've always been
too crowded?

865
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,767
Well, tonight must be
your lucky night.

866
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:59,267
Oh, yeah, it's amazing
what a bullet to the spine
will do for your luck.

867
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:02,234
I should
go out and get
some Quick Picks!

868
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,467
I'm sure you'll have
a wonderful time here
at the restaurant.

869
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,167
Here you are.

870
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,367
Your waiter
will tell you
about the specials.

871
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,868
God, I hate snobs.

872
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,534
Then why eat here?

873
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:21,934
Because it's
supposed to be
the best in the city,

874
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:24,133
and I don't want you
to forget this night.

875
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,133
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

876
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:28,868
You're not going to chicken
out on me, are you, Bob?

877
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:29,968
No.

878
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:31,234
Because this will
be a wasted meal

879
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,434
if you don't go
through with it.

880
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,734
It's not a wasted meal.

881
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,634
Then stop looking
so goddamn sad.

882
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:38,000
Sir,

883
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,367
Madam,

884
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,167
would you like
to hear the specials?

885
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,634
Oh, no need, we'll take
the two most expensive
dishes on the menu.

886
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,033
[Waiter]
Excellent choice.

887
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:47,467
I imagine you'd like
a bottle of Opus One
to wash it down?

888
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:48,868
You read my mind.

889
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,434
I'll bring it
right over.

890
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,601
Don't worry, if you
really have my job,

891
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:56,400
you can afford it.

892
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,100
Aren't you going
to miss anything?

893
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,667
Your friends,
your family...

894
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,767
Bob, how many flowers
were in my room?

895
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:06,033
I don't remember.
None.

896
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:08,634
And how many people
came to wish me well?

897
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:11,667
I don't know.
None.

898
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,267
And who came
to see me today?

899
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,901
The day I got
to go home?

900
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:18,534
Just me.

901
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,400
Just you.

902
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,934
You're such a beautiful woman,
so full of life, your smile--

903
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,567
Yeah, I could light
up a room, I know,

904
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,434
it's my first
line of offense.

905
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,968
I don't understand.

906
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:32,701
I'm 26 years old, Bob.
26?

907
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah, and I was a heartbeat
away from being Senior VP

908
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,767
at a Fortune 500
company in just
one year on the job.

909
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,801
You're an incredibly
educated woman--

910
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,968
No, no I'm not.

911
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:49,467
My entire extended
schooling is two years
at Valley Junior College.

912
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,868
I have a brain, Bob,
but the only reason why

913
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,601
I got to where I am
so fast is because,

914
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,634
one, I was a complete
knockout, and two,

915
00:48:55,634 --> 00:48:59,234
I gave the best goddamn
blow jobs in the entire state.

916
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:01,100
Your wine.
Great.

917
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:07,200
And it didn't hurt
that I also had that whole
woman/child thing going on.

918
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,501
Men either wanted to
protect me or fuck me, so,

919
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,667
it helped me get
up the ladder,

920
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:17,133
and I did a hell of a
lot of climbing, Bob.

921
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:20,267
 More than my share.

922
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:21,734
Right.

923
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:24,367
Look, the point is,
you don't make any friends

924
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:25,968
stepping all over them
on the way up.

925
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:29,934
Look, enough with
this doom and gloom.

926
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,133
Let's see what a $300 bottle
of wine tastes like.

927
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:35,934
Me first. Here, can
you take this off?

928
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,033
Ohhh...

929
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:50,267
Okay?

930
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:51,968
Yeah.

931
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:54,033
Don't worry.

932
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,801
Ohh..

933
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,067
Whoo...

934
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,801
Ow, that's so
much better.

935
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:21,567
Now that I'll miss.

00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,834
 <i>Bon appetit.</i>

937
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:29,167
You have any brothers and
sisters?
Umm...yeah....

938
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:32,400
What was your most personal--
I do like apple juice a lot...

939
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,200
Really? One time
at the office I was
talking shit about Paula

940
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,467
Sweet Orchard apple juice...
and she was right behind me.

941
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,534
Oh, Paula...

942
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,367
[laughing]

943
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,267
But are goldfish like cats,

944
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:44,267
where you can't leave food
out for them?

945
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:48,334
Pretty much.
Everyone's due for
a good hangover.

946
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:51,334
It's easier to ask
what hasn't been my most...

947
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:54,133
You go ahead,
I'm stuffed.

948
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,100
How can you tell?
You can't feel anything
below your neck.

949
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,834
I know my limit.

950
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:00,234
Besides, they're
closing this place
out, I think.

951
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,467
It's only
ten o'clock.

952
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:09,701
I guess we're going to have
to try and find something else
we've never done before.

953
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:12,200
What haven't you done before?

there will be pain *

** [instrumental]

1062
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:21,167
I told you guys to be here
as soon as possible.

1063
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:25,000
It's an emergency.
[indistinct]

how to drive? Huh?

[laughing]

1067
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:52,400
The big problem's
a lack of communication
between departments,

1068
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,300
but I notice there's one place
people don't have any trouble
expressing themselves,

1069
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,968
and that's by the water cooler,
so I thought if you put
a little miniature water cooler

1070
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:02,834
by every phone in every office
and promote communication
between departments.

1071
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,934
That's good
thinking, Bob.

1072
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:08,334
[everybody]
Yeah, yeah.

1073
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:13,067
* And I said
some days may fade *

1074
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,968
* I will let this one fade *

1075
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:21,634
* Sometimes rain falls *

1076
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:25,467
* And I will let it fall *

1077
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:30,167
* And some things
are bound to change *

1078
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:34,033

I guess we overdid
it today.

1097
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:02,501
It was a great day.

1098
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,501
But it could
be perfect.

1099
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,367
It's not already?
[kissing]

1100
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,734
It just needs
that final touch.

1101
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:16,234
Your finger's definitely
getting stronger.

1102
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:17,934
Take me to the couch.

1103
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:46,367
I want to satisfy
you, Bob.

1104
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,868
You have.
You are.

1105
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:53,100
Not intellectually,
I mean intimately.

1106
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,634
Sexually.

1107
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,434
All you have to do
is reposition me,

1108
01:02:57,434 --> 01:03:00,834
put my head over the couch,
and I'll do the rest.

1109
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:05,133
Vanessa!
What? You're my
boyfriend, right?

1110
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,734
Come on, you've done
so much for me.

1111
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:09,467
Please, just let me
do this for you.

1112
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,934
No, no,
I don't think we should.
I don't see you that way.

1113
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,467
Well that's just it.
I want you to. I want
you to find me attractive.

1114
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:19,934
I do.
You're beautiful.

1115
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,534
Not enough to
be intimate with?

1116
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,767
Vanessa,

1117
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,434
from the first moment
I saw you

1118
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:31,901
I wanted to be close to you
in every way possible.

1119
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:38,267
I fantasized about you

1120
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,834
being naked.

1121
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,367
Can I at least fulfill
that fantasy then?

1122
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,033
Please?

It's okay.

There's a clasp.

1128
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,801
Touch them.

1129
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,367
But you won't
feel anything.

1130
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,267
I will if you do.

to go with you.

Why?

1147
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:24,367
Because, it's time to
see where it happened.

1148
01:06:25,868 --> 01:06:29,267
All those people seeing
what's happened to you.

1149

The ones that you said
you stepped on,

1150
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:32,767
are you sure you're strong
enough to handle all that?

1151

I will be
if you're with me.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

overdone?

No, the nurse
did a good job.

is in the way.

Let's no do this.
Not today.
No! No no no no no!

1157
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,367
When are you going to learn
to put your emotions away
and just do it?

1158
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,434
Stop! Dammit,
don't do that!

1159
01:07:20,434 --> 01:07:23,267

a shame what happened.

But you look ravishing
as always.

1166

If there's anything
I can do, really.

You okay?
Keep moving.

01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:30,067
It's supposed to
make you happy.

1172
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,334
It stinks.

Wait, stop.

Where were you?

1176
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,100
I was over by the hula girl.

1177
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:02,601
Take me to where I fell.

1178
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,534
I heard the shots, but I didn't
see where they came from.

1179

Where was Coleman standing?

1180
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,100
He was right there.

1181
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,167
Show me.

1182
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,701

I wish I would have
seen his eyes.

01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,767
I know.

Vanessa?

1190
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:55,567
They told me you were here.
I couldn't believe it.

1191
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,267
I wanted to see
where it happened.

1192
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:58,767
I understand.

1193
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:05,968
I am so, so sorry
about what happened.

1194
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:07,868
Yeah, so am I.

1195
01:11:07,868 --> 01:11:10,501
Bob. Come on. Let's go.
We're done here.

1196
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,701
You can move?

1197
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,200
I-I thought you were
permanently paralyzed.

1198
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,968
Yeah, so did I. I guess
we were both wrong.

1199
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:21,534
Bob.

1200
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,767
It was so good
to see you.

Freak show's over.
Everyone back to work.

1202
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:53,834
That's Hawaii, definitely.
Or maybe it's Japan.

1203
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:55,834
Both would be great.

1204
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,234
God, it would be nice
to go somewhere.

01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:03,701
You're awfully
quiet tonight.

1206
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:10,234
If you hadn't been shot,
would you ever have thought
of being with me like this?

1207
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,701
That's kind of
a cruel question.

1208
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:13,968
You wouldn't, I know.

1209
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:16,133
I didn't even
know you.

1210
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:18,100
Who would you be
with then?

He was married, Bob.

1215
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:32,834
So?
So I told you
who I was before.

1216
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,734
And why I did
what I did.

1217
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:37,167

Love was the last
thing on my mind.

1218
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,934
Why are we talking
about this right now?
What happened happened.

And in this world
I'm with you, you are
the one I want to be with,

01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,501
and nothing's going
to change that unless
you want it to change.

1221
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:53,133
I don't want
anything to change.

1222
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,133
Then it won't.

1223
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:23,534
Bob,

1224
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:26,634
you should've told me
you like your women
submissive.

1225
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:30,167
I would have
accommodated.

1226
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,133
Your day will come.

1227
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:39,901
Hey Bob.

1228
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,434
What are you doing in here?
We need to talk.

1229
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:47,100
Don't you ever stop?
I have nothing to say.
I'm fine.

1230
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,767
Well, I'm not, okay?

1231
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:52,067
I'm failing here, Bob,
and I need your help.

1232
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:55,567
See, I wasn't good enough
to do my job.

1233
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,767
And now I think something
really wrong is going to happen,

1234
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,267
and it's going to be my fault.
What could go wrong?

1235
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:06,000
Let me show you something.

1236
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,467
All right, Bob.
You gotta see this.

1237
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:16,067
I haven't shown this
to anybody.

1238
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:21,100
Sit down.

1239
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:37,033
Where did you find this?

1240
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:39,534
In the copy machine.

1241
01:14:39,534 --> 01:14:42,567
You see, the good thing is,
it's in the form of a question.

1242
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,601
That means whoever wrote it

1243
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,834
hasn't made up their mind
what they're going to do yet.

1244
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,367
Maybe they already have,
and they're not
going to do anything.

1245
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,901
Can we take that chance?

1246
01:14:55,501 --> 01:15:00,234
No. The person that wrote
this note is reaching out.

1247
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:01,801
He may not even know it.

1248
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:04,634
But that would be
a real tragedy

1249
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:08,701
if you and I didn't
try to save him.

1250
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:10,133
How can I save him?

1251
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:14,100
Help me bring him out
into the open.

1252
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,667
Otherwise, I gotta
go down to Mr. Shelby,

1253
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:23,601
initiate a company-wide
handwriting analysis

1254
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,801
and, my friend,
that's just a bitch.

1255
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:28,367
It's just a bitch.

1256
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:32,534
Oh, shit.

1257
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:35,534
[beep]
 <i>Bob, you there?</i>

1258
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,834
[clears throat]

1259
01:15:39,834 --> 01:15:43,767
Ah. I need you to go
out and buy a gift.

1260
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:47,567
I wanna get something--
something really special,

1261
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:48,767
but I don't know
what's appropriate

1262
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,834
for someone
in Vanessa's condition

1263
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:55,701
I figured you would know
what she'd like these days,

1264
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:58,200
because I certainly
don't know.

1265
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,234
I can not get over seeing
her come in like that.

1266
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:02,934
What a brave woman.

1267
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:06,434
Here. Take the afternoon
if you need it.

1268
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,868
We-- here.

1269
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:12,634
What? Do you think
it's not enough?

1270
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,734
I don't think it's right.

1271
01:16:14,734 --> 01:16:16,601
Why not?

1272
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,934
You shouldn't be buying
presents for another woman.

1273
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:20,534
Vanessa is not
another woman.

1274
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,033
She happens to be a valued
and appreciated member
of the ADD team.

1275
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,501
Is that what you
tell Mrs. Shelby?

1276
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:27,868
Are you questioning
my fidelity?

1277
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:30,801
Because if you are,
you are way out of line, pal!

1278
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,467
I just don't wanna see
her hurt again.

1279
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:33,934
And what are you?
Her protector?

1280
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,033
I care about her.

1281
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:38,534
Oh, Jesus, you're
in love with her.

1282
01:16:38,534 --> 01:16:41,934
[laughs]
I can't believe it.

1283
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:44,167
She's done it
to you too.

1284
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:47,434
Bob, that woman

1285
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:51,133
will do anything to get a man
to give her what she needs.

1286
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,601
She's changed.

1287
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:55,000
Yes. She's disabled.

1288
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,667
She doesn't want
anything from me.

1289
01:16:57,667 --> 01:17:00,767
Bob, you're the spoon.

1290
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,601
Because that's what
she needs right now.

1291
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,567
But let me ask
you something.

1292
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:08,100
What happens if she starts
to wiggle more than her finger?

1293
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,234
What if she starts to move
her entire hand?

1294
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:11,901
Or her arm?

1295
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:14,167
What happens if she
can feed herself,

1296
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,000
move herself,
take care of herself?

1297
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,234
Do you really think
that a woman like that

1298
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,334
is gonna choose
a man like you?

1299
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:24,701
I mean, honestly now.

1300
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:28,167
I...

1301
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:31,334
am not...

1302
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:35,534
a spoon.

1303
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:54,834
There he is.
Man of the people.

1304
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:58,834
Now this thing between
you and Little Miss
Bottle Rocket serious?

1305
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,334
Don't call her that.

1306
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:02,934
I'm just saying, Bob,
you're at your peak right now.

1307
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:05,701
Great money, great car,
great friends.

1308
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:08,300
Some men wait a whole
lifetime for that.

1309
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,334
Why would you wanna
waste it on a gimp?

1310
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:11,467
[grunts]

1311
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:15,000
You are a very
cruel man!

1312
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,267
Bob, come on. Hey.

1313
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:23,968
Forget golf on Sunday,
you fucking freak!

1314
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:19,067
[door creaks, slams]

1315
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,133
Don't touch her.

1316
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:29,901
She was mine.

1317
01:20:29,901 --> 01:20:31,734
Well, you threw her away.

1318
01:20:31,734 --> 01:20:34,934
No, I didn't.
She was broken.
She was in pieces.

1319
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:37,501
She's all better now.

1320
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,634
She was mine.

1321
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,033
Say bye-bye.

1322
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,200
What's this?
He's the guy
you're looking for.

1323
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,400
He's the one
with the problem.

1324
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,234
Henry from Maintenance.

1325
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:00,200
That's your man.

1326
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,434
Bob, I think you misunderstood
what I was asking of you.

1327
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:05,300
No, I didn't.
You wanted me to find
the next Coleman,

1328
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,000
that's-- that's
what I did.

1329
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,968
How did you
actually do this?

1330
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:10,367
I had the sense, remember?

1331
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:11,868
The sense.

1332
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,934
You know, how
I knew something was
gonna happen here.

1333
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:16,334
How I knew to bring my gun in
the day Coleman went off.

1334
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,400
Right.
And you're right.

1335
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,868
This man is very dangerous.

1336
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:20,367
You need to do something.
You need to get him some help,

1337
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:22,300
and you need to get him out
of here, just like you said.

1338
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,567
Bob, he's not the one.

1339
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:24,934
You didn't see him.
He's this tall!

1340
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,100
You're the one, Bob.

1341
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,634
You're the one
that needs help.

1342
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,067
I'm the hero.
I shot the bad guy.

1343
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,801
I know.

1344
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:36,067
That's why I wanted you
to come to me on your own.

1345
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:39,334
That's why you're up here
on the top floor.

1346
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,901
You're wrong.

1347
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:44,100
Think about it-- Vice President
of Creative Thinking?

1348
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,601
Do you really believe that
someone like you would
have a job like that?

1349
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:49,000
Someone like me?

1350
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,501
[sighs]

1351
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:52,400
Just admit you're
the one, Bob,

1352
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,067
and you'll be
halfway home.

1353
01:21:59,434 --> 01:22:01,601
No.

1354
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:02,801
I'm not the one.

1355
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,234
I'm not the one!

1356
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm not the one!

1357
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,367
I'm not the one!
I'm not!

1358
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:11,868
Not the one!

1359
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:25,968
No. No, no, no.

1360
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:29,400
No!

1361
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,868
Let me through!
Let me through!

1362
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,133
[plane landing]

1363
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,667
[panting]

1364
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:19,801
Mr. Shelby?

1365
01:23:19,801 --> 01:23:21,133
Hello, Bob.

1366
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,567
What's going on?
Why is he here?

1367
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:23,701
Well--
I just came--

1368
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:24,868
I didn't ask you!

1369
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:27,133
I think you better go.

1370
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,200
Are you sure?

1371
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,801
Yeah.

1372
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:35,033
I, uh-- I'll see you
tomorrow, Bob.

1373
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:37,300
Right?

1374
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,067
I didn't know that he
was coming over.

1375
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:44,667
The nurse let him in
before I could stop her.

1376
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:47,501
He's never come
over here before.
Why here? Why now?

1377
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:48,901
He wanted to talk.

1378
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:51,901
About what? About your
miraculous recovery?

1379
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:54,400
Or how-- how he wants
to ask you back into his life.

1380
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,167
Don't do this.
Don't do what?

1381
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,834
Don't turn this into
something it's not.

1382
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,133
Don't tell me
how to feel!

1383
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:04,100
He came over here because
he was worried about you.

1384
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,534
He said that you two
had words earlier

1385
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:08,434
and that you
left very upset.

1386
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,200
Did he tell you
why I was upset?

1387
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,434
How he wanted me to buy you
a present from him? Huh?

1388
01:24:12,434 --> 01:24:14,434
I bet he didn't tell you
a thing about that, did he?

1389
01:24:14,434 --> 01:24:16,601
Yeah, he did.
He also told me that
you harassed Paula

1390
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:18,334
and that you choked
Harper in the elevator.

1391
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:20,467
That's 'cause they
disrespected you.

1392
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:22,467
My God! What is so wrong?

1393
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,100
I'm not the one
who has the problem!

1394
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,701
I don't need any help!
I--

1395
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:28,634
[panting]

1396
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:32,367
Do I?

1397
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,300
Bob, everybody needs
help sometimes.

1398
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,968
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1399
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,501
Look at me.
Without you, I'd either
be hopeless or dead.

1400
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,567
That's because you
need me right now.

1401
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,567
What happens if you
start to get better?

1402
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:43,934
If you could feed yourself,
clothe yourself,

1403
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,667
take better
care of yourself--

1404
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,667
What're you gonna
do with me then, huh?
Bob, please stop it.

1405
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:48,868
What're gonna
do with me then?

1406
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:50,834
You're gonna throw me away.
That's it.

1407
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,601
No, I'm not.
Listen to me.
Yes, you are!

1408
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,767
Yes, you are!
Sit down.
Come here.

1409
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,300
Sit down.
Come here.
No!

1410
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,634
I'm not coming
over there!

1411
01:25:00,634 --> 01:25:04,367
Bob. Sit down.

1412
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:08,434
Come here
and sit down, now.

1413
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,300
Jesus.

1414
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,868
Listen to me.

1415
01:25:12,868 --> 01:25:15,801
I didn't just find you
in this tragedy.

1416
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:19,734
I found myself.

1417
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,968
And I can tell you
with all honesty

1418
01:25:21,968 --> 01:25:25,467
that it doesn't matter
if I never walk again
or I can fucking fly.

1419
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:31,133
It's your heart
and your soul that
I desperately need,

1420
01:25:31,133 --> 01:25:35,434
and I'll always need.

1421
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:39,634
So you have a problem?
So what?

1422
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,300
I'm gonna help you
get through this.

1423
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,033
You just need the courage
to do the right thing.

1424
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,734
What is the right thing?

1425
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:53,834
To do what's in your heart.

1426
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:57,834
And you need the courage
to face that.

1427
01:25:57,834 --> 01:26:01,334
It's easier to find
when I'm with you.

1428
01:26:02,701 --> 01:26:04,701
And if you feel
it's slipping away,

1429
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,901
just look into my eyes...

1430
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,901
and it'll be right there.

1431
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,601
Do you love me?

1432
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:41,734
Bob...

1433
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:46,000
that's such a foreign word
to me, you know that.

1434
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:51,167
It doesn't mean
that I won't,

1435
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:54,033
I just-- I have to be
sure before I say it.

1436
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:57,734
[plane landing]

1437
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:58,901
It doesn't matter.

1438
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,067
Yes, it matters.

1439
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:01,567
It does matter, Bob!

1440
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:03,434
Please. Don't go.

1441
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:07,033
Stay with me
tonight, please.

1442
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,434
Please.

1443
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,200
Why?

1444
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,400
Because I'm afraid if you
leave feeling this way...

1445
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,534
you won't find
your way back.

1446
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:33,801
[soft moan]

1447
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,801
What-- what?

1448
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:47,334
 <i>[Bob]</i>
 <i>So, she couldn't say it.</i>
 <i>So what?</i>

1449
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:50,133
 <i>It'll come.</i>
 <i>It'll happen.</i>

1450
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:54,901
 <i>I just have to be patient.</i>

1451
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:57,200
 <i>'Cause in the end,</i>

1452
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,567
 <i>it's all about timing.</i>

1453
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:12,334
[groans]

1454
01:28:56,868 --> 01:29:00,234
The bitch lied.

1455

[yells]

1456
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,200
Excuse me, sir!

1457
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,300
Where's Shelby?

1458
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,667
He's not up here.
He's downstairs.

1459
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:46,400
Maconel!

1460
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,567
Maconel.

1461
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:53,033
Dammit, I told that
drone not to leave.

1462
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:55,334
You know where
Maconel went?

1463
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,033
[office chatter]

1464
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:33,200
[Woman]
You see that?

1465
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,434
[Man]
Yeah.

1466
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:38,667
He's got a gun!

1467

 <i>You're the one, Bob.</i>
 <i>You're the one that needs help.</i>

1469
01:31:18,968 --> 01:31:22,267
 <i>[Bob]</i>
 <i>You may ask why</i>
 <i>I did what I did.</i>

1470
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:26,634
 <i>But what choice</i>
 <i>did you give me?</i>

1471
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:39,167
 <i>How else could</i>
 <i>I get your attention?</i>

1472
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:43,267
 <i>All I wanted was to</i>
 <i>exist in your world.</i>

1473
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,501
 <i>Just one person</i>

1474

 <i>He was a quiet man.</i>
