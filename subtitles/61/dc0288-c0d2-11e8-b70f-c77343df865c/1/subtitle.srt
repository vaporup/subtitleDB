1
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
Hey, baby, what's going on here?

2
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Oh, hi.

3
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,900
Miss Gorightly!

4
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,000
Some day... Some day...!

5
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,700
Miss Gorightly!

6
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,200
You go to the powder room
and that's the last I see.

7
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
- Now, Harry...
- Harry was the other guy.

8
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm Sid Arbuck.
You like me, remember?

9
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Miss Gorightly! I protest!

10
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Darling, I am sorry,
but I lost my key.

11
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
That was two weeks ago.

12
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,200
You cannot keep ringing my bell.

13
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,600
You disturb me!
You must have a key made!

14
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
But I just lose them all.

15
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,600
- Come on. You like me.
- I worship you, Mr Arbuck.

16
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,300
- Good night.
- Wait! What is this?

17
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,800
You like me. I'm a liked guy.

18
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,000
You like me. I picked up
the cheque for five people...

19
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Your friends.

20
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,300
When you wanted change for
the powder room I gave you $50.

21
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,000
That gives me rights.

22
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,400
In 30 seconds I call the police!

23
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
All the time, disturbance!

24
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
I get no sleep!

25
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,900
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

26
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,500
I going to call vice squad on you!

27
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,900
Don't be angry. I won't do it again.

28
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,200
I might let you take those pictures.

29
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,200
When?

30
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,900
Some time.

31
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,600
Any time.

32
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Good night.

33
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm sorry to bother you.
I couldn't get the door open.

34
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,100
I guess they sent me
the upstairs key.

35
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
I couldn't get the
downstairs door open.

36
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,500
I said, I guess they sent me
the...upstairs key.

37
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,400
I couldn't get the downstairs
door open. Sorry to wake you.

38
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
That's all right.

39
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
It could happen to anyone...
frequently does. Good night.

40
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,100
I hate to...

41
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I hate to bother you,
but could I use the phone?

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
Sure.

43
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Why not?

44
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Thank you.

45
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, this is a...

46
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,100
nice little place you've got here.

47
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,600
You just moved in, too, huh?

48
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,900
I've been here about a year.

49
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,300
Phone's over there.

50
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
Well, it was.

51
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Oh, I remember.

52
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,400
I stuck it in the suitcase
to muffle the sound.

53
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm...sorry.

54
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
Is he all right?

55
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,400
Sure. He's OK, aren't you, cat?

56
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,800
Poor old cat.

57
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Poor slob. Poor slob without a name.

58
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,100
I don't have the right
to give him one.

59
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,700
We don't own each other.
We just met one day.

60
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
I won't own anything

61
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,800
until I find a place where
me and things go together.

62
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm not sure where that is,
but I know what it's like.

63
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
It's like Tiffany's.

64
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Tiffany's?
You mean the jewellery store?

65
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
That's right.

66
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,100
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

67
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,500
Listen.

68
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,300
You know those days
when you get the mean reds?

69
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,700
The mean reds? You mean the blues?

70
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,500
The blues are when you're fat
or it's raining, that's all.

71
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,400
The mean reds are horrible.

72
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,300
Suddenly, you're afraid
and don't know what of.

73
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,200
- Do you ever get that feeling?
- Sure.

74
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
When I get it, all that does any good

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,600
is to jump in a cab to Tiffany's.

76
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Calms me down right away.

77
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
The quietness and proudness of it.

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Nothing bad could happen there.

79
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,400
If I could find a real place

80
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,500
that made me feel
like Tiffany's, then...

81
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,300
I'd buy some furniture
and give the cat a name.

82
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm sorry. You wanted something.

83
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
The telephone.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,300
I was supposed to meet somebody.

85
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,800
This is 10:00 Thursday morning?

86
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,700
I just got off a plane.
I'm not sure.

87
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,600
Thursday. Is this Thursday?

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,100
- I think so.
- It can't be!

89
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
It's too gruesome!

90
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, what's so gruesome
about Thursday?

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
I never remember when it's coming up.

92
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,800
Wednesdays,
I generally don't go to bed

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,100
because I have to catch the 10:45.

94
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,600
They're so particular
about visiting hours.

95
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
Be a darling and look under the bed

96
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,700
for a pair of alligator shoes.

97
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,300
I've got to do something
about how I look.

98
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,400
I can't go to Sing Sing
with a green face.

99
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,500
Sing Sing?

100
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,200
It's a ridiculous name for a prison.

101
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Sounds more like an opera house.

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,700
Black, alligator.

103
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,000
All the visitors make an effort
to look their best.

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
It's touching, the women wearing
their prettiest things.

105
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,600
I love them for it.
And I love the kids, too.

106
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,500
It should be sad seeing kids
there, but it isn't.

107
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,300
They have ribbons in their hair
and shine on their shoes.

108
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,700
As I understand it,

109
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,400
you're going to visit somebody
at Sing Sing.

110
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,000
You can tell what kind of person
a man thinks you are

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
by the earrings he gives you.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I must say, the mind reels.

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,700
- May I ask whom?
- Whom I'm going to visit?

114
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,600
I guess that's what I mean.

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
I don't know if I should say.

116
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
They never told me not to.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Cross your heart and kiss your elbow.

118
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll try.

119
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
You probably read about him -
Sally Tomato.

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
Sally Tomato?

121
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,300
Don't look so shocked.

122
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,500
They couldn't prove
he was in the Mafia,

123
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,400
much less head of it.

124
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,300
They only proved
he cheated his income tax.

125
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,400
He's a darling old man.

126
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,700
He wasn't my lover or anything.

127
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,000
I never knew him until
after he was in prison.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,800
I've seen him every Thursday
for seven months.

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,400
I'd go even if he didn't pay me.

130
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,500
- Shoes.
- I only found one.

131
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,400
- He pays you?
- That's right. His lawyer does.

132
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,100
If he is a lawyer, which I doubt.

133
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
He only has an answering service

134
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,600
and always wants to meet
at Hamburger Heaven.

135
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,600
There you are, you sneak. Thank you.

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,100
You're welcome.

137
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
Dress... Dress...

138
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Here we are... Bag.

139
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
And a hat, too.

140
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
There we are.

141
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,500
Anyway, seven months ago,
this so-called lawyer

142
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,600
asked if I'd like
to cheer up an old man

143
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,100
and pick up 100 a week.

144
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,400
I told him, "You've got
the wrong Holly Golightly."

145
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,100
I do as well on trips
to the powder room.

146
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Any chic gentleman will give
a girl $50 for the powder room.

147
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
And cab fare, that's another 50.

148
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,000
Then he said his client
was Sally Tomato.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sally had seen me somewhere

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
and had admired me à la distance.

151
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,100
It would be a good deed to visit him.

152
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,700
How could I say no?
It was so wildly romantic.

153
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
How do I look?

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Very good. I must say I'm amazed.

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,800
I could never have
done it without you.

156
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
Bag...

157
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
Call me any time.

158
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm just upstairs,
as soon as I get moved in.

159
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,100
Bye, cat.

160
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,500
You mean he gives you $100
for an hour's conversation?

161
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,600
Mr O'Shaughnessy does when
I give him the weather report.

162
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,700
It's none of my business,
but you could get in trouble.

163
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Hold this for me.

164
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
And what do you mean,
weather report?

165
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Just a message
I give Mr O'Shaughnessy,

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,300
so he knows I've been there.

167
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Sally tells me things to say like...

168
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
"There's a hurricane in Cuba",

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
"cloudy over Palermo",
things like that.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Don't worry. I've taken care
of myself for a long time.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,300
Taxi!

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,100
- I never could do that.
- It's easy.

173
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,300
Paul.

174
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm late. I know it.

175
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,700
Were you locked out?
Didn't you get the key?

176
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Oh, darling. I'm so sorry.

177
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
No, I got the key.

178
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,200
Miss Golightly, my neighbour,
kindly let me in.

179
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Golightly's
on her way to Sing Sing.

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,300
Just visiting, of course.

181
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Miss Golightly,

182
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Mrs. Falenson, my...decorator.

183
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Darling. Let me look at you.

185
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,900
- Are you through?
- Was the flight ghastly?

186
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,500
Grand Central station,
and step on it, darling.

187
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,700
Is it only three weeks
since I left you in Rome?

188
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,200
Seems like years.

189
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
- You seen the apartment?
- Not yet.

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,800
It was wicked of me,
but I couldn't resist.

191
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
I fixed it up without you.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
I think it's darling,

193
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,700
but if you absolutely hate it,
we can start from scratch.

194
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Hey, baby! Where you going?

195
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,700
Come on, baby. Open the door.

196
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
Ah, be a pal!

197
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,800
You're breaking up a beautiful party.

198
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,300
Come on, baby. Open the door.

199
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,200
Hey, the band's swinging.

200
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Aw, come on, baby.

201
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Once again, I must protest!

202
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,700
If you don't stop
that phonograph now,

203
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm going to call
the police department!

204
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Yeah. That's more better.

205
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,900
What's the matter, baby?

206
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,100
Come on. You're a great kid.
Open the door.

207
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Come on, baby. I'm waiting for you.

208
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
- It's only me.
- Wait a minute. Miss...

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,100
Golightly. Holly Golightly.

210
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,800
I live downstairs.
We met this morning, remember?

211
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,300
Yeah.

212
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
It's OK. She's gone.

213
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,800
She works late hours for a decorator.

214
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,300
There's the most
terrifying man downstairs.

215
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,800
He's sweet when he isn't drunk,
but some vino,

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
and, golly, quel beast.

217
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
It got so tiresome,
I went out the window.

218
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,000
You can throw me out if you want,

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but you looked so cosy
and your friend had gone,

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,600
and it was getting cold out there.

221
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
And I'd heard people in New York

222
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,400
never get to know their neighbours.

223
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, how was Sing Sing?

224
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,800
Fine. I made the train
and everything.

225
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
And what's the weather report?

226
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Small-craft warnings,

227
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,700
Block Island to Hatteras...
whatever that means.

228
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,000
You know, you're sweet.
You really are.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,300
And you look a little
like my brother Fred.

230
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,700
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

231
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,100
Not at all.

232
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
300. She's very generous.

233
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,900
Is it by the week, hour or what?

234
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,400
The party's over. Out.

235
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh, Fred. Darling Fred, I'm sorry.

236
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,800
I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings. Don't be angry.

237
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,400
I was just saying I understand.

238
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,900
I understand completely.

239
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Stick around. Make yourself a drink.

240
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,800
- Throw me my robe.
- Stay where you are.

241
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,500
You must be absolutely exhausted.

242
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
I mean, it's late,

243
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,900
and you were sound asleep
and everything.

244
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,700
I suppose you think
I'm très fou or something.

245
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,600
No fouer than anybody else.

246
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
I don't mind.

247
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,700
It's useful being top banana
in the shock department.

248
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
What do you do, anyway?

249
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,200
- I'm a writer, I guess.
- You guess? Don't you know?

250
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
OK. Positive statement.
Ringing affirmative.

251
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm a writer.

252
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,600
The only writer I've ever been
out with is Benny Shacklett.

253
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,800
He's written a lot of TV stuff,
but quel rat.

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
Tell me, are you a real writer?

255
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,300
I mean, does anybody buy
what you write or anything?

256
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,400
They bought what's in that box.

257
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,600
Yours?

258
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,200
All these books?

259
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,100
There's just the one book,

260
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,600
12 copies of it.

261
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,200
"Nine Lives" by Paul Varjak.

262
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
They're stories.

263
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,500
Nine of them.

264
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
Tell me one.

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
They're not the kind you can tell.

266
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Too dirty?

267
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Yeah, I suppose they're dirty, too,

268
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
but only incidentally.

269
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,600
Mainly they're angry,
sensitive, intensely felt,

270
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,900
and that dirtiest
of all words - promising.

271
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,000
So said The Times Book Review,
October 1, 1956.

272
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,200
- 1956?
- That's right.

273
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,700
This a ratty question, but what
have you written lately?

274
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Lately, I've been working on a novel.

275
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,700
- Lately, since 1956?
- It takes time.

276
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,300
- I want to get it right.
- So no more stories.

277
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm supposed to not fritter
my talent on little things.

278
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm saving it for the big one.

279
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
Do you write every day?

280
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Sure.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,900
- Today?
- Sure.

282
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,200
It's a beautiful typewriter.

283
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Of course.

284
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,300
It writes nothing but sensitive,
intensely felt, promising prose.

285
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,800
There's no ribbon in it.

286
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,700
There isn't?

287
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
No.

288
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,400
Something you said this morning
has bothered me all day.

289
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
What's that?

290
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,300
Do they really give you $50
for the powder room?

291
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Of course.

292
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,400
You must do very well.

293
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm trying to save,
but I'm not very good at it.

294
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,900
You know, you do look
a lot like my brother Fred.

295
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,300
I haven't seen him since
I was 14, when I left home.

296
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,800
He was already 6'2".

297
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,900
It must have been
the peanut butter that did it.

298
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,000
Everybody thought he was dotty,
the way he ate peanut butter.

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,700
But he wasn't dotty,

300
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
just sweet and vague
and...terribly slow.

301
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,900
Poor Fred. He's in the army now.

302
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,400
It's best until I get enough money.

303
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,800
- And then?
- And then Fred and I...

304
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,700
I went to Mexico once.

305
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a wonderful place
for raising horses.

306
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,100
I saw one place near the sea that...

307
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,800
Fred's very good with horses.

308
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Even land in Mexico costs something.

309
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Whatever I do, there's never
more than $200 in the bank.

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It can't be 4:30.

311
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,500
It just can't.

312
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,300
Do you mind if I just
get in with you for a minute?

313
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,100
It's all right. Really, it is.

314
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,500
We're friends, that's all.

315
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,000
We are friends, aren't we?

316
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,200
Sure.

317
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,500
OK, let's don't say another word.

318
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Let's just go to sleep.

319
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,800
Where are you, Fred?

320
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,100
It's cold.

321
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,900
There's snow and...wind.

322
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,900
What is it?

323
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,800
Why are you crying?

324
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,400
If we're going to be friends,
let's get one thing straight.

325
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I hate snoops.

326
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
- Yeah.
- Lucille, darling?

327
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,900
I've been trying
desperately to reach you.

328
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,800
Bill just got back...

329
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
a day early, the beast...

330
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,000
so I'll have to beg off.

331
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,100
You'll explain
to the rest of the girls?

332
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,900
You're a darling.

333
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,400
Maybe we can have
a long lunch tomorrow.

334
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,700
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Whatever you say.

335
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,500
You'll manage to survive
without me tonight?

336
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,300
Sure. I might even take a wild,
boyish fling at writing.

337
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

338
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Got yourself stuffed,
huh, Polly, baby?

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,900
Serves you right, big mouth.

340
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,000
- Buon giorno.
- Huh?

341
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,900
Aren't you drinking?

342
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,900
You have pockets or something?
What do you go by?

343
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,700
What's your name?
What do you call yourself?

344
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,000
- Irving.
- Perfect, perfect.

345
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,500
That's wonderful, Irving.

346
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,700
I'll be right back, Irving, baby.

347
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Yeah? Kid's still in the shower.
You expected?

348
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,100
I was invited. That what you mean?

349
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,900
Don't get all tense. Come on in.

350
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,700
It's a party - lot of characters
come who aren't expected.

351
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll buy you a drink. You drink?

352
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Then I'll buy you a drink.

353
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,700
Hey, honey, your skirt's split there.

354
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
- What do you drink?
- Bourbon.

355
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
- On the rocks?
- Yeah... No. With water.

356
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,300
- Want rocks first?
- Yeah. Not too much.

357
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,600
All right. That'll set you free.

358
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,500
- Know the kid long?
- Not very. I live upstairs.

359
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Look at this place.
It's unbelievable. What a dump!

360
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,800
What do you think?

361
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,100
- About what?
- Is she or isn't she?

362
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Wait a minute. Hold it.

363
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
- Harriet!
- Hi, JB.

364
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,600
"JB"? What's that?

365
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
- You know Gil.
- Yeah. How are you?

366
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,800
- How about a drink?
- In the kitchen.

367
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,900
So... Oh, honey, that is you.

368
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,500
Fred, darling,
I'm so glad you could come.

369
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,200
I brought you a present
for the bookcase.

370
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,900
You're sweet.

371
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,800
Doesn't that look nice?
Give me a cigarette, OJ.

372
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,600
OJ's a great agent.
He knows a lot of phone numbers.

373
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
What's Jerry Wald's phone number?

374
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,100
Come on, lay off.

375
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,000
Call him and tell him
Fred's a genius.

376
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Stop blushing, Fred.
You didn't say it. I did.

377
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,800
Quit stalling. How will you make
Fred rich and famous?

378
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,600
Let Fred and me
settle that, huh, puppy?

379
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,800
OK, but remember, I'm the agent.

380
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
He's already got a decorator,
I'm the agent.

381
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
Hold it.

382
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Hi, boys. Come on in.

383
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,400
Everything you need's
in the kitchen.

384
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,500
So, listen, Fred, baby...

385
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,500
- No, it's Paul, baby.
- I thought it was Fred, baby.

386
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,500
- Is she or isn't she?
- What?

387
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,100
A phoney.

388
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't know. I don't think so.

389
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Well, you're wrong - she is.

390
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,600
On the other hand, you're right,
because she's a real phoney.

391
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
She honestly believes
all this phoney junk.

392
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Now, I sincerely
like the kid. I do.

393
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,900
I'm sensitive. That's why.

394
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,600
You got to be sensitive
to like the kid.

395
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,900
It's a streak of the poet.

396
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,400
You known her long?

397
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,200
I discovered her. I'm OJ Berman.
Couple of years ago...

398
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,000
She was just a kid.
Lot of style, class...

399
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,900
- Lot of what?
- Class.

400
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,500
But you didn't know whether
she was a hillbilly or an Okie.

401
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Know how long it took
to smooth that accent?

402
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
One year. Know how?

403
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,200
We gave her French lessons.

404
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Figured once
she could imitate French,

405
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,100
she could imitate English.

406
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,000
Finally, I arranged
for a little screen test.

407
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,100
The night before - I could've
killed myself- the phone rings.

408
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,200
I pick it up. She says, "It's
Holly. I'm in New York."

409
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,500
I say, "You got
a screen test tomorrow."

410
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,800
I say, "Get back here!"
She says, "I don't want to."

411
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,500
"What do you mean? What do you want?"

412
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,000
She says, "When I find out,
I'll let you know."

413
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,500
- Fred, baby...
- It's Paul, baby.

414
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,800
Sure. Don't tell me
she isn't a phoney.

415
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,700
Irving!
Honey, Irving, where you been?

416
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,100
Mike, darling, I tried
reaching you all day long.

417
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,000
Your answering service
doesn't answer.

418
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,800
That's the trouble
with answering services...

419
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
And after all that she said...

420
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
- Time, darling.
- What?

421
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
The time?

422
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
- You have a watch?
- No.

423
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,500
- Oh, let me see. 6:45.
- Thank you.

424
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,700
Really, was that necessary?

425
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,400
This is some party. Who are
all these people, anyhow?

426
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,700
Who knows? The word gets out.

427
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,800
You don't mind, do you, darling?

428
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
Reinforcements.

429
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,200
Right in there.

430
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,100
Holly, darling!

431
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,900
What's that?

432
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,400
Mag Wildwood.

433
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,300
She's a model, believe it
or not, and a thumping bore.

434
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,700
But look at the goodies with her.

435
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,300
He's all right,

436
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,700
if you like handsome,
rich-looking men

437
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,000
with passionate natures
and too many teeth.

438
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,100
I mean the other one.

439
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,800
- The other one?
- He's Rusty Trawler.

440
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,900
He's the ninth richest man
in America under 50.

441
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,200
That's remarkable information
to have at your fingertips.

442
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,600
I keep track of these things.

443
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,300
- Excuse me. You owe me 47...
- Hold this a minute, darling.

444
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,900
Mag, darling,
what are you doing here?

445
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,400
I was upstairs
working with Yunioshi...

446
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,600
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

447
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,500
Then these two nice boys
came to pick me up.

448
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,900
It was a mistake, of course.
My wires got crossed somewhere.

449
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,800
They were both very sweet about it.

450
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,100
May I present Josè Silva Pereira?

451
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,500
He's from Brazil.

452
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,700
Miss Golightly.

453
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Very kind of you to allow me
to attend your party.

454
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm so interested
in North American culture.

455
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,900
I've been already
to the Statue of Liberty

456
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,800
and to the restaurant Automatique,

457
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
but this is the first time

458
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm in a typical North American home.

459
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,400
Wouldn't he just melt in your mouth?

460
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
And this is Mr Rusty Trawler.

461
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Miss Golightly.

462
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,200
You're not vexed at me
for bringing them?

463
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,700
- Of course not, darling.
- I'm glad.

464
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,600
Now, who's going
to bring me a bourbon?

465
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,700
- OJ.
- Yeah.

466
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,800
Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?

467
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Which one's Miss Wildwood?

468
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Mr Berman, we haven't been
formally introduced,

469
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,100
but I'm Mag Wildwood
from Wildwood, Arkansaw.

470
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,400
That's...hill country.

471
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,300
Now, you just make yourself
right at home.

472
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
Don't trouble yourself.

473
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm contented to observe
the customs of your country.

474
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,600
OK, you do that.

475
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,500
Now, come along, Mr Trawler.

476
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,300
Let's see what we
can find to amuse you.

477
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,400
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

478
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,900
At the last minute, I had...

479
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,700
Look, I wasn't supposed
to pick you up.

480
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,500
Yes?

481
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Miss Gorightly!
This time I'm warning you!

482
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,400
I am definitely this time
going to calling the police!

483
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,300
Good evening!

484
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,600
Is it something important?

485
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,400
No. Just the guy upstairs
complaining about the noise.

486
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,800
He's angry.

487
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,500
He did mention something
about calling the police.

488
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, the police... The police?

489
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,600
That I cannot have. I'd better
find Miss Wildwood and go.

490
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,400
To think I'd find a beau of mine

491
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,300
mousing after
some cheap Hollywood trash.

492
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,500
Mag, darling, you're being a bore.

493
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,400
Shut up!

494
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,700
You know what's going
to happen to you?

495
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm going to march you to the
zoo and feed you to the yak.

496
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,900
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

497
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Timber!

498
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Sorry.

499
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,600
- Oh, good evening, Ed.
- It's Paul, baby.

500
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,900
You remember Irving, don't you?

501
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,000
- This is Josè.
- Nice to meet you.

502
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,300
Yes.

503
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,800
Jewel thieves.

504
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,200
Sally helps me with my accounts.

505
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,900
I have no head for figures at all.

506
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm trying desperately
to save some money.

507
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,400
I just can't seem to.

508
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
He makes me write down everything.

509
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
What I get, what I spend.

510
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,700
I had an cheque account.
I got rid of that.

511
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,800
He feels it's better to operate
on a cash basis, taxwise.

512
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,600
Some day, take this book,
turn it into a novel.

513
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,400
Everything is there.
Just fill in the details.

514
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Would be good for some laughs.

515
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,500
No. No, I don't think so.

516
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,400
This book would break the heart.

517
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,100
"Mr Fitzsimmons...powder room, $50.

518
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,600
"Less $18... Repair
one black satin dress.

519
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
"Cat food, 27 cents."

520
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Sally, darling, please stop -
you're making me blush!

521
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,100
But you're right about Jack.
He's an absolute rat.

522
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,600
I guess, of course,
I don't know anybody but rats.

523
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,900
Except, of course, Fred here.

524
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,800
You do think Fred is nice, don't you?

525
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,300
For you... I hope he is.

526
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,500
Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.

527
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,900
Goodbye, Uncle Sally.

528
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
Goodbye and don't forget
to send that book.

529
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I won't.

530
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,800
Oh, what about the weather report?

531
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh, yes.

532
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,700
Snow flurries expected
this weekend in New Orleans.

533
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,900
Snow flurries expected
this weekend in New Orleans?!

534
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,700
Isn't that just the weirdest?

535
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,600
I bet they haven't had
snow in New Orleans for years.

536
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't know how he thinks them up.

537
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,600
<i>* Moon River *</i>

538
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,400

539
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,200

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,500

556
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

557
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,500
- What you doin'?
- Writing.

558
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,900
Good.

559
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
Well, hello.

560
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

561
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,300
It's probably nothing.

562
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,400
I want to see if he's still there.

563
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,200
See if who's still there?
What are you talking about?

564
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,100
Look.

565
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,100
See? I noticed him
yesterday afternoon.

566
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,300
I didn't want
to sound neurotic, but...

567
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,400
- when he's there again today...
- Who do you think he is?

568
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,600
It could be anybody, of course,

569
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,100
but what crossed my mind was...

570
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,200
suppose Bill's
having us watched, huh?

571
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,000
OK, I'll take care of this.

572
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,300
No. No, don't.

573
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,100
If that's it,
you'll only make it worse.

574
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,800
I'll be careful. You wait here.

575
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,600
Darling, please don't.
I don't think you should.

576
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,100
Take it easy.

577
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,700
I just want to find out
what this is about.

578
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,400
All right, what do you want?

579
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,300
Son, I need a friend.

580
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,800
That's me, that's her,

581
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,100
that's her brother Fred.

582
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,300
You're Holly's father?

583
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Her name ain't Holly.

584
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,100
She was Lula Mae Barnes.

585
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
Was till she married me.

586
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,900
I'm her husband Doc Golightly.

587
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,100
Paul Varjak.

588
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,900
I'm a horse doctor... Animal man.

589
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,700
Do some farming, too,
near Tulip, Texas.

590
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,000
Her brother Fred's
getting out of the army soon.

591
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,400
Lula Mae belongs home with her
husband, brother and children.

592
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Children?

593
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,900
Them's her children.

594
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
She's got four children?

595
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,000
Now, son, I didn't claim
they was her natural children.

596
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,600
Their own precious mother -
precious woman -

597
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,000
passed away July 4th, 1955,
the year of the drought.

598
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,800
When I married Lula Mae,
she was going on 14.

599
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,600
You might think a person of 14
wouldn't know their own mind.

600
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,100
But you take Lula Mae.

601
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,900
She was an exceptional person.

602
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,900
She just plumb broke our hearts
when she run off like she done.

603
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,200
Just plain had no reason.

604
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,200
All the housework
was done by her daughter.

605
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Lula Mae could take it easy.

606
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,000
That woman got positively fat,

607
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,700
while her brother,
he growed up into a giant,

608
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,300
which is a sight different
from how they come to us.

609
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,200
A couple of wild young'uns, they was.

610
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,600
I caught 'em stealing milk
and turkey eggs.

611
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,300
They'd been living with
some mean, no-account people

612
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,800
about 100 mile east of Tulip.

613
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,400
She had cause to run from that house.

614
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,500
Never had none to leave mine.

615
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,100
What about her brother?
Didn't he leave?

616
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,500
No. We had Fred with us
till the army took him.

617
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,000
That's why I come.

618
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I had a letter from him.
He's getting out in February.

619
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,200
That's why I come to get her.

620
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,000
Lula Mae's place is with her
husband, children and brother.

621
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,000
The prize from
a Cracker Jack box. Want it?

622
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,500
Never could understand
why that woman run off.

623
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,000
Don't tell me she weren't happy.

624
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,300
Talky as a jay bird she was,

625
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,200
with something to say
on every subject.

626
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,800
Better than the radio.

627
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,000
The night I proposed,
I cried like a baby.

628
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,900
She said, "Why are you crying?
We'll be married.

629
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,300
"I never been married before."

630
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,200
I laughed and hugged
and squeezed her.

631
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,400
"Never been married before."

632
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,300
Listen, son,
I advise you I need a friend,

633
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
'cause I don't want
to surprise or scare her none.

634
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,600
Let her know I'm here.

635
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
Will you do that, son?

636
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,900
Yeah, sure, Doc.
If that's what you want.

637
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,600
Come on.

638
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,200
All right.

639
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,800
Coming.

640
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,200
Oh, darling, I'm on my way out.

641
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,900
I'm half an hour late.

642
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,400
Maybe we can have a drink tomorrow.

643
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,800
Sure, Lula Mae...

644
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,100
if you're still here tomorrow.

645
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,700
Oh, please, where is he?

646
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,300
Gosh.

647
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,800
Gee, honey, don't they feed you
up here? You're so skinny.

648
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,500
- Hi, Doc.
- Gosh, Lula Mae...

649
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,200
Kingdom come!

650
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,100
What's the matter? You all right?

651
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,800
I guess so... No, I'm not.
Will you help me?

652
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,100
- If I can.
- Come to the bus station.

653
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
He still thinks I'm going back.

654
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,900
I can't play it alone.

655
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,600
He's your husband.

656
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,600
- No, he's not.
- He's not?

657
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,600
It was annulled ages ago.
He just won't accept it.

658
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Please, Fred.
I'll say you're seeing us off.

659
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,100
Don't say anything.

660
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,900
Just meet us out front
in about an hour. Please?

661
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You wait right here, honey.

662
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,400
I'll get the bag.

663
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Why don't I get some magazines?

664
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,400
Please, Fred, don't leave me.

665
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,200
Attention, please.

666
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,700
Leaving from platform 5,
through coach to Dallas...

667
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,400
Philadelphia, Columbus,
Indianapolis, Terre Haute,

668
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,600
St Louis, Tulsa,
Oklahoma City, Denison, Dallas.

669
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,800
Come on, Lula Mae. That's us.

670
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,000
Doc, I'm not coming with you.

671
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Come on. Let's walk quietly.

672
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,200
I'll try and help you
understand. Help me, Fred.

673
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,700
I appreciate your help, but
it's between Lula Mae and me.

674
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,100
Sure, Doc.

675
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,600
I love you, Lula Mae.

676
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,600
I know you do, and
that's just the trouble.

677
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,000
It's a mistake you always made,
trying to love a wild thing.

678
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,200
You were always
lugging home wild things -

679
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,200
a hawk with a broken wing,

680
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,500
a full-grown wildcat
with a broken leg...

681
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,000
Remember?

682
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There's something...

683
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,500
You mustn't give your heart
to a wild thing.

684
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,900
The more you do,
the stronger they get,

685
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,600
until they're strong enough
to fly into a tree,

686
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,100
then to higher trees,
then to the sky.

687
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,700
There's something I got to tell you.

688
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,000
Excuse me.

689
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,600
Couple weeks ago,
I got a letter from Fred.

690
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,700
From Fred?
He's all right, isn't he?

691
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah, he's fine, I guess.

692
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,900
He's getting out of the army
in February.

693
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,800
In February?

694
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,300
Well, that's only four months.

695
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,600
So, you got to come back.

696
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,400
Your place is with us.

697
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,200
Doc, you've got to understand,
I can't come back.

698
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,500
You got to understand
what I'm saying.

699
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,700
I don't want to pressure you,
but I got to.

700
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,100
If you don't come,

701
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,000
I'll have to tell young Fred

702
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,400
he better sign up for another hitch.

703
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
Don't do that.
Don't write that to him.

704
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,300
I'll write him and say
I want him with me.

705
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,800
I'll take care of him.

706
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,400
You're talking crazy, Lula Mae.

707
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,600
Doc, stop calling me that.
I'm not Lula Mae any more.

708
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,600
All right, Lula Mae.

709
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,400
I guess you know what you're doing.

710
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,400
Keep an eye on her, will you, son?

711
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,700
At least see she eats
something once in a while.

712
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,100
Sure, Doc.

713
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,200
So skinny.

714
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,800
Please, Doc. Please understand.

715
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,700
I love you,
but I'm not Lula Mae any more.

716
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,000
I'm not.

717
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,800
You know the terrible thing,
darling?

718
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,200
I am still Lula Mae.
Fourteen, stealing turkey eggs

719
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,500
and running through a briar patch.

720
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,000
Except now I call it
having the mean reds.

721
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,600
Well, it's still too early
to go to Tiffany's.

722
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,700
I guess the next best thing
is a drink.

723
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,600
Yes, I very much need a drink.

724
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,500
Buy me one, Fred, darling?

725
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,900
Sure.

726
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,200
Only promise not to take me home
until I'm drunk.

727
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,000
Until I'm very drunk indeed.

728
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,900
Do you think she's talented?

729
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,600
Deeply and importantly talented?

730
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,000
No.

731
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,700
Amusingly and superficially
talented, yes,

732
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,800
but deeply and importantly, no.

733
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,400
Gracious.

734
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,000
Do you think she's handsomely paid?

735
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Oh, indeed.

736
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,700
Well, let me tell you something.

737
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,200
If I had her money,
I'd be richer than she is.

738
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,000
- How do you figure that?
- I'd keep the candy store.

739
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,300
Old Sally Tomato -
that's my candy store.

740
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,400
I'd always keep Sally.

741
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,400
That's why I'd be richer than she is.

742
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,200
We'd better get a little more air.

743
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
..every Tom, Dick and Harry...

744
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,900
No. Correction.

745
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,300
Every Tom, Dick and Sid -
Harry was his friend.

746
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,200
Anyway, every Tom, Dick and Sid

747
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,500
thinks if he takes a girl to dinner,

748
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,000
she'll just curl up in a little
furry ball at his feet, right?

749
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,800
I have by actual count
been taken to dinner

750
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,600
by 26 different rats
in the last two months.

751
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,700
27, if you count Benny Shacklett,

752
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,400
who's in many ways a super rat.

753
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,400
- I forgot my key.
- Never mind. I buzzed Yunioshi.

754
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,800
Do you know something funny?

755
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,700
In spite of the fact these rats
fork up $50

756
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,500
for the powder room
like little dolls...

757
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,600
I find I have $9 less
in the bank account

758
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,500
than I had six months ago.

759
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,700
So, my darling Fred,

760
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,000
I have tonight made
a very serious decision.

761
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,400
And what is that?

762
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,400
No longer will I play the field.

763
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,000
- Congratulations.
- The field stinks...

764
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,800
both economically and socially,

765
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
and I'm giving it up.

766
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,600
This time I'm calling
the police, the fire department,

767
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,500
and the New York State
Housing Commission,

768
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,800
and, if necessary,
the Board of Health!

769
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,300
Quiet, up there. You want
to wake the whole house?

770
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,700
As Miss Golightly was saying

771
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,000
before she was so rudely interrupted,

772
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,300
Miss Golightly
further announces her intention

773
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,400
to devote her
not inconsiderable talents

774
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,100
to the immediate capture,

775
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,400
for the purpose of matrimony,

776
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,900
of Mr Rutherford...

777
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:03,700
Rusty to his friends, of whom
I'm sure he has many, Trawler.

778
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,000
- Who?
- Rusty Trawler.

779
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,300
You met him at my party.

780
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,200
He came with Mag Wildwood.

781
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,800
Not the beautiful Latin type,

782
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,700
the other one - the one
that looks like a pig.

783
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,900
Remember?

784
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,900
The ninth richest man
in America under 50?

785
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,700
Ah...

786
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:31,700
Do I detect a look
of disapproval in your eye?

787
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,200
Tough beans, buddy,

788
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,500
cos that's the way it's gonna be.

789
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,100
Hi, cat.

790
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,700
- Holly, you're drunk.
- True.

791
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,700
Absolutely true.
True, but irrevelant.

792
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,600
What are you doing?

793
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,100
So I think we should have a drink

794
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,400
to the new
Mrs. Rusty Trawler...me!

795
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,300
Hey, take it easy.

796
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,400
What's up,
don't you think I can do it?

797
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,100
Tell me. I'm interested.
Don't you think I can?

798
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,800
You heard the Doc.

799
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,600
My brother gets out in February.

800
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,700
The Doc won't take him back.

801
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,300
It's all up to me.

802
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,300
I don't know why
you don't understand.

803
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,900
I need money, and I'll do
whatever I have to do to get it.

804
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,400
So this time next month,

805
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,800
I'll be the new Mrs. Rusty Trawler.

806
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,700
I think we should have
a little drink to that.

807
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,800
It's all gone. Isn't that too bad?

808
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,000
Got any whisky upstairs?

809
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,800
But you've had enough.

810
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,400
Go ahead. Get the whisky.

811
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,800
I'll pay you for it.

812
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,100
Holly, please.

813
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,200
No, no, you disapprove of me,
and I do not accept drinks

814
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,400
from gentlemen who disapprove of me.

815
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,000
I'll pay for my own whisky
and don't forget it.

816
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,000
I do not accept drinks
from disapproving gentlemen.

817
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Especially not
disapproving gentlemen

818
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,300
who are kept by other ladies.

819
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,100
So take it.

820
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,800
You should be used
to taking money from ladies.

821
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:19,600
If I were you, I'd be more
careful with my money.

822
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,500
Rusty Trawler is too hard
a way of earning it.

823
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,900
It should take you
exactly four seconds

824
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,200
to cross from here to that door.

825
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,900
I'll give you two.

826
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,600
Hi. I wanted to talk
about the other night,

827
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,500
then I saw the paper, and...

828
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,700
Well, actually, I'm kind
of embarrassed about it,

829
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
but since it concerns you,

830
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,500
I thought I should
talk about it in person.

831
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,000
- What?
- What?

832
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Oh, the earplugs.

833
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
I can't go through
the whole thing again.

834
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,900
It's sufficient to say,

835
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,500
I've come to make up.

836
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,500
As an added inducement,
I have all kinds of news.

837
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,000
Can I come in?

838
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,500
I guess so.

839
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,900
Just a minute.
Do I have a nightgown on?

840
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,900
No, I don't. Would you turn
around for a second?

841
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,100
Never mind. That's corny anyway.

842
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,300
I'll turn around myself.

843
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,600
Come in.

844
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,700
Have...you seen the paper?

845
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,000
Rusty, you mean?

846
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,200
Yes. I know all about it.

847
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,500
Certainly had him
pegged wrong, didn't I?

848
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,000
I thought he was just a rat,

849
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,700
but he was a super rat all along.

850
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,400
A super rat in rat's clothing.

851
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,900
You don't even know the best part.

852
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,500
Not only was he a super rat,

853
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,700
he was also broke.

854
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,900
Broke! I mean, but not a farthing.

855
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,400
His family has money,
but he personally is broke.

856
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,000
It turns out he owes $700,000.

857
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,900
Can you imagine
anyone owing $700,000?

858
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,500
$43, yes.

859
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,700
Anyway, that's why he decided

860
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,500
to marry the queen
of the pig people.

861
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,000
I'll tell you one thing,
Fred, darling,

862
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,900
I'd marry you
for your money in a minute.

863
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,100
- Would you marry me for mine?
- In a minute.

864
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,400
I guess it's lucky
neither of us is rich.

865
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,300
Yeah.

866
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,700
Oh, Fred, darling,
I'm so glad to see you.

867
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,400
What have you been doing?

868
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,200
Writing, mostly.

869
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,500
I sold a story.
Just got word this morning.

870
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,300
Oh, that's marvellous!

871
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,000
It really is, but...

872
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,400
Only how does your decorator
friend feel about it?

873
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,000
Aren't you supposed
to be saving yourself?

874
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,400
You know something?

875
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,400
I haven't got around
to telling her yet.

876
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,600
Look, why don't we go have a drink

877
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,700
or take a walk to celebrate?

878
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,100
All right. There's some
champagne in the icebox.

879
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,800
Why don't you open it
while I get dressed?

880
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,900
I haven't drunk champagne
before breakfast before.

881
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,600
With breakfast on several occasions,

882
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,400
but never before, before.

883
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
I've got a wonderful idea.

884
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,100
We'll spend the day
doing things we've never done.

885
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,700
We'll take turns.
First you, then me.

886
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,700
Of course, I can't think
of anything I've never done.

887
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,100
I've never been
for a walk in the morning.

888
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,100
Not in New York.

889
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:02,600
I've walked here at six,
but I consider that night.

890
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,100
- Do you think it counts?
- Sure. Now we're even.

891
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,400
- Don't you just love it?
- Love what?

892
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,400
Tiffany's.

893
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,700
Isn't it wonderful?

894
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,200
Nothing bad could happen to you
in a place like this?

895
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,500
I don't give a hoot about
jewellery, except diamonds.

896
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,200
Like that.

897
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,200
What do you think?

898
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,600
Well...

899
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,400
Personally, I think it's tacky
to wear diamonds before 40.

900
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,600
You're right, but meantime,
you should have something.

901
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,100
I'll wait.

902
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,400
No. I'm buying you a present.

903
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,600
You bought me a typewriter
ribbon, and it brought luck.

904
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,700
But Tiffany's can be expensive.

905
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,900
I've got my cheque and $10.

906
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,200
I wouldn't let you cash your cheque,

907
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,000
but a present for $10 or under,
that I'll accept.

908
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,700
Of course, I don't know
what we'll find here for $10.

909
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,500
May I help you?

910
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,700
Perhaps. We're looking
for a present for the lady.

911
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,100
Certainly, sir. Is there
something you had in mind?

912
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,100
Well, we had considered diamonds.

913
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:48,900
No offence, but the lady feels
diamonds are tacky for her.

914
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,700
Oh, I think they're
divine on older women,

915
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,200
but they're not right for me,
you understand.

916
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,400
- Certainly.
- In fairness, I should explain

917
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,600
there's also
the problem of finance.

918
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,300
We can only afford
to spend...a limited amount.

919
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,400
May I ask how limited?

920
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,500
- $10.
- $10?

921
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,700
That was the outside figure, yes.

922
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,900
- I see.
- Do you have anything for $10?

923
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,300
Frankly, madam,
within that price range,

924
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,000
the variety of merchandise
is rather limited.

925
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,300
However, I do think
we might have, let's see...

926
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,400
Strictly a novelty,
you understand...

927
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,500
For the lady and gentleman
who has everything,

928
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,100
a sterling silver telephone dialler.

929
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,100
That's $6.75, including tax.

930
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,800
A sterling silver telephone dialler.

931
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,600
Yes, sir. That's $6.75,
including federal tax.

932
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,800
Well, the price is right,
but I must say,

933
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,500
I'd hoped for something more,
how shall I say it,

934
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,300
romantic in feeling.

935
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,700
- What do you think?
- A silver telephone dialler?

936
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,300
I certainly think it's handsome,
but, well, you do understand.

937
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,900
Well, we tried, but...

938
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,000
We could have
something engraved, couldn't we?

939
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,700
Yes, I suppose so.

940
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,100
Yes, indeed.

941
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,600
The problem is, you'd have
to buy something first

942
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,000
in order to have some object
on which to place the engraving.

943
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,200
You see the difficulty?

944
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,500
Well, we could
have this engraved, couldn't we?

945
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,400
I think it would be very smart.

946
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,300
This, I take it,
was not purchased at Tiffany's?

947
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,900
No. Actually, it was purchased
concurrent with...

948
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,200
well, actually, it came inside a...

949
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,600
- a box of Cracker Jack.
- I see.

950
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,700
Do they still really have prizes
in Cracker Jack boxes?

951
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,900
Oh, yes.

952
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,700
That's nice to know.

953
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:49,300
It gives one a feeling
of solidarity,

954
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,600
almost of continuity with
the past, that sort of thing.

955
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,100
Would Tiffany's really
engrave it for us?

956
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,700
They wouldn't feel it
beneath them or anything?

957
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,800
Well, it is rather unusual, madam,

958
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,600
but you'll find that Tiffany's
is very understanding.

959
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,100
If you would tell me the initials,

960
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,100
I think we could have something
ready for you in the morning.

961
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,200
Didn't I tell you
this was a lovely place?

962
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
What is this place, anyway?

963
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,500
You wanted to sit down.
It's the public library.

964
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,200
- You've never been here?
- No. That makes two for me.

965
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,700
I don't see any books.

966
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,500
They're in there.

967
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,900
See?

968
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,100
Each one of these drawers
is stuffed with little cards.

969
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,300
Each little card
is a book or an author.

970
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,000
I think that's fascinating.

971
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,700
V-A-R-J-A-K.

972
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,100
Really?

973
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,000
Look. Isn't it marvellous?

974
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,700
There you are, right
in the public library.

975
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,200
Varjak, Paul. Nine Lives.

976
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,900
Then a lot of numbers.

977
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,600
Do they really have
the book itself, live?

978
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,700
Sure. Follow me.

979
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,100
Number 57. That's us.

980
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,100
57, please.

981
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,000
Nine Lives by Varjak, Paul.

982
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,100
Have you read it?
It's marvellous.

983
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,000
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- You should. He wrote it.

984
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,600
He's Varjak, Paul, in person.

985
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,300
She doesn't believe me.

986
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Show her your driver's licence

987
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,600
or Diner's Club Card or something.

988
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,800
He is the author. Cross my heart
and kiss my elbow.

989
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,700
Would you kindly lower your voice?

990
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,600
Autograph it.

991
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Wouldn't that be nice?
Make it more personal?

992
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,700
Really, Miss...

993
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,700
Go ahead. Don't be so stuck up,
autograph it.

994
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,600
What shall I say?

995
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,600
Something sentimental, I think.

996
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,000
What are you doing? Stop that!

997
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,200
You're defacing public property.

998
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,100
Well, if that's how you feel.

999
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,900
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1000
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,700
I don't think this place
is half as nice as Tiffany's.

1001
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,200
Did you ever steal anything
from a 5-and-10

1002
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,800
when you were a kid?

1003
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,900
No. I'm the sensitive,
bookish type. Did you?

1004
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,900
I used to. I still do now
and then, to keep my hand in.

1005
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,400
Come on.

1006
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,200
You've never done it,
and it's your turn.

1007
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,300
I can't see.

1008
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,600
Hi, cat.
Lady of the house at home?

1009
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,900
Trick or treat?

1010
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,700
You're crazy.
You know that, don't you?

1011
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,900
But I love you anyway.

1012
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,500
- Tooley.
- Yeah?

1013
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,900
I've...got to talk to you.

1014
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,500
All right.

1015
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,000
You want a drink?

1016
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,800
If this is a serious discussion,

1017
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,400
and suddenly
I'm terribly afraid it is,

1018
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,200
you'll have to take off
that ridiculous mask,

1019
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,600
or I'll have to wear one, too.

1020
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,000
Tooley, look, please.

1021
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,300
What's the matter?

1022
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,000
Girl trouble?

1023
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,100
Is that it?

1024
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,700
Oh, I see.

1025
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,700
Well, that's not so serious.

1026
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,600
As a matter of fact,
I've been expecting it.

1027
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,700
I can't say I like it,
but I've been expecting it.

1028
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,100
Who is she?

1029
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,700
Hasn't got anything to do with her.

1030
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,500
This is between you and me.

1031
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,900
Then it is serious.

1032
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,500
Well, now.

1033
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,100
Tooley, you're a very stylish girl.

1034
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,400
Can't we end this stylishly?

1035
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,600
End it?

1036
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,000
Yes.

1037
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,800
Well...

1038
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:19,800
I do believe love
has found Andy Hardy.

1039
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,900
Let's see...a waitress?

1040
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,900
A salesgirl?

1041
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,000
No. She'd have to be rich,
wouldn't she, Paul?

1042
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,900
Someone who could help you.

1043
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,100
Curiously enough...

1044
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,900
She's a girl who can't
help anyone, not even herself.

1045
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,900
But I can help her, and it's
a nice feeling for a change.

1046
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,300
All right.

1047
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,500
I understand.

1048
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,600
I'll tell you what, Paul.

1049
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,300
I am a very stylish girl.

1050
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,000
- What are you doing?
- Writing a cheque.

1051
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,400
Don't look so bewildered.

1052
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,100
Surely you've noticed me
writing cheques before.

1053
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,400
Pay to the order
of Paul Varjak, $1,000.

1054
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,300
Take her away somewhere
for a week.

1055
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,800
You're entitled
to a vacation with pay.

1056
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,800
Simply a matter of fair
labour practice, darling.

1057
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,300
If you were really smart,

1058
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:26,200
you'd get the boys together
and organise a union.

1059
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,700
That way you'd get
all the fringe benefits -

1060
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,600
hospitalisation, a pension plan

1061
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,600
and unemployment insurance
when you're...

1062
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,700
how shall I put it...

1063
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,600
between engagements?

1064
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,700
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1065
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,600
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

1066
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,200
Take the cheque.

1067
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,100
And call your girl.

1068
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,600
No, thanks.
I've got a cheque of my own.

1069
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,500
When you get yourself
a new writer to help,

1070
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,400
try and find one my size.

1071
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,100
That way you won't have
to even shorten the sleeves.

1072
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:10,600
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Excuse me... I'm sorry.

1073
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,600
You look just like
a girl I know named Holly.

1074
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Really!

1075
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,500
I'm sorry.

1076
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,000
Hi.

1077
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,000
What do you want?

1078
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,200
I want to talk to you.

1079
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,000
I'm busy.

1080
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,500
What are you doing?

1081
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,900
Reading.

1082
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,900
"South America:
Land of Wealth and Promise"?

1083
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,900
It's very interesting.

1084
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,300
Let's get out of here.

1085
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:21,000
I said let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

1086
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,600
What's the matter with you?
What's happened?

1087
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,900
Fred, will you please
just leave me alone?

1088
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,100
I love you.

1089
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,300
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies' room.

1090
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,200
- What's the matter with you?
- Let me go.

1091
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,200
- No.
- Fred, let me go.

1092
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,500
Let's get something straight.

1093
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,500
I am not Fred,
nor am I Benny Shacklett.

1094
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,800
My name is Paul, Paul Varjak,
and I love you.

1095
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,600
- Let me go.
- No. What about South America?

1096
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,900
If I'm marrying
a South American,

1097
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,500
I'd better find out
about the country.

1098
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,000
- Marry? What South American?
- Josè.

1099
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,900
- Who's Josè?
- Josè de Silva Pereira.

1100
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Who's Josè de Silva Pereira?

1101
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,300
You met him -
Mag Wildwood's friend.

1102
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,900
The good-looking one
who came with Rusty.

1103
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,900
Well, you won't believe this -

1104
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,400
not only is he handsome and rich,

1105
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,400
he's absolutely cuckoo for me.

1106
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,200
- You're crazy.
- You think you own me?

1107
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,700
That's it exactly.

1108
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,000
That's what everybody always
thinks, but they're wrong.

1109
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,800
Look, I am not everybody.

1110
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,400
Or am I?

1111
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,400
Is that what you really think?

1112
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,000
That I'm no different from
all your rats and super rats?

1113
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,100
Wait a minute.

1114
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,900
If that's it...

1115
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,900
If that's what you really think...

1116
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,800
there's something I want to give you.

1117
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,000
What's that?

1118
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,000
$50 for the powder room.

1119
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,900
The place is in such a mess,
I couldn't face it alone.

1120
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,600
- Ah, you have a message.
- No.

1121
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,400
Olè.

1122
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,500
Good evening, Mr Yunioshi.

1123
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,200
Oh, good evening, Paul.

1124
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,300
Good evening.

1125
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,600
Good evening.

1126
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,200
Please, you must help me.

1127
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,700
Let me go. No!

1128
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Oh, Fred.

1129
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,300
Fred.

1130
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,400
No! No!

1131
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,100
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

1132
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,200
There was a telegram,
and then this...

1133
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,100
crashing everything,
and acting crazy.

1134
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,400
It's appalling.

1135
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,200
I can't have a public scandal.
It's too delicate.

1136
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,300
My name, my position, my family.

1137
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,300
Will there be the police again?

1138
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,700
I don't see why. There's no law
against wrecking your apartment.

1139
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:02,200
- Where is the telegram?
- There it is.

1140
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,800
"Received notice
young Fred killed...

1141
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,900
"in jeep accident,
Fort Riley, Kansas.

1142
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,300
"Your husband and children
join in the sorrow

1143
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,700
"of our mutual loss.

1144
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,500
"Letter following. Love, Doc."

1145
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,900
Her brother Fred.

1146
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,400
This brother,
was she very close to him?

1147
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,800
Yeah.

1148
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,800
What can one do?

1149
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,700
Try to help her.

1150
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,200
I tried. It didn't do much good.

1151
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,000
You got a ranch
or something in Brazil?

1152
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yes.

1153
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,200
That's good. She'll like that.

1154
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,000
Well, you better get in there.

1155
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,500
- Hi.
- Hello. Got your wire.

1156
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,900
How did you know where to reach me?

1157
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,400
I tried everything -
called people, asked around,

1158
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,800
then suddenly thought of the
phone book. I'm glad you came.

1159
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,400
You look fine.

1160
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,800
I'm fat as a pig,
and I haven't had my hair done,

1161
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,700
but I'm happy, really happy -
it probably shows.

1162
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,500
You look très distinguè
yourself.

1163
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,000
I've got a job.
I've been writing a little.

1164
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I've read three of your stories -

1165
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,900
two in the New Yorker and one
in that funny little magazine.

1166
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,100
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1167
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:00,000
- I've taken up knitting.
- So I see.

1168
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,900
It'll probably look very nice
once it's finished.

1169
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,600
I'm nervous about it.

1170
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Josè brought up the blueprints
for a ranch house.

1171
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,000
Maybe those and my knitting
instructions got switched.

1172
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,000
It's possible
I'm knitting a ranch house!

1173
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,900
Really, I can't tell you
how divinely happy I am.

1174
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,100
What is that, anyhow?

1175
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,000
Portuguese -
a very complicated language.

1176
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,700
4,000 irregular verbs.

1177
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,200
Very impressive.
What's it mean?

1178
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,900
I believe you are in league
with the butcher.

1179
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,000
Holly, what's this about?

1180
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,400
Why did you want to see me?

1181
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,500
Josè's in Washington tonight,
so I thought I'd ask you over.

1182
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,000
Well, I've said goodbye
to everyone else I care about.

1183
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,500
- You're going somewhere?
- Rio, tomorrow.

1184
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,100
I've got the plane ticket, and
I've even said goodbye to Sally.

1185
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,900
- Josè's flying with you?
- We're on separate planes.

1186
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,600
He thinks it's wrong
to travel together.

1187
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,800
His family's important, so he
worries about things like that.

1188
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,800
I thought I'd show off
and cook dinner for us.

1189
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,800
Did I tell you
how utterly happy I am?

1190
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,900
Yes.

1191
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,000
You are getting married, then?

1192
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,300
Well, he hasn't really asked me,
not in so many words.

1193
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:34,700
Four, you mean?

1194
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,000
Well, that's how many
words it takes.

1195
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,700
"Will you marry me?"

1196
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,300
We'll get married, all right.

1197
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,300
In church and with his family there,

1198
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,100
and that's why he's waiting
till we get to Rio...probably.

1199
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,600
Do you think it's trying
to tell us something?

1200
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,400
I hope you like chicken
and rice with chocolate sauce.

1201
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
It's an Indian classic, dear.

1202
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,400
Three months ago,
I couldn't scramble eggs.

1203
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,900
Are you all right?

1204
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,800
Golly, darling. I did so want
to impress you.

1205
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,400
Look, I'm not much
for chicken with sauce, anyway.

1206
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,600
Why don't we go out somewhere
for a farewell dinner?

1207
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,300
That would be fun,
as long as I can go like this.

1208
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,100
Years from now,

1209
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,500
years and years,

1210
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,200
I'll be back...

1211
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,600
me and my nine Brazilian brats.

1212
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,300
They'll be dark like Josè, of course,

1213
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,000
but they'll have bright green,
beautiful eyes.

1214
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,200
I'll bring them back, all right,

1215
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,900
because they must see this.

1216
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,600
Oh, I love New York.

1217
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:57,200
Then why are you leaving?
What's in it for you, anyway?

1218
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,600
I know what you're thinking.
I don't blame you.

1219
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,300
I've always thrown out
such a jazzy line,

1220
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:09,400
but except for Doc and yourself,
Josè's my first non-rat romance.

1221
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,300
Not that he's my idea
of the absolute finito.

1222
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,600
He's too prim and cautious
to be my absolute ideal.

1223
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,400
If I could choose from anybody,
I wouldn't pick Josè.

1224
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,100
Nero, maybe, or Albert Schweitzer.

1225
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,700
Or Leonard Bernstein.

1226
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:28,400
But I am mad about Josè.

1227
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,200
I'd give up smoking if he asked me.

1228
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,600
Come on, darling, let's eat.

1229
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,100
It's getting late.

1230
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,900
I'm leaving tomorrow
and I haven't begun to pack.

1231
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:05,100
Didn't want Josè to think
I'm a girl who loses her key,

1232
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,300
so I had 26 of them made.

1233
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400
Wait. I got a better idea.

1234
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,800
Kind of a farewell gesture.

1235
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,100
Somebody must have tripped the lock.

1236
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,800
Ah, crafty devil, that Yunioshi.

1237
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,300
Wake up, wake up!
The British are coming!

1238
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,000
Or, in this case, the Brazilians.

1239
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,300
Exactly.

1240
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,300
I've still got to clean up that rice.

1241
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,700
Hey, you know...

1242
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:35,000
There she are who did it!
The wanted woman! There!

1243
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,800
Groenburger. Narcotics squad.

1244
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,000
What do you mean?

1245
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,100
What's going on?

1246
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,800
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- What boss?

1247
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,000
Sally Tomato. Ask him. Come on.

1248
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,300
Look around for narcotic!
They got plenty in there.

1249
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,800
- What's your name?
- Varjak.

1250
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,600
Hold it down over there!

1251
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,900
Paul Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K. Get lost!

1252
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,500
Get out!

1253
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,100
I'm a writer. W-R-l-T-E-R.

1254
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,500
I can't answer all your questions.

1255
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:27,900
One at a time. One, please. Good.

1256
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,800
I can't answer all your questions.

1257
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,100
One at a time.

1258
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,800
Knock it off!

1259
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,500
Now, why don't you start?

1260
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,800
Did you carry messages in code?

1261
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,300
Of course not.

1262
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,500
I'd just give Mr O'Shaughnessy
the weather report.

1263
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,400
Simply do not ask me
what this is all about.

1264
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,300
- You did visit Tomato?
- Every week. What's wrong?

1265
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,500
Tomato's part
of the narcotics syndicate.

1266
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,600
He never mentioned narcotics.

1267
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:59,100
These wretched people
keep persecuting him.

1268
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,900
He's a deeply sensitive person,
a darling old man.

1269
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,000
- Then you're innocent.
- Of course.

1270
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,500
What are you going to do
about it? Who's your lawyer?

1271
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,900
I don't know.
Mr O'Shaughnessy, I guess.

1272
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,800
Mr O'Shaughnessy!

1273
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,000
Hey! Get out of here!

1274
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,500
All right, come on! OK, move.

1275
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,900
Shut up!

1276
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,400
Get in there!

1277
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,500
- Yeah.
- Mr Paul Varjak?

1278
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
Yeah.

1279
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,700
Ready with Mr Berman
in Hollywood.

1280
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,100
Kindly deposit $3
for the first 3 minutes.

1281
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,400
Hello? Hello?

1282
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,700
OJ Berman here. Who's calling?

1283
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,000
- This is Paul Varjak.
- Nice to talk to you, kid.

1284
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,400
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1285
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,200
I'm a friend of Holly's.
We met at a party.

1286
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,400
- Who?
- Paul. Paul Varjak.

1287
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:25,200
V-A-R...

1288
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,200
Mr Berman, this is Fred.

1289
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,300
Oh, Fred, baby, huh?

1290
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,800
You're calling about the kid, huh?

1291
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,900
Everything's under control.
You can just relax.

1292
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,800
I spoke to my lawyer in New York.

1293
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,800
I told him to take care of it,
but keep my name anonymous.

1294
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:47,800
- What?
- I want no part of it. Hear me?

1295
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,200
You sound like you're in a tunnel.

1296
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,700
It's this executive phone I have.

1297
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,600
- What?
- Executive phone!

1298
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,000
They only got her on 10,000 bail.

1299
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,400
My lawyer can get her out at 10am.

1300
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,400
I tell you what you do.

1301
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,100
You bust into that dump she lives in,

1302
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,600
collect all her junk,

1303
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:12,100
go get her, take her to a hotel
under a phoney name.

1304
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,600
Keep her away from the reporters.

1305
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,000
Will you do that?

1306
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,400
Sure, Mr Berman.

1307
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,500
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate...

1308
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,200
Forget it.
I mean, I owe her something.

1309
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,500
Not that I owe her anything,
if you get right down to it,

1310
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,200
but...she's a crazy.

1311
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,800
She's a phoney.

1312
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,500
But she's a real phoney.

1313
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,500
Know what I mean, kid?

1314
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1315
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,100
Thanks, Mr Berman. Thanks a lot.

1316
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:46,800
Right!

1317
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,300
Why don't you behave?

1318
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:08,400
Quel night.

1319
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,300
I did a little housebreaking
while you were away.

1320
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,700
Clayton Hotel, driver.
84th and Madison.

1321
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,300
OJ thinks you should
stay out of sight for a while.

1322
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,800
I got your stuff here, including cat.

1323
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,200
Hope he's all right.

1324
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,100
Hello, cat...

1325
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,100
Poor no-name slob.

1326
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,800
Listen, darling,
did you find that plane ticket?

1327
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,400
- Here. We can cash it in.
- Are you kidding?

1328
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:53,100
- What time is it?
- A little after 10.

1329
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,500
Idlewild Airport, driver.

1330
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:58,000
- Never mind. You can't do that.
- Why not?

1331
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,200
You don't understand.
You're under indictment.

1332
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:03,500
You jump bail,
they'll throw away the key.

1333
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,400
Don't be ridiculous.
Soon I'll be married

1334
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,400
to the future president of Brazil.

1335
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,200
That'll give me diplomatic
immunity or something.

1336
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,700
I wouldn't bet on it.

1337
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,600
What is it, darling?

1338
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,900
I have a message for you.

1339
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:23,800
Oh, yes, I see.

1340
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,900
Did he bring it in person,
or was it shoved under the door?

1341
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,500
A cousin.

1342
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,800
Hand me my purse, will you, darling?

1343
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,300
A girl can't read
that sort of thing...

1344
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,600
without her lipstick.

1345
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,400
You read it to me, darling.

1346
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,900
I don't think I can quite...bear...

1347
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:47,000
Are you sure you want me to?

1348
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,800
"My dearest little girl,

1349
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,700
"I have loved you
knowing you were not as others,

1350
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,700
"but conceive of my despair

1351
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,200
"upon discovering in such
a brutal and public style

1352
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,900
"how very different you are
from the manner of woman

1353
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:11,100
"a man of my position
could hope to make his wife.

1354
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,600
"I grieve for the disgrace
of your present circumstances,

1355
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,700
"and I do not find it in my heart

1356
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:19,400
"to add my condemn...

1357
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:22,300
"to the condemn that surrounds you.

1358
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:27,000
"so I hope you find it
in your heart not to condemn me.

1359
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,900
"I have my family
to protect, and my name.

1360
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:34,000
"I am a coward where
these institutions enter.

1361
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,300
"Forget me, beautiful child,

1362
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,600
"and may God be with you.

1363
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,000
"Josè."

1364
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,700
Well...

1365
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,600
Well, at least he's honest.

1366
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,500
It's kind of touching.

1367
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,300
Touching! That square-ball jazz.

1368
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,800
He says he's a coward.

1369
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,100
All right! So he's not a regular rat

1370
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,700
or even a super rat.

1371
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:02,500
He's just a scared little mouse,
that's all.

1372
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,600
But, oh, golly... Gee, damn!

1373
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:16,700
Well, so much for South America.

1374
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,000
You're not cut out
for queen of the Pampas, anyway.

1375
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,900
- Clayton Hotel.
- Idlewild.

1376
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,300
What?

1377
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,900
The plane leaves at 12.
On it I plan to be.

1378
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,700
- Holly, you can't.
- Et pourquoi pas?

1379
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:33,200
I'm not hotfooting it
after Josè,

1380
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,500
if that's what you think. Oh, no.

1381
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,500
As far as I'm concerned, he's
the future president of nowhere.

1382
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,200
Only why waste a plane ticket?

1383
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,900
Besides, I've never been to Brazil.

1384
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,800
Please, darling, don't sit there
looking at me like that.

1385
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,700
I'm going and that's that.

1386
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:56,000
All they want are my services
as a witness against Sally.

1387
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:59,200
Nobody has any intention
of prosecuting me.

1388
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:03,300
To begin with, they don't have
a ghost of a chance.

1389
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,300
This town's finished for me...

1390
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,200
at least for a while.

1391
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,100
There are certain shades of limelight

1392
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,600
that can wreck a girl's complexion.

1393
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,900
They'll have the rope up
at every saloon in town.

1394
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,800
I'll tell you what.
When you get back to town,

1395
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,900
call the New York Times
or whoever you call.

1396
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:27,400
Mail me a list of the 50 richest
men in Brazil. The 50 richest!

1397
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Holly.

1398
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,400
I won't let you do this.

1399
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,400
- You won't?
- Holly, I'm in love with you.

1400
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,600
- So what?
- So what? So plenty!

1401
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,200
I love you. You belong to me.

1402
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:43,500
No. People don't belong to people.

1403
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,800
Of course they do.

1404
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,500
- Nobody's putting me in a cage.
- I want to love you.

1405
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,000
It's the same thing.

1406
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,100
No, it's not! Holly!

1407
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:54,400
I'm not Holly.
I'm not Lula Mae, either.

1408
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,000
I don't know who I am!
I'm like cat, a no-name slob.

1409
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,900
We belong to nobody.

1410
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,900
We don't even belong to each other.

1411
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,900
Stop the cab.

1412
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,000
What do you think?

1413
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
This ought to be the right place

1414
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,100
for a tough guy like you -
garbage cans, rats galore.

1415
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:20,600
Scram! I said take off! Beat it!

1416
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,900
Let's go.

1417
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,200
Driver...

1418
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:39,200
Pull over here.

1419
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:50,200
You know what's wrong with you,
Miss Whoever-You-Are?

1420
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,700
You're chicken.

1421
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,200
You've got no guts.

1422
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,300
You're afraid to say,
"OK, life's a fact."

1423
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,900
People do fall in love.

1424
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,500
People do belong to each other,

1425
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,200
because that's the only chance
anybody's got for happiness.

1426
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:06,700
You call yourself a free spirit,
a wild thing.

1427
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:09,700
You're terrified somebody's
going to stick you in a cage.

1428
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,900
Well, baby,
you're already in that cage.

1429
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,200
You built it yourself.

1430
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,600
And it's not bounded
by Tulip, Texas, or Somaliland.

1431
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,600
It's wherever you go.

1432
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,900
Because no matter where you run,

1433
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:22,500
you end up running into yourself.

1434
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:33,100
Here. I've been carrying
this thing around for months.

1435
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:34,900
I don't want it any more.

1436
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,100
Here, cat!

1437
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,900
Cat!

1438
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,900
Where's the cat?

1439
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,900
I don't know.

1440
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,900
<i>* Two drifters *</i>

1441
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,400
<i>* Off to see the world *</i>

1442
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:26,400
<i>* There's such a lot of world *</i>

1443
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:31,100
<i>* To see *</i>

1444
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:34,900
<i>* We're after *</i>

1445
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:38,100
<i>* The same *</i>

1446
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,900
<i>* Rainbow's end *</i>

1447
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,500
<i>* Waitin' 'round the bend *</i>

1448
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,300
<i>* My huckleberry friend *</i>

1449
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:56,900
<i>* Moon River *</i>

1450
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,700
<i>* And me. *</i>
