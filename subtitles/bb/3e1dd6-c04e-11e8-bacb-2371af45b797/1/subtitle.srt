1
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,987
Can you do this?

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,564
Anything you can do I can do better.

3
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,500
Do you think they can manage it?

4
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,461
A bunch of lazy bums.

5
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,481
Five, ten, fifteen

6
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,610
Oh, no

7
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,524
Don't trespass?

8
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,664
Consider yourself lucky.

9
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,591
- Tong!
- Uncle!

10
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,065
It's late. Go to bed.

11
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,635
Must finish it before tomorrow.

12
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,037
Uncle!

13
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,944
Hurt yourself!

14
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,986
Sorry to have got...

15
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,652
you into this.

16
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,956
I don't mind.

17
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,256
Come on, get up!

18
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,766
Be quick... it's ready.

19
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,902
Get out!

20
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,338
Out of my way.

21
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,806
Master!

22
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,750
Who's that kid?

23
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,962
Tong, the Cripple's nephew.

24
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,033
I must win, and win well.

25
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,503
That can be arranged.

26
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,009
No!

27
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,880
- What's happened!
- Stupid fool!

28
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,893
You can't lose.

29
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,033
Today's our...

30
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,067
saint's birthday.

31
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,367
So we stage a game to celebrate.

32
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,069
All participants...

33
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,407
must come unarmed.

34
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,880
They must climb up here with hands tied.

35
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,449
Then across the bridge.

36
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:32,621
And win the ball with their feet.

37
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,689
Prizes are roast pig and some cash.

38
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:44,565
On your marks.

39
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,941
Ready!

40
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,017
Wait for me!

41
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,954
Tie your hands!

42
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,321
- Ready!
- Wait!

43
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,631
Glasses are not allowed.

44
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,703
Dumb fatso!

45
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,991
Don't worry! I'm supporting you.

46
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,271
You again!

47
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,028
- What's the matter?
- He...

48
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,268
I've made it!

49
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,843
I'll pay you more.

50
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,114
Got no time for you.

51
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:07,243
- Great!
- Tong's good!

52
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,948
I've got it!

53
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,232
Are you alright?

54
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,539
Are you alright?

55
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,768
Murder! Grab him!

56
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,279
Take these money and run!

57
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,543
Go there...

58
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,381
if you need help!

59
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,749
I'm staying!

60
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,347
Why? They're after your blood.

61
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,632
- What is it?
- Where's your nephew?

62
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,895
- Haven't seen him all day.
- Are you sure?

63
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,307
- Look around!
- Yes...

64
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,111
Where could he be?

65
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:24,383
It was a nasty blow for master.

66
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,453
- What are you about?
- No!

67
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,258
We'll wait for him.

68
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,363
- Guard the doors.
- Yes!

69
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,046
Tse Wong Terrace.

70
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,528
"Forced to move! Horrible!"

71
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,811
Big Brother!

72
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,124
This is a matter of life and death.

73
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,757
We must...

74
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,324
beat the Indians.

75
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,361
- If we lose...
- We'll lose our livelihood.

76
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,958
- No more shoes to shine.
- No more cars to wash!

77
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,537
Take him off!

78
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,844
Where's...

79
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,502
your stamina?

80
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,279
Big Brother!

81
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,115
What's so funny?

82
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,852
How could you missed an open goal?

83
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,893
Where's your fighting spirit?

84
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,861
Otherwise, we wouldn't have lost.

85
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,565
You must keep moving on the field.

86
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,073
Send more crosses over.

87
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,767
Why just standing around?

88
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,206
Pass it to me!

89
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,975
Try the sliding tackle!

90
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,283
A goalie must not afraid of injury.

91
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,021
Terrific!

92
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,431
Blood! I smell trouble!

93
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,104
Don't let him go!

94
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,336
Stop him!

95
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,473
Wait!

96
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,432
Look for him!

97
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:36,405
Wine, glorious wine!

98
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:59,166
Welcome, King of the football maestro!
Welcome!

99
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,370
King of the football maestro!

100
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,642
Stop pushing!

101
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,770
Who is he?

102
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,382
Do you know our idol?

103
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,452
Ladies and gentlemen.

104
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:19,354
We are every honored today.

105
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,450
For the presence of King,
our football maestro.

106
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,462
To officiate
the opening of this stadium.

107
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,431
A big hand for king!

108
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,334
He has done well with football!

109
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,010
Want to buy...

110
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,604
a lottery ticket?

111
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,479
This is the chance...

112
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,074
of a lifetime!

113
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:51,019
Luck has never...

114
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,181
been on my side.

115
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,423
But I'll give it another try.

116
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,759
I've also finished for the day.
Thank you

117
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,974
- Give me one of those.
- Okay!

118
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,506
Want to buy a lottery ticket?

119
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,675
The last one?

120
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,744
You're dishonest!

121
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,884
Go away if you don't want to buy.

122
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,694
Take me for a fool?

123
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,366
Here comes the fool!

124
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,899
I'm no fool!

125
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,611
- Mister...
- No!

126
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,212
Not!

127
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,519
"Cannon" Sun, 26 Tse Wong Terrace...

128
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,452
That's my old address.

129
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,554
Are you blind?

130
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,860
- Pickpocket!
- Where?

131
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,559
- You slashed my wallet!
- Go to hell!

132
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,967
You go to hell!

133
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,115
Give me back my money!

134
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,050
- I'll make you do it!
- No.

135
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,087
What is it? Stop!

136
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,230
You are disturbing the peace!

137
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,330
But he slashed my wallet!

138
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,732
Do you know who I am?

139
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,826
Who are you?

140
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,630
I'm a cop!

141
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,868
Come with me!

142
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,407
- What about my money?
- It'll be used as exhibit in Court.

143
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,444
They're from the same gang!

144
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,516
Give me back my money!

145
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,114
What happened?

146
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,859
- Who threw it at me?
- I'm sorry!

147
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,237
Here you are.

148
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,810
- Hurt yourself?
- Making a fool of me?

149
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,075
- They are coming...
- Run!

150
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,209
Run!

151
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,318
Stop!

152
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,656
- Run for it!
- Where are we going?

153
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,852
To my home!

154
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,258
But I've never met you before.

155
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,000
You've got all my lottery tickets.

156
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,398
Is this yours as well?

157
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,432
Yes!

158
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,368
- 'Cannon' Sun?
- That's right.

159
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,306
He's my dad.

160
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,137
What a coincidence! Where's he?

161
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,782
- He's going...
- Gone abroad?

162
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,617
He's gone two years ago.

163
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,822
My mother went before him,

164
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,423
They're both dead.

165
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,361
I'm sorry about it.

166
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,070
It doesn't matter.

167
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,387
Move over!

168
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,718
Don't block the way.

169
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,160
How come we're here?

170
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,892
Damn it!

171
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,929
You?

172
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,368
Brother, you...

173
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,969
He's your brother?

174
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,543
I didn't mean it.

175
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,942
It's okay. Why did you run away?

176
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,548
I want you to join our team.

177
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,276
I don't know how to play football.

178
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,249
But you've got a powerful shot.

179
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,948
We'll be invincible if you join us.

180
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,162
I...

181
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,591
I know a good player when I see one.

182
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,270
Head.

183
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,442
We can't afford to lose.

184
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:18,972
What about me?

185
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,516
Play up front, of course.

186
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,813
You mean I'm a forward?

187
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,979
Stop him!

188
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,588
Tong, I'll stop him. Go!

189
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,426
Kick it! Tackle him!

190
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,465
Tong!

191
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,468
Go for it!

192
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,944
Why can't he stand straight?

193
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,543
I told you?

194
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,008
Mine!

195
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,183
Tackle him!

196
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,850
- Look!
- A goal!

197
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,260
This is unbelievable!

198
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,594
Well done!

199
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,896
You really can't play football?

200
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,665
Go to hell!

201
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,113
Tackle him! Don't let him score!

202
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:30,045
Let me stop him. You go...

203
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,792
- What are you doing?
- Nothing at all.

204
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,631
Go to die.

205
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,760
Don't stand around...

206
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,624
like a penguin!

207
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,894
But I'm a forward!

208
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,234
Him again.

209
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,914
Oh god, a goal!

210
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,382
This goal has been disallowed!

211
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,292
You're biased!

212
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,658
Want a fight?

213
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,722
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

214
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,571
We're in big trouble now.

215
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,366
Just have a little tolerance.

216
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,843
Beat him up!

217
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,661
Run!

218
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,027
Can you make it?

219
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,867
I can't!

220
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,865
A real foot brawl!

221
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,743
Give it to me!

222
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,041
Where are you buddies?

223
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,916
They're the first to run.

224
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,552
I'll share this with you.

225
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,456
Why hang around those bums all day?

226
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,859
Find yourself a job.

227
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,861
Just ignore her.

228
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,332
No, I want a job.

229
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,704
Try your luck...

230
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,507
- with a football club!
- Right!

231
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,251
The first time...

232
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,853
you chased me out of town.

233
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,946
The second time I was beaten up.

234
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,988
- The next time...
- Next time?

235
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,423
I may even lose my life.

236
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,656
But if we sign...

237
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,127
on with a club.

238
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,597
We'll have a chance to become famous.

239
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,033
Then what?

240
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,640
Then we'll be rich!

241
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,269
We may even have our own cars.

242
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,472
We will have nothing...

243
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,382
to worry about.

244
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,423
How can we be famous?

245
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,620
Ask him!

246
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,956
"Lung Wah Sports Club Player Recruitment"

247
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,097
Great...

248
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,672
Excellent, six out of ten.

249
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,468
Right, just like Pele.

250
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,144
Thank you!

251
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,080
Thumb down?

252
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:05,929
You've not got Pele's footwork.

253
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,157
Taking the Mickey out of me?

254
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,793
Think you can make it?

255
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,371
You can tell by my look that I've failed.

256
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:19,273
- Next, Lee Tong!
- I'm not going.

257
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,971
- Lee Tong!
- He's calling you.

258
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,172
If you can't make it...

259
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,543
Go try your luck.

260
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,982
- No...
- Go!

261
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,712
- Lee Tong?
- Yes!

262
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,346
Perform the same routine.

263
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,053
Wait!

264
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,096
Have I seen him somewhere before?

265
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,492
Remember me?

266
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,074
So he's a friend.

267
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:56,043
He's the best player around.

268
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,511
He makes all decisions for the club.

269
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,410
I can't lower myself to beat him up.

270
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,281
This is his club.

271
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,280
Thumb up.

272
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,393
I know you're a natural born player.

273
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,462
You're in.

274
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:19,066
I bet he has pulled some strings.

275
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,641
Good.

276
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,942
Have we met...

277
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,304
Forget the past. Think about the future.

278
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,339
What future?

279
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,248
You're now a member of the Lung Wah Club.

280
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,427
He's here? The maestro's here.

281
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,961
Tong.

282
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,104
Lee Tong, the Player of the Century.

283
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,078
Is he really a natural born player?

284
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,677
I wasn't too bad.

285
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,523
Maybe that's fate.

286
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,889
Take you chance.

287
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,329
You'll make it if you work hard.

288
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,197
Don't let me down.

289
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:38,879
Let's begin today's training with...

290
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,113
Boss!

291
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,753
I'm taking this session myself.

292
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,826
You're...

293
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,624
in luck today.

294
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,766
I'll turn you...

295
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,201
into men of steel.

296
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,937
A player...

297
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,539
Must be tough.

298
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,749
- Lee Tong!
- Yes!

299
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,950
I'll show you how to play.

300
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,222
The boss likes...

301
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,591
good young players.

302
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,858
Tackle me!

303
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,171
What is it?

304
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,405
Don't close in...

305
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,847
when you tackle!

306
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,076
Remember it!

307
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,620
- It's important
- Okay!

308
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,347
Let's reverse our roles.

309
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,493
This is a foul!

310
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,373
So you must think of a better way.

311
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,914
The referee won't notice
things like these.

312
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,264
These are deliberate fouls.

313
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,669
Don't use them.

314
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,504
What's his best position?

315
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:54,009
He sure can take some sticks.

316
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:58,145
- Put him on the ground staff.
- You're getting very smart.

317
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,574
This is too tough.

318
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,112
Give it up.

319
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,180
I disagree.

320
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,377
Success won't come easy.

321
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,287
You must have hurt yourself...

322
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,690
doing acrobatics.

323
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:42,198
This is not too bad.

324
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,761
I'm sorry, Tong.

325
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,570
Fanny, come here.

326
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,570
Let's go...

327
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,970
and see Tong train.

328
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,836
But let's leave him...

329
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,742
now to rest.

330
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,481
One day,

331
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,918
I'll be as good as you.

332
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,405
I've found a job.

333
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:30,576
Everybody treats me well.

334
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,575
I hope you like the walking stick.

335
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,467
Stand closer!

336
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,368
Don't be afraid of the ball.

337
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,465
That's right!

338
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,827
- Give me the ball!
- Yes!

339
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,862
You forgot?

340
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,598
Use your hands!

341
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,730
Not your feet!

342
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,175
- Throw it to me, ball boy.
- Yes!

343
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,282
- Ball boy!
- Yes!

344
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,194
- Ball boy!
- Yes!

345
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,438
Good

346
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,175
- Boss.
- Let's call it a day.

347
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,248
Right, dismiss.

348
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,527
Give me those!

349
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,125
Have a cup of tea, boss.

350
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,222
Where did he go?

351
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,995
- Boss!
- What did you try to do to me?

352
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,467
No!

353
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,331
You're out, forever!

354
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,004
But boss... I beg you.

355
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,312
I've got a scapegoat.

356
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,830
What are you...

357
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,467
staring at?

358
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,250
You're staring at me, too.

359
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,012
Want to see who has got a tougher leg?

360
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,587
Chicken!

361
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,749
Coward!

362
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:06,592
Give me a towel!

363
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,361
Don't be late tomorrow!

364
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,577
We're almost there.

365
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,878
Tong will be...

366
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,147
- a star real soon.
- Are you kidding?

367
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,523
I can even...

368
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,215
offer you membership.

369
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,290
Don't believe you.

370
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,325
"Authorized Persons Only"

371
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,689
Here we are!

372
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,331
Come on!

373
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,894
We're not allowed in.

374
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,436
Let's try the main entrance.

375
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,998
This is a big ground.

376
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,975
Tong! He's in there.

377
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,855
Tong, over there!

378
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,690
Be quick!

379
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:53,131
Tong, we're here!

380
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,466
How are you?

381
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,280
- Fine.
- Improved?

382
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,409
How long have you been here?

383
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,675
I hired you...

384
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,381
as a ball boy.

385
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,982
So go do your job!

386
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,702
- He's a ball boy.
- He doesn't even have a jersey.

387
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,999
I thought he was a superstar.

388
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,938
- It's all a lie!
- Let's go.

389
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,143
Tackle him, closer!

390
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,051
"Changing Room"

391
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,226
Be quick!

392
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,760
Take a shower! Get changed!

393
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,663
I've avenged you.

394
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:11,908
A very pretty little girl, boss.

395
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,573
That's what...

396
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,618
you said the left time.

397
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,747
But this one is Danish.

398
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,384
She just arrived...

399
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,920
in Hong Kong.

400
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:33,732
She's fantastic!

401
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,168
I'm sure you will enjoy her.

402
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,900
You'll come back for more.

403
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,402
She sounds delicious.

404
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,440
I must carry on and learn.

405
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,881
That's right!

406
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,046
I must improve my stamina.

407
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,799
- Come on.
- Here you are!

408
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,638
- Look at this.
- It's mine.

409
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,035
Left and right, here!

410
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,306
Left and right, here!

411
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,854
The God shows me the way.

412
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,789
- Wonderful!
- That's nothing!

413
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,261
Who are you trying to fool?

414
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,764
Go!

415
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,355
Left and right!

416
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,261
Left and right!

417
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,239
That's excellent!

418
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,039
I'll show you more!

419
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,306
- Watch out!
- I will!

420
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,525
- Give me a kiss!
- No!

421
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,153
Don't be afraid. Come on!

422
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,966
It's a misunderstanding.

423
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,930
No wonder...

424
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,901
you're still wearing a hat!

425
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,898
I back Lung Wah to win!

426
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,136
Yes, me too.

427
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,643
Me too...

428
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,976
Even money for Lung Wah to win.

429
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,079
I can't see Lung Wah lose.

430
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,882
Check carefully.

431
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,215
No mistakes!

432
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,692
Thanks!

433
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:19,131
Fifty cents for Seng Sun to win.

434
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,295
Save it for an ice cream.

435
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,269
Lung Wah again, good!

436
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,738
I'll put everything on Lung Wah.

437
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:30,939
I know!

438
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,073
Give the boss a call.

439
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,322
Lung Wah's favorite to win.

440
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,625
Don't worry.

441
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,854
Accept all bets.

442
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,224
Yes, boss.

443
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:10,279
Why didn't you wait for us?

444
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,518
- Have a drink, King.
- Okay!

445
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,889
Buy me a watch tomorrow!

446
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,087
- Okay!
- Sure!

447
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,526
It's a promise!

448
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,832
Go away!

449
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,663
Good!

450
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:37,981
$50,000 as usual!

451
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,079
Is that all?

452
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,183
I'll make it $70,000

453
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,453
What did you say?

454
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,895
With the high cost of living...

455
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,761
Okay! $100,000.

456
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,163
I'll make it look real.

457
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,875
Is this okay?

458
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,602
Just put it here.

459
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,212
Let's drink to us!

460
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,542
We'll make a good team.

461
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,177
I want to make the ball boy a reserve.

462
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,813
But he can't play.

463
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,353
That's what I like about him.

464
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,893
I've brought...

465
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,520
you Lulu and Mimi.

466
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,394
They're the most beautiful girls here.

467
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,264
Lee Tong...

468
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,599
I'm sorry, coach.

469
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,902
You're in luck.

470
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,810
- Boy!
- In Luck?

471
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,546
"Substitute Lee Tong"

472
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,984
That's me?

473
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,354
King seems to like you.

474
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,561
I've made it!

475
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,732
- You're crazy!
- Coach!

476
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,568
- I've made it!
- I've done it!

477
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,580
You're lovely.

478
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,585
They're beautiful!

479
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,461
You like them?

480
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,190
They're yours.

481
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,101
What about you?

482
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,901
I've got another pair.

483
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,176
He treat them...

484
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,303
like his concubines!

485
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,289
Try them on, you'll need them.

486
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,461
How much money's in the pool?

487
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,164
It's huge, and the money's
on Lung Wah to win.

488
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,268
Look!

489
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,447
Excuse me.

490
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,708
- Let's go!
- Shut up!

491
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,510
- Lung Wah's not a certainty!
- 20 dollars, Lung Wah win.

492
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,877
Can't you say something better?

493
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,188
I'll place the bet for you.

494
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,322
Don't push me!

495
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,226
$20 on Lung Wah to win.

496
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,029
- He's pretty smart!
- It's done.

497
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,866
- Fine!
- Twenty cents please!

498
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,737
- Sure, it's worth it!
- Thanks!

499
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,975
- Good luck!
- I hope so.

500
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,539
I'll place your bet for you.

501
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,139
Lung Wah to win!

502
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,614
Where's Lee Tong?

503
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,314
He's on the substitutes' bench.

504
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,223
Be careful, boss.

505
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,921
Sit...

506
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,623
Manager Mr Fok.

507
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,425
How do you rate...

508
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,332
Seng Sun's chances?

509
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,506
We're on a big bonus to win.

510
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,300
My boss wants...

511
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,504
to be famous.

512
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,944
I'll be rich if we win.

513
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,281
That goes without saying.

514
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,821
That's all.

515
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,949
It's not even time yet!

516
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,690
King beats one of...

517
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,627
the Hsin Sang defenders.

518
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,495
And another, with a beautiful dribble.

519
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,761
He's now being surrounded
by three players.

520
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,565
Another ten yards.

521
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,003
And they cannot...

522
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,540
dispossess King.

523
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,541
He's now into Hsin Sang's twenty five.

524
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,169
A great pass to the left winger.

525
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,679
A long cross
to the other side of the field.

526
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,408
Now the ball's back in the center.

527
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,074
A good pass can...

528
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,481
put King clear.

529
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,052
King is clear
with only the goalie to beat.

530
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,315
He's now in the penalty area.

531
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,754
He collides...

532
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,391
with a defender.

533
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,926
The defender looks badly hurt.

534
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,052
But King seems alright!

535
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,096
No, he's gone down again
and looks in pain.

536
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,961
What a tragedy.

537
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,329
I wonder how the referee will decide.

538
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,492
Good.

539
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,298
Lee Tong, you go on.

540
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,041
- Ah Tong!
- Tong!

541
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,307
He bumps into the referee.

542
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,507
Maybe he's too nervous.

543
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,950
Why sent him on?

544
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,283
- Who?
- I'm sorry!

545
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,086
Go on your own!

546
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,526
Lee just received the ball
from his goalie.

547
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,765
He sure has some...

548
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,401
nice touches.

549
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,033
But he is going the wrong way.

550
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,165
He passed the ball to Chan Ming.

551
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,210
A reverse pass from Chan to him.

552
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,907
The pass was too long...

553
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,344
but Lee still gets it.

554
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,149
He slips two defenders.

555
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,182
Now he passes...

556
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,083
the ball back to Chan.

557
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,415
And Chan passes it...

558
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,283
back to him.

559
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,417
Pass it back!

560
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,031
What are you trying...

561
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,602
to do?

562
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,135
We've lost the match!

563
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:17,179
Let's go!

564
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,972
Take it easy!

565
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,778
- Keep you voice down!
- Take it easy!

566
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,284
Pass it over!

567
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,857
Not this time!

568
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,155
I'm not going to pass it to anyone!

569
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,931
Go...

570
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,930
He has dribbled past many players.

571
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,439
That's a wonderful dummy!

572
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,576
And over-head kick,

573
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,904
it's a goal.

574
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:52,413
One all!

575
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:09,821
He sure has nice footwork!

576
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,593
And he scores!

577
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,896
It was an accident!

578
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,411
Over there!

579
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,344
- I'm queuing to collect my winning!
- Great!

580
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,854
They just can't rob him of his ball.

581
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,396
The defender collide and fall.

582
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,832
Within shooting distant, it's a goal.

583
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,427
Lung Wah lead two one thanks to Lee Tong.

584
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,303
Looks like it.

585
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,247
We've won!

586
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:06,755
Great...

587
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,090
What's the matter with you?

588
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,289
- You've spoiled everything!
- Beat him up!

589
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,272
I wouldn't have sent you on
if we want to win.

590
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,273
Boss!

591
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,818
So you were trying to fix the match!

592
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,114
Take care of him!

593
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,076
Don't go!

594
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,428
I promise...

595
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,199
I'll break your legs!

596
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,285
Good to see you here.

597
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,529
Our boss wants to see you.

598
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,602
- Sure, I've got nothing to hide.
- This way please!

599
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,308
Calm down! Take a seat!

600
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,604
Drive on!

601
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,907
Let's talk here.

602
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,813
We like you style.

603
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,480
Want to join our team?

604
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:20,817
No!

605
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,654
I rather go home and be a farmer.

606
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,354
Giving up football?

607
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,133
We want to make you...

608
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,293
the new maestro.

609
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,934
Say that again.

610
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,304
We want you to be a superstar!

611
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,081
Then it's different.

612
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,506
No more match-fixing, okay!

613
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,346
We never fix matches!

614
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,580
Stamina is important...

615
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,454
in this game.

616
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:02,192
I was once a superstar.

617
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,593
Know why I want to take up coaching?

618
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,702
It's because I do not have stamina.

619
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,498
So you must work hard on your stamina!

620
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:17,273
"Who makes me bleed and sweat?"

621
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:23,751
"Who forces me to stride on
with clenched fists?"

622
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,454
"I do get tired,"

623
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,187
"wanting to throw in the to throw
in the towel. It's tough!"

624
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,765
"But there is no choice."

625
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,830
"Tired to the marrow,
I must keep on going."

626
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:43,895
"It's I myself..."

627
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,567
"who goads me on the thorny path."

628
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:53,705
"I challenge myself to new heights,
whatever the battleground."

629
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:59,346
"I have to throw."

630
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,230
I order to crack a tight defense.

631
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,760
We must use our wingers more!

632
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,165
The full backs...

633
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,330
should also attack!

634
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,509
"They says I'm pigheaded,
bleeding and sweating."

635
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:27,374
"Keeping on the path of pain
with clenched fists."

636
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,211
"Yes, I am tired, very tired."

637
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,119
"Yes, I have had enough of it."

638
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,829
"But I have no choice."

639
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,564
"Tired to the marrow,
I must keep on going."

640
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,892
"It's I myself..."

641
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,173
"who goads me on the thorny path."

642
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:58,104
"I challenge myself to new heights,
whatever the battleground."

643
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:02,516
"I have to throw."

644
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,586
I didn't do too badly, did I?

645
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,586
You did well to find them.

646
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,818
What is that?

647
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,623
- Make yourselves at home.
- This is lovely!

648
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,560
Look!

649
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,132
- Not bad!
- Right!

650
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,733
You can stay here if you want.

651
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:24,996
Great!

652
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,711
I've made it!

653
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,505
Come and enjoy life with me!

654
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,591
Seng Sun are odds on favorite to win.

655
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,024
I'll back...

656
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,461
Seng Sun.

657
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,861
$15 on Seng Sun!

658
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,092
$20 on Seng Sun!

659
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:39,070
Come on!

660
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,316
Push him down!

661
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:49,687
- Hold on!
- Push him down!

662
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,691
Just hold on a little longer!

663
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,826
Push him down!

664
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,336
Bear...

665
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,568
Here's the money!

666
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,367
It's been paid for by that gentlemen.

667
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,976
Just look at the size of Wong!

668
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,742
He's really quite useless.

669
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,910
He's here with a mission.

670
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,452
What does he want?

671
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:20,780
I don't know!

672
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,526
- Come over here!
- I...

673
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,363
Do as I say, okay?

674
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,764
What is it?

675
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,105
- I want you team to lose tomorrow.
- You mean...

676
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,479
I little bit more, maybe.

677
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,855
You've heard him! More!

678
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,161
Not nearly enough! More!

679
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,962
I said more!

680
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,799
- This is out first time!
- Well, it's up to you.

681
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,451
A little more!

682
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,953
Come on! More!

683
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,421
It's not enough. More!

684
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,428
Come on, hurry up! More!

685
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,726
You don't need to hesitate!

686
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,632
Just keep them coming!

687
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,033
- Don't ask if you can't take it!
- Right.

688
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,843
I didn't realize what he was doing.

689
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,778
What shall we do?

690
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,539
Who do you think we are? The Maestro?

691
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,872
- Tong, are you alright?
- I'm fine!

692
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,247
Fatso wants us to fix the match.

693
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,011
I told you! Get changed and go!

694
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,692
Who does he think we are?

695
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,053
The Maestro?

696
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,196
Let's try to score...

697
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,695
as many as possible!

698
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,958
Let's play in...

699
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,295
a 4-3-3 format!

700
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,629
Fall back!

701
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,403
Blood?

702
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,457
Go!

703
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,645
What happened?

704
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,816
We looked like fools!

705
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,450
You must've got the wrong people.

706
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,582
It's possible.

707
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,756
He and Suen is really
a perfect combination.

708
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,759
Now on the field,
Lee Tong gets the chance again.

709
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:48,953
18 yards away from the goal, a kick.

710
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,765
8 to 0, Seng Sun sweeps the board.

711
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,997
It's really shows the teamwork of Suen
and Lee Tong is welcomed by everyone.

712
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,932
"Players' Cafeteria"

713
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,373
Coach

714
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,276
Here you are, boss!

715
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:05,938
Have a seat, boss!

716
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,811
Cool it!

717
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,747
He's just a ball boy.

718
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,719
Why compare yourself with him?

719
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,950
We'll get even with him later on.

720
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,353
This was reserved...

721
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,329
for press conference.

722
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,394
The press?

723
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,236
I guarantee this will work.

724
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,636
Wait!

725
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,636
No...

726
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,678
Yes...

727
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,983
It was a terrific match!

728
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,556
Any plan for your next game?

729
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,053
Well...

730
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,125
- That's a team secret.
- Right!

731
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,058
- Sit over there!
- Sit over there!

732
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,362
Let's take a picture of you two.

733
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,697
Good!

734
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,767
A little closer please.

735
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,480
They're just two country bumpkins.

736
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,676
How can they host a press conference?

737
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,516
Maestro!

738
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,485
Seung sun will take you on soon.

739
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:22,580
What are you tactics?

740
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,422
Do you think they can beat us?

741
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:29,720
I doubt...

742
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,766
if you can make the finals.

743
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,229
More about our...

744
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,998
plans later.

745
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,906
We'll get him later!

746
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,274
- But where?
- Come on.

747
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,317
Take it easy!

748
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,883
Come again soon!

749
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,527
Will you follow me please?

750
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,421
This way!

751
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,730
Have a seat!

752
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,800
Take good care of our guests.

753
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,278
I thought...

754
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,370
King virtually live here?

755
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,948
Don't worry. He'll be here.

756
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,750
He's over there! Let's live it up!

757
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,327
Do you have any favorite?

758
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,657
We want to spend some money here.

759
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,956
Sounds good!

760
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,865
Let me!

761
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,101
- Who's that?
- It's Lee Tong!

762
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,437
He's lovely!

763
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,543
They've won another match today!

764
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,545
A ball boy in a ball room!

765
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:54,873
He's staring at us!

766
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,144
- Don't be afraid!
- Keep clam!

767
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,681
Have a smoke!

768
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,452
Live it up!

769
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,786
Cheers!

770
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,563
Cheers!

771
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,939
Looking good!

772
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,580
He's showing off!

773
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,318
Cheers!

774
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,121
Look at King's ring! It's great!

775
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,285
It's big, isn't it?

776
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,556
- It's big.
- Give it to me as a present!

777
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,927
You're out of your mind!

778
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,968
What time is it?

779
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,377
- It is wonderful!
- Pretty, isn't it?

780
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,312
It's made of sapphire!

781
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,474
- Take it!
- A look.

782
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,243
You are putting me on!

783
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,982
I like it very much!

784
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,787
- Can you give me one?
- Please.

785
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,192
Lee Tong has one bigger than yours.

786
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,789
He's losing his temper.

787
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,259
Clam down! Cool it!

788
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,734
We mustn't let him steal the show!

789
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,271
Show him what you can do!

790
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,195
Okay!

791
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,290
Great!

792
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,802
He's great!

793
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,630
What are you looking at?

794
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,444
I've never seen Tango like this.

795
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,442
Shut up!

796
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,128
He can even do it kneeling down.

797
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:41,632
Damn it!

798
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,424
She dropped her skirt!

799
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,977
Don't try to stop me.

800
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,511
Stop it!

801
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,376
I beg go!

802
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,777
Just who do you think you are?

803
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,918
I've always been...

804
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,647
a better player.

805
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,322
Better in match-fixing.

806
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,356
Stop it now!

807
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,553
Call a truce!

808
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,825
- Resume your duel.
- On football field!

809
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,198
Have the guts to take me on?

810
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,101
I admit defeat if you win or draw.

811
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,503
But I want your leg if you lose.

812
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,733
It's a deal!

813
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,534
Start practicing with this now.

814
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:49,905
Let's go!

815
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,508
Lee Tong wins even if it's a draw.

816
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,745
Confident of winning?

817
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:01,682
I think I can do it.

818
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,158
Where are you going?

819
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,428
I'll go seek advice...

820
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,124
from my friends.

821
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,767
Don't worry about me.

822
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:30,846
Who is it?

823
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,063
When did you arrive?

824
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,628
It's been such a long time.

825
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,740
Have I changed?

826
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:53,840
Come with me.

827
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,140
There are that...

828
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,837
I've got for hard work.

829
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,312
And this one...

830
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,876
It was presented to me by the Governor.

831
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,818
- What are you doing?
- Leave me.

832
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,525
Uncle!

833
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,995
Come home with me at once.

834
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,761
Do you think you've done well?

835
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:29,771
I was once a proud footballer.

836
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:34,846
I refused to fix a match.

837
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,213
Thanks!

838
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:45,221
So when I went home one night.

839
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,797
What are you trying to do?

840
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,614
I became...

841
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,683
a Cripple since.

842
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,845
Tong, everybody's here.

843
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,621
We've to mark King out of the game.

844
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,224
Don't be afraid to tackle.

845
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,419
They're weak on their left side.

846
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,029
We've discovered...

847
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,496
their weakness.

848
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,098
We'll attack down...

849
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,134
the left flank.

850
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,365
Count me out of tomorrow's game.

851
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,375
But why?

852
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:43,414
Are you scared?

853
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,281
Remember how King treated you?

854
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,251
Remember how King fixed a match?

855
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:53,990
We must get rid...

856
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,291
of people like King!

857
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,962
I don't have you as a friend.

858
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:03,094
- Play!
- Who are you?

859
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:07,331
You must play not matter what happened.

860
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:15,516
This is a private match arranged by King.

861
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,618
They're using their legs as wager.

862
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,848
Let's do our best!

863
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:33,861
We can have a side bet, right?

864
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,266
This is going to be a real match!

865
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:45,245
How about $1,000 for one goal?

866
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:48,115
Sure, but don't forget...

867
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:49,980
this match is not fixed.

868
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,635
Substitutes are not allowed
in this match.

869
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,294
And no audience is...

870
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,929
allowed in.

871
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:15,372
I am the only exception.

872
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,274
The game is on.

873
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:23,650
Lee passes to Suen.

874
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,982
Suen does well to keep...

875
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:27,280
the ball in play.

876
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:28,321
It's a foul...

877
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,549
but the referee plays the advantage.

878
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,182
The ball is still with Lee.

879
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,792
The rebound is high...

880
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,988
and Lee will shoot!

881
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,130
It hits the woodwork!

882
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,732
And the goalie throws...

883
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,834
himself at the ball!

884
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,904
Lee was just one step too late.

885
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:44,999
Lung Wah's...

886
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,870
on the attack now.

887
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:49,068
King and Lee, what a pair!

888
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,042
King is now marked...

889
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,145
by two men.

890
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,339
And King will try anything he knows.

891
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,217
King's in possession now.

892
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,116
And he passes the ball...

893
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,654
to the right wing.

894
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,916
And the winger passes it back to him.

895
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:07,757
King dribbled past Lee
near the goal line.

896
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,524
And he scores...

897
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,929
with a banana shot!

898
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,060
- Great!
- King's really good.

899
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,604
What a great shot!

900
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,040
- Well?
- Calm down!

901
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,471
What do you think?

902
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,019
Want to carry on?

903
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:34,749
Boss!

904
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,588
Lung Wah lead...

905
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,218
by one goal!

906
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,929
Lee's having a private duel with King.

907
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,972
It's a throw in.

908
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:57,104
I know your tricks!

909
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,577
Suen gains possession...

910
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,013
in the penalty area.

911
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:05,177
And he passes the ball to the left.

912
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,686
Great teamwork
and the ball's back with Suen.

913
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,315
He evaded three men...

914
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,222
and passes the ball to Lee.

915
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,919
Lee's here... good.

916
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,085
A couple of great...

917
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,925
dummies from Lee.

918
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,966
Down the goal line and a great cross!

919
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,571
It hits a defender and falls for Suen.

920
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:28,939
He chips it forward
and Lee scores with a header.

921
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:35,408
They've pulled one back!

922
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,609
Be alert!

923
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,378
We have made a score.

924
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,746
Be alert!

925
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,288
Hsin Sang...

926
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,157
on the attack now.

927
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,993
It's a foul!

928
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,469
They have seized the ball.

929
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:58,103
The goalie saves well...

930
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,470
from Lee.

931
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,304
Suen tries to score from the rebound.

932
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:06,381
And King knocks it on to the crossbar.

933
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:10,281
And King saves the day again!

934
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:11,647
Be alert!

935
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,183
Now King's have a go at the goalie.

936
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,618
Block the referee!

937
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,257
The match is turning...

938
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,055
into a fight.

939
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:22,494
Like kung-fu, with a shield.

940
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,626
King and Lee are having...

941
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:28,032
a go at each other.

942
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:35,071
And the referee booked Lee.

943
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:39,002
- I'll sent you off if you do it again!
- Referee!

944
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,445
Suen is not happy about it.

945
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,608
Have you seen this before?

946
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:51,851
And the referee blows the whistle
for halftime.

947
01:18:56,865 --> 01:19:00,232
Lung Wah launch attack after attack.

948
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,498
But they're stopped by Hsin Sang.

949
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,732
Lee dribbled past several players.

950
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,868
He forgets about teamwork now.

951
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:12,503
It's a private duel between Lee and King.

952
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,017
King dashes into the penalty area.

953
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,983
But he was dispossessed by Suen.

954
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:21,281
Suen starts a counter-attack.

955
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,323
And he was fouled from behind.

956
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,484
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

957
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,295
It's not Suen. Maybe it's Bao.

958
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:30,428
Stand closer!

959
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,123
Take a few steps backward!

960
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,356
A free kick for Hsin Sang
and another name in the book.

961
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,299
Suen and Lee are having a conference.

962
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,531
They put one of their own men
in the wall.

963
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,268
Lee moves away from the ball.

964
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:46,506
Suen shots and
hit the player in the face.

965
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,145
It look like he has lost a tooth.

966
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,146
Here come Hsin Sang again.

967
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:55,155
Suen kicked Chan Ming.

968
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,656
The two are having a tussle.

969
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:02,293
But the referee waves play on.

970
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,988
Play on.

971
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,426
Are you ok?

972
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,332
Just go, mark King.

973
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,466
King has taken control of the game.

974
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,336
He is ready to send over a cross.

975
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:16,306
Hsin Sang must reorganize the defense.

976
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,447
King ascores with a brilliant...

977
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,014
first time shot.

978
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,674
We scored a goal.

979
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,617
Two-one, we're leading.

980
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,425
Now Sue retaliates!

981
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:32,720
He has...

982
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,659
three players on him!

983
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,322
Lee Tong is there, he can't shoot...

984
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:43,329
He plays a one two with Lee.

985
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,205
And Suen collides with the goalie.

986
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:50,102
But the referee waves play on!

987
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,540
Lung Wah are on the attack again!

988
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:52,738
Go on... move.

989
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,042
King has a great chance...

990
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,651
to score again.

991
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:59,682
He rounded...

992
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,288
the goalie.

993
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,649
He's not shooting. He's too proud.

994
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,622
And he makes it three one.

995
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,432
The referee has gone over to Suen.

996
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,064
Are you alright?

997
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,997
It looks like...

998
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,572
he is badly hurt.

999
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:21,876
Help him out.

1000
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:25,674
The referee has summoned for a stretcher.

1001
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,708
- We lost one player.
- Yes.

1002
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:35,881
Still have chance.

1003
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,753
Light it.

1004
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:41,159
Let's see what Lee can do without Suen.

1005
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,231
He dribbled past a few players.

1006
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:44,992
He sees there is someone on the right.

1007
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,795
Pass it to the right and get it.

1008
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,061
But he does not have Suen
to meet his pass.

1009
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,033
The ball is robbed and Lung Wah attack.

1010
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,197
There are only a few minutes to go.

1011
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,665
Lung Wah are leading...

1012
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:56,937
by three one.

1013
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:58,478
Hsin Sang are still trying to draw level.

1014
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,343
Or reduce the deficit.

1015
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,313
And the ball is now back with the goalie.

1016
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:07,918
Lung Wah are using time-wasting tactics.

1017
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,923
Defeat Hsin Sang.

1018
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:14,587
Lee is now on his own.

1019
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,891
He has no one to help him.

1020
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:20,396
More time-wasting tactics from Lung Wah.

1021
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:21,895
And they're passing the ball back...

1022
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,095
and forth between them.

1023
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:29,710
He's leg is mine.

1024
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,906
Are you spitting again?

1025
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,314
I'm sorry!

1026
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,183
Again!

1027
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:41,246
No, it's raining!

1028
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,289
They just have to try their luck.

1029
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,825
The ground has become very slippery.

1030
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,825
It's muddy, too!

1031
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,290
Let's see if they can score.

1032
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:51,831
Lee takes the chance.

1033
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,093
Lee have a go with a shot.

1034
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,998
But is was saved by the goalie.

1035
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,799
But the goalie dropped the ball.

1036
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:01,501
It's in Hsin Sang's possession but...

1037
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:02,974
King slipped...

1038
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,577
and Lee robbed him.

1039
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:09,509
It's turning...

1040
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,016
into a real farce.

1041
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,221
But time is running out...

1042
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,650
on Hsin Sang.

1043
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,918
Here's another chance...

1044
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:21,892
for them.

1045
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,022
Shoot...

1046
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:25,865
But Lee slipped
just when he was about to shot.

1047
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:29,130
He has even lost...

1048
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,932
one of his boots.

1049
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,803
Time is running out!

1050
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,545
Lee is now bare footed.

1051
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,581
But he plays on!

1052
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,851
He dribbled past two defenders.

1053
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:54,486
And another one!

1054
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,257
He has King...

1055
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,195
a front of him now.

1056
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,391
His shot hits...

1057
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,960
the goalie.

1058
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:07,131
An overhead kick.

1059
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,572
It's a goal.

1060
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:10,074
Another score.

1061
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:11,803
They're now only one goal behind.

1062
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:13,311
Lee can surely play...

1063
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,142
without boots.

1064
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,047
He's quick.

1065
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:22,215
Can they draw level?

1066
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,482
Everybody is falling about...

1067
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,389
on the pitch.

1068
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,994
Only Lee can...

1069
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:31,291
stand firm.

1070
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:35,232
Lee's attacking on the right.

1071
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,669
A great shot from the edge of the area.

1072
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,138
But it was blocked by a defender.

1073
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:44,301
King takes off his boots.

1074
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,413
He looks like a monster.

1075
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,039
Lee's now in the penalty area.

1076
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,913
He shoot against a defender...

1077
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,543
and the goalie saves.

1078
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,417
Lee tries again but no luck.

1079
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,285
It looks like...

1080
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:58,484
Hsin Sang will lose this match.

1081
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,957
The referee
has been knocked off his feet.

1082
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,459
Where's my whistle?

1083
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:03,588
Lee is charring towards goal.

1084
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,130
But King robs him of the ball.

1085
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,725
Lee shoots...

1086
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,633
and the goalie saves.

1087
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,672
Lee shoots again!

1088
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,672
But King saves on the goal line.

1089
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,038
You are going to lose.

1090
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:19,170
He passes...

1091
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:21,406
the ball back to the goalie.

1092
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,144
But the ball bounces
over the goalie's head.

1093
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,446
We call it being hit by land mine.

1094
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,351
And it gets stuck...

1095
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,548
in the water.

1096
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:31,989
It is not a goal.

1097
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,492
The ball is loose.

1098
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,222
Both Lee and King are racing towards it.

1099
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:39,355
King beats Lee but it's an own goal!

1100
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,593
The final score is three all.

1101
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:46,237
You'll soon vanish from the scene!

1102
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,909
Break both his legs!

1103
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:05,220
We did it at the very last moment!

1104
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,190
Thanks to King who scored for us!

1105
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:11,629
You're in luck today.

1106
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,393
King deserved to be punished.

1107
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,093
Left or right?

1108
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,005
Both!

1109
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:24,709
Like him?

1110
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,811
Can you spare a dime please?

1111
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:31,274
Just like him!
