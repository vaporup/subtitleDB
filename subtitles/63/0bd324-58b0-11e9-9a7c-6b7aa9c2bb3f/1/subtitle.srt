00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:07,233
(Translated by Ed. Timed by some guy I don't know the name of, who did the Chinese subs. Thanks!)

2
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:32,945
Those who've finished drinking, return your...

3
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,350
...empty cartons to the correct number and sit back down.

4
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:44,958
Our school has been selected from ten thousand candidates...

5
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:50,398
...all across the country to promote milk for middle schoolers.

6
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,837
You're currently approaching your second growth period.

7
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:02,948
The calcium in milk not only strengthens your bones,

8
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,553
but also nurtures your brains.

9
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:19,460
These are porn movies I confiscated from Kamiyama last month.

10
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,361
He digitally removed the mosaic on them at Watanabe's house,

11
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,407
and planned on giving them to all the boys in the class.

12
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:34,543
I'm sure you know that your bodies and hearts are about to...

13
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:35,911
(You're kidding me! You kissed him!?)

14
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,916
...go through an immense period of growth known as puberty.

15
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:45,087
I don't know how effective milk will be on thirteen year old bodies and minds.

16
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:50,865
But I'm sure we'll see some changes in you come the March health checkups.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,734
Though I'll be gone by then.

18
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:01,566
I've had enough, so this will be my last month as a teacher.

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,177
You gotta be kidding!

20
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,542
Awesome!

21
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,447
(25th March
End of term ceremony for Year One Class B)

22
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:20,722
I don't really know whether I've been a good teacher.

23
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,805
Stop messing around! The teacher's trying to say something!

24
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,206
Thank you, Hoshino.

25
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:43,446
Do any of you know a teacher called Masayoshi Sakuramiya?

26
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,643
Yeah!

27
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,017
He's the super-teacher that wrote this book, right?

28
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,817
He's totally awesome.

29
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,016
He's a truly passionate teacher who has published books,

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,560
and has appeared on television.

31
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,762
Originally he was a total deadbeat, right? He dropped out...

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,266
...of school and travelled the world before becoming a teacher.

33
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,266
That's right.

34
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,099
Last year he was told he only had a few months left to live.

35
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,799
Yet he wasn't discouraged, and continued to put his...

36
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,570
...all into his classes until the very last.

37
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,108
He taught at...

38
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,742
...the first school I ever worked at.

39
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,149
Seriously!?

40
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,622
¡°The weak will always hurt those weaker than them.

41
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,957
Are the only choices available to bear it or die?

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,426
No, the world you live in is not so limited.

43
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:34,559
If you're stuck in a difficult situation,

44
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:37,467
it's okay to retreat to somewhere safer.¡±

45
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:38,737
Retreat, huh?

46
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,808
Guess we better had then!

47
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,969
I'm outta here!

48
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,650
Already taking Mr. Sakuramiya's words to heart.

49
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,617
Truly, the man is a genius.

50
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,119
Well, I suppose it hardly matters.

51
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:57,455
Compared to Mr. Sakuramiya,

52
00:03:57,593 --> 00:04:00,687
I might never have been much of a teacher.

53
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:04,532
But there were two rules I chose to work by.

54
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,827
One: Address the students politely.

55
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,938
Two: Do my best to place myself on the same level as them.

56
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:11,801
Speak with them as I'd like to be spoken to.

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,036
Be frank with them as if we were friends, talking to them about anything they wanted.

58
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:19,807
I think I must have been quietly influenced...

59
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,781
...by drama characters who spoke in such ways.

60
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,414
I'm sorry, Nagaguchi.

61
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,452
Even though you sent me late night e-mails,

62
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,386
telling me you wanted to lose weight, or that you wanted to die,

63
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:32,517
I could never answer you kindly.

64
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:37,155
Because frankly I never completely trusted what any of you told me.

65
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,665
Hey, what's that supposed to mean!?

66
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,637
I remember a certain event.

67
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:50,336
A girl wrote to a young male teacher saying she was in love with him.

68
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,343
I remember this!

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,382
That she'd kill herself if he didn't meet her. He panicked and agreed to meet her at a love hotel.

70
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,246
The girl waited there, and got a photo of him.

71
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:02,414
Then she showed it to her parents, who stormed into the school.

72
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,620
Ridiculous...

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,958
It was just a stupid prank by a girl who was angry for being scolded.

74
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:12,032
The teacher was a fool to trust her.

75
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,068
So you don't believe us about anything!?

76
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:19,269
It's just because students...because all of you...are so good at lying.

77
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,899
(I'm waiting up on the roof.)

78
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,507
Miss, I'm feeling ill. Can I go to the nurse?

79
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:28,980
Go ahead.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,251
Anyway, after that, if I was called out by a student of the opposite gender,

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,551
even one of my own, I'd get a male teacher from...

82
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:41,993
...another class to go instead.

83
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,456
Just as whenever one of the boys in this class...

84
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,434
...asked to meet me, I'd send Mr. Tokura from Class A.

85
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,970
I feel that's deeply irresponsible as our teacher.

86
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,596
Oh you do, do you?

87
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,403
I see. I suppose you can look at it that way.

88
00:05:55,544 --> 00:06:00,607
Spending your every moment thinking about marrying a Johnny's Jr.

89
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,240
you can become quite self-absorbed, and completely wrapped up in your own little worlds.

90
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:08,846
It's easy to forget what it means simply to live.

91
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:14,452
I'm going to make sure none of you ever use words like 'I want to die' so lightly again.

92
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,528
I'm going to give you one final, very important lesson.

93
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,199
(Life)

94
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,148
As you know, I'm a single mother.

95
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:45,218
I had intended to marry the father of my daughter Manami.

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,194
We were both teachers, but he was someone I really looked up to.

97
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:53,426
Shortly before we were due to be married, I became pregnant.

98
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:58,665
And he was diagnosed with HIV during a physical examination.

99
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:02,937
HIV. A virus which destroys the immune system.

100
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:05,774
The virus which causes AIDS.

101
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:10,880
He contracted it as a relief worker abroad.

102
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,078
It's okay, you can breathe.

103
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,416
It doesn't pass through the air.

104
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,650
It also won't pass through handshakes, sneezes,

105
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:21,729
baths, or swimming pools.

106
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:26,734
Even if you're close to someone infected regularly, it doesn't pose problems.

107
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,428
So I'm not even infected to begin with.

108
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:35,570
HIV isn't guaranteed to pass via sex.

109
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:40,239
Though I myself couldn't believe I wasn't infected, and demanded a reevaluation.

110
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,983
In the end, I gave birth to my child, but didn't marry.

111
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:49,017
That was the decision I took.

112
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:50,647
Why didn't you marry him?

113
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,454
Even though the child wasn't infected,

114
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,563
her father was. And if that became...

115
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:57,324
public knowledge, she'd face discrimination.

116
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,763
Who cares what people think!

117
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,530
The specter of his illness would hang over her even after he had passed.

118
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:09,508
It would only make her suffer. That was his judgement, and I agreed.

119
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,202
That's so cruel on the kid!

120
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,310
It would've been crueler to do otherwise.

121
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:29,328
Even though he wanted to hold Manami more than anyone, he couldn't...

122
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,136
As hard as it was for me, I think it was a hundred times harder for him.

123
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:41,773
I gave Manami every bit of love I had.

124
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:47,274
When she turned one, I went back to work.

125
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,951
Until she was six, she'd wait for me at the local nursery.

126
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:57,582
And after that, I entrusted her to a Ms. Takenaka I met via a volunteer center.

127
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:00,593
She took care of a dog called Shaggy.

128
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,454
Manami really loved that dog,

129
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:07,932
so she put her in charge of feeding it.

130
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:12,899
At the start of this year, Takenaka was hospitalised.

131
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,374
Every day I finished work by the time she finished nursery.

132
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,979
Except on Wednesdays, when there were staff meetings.

133
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:21,309
Then I'd go and meet her early, and have her...

134
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,852
wait until the meeting was over in the school infirmary.

135
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:42,436
Manami really loved a character called Cotton Bunny.

136
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:50,607
Her bag, her handkerchief, her tissues, her shoes...

137
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,173
Hey, Shimomura, you remember this pouch, right?

138
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:00,311
Buy it for me Mommy!

139
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,753
I already bought this one for you.

140
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,418
Why don't you just buy her it? It's only a pouch.

141
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:10,320
Thinking about it now, you were probably right.

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,261
Because in the end...

143
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:15,527
Manami?

144
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,970
Manami! Manami!

145
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:26,674
...it was the last thing Manami ever asked me to do for her.

146
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,015
Miss!

147
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,023
On the 13th of February...

148
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,818
Miss!

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,557
...the police determined that she had slipped into the pool, and drowned.

150
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,134
There were bread crumbs beside Shaggy,

151
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,367
and it was the same bread Manami was given at the nursery.

152
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:59,106
Manami had secretly been walking past the pool every week.

153
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,205
To give Shaggy food.

154
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:04,545
She's crying!

155
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,348
Aww, baby wants to cry!

156
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,081
Manami is gone.

157
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:18,933
I'll never touch her small hands again.

158
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,763
My hands will never again be able to feel her tiny cheeks...

159
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,663
Her soft hair...

160
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,904
Manami's death...

161
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:34,414
...was probably my fault. I failed as her guardian.

162
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,280
But...

163
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:40,414
I wasn't going to let it end like that.

164
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,483
Manami died.

165
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,759
But it was no accident.

166
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,633
She was killed by students from this class.

167
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:12,543
(Moriguchi's going crazy!)

168
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:25,728
What is it that protects you?

169
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,737
Your parents? Weapons?

170
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:35,140
No, your strongest ally is...

171
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:39,577
Juvenile law.

172
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:43,879
Under Article 41 of the penal code, those under fourteen years of age...

173
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,850
are not liable for their crimes.

174
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:49,923
And cannot be punished for them. Isn't that lovely?

175
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,084
There was a thirteen year old girl just the same as you.

176
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,787
She mixed all sorts of drugs into her family's food,

177
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,127
calling it a holy rite, and recorded the results...

178
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,327
in detail on an internet blog.

179
00:13:02,804 --> 00:13:03,736
The Lunacy Incident?

180
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,772
That's right. The Lunacy Incident.

181
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,632
That was the name she used on her blog,

182
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:12,679
so the press gave it that name and turned it into a big scare story.

183
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:18,751
In the end, they never found a reason for...

184
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:21,914
...her to brutally murder her whole family.

185
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:25,356
But because of that, all sorts of foolish rumours began to spring up...

186
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:29,520
...and she even won admirers among people her age.

187
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,133
(Tell us who we need to punish!)

188
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,637
The only one who received a harsh punishment...

189
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:42,937
...was the teacher who told her specific details about various medicines.

190
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,411
All she had to do was write a few remorseful words in a...

191
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,040
...juvenile detention center and she was pronounced rehabilitated.

192
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,581
Even if you kill someone, you're not going to be punished for it.

193
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,951
(Exactly. That's why I did it!)

194
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,991
And there's no way for us to stop these crimes...

195
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:01,391
For us to stop child murderers.

196
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:06,160
If you felt like it, you could kill someone with a baseball bat...

197
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:08,428
...or a nice long kitchen knife...

198
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,629
...or a medicine ball from P.E...

199
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,740
...or even with your bare hands!

200
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:16,434
And there'd be nobody to stop you.

201
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,136
That hurts...

202
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,541
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:22,342
Hurry up, hurry up!

204
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:27,783
Guess even you wanted to find out who the culprits are, huh?

205
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,489
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I have no intention of telling you their names.

206
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:36,290
The hell!? That's not fair!

207
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,227
Masami's father was Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

208
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,800
The reason that we had a special sort of funeral at our house...

209
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:54,677
...was because he wanted to finally hold Manami before she was gone.

210
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:58,980
The first time Manami was held by her father...

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,112
...her soul had already departed.

212
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,393
He confessed to me that his condition had worsened into AIDS.

213
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,762
But in the few months of life he had left...

214
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,459
...I couldn't bring myself to say anything to him.

215
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:20,098
I believe that along with Manami,

216
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:25,474
something important inside me died too.

217
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,016
Last week, I went to visit Ms. Takenaka, who had retired.

218
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:39,593
She gave me a box of Manami's things I had left with her.

219
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:43,163
And this was in the box.

220
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:47,064
The pouch I had never bought her, 

221
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,469
Where did it come from?

222
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:53,404
Ms. Takenaka said she found it near Shaggy's kennel.

223
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,168
Shaggy...

224
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:01,047
The students sometimes drop their things here...

225
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:06,547
...while they play catch and clean the pool...

226
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:14,090
I remember it dawning on me that the only punishments children...

227
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:19,223
...ever have to deal with are a few extra laps, or having to clean the pool...

228
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,630
Don't be stupid! It's not me.

229
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,671
(I know who it is!)

230
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:32,706
Was Minami really alone at the pool that day?

231
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,581
There are two students responsible.

232
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:57,864
I'll refer to them as 'A' and 'B'.

233
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:17,488
'A' is a straight As student. Looking at him, you wouldn't expect him to have any problems at all.

234
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:23,152
But...there are some fairly unsettling rumours you hear from time to time...

235
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:26,529
Since he was in junour school, he's been picking up stray cats and dogs...

236
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:29,068
...and taking them home to kill with his Execution Machine.

237
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:31,137
Execution Machine?

238
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:34,173
Some sort of weird tool he made himself.

239
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,040
He puts photos of the animals he kills with it on his site.

241

(A new machine is currently in development. Be prepared!)

242
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:47,243
I checked out A by calling his junior school teacher,

243
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,357
but was told there had been no problems with him at all.

244
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,950
Just as I was about to give up on him...

245
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,323
So what do you teach, Miss?

246
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,431
...'A' came to my office.

247
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,055
Science.

248
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,225
Lights and stuff?

249
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,466
If you want to know about that, shouldn't you just ask your dad?

250
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,469
There's something good inside. Try opening it!

251
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,949
Awesome, huh?

252
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,694
So I'm a test subject, huh?

253
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:31,964
Are you going to use this to torture animals?

254
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,330
No point in that.

255
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,172
Pop...

256
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:42,435
What?

257
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,978
Can't you hear that, Miss?

258
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:49,706
It's the sound of something important to you disappearing...

259
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,350
(All Japan Junior High Applied Science Fair)

00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:02,858

261
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:07,024
Protects your important valuables from muggers.

262
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,363
It wasn't an Execution Machine?

263
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,399
Whatever. Just stamp here.

264
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:17,273
One report that stressed how safe it was with its new safety switch...

265
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:21,542
...and one full of perfectly played junior school sincerity...

266
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,343
They only made him seem more frightening.

267

'A service to humanity', huh?

268
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,252
There's no need to read every damn word.

269
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,381
Just tell me which one is better!

270
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,922
I consulted the Principal on the matter, but...

271
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:36,928
...he did little more than echo my concerns.

272
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:45,335
And in the end, the Anti-Theft Surprise Wallet won first place at the contest.

(SHUUYA SHUUYA SHUUYA SHUUYA...)

274

(It's Shuuya Watanabe!)

275
00:19:56,484 --> 00:20:01,285
I asked 'A' about the truth behind Manami's death.

276
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,627
Just messin' with ya.

277
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,470
'A' told me the truth with a smile.

278
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,198
He hardly seemed to care that the woman before him...

279
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,801
...was the mother of the girl he killed.

280
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:29,845
'A''s motive...

281
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:32,475
Was pure naivety.

282
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,888
A desire to have the world notice him.

283
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:39,459
To be recognised as more talented than any of his peers.

284
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:44,860
But on the day that he got his wish and was published in the newspaper.

285
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,560
The world turned their eyes from him...

286
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,201
...to a certain girl of the same age.
(Junior high student murders family of four)

287
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,636
(Refers to herself as 'Lunacy' on a blog)

288
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:56,709
Even if you're recognised for doing good stuff, nobody gives a shit.

289
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:59,677
They all just care about that Lunacy freak.

290
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:03,147
An overdose? Hah!

291
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:07,914
If I wanted to kill someone, I could make everything myself. Just like this.

292
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,216
I want to kill this little brat.

293
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:17,522
That was the only thought that ran through my head.

294
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:24,269
'B' had transferred to our school, and joined the P.E club, but...

295
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,430
...it was all just athletics...

296
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:28,235
...and they wouldn't even let him hold a racket.

297
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:29,536
(DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE...)

298
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:34,774
He was fed up, but he didn't have the nerve to talk to the teacher.

299
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,544
So he got his mum to call in, quit the club...

300
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:40,051
...and began attending a cram school.

301
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:42,356
But his grades didn't get any better.

302
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,586
And though he worried, he was too lazy to do anything about it.

303
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:57,426
He holed up in the police station.

304
00:21:57,872 --> 00:22:00,432
He got a shock when the person who came to meet him...

305
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,941
...wasn't me, but Mr. Tokura.

306
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:05,875
Why didn't Miss Moriguchi come?

307
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,541
What're you babbling about, idiot.

308
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:11,777
(DIE)

309
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,548
For violating the rule against juniors going to the arcade,

310
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,284
'B' was given a punishment.

311
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,554
He was to clean the school rooms and the poolside once a week.

312
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,157
(You gotta be kidding me. That little wimp did something so serious?)

313
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:35,267
I heard this from 'B' himself, at his home.

314
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,545
His mother sat beside him.

315
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,705
And everytime he said something, her only response was...

316
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,010
It's not fair.

317
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,619
She kept saying it.

318
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:50,485
But she wasn't talking about my dead daughter. She was talking about her son.

319
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:58,354
At the start of February, 'A' made contact with 'B'.

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,936
To recruit him to aid in a terrible plan.

321
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,611
Who would be good?

322
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:19,379
For what?

323
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:23,650
Woah, is that the thing that won the contest?

324
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:27,022
I juiced it up a bit, so I want to test it on someone.

325
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:32,856
It doesn't really matter who. Though I did make it to zap bad guys.

326
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,168
Then I guess we'd better find some creep to test it on too.

327
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:38,430
'B''s first suggestion was Mr. Tokura.

328
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:41,700
'A' didn't respond.

329
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,473
So then 'B' put forward my name.

330
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,171
I hate that bitch.

331
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:52,377
One of her students is in trouble, and she sends another teacher to do her dirty work.

332
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,852
But I've already tested it on her.

333
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:58,356
'A' wasn't interested in that idea either.

334
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:01,355
Then how about her daughter?

335
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,533
We'd be punishing a teacher for caring more about her daughter than her students.

336
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:13,738
'B' talked about how Manami came by the pool to feed the dog...

337
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:19,039
...and how he saw her clamouring for the pouch...

338
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,149
...and it not being bought for her.

339
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:30,555
The target they chose...

340
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:33,854
...was my daughter.

341
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:36,421
My young, defenseless daughter.

342
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:54,243
Your mommy wouldn't buy this for you, right?

343
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,210
Or has she given you one already?

344
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:02,917
Right. She asked us to go and buy it for you.

345
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:04,319
Mommy said that?

346
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,086
Here you go. A Valentine's Day present from your lovely mommy.

347
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:11,163
Try opening it.

348
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:13,425
There's chocolate inside.

349
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:42,388
What the hell? T...this is bad!

350
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,554
She's dead.

351
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:48,464
I killed her 'cause she was a little brat that wouldn't shut up.

352
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:52,436
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

353
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:55,371
I told him that and headed home.

354
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:59,569
But then that moron had to go and...

355
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,620
If it came out that the pouch had killed her...

356
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,522
I thought I'd be guilty, so...

357
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:23,470
I thought if I made it look like she fell in the pool...

358
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,173
I wouldn't be found out.

359
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:55,531
That was the truth behind Manami's death.

360
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,079
As the two of them said...

361
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,314
...the police determined that it was an accident.

362
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:19,221
I have no intention of fighting that judgement.

363
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:27,256
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.

364
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,971
I took a look at it...

365
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:35,075
...and even taking into account that she was only four...

366
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:39,942
...it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.

367
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,846
Want to give it a try?

368
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:49,182
Manami had just fallen unconscious.

369
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:53,459
There's no doubt in my mind that the true cause of her death...

370
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:57,860
...was her drowning after 'B' threw her into the pool.

371
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,359
It's quite ironic.

372
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:06,166
'A' had the guts to kill someone, but failed to do so.

373
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:12,273
And 'B' didn't want to hurt anyone, but ended up killing Manami.

374
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,745
Even if I brought forth this evidence to the police, the two would...

375
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:19,683
..be protected by juvenile law, and would suffer nothing more than being put into care.

376
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:22,417
Essentially, they'd be viewed as innocent.

377
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,354
I've decided that that's simply not enough.

378
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:33,764
It's a teacher's duty to reprimand her students when they've done wrong.

379
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,829
I intend to make the two of them realise the severity of their crimes...

380
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,839
...and come to appreciate the importance of life.

381
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,107
I want them to live, each day...

382
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,179
bearing the weight of their crimes.

383
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,947
I mixed a little something...

384
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:59,289
...into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.

385
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:08,557
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

386
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,135
Shit!

387
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,438
Calm down!

388
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:27,218
You were good enough to drink it all up, too.

389
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:28,685
Thank you.

390
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:32,724
I hope you look forward to the three month wait on blood tests.

391
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,229
If the results come back positive, the incubation period is five to ten years.

392
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:41,232
Time enough, I think, to repent for your sins,

393
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:43,734
and to realise the value of life.

394
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,652
Spring is a season when everything bursts into life.

395
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:08,853
The flowers, the trees, the grass, the birds, and even people...

396
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:20,738
I wish you all a wonderful Spring holiday!

(Confession: Yuko Moriguchi)

398
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:25,535
That's all I have to say.

399
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,158
Miss Moriguchi...

400
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,954
...you wouldn't believe your eyes.

401
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:25,861
Seeing the sunny smiles on the faces of our class...

402
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:32,744
...now that you've gone, and the new term is rolling in.

403
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,409
(6th April
Start of term ceremony for Year Two Class B)

404
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,416
April didn't bring any changes to our class,

405
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:41,077
but it did bring a new face during homeroom.

406
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:42,779
Werther.

407
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,255
That's what people have been calling me since my school days.

408
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,187
But it's 'Werther', not 'worrier'. You can count on me.

409
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,956
The awful jokes kept coming.

410
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:52,463
Yukari.

411
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,968
Maki?
(And he acted all friendly with us, like he had known us forever.)

412
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:59,561
Ayaka? And...Naoki?

413
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:01,668
Oh, that's right, he caught a cold.

414
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:05,767
Everyone knew Nao wasn't absent because of some stupid cold.

415
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:08,575
What surprised us more was that Shuuya...

416
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:13,011
...continued coming to school.

417
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:16,919
I wasn't exactly what you'd call a serious student in school.

418
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:22,085
But then I read a book that changed my life.

419
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:27,126
That had to be...

420
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,896
...the worst joke of all.

421
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,908
"While wandering the world, I read the Bible.

422
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,779
And in it I discovered the true shape of education.

423
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:44,511
'What man among you...

424
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:46,949
...who has 100 sheep and loses one of them...

425
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:50,113
...does not leave the 99 in the open field...

426
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:54,751
...and go after the lost one until he finds it?'"

427
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,419
Teach, you're awesome!

428
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,400
I want to show you all how passionately I believe in these words!

429
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:07,872
I think...everyone was just cowardly...

430
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,738
You can count on me whenever you need me!

431
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:15,303
They wanted to hide from the horrible truth Ms. Moriguchi had shown us.

432
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,883
I'll support you with all my might!

433
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,316
So they pretended to be stupid.

434
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:26,051
I want to be like a big brother to you all!

440
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:04,757
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:10,900
I've been lying to you.

442
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:14,906
I told you Naoki couldn't come to class because of colds or illnesses.

443
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:17,408
But he's not just been skipping.

444
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:21,105
He wants to come to class, but he's very sick mentally.

445
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:24,115
Werther was the only one in the class...

446
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,344
...who didn't know why he was like that to begin with.

447
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:27,578
(We'll refer to the one who leaked Miss Moriguchi's confession as Boy 'C')

448
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:32,385
The mail was sent to everyone in the class just after...

449
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:34,756
...the closing ceremony that day. Nobody knew who sent it.

450
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:36,624
How about it, everyone?

451
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,254
Want to help me make it easier for him to come back?

452
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:47,802
For example, maybe we could make lots of leaflets, and...

453
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:52,344
...Class Representative Mizuki and I could take one to his house each week.

454
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,911
No good? What do you think, Mizuki?

455
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:57,513
Sounds okay.

00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:00,085
Stand up! Thanks.

457
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,654
Do you have a nickname too, Mizuki?

458
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:04,347
Mozuki.

Yes.

468
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,914
If a teacher as passionate as you had been his homeroom teacher,

469
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:05,575
Nao might never have ended up like this.

470
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,780
The last teacher was a single mother, right?

471
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:13,556
Imagine, bringing your child to work in the first place.

472
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:17,060
Nao's mother danced around the subject of the incident...

473
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:19,825
...itself, and just kept blaming Miss Moriguchi.

474
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,630
I can't help but feel like she was so focused on her daughter...

475
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:25,567
...that she lost sight of the needs of her students.

476
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,433
So Naoki is...

477
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:27,665
Naoki is the sort of boy...

478
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:31,335

Pee.

488
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:16,212
He wouldn't let me touch anything he had touched...

489
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:20,122
...and insisted on washing every inch of it himself.

490
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:32,798
Yet for some reason he wouldn't wash his hair, and refused to take a bath.

491
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:35,600

What are you babbling about?

495
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:47,116
She made it sound like it was all Nao's fault.

Even though he was just led astray by bad friends.

497

00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,237
Can I talk to him for just a few moments?

521
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,276
Sir...

522
00:41:04,784 --> 00:41:06,411
Just call me Werther.

523
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:11,021
Doing this stuff isn't going to make Nao come to school.

524
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:12,590
It might actually have the oppos...

525
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:15,559
Mozuki, relax.

526
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:18,960
This is just a little adolescent angst. If he gets through it, he'll see the light.

527
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,162
(Believe)

528
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,928
Let's believe in each other!

529
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,763
(Never)

530
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:26,098
Never give up!

531
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:38,480
Why...?

532
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,679
Why is it that Nao can be peaceful, but...

533
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:44,016
...everytime that guy comes here...

534
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:48,524
...he's terrified...

535
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:53,325
That stupid teacher.

536
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,092
Spouting that optimistic rubbish.

537
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,765
He's useless.

538
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,943
I slipped sleeping pills into his food.

539
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:19,115
My husband was away on work.

540
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:22,023
And my eldest daughter was busy with her studies in Tokyo.

541
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:28,529
There was nobody in the house but the two of us.

542
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:32,798
Nobody to protect him but me.

543
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:24,790
Mom...

544
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:28,119
Nao...

545
00:43:38,872 --> 00:43:41,500
Who's this?

546
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:46,136
The heck's he smiling for?

547
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,848
June.

548
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,688
There are bullies in this class.

549
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:04,519
And the one being bullied is Shuuya Watanabe.

550
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,827
This note was in among the homework I took in yesterday.

551
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:14,730
It took courage to write this.

552
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,434
I'm not just gonna ignore that.

553
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:20,642
I think the bullies are just jealous.

554
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:26,783
Because Shuuya's the smartest kid in the year.

555
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,751
Don't think you can just walk all over him...

556
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:31,118
...just because he's smarter than you!

557
00:44:31,257 --> 00:44:34,749
He couldn't have been more wrong.

558
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:38,421
Shuuya's intellect is one of his unique qualities!

559
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:41,624
You all possess unique, individual abilities too!

560
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:44,464
The ability to bully those weaker than you.

561
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:47,095
The ability to forget things you don't want to face.

562
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,471
I want to see you all continue to polish those abilities.

563
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:55,040
Because I'm always watching over you.

564
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:12,723
Hey, it was you who grassed us up, right?

565
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:16,130
No! It wasn't me!

566
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:18,260
The class blamed me.

567
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:22,067
Because I was the only one whose punishment points sat at...

568
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,937
Mizuki 0 Points

569
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,712
Allying yourself with a murderer...

570
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:39,450
Don't you have any shame, Mozuki?

571
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:43,958
Don't you feel sorry for Miss Moriguchi?

572
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:46,559
Don't!

573
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:47,723
Lemme go!

574
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:54,431
Kiss!

575
00:45:54,574 --> 00:45:59,671
Miss... Our class is finished.

576
Naoki's crying.

576
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:15,918
He's probably thinking about the accident.

577
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:20,521
And crying...

578
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:22,827
...for the girl who died.

579
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,628
It's clear to me.

580
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,802
I know he hasn't changed a bit.

581
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,742
That same old gentleness...

582
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,680
He's still Naoki.

583
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:54,924
Fill...the...kill...lear... Filthy killer.

584
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:35,601
(I'm at the underpass under the bridge. Can we meet?)

585
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:44,215
(I'll be there.)

586
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:58,630


587
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:01,028


588
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:04,229
Just wanted to let you know.

589
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:13,202
It's fine. I already knew.

590
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:29,350
Hey! Wanna go drink some juice?

591
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:36,425
So you already knew?

592
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:42,440
Yeah. Had to be a lie.

593
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,811
Mixing HIV-infected blood into milk.

594
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,906
Couldn't believe everyone bought it.

595
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,449
How come?

596
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:54,476
Well...

597
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,080
If someone was really trying to kill someone, or get revenge...

598
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,328
...they wouldn't feed us all that shit about the importance of life.

599
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,451
You think?

600
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:06,656
She didn't have the guts.

601
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:11,297
No matter how much she hated you.

602
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:20,807
She just said that stuff to give you a wake up call.

603
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,079
I could tell.

604
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:29,147
You're not afraid of me?

605
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:38,222
Even though I'm Boy 'A'?

606
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:44,434
Why'd you bother telling me the results?

607
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:49,503
Because even though my life isn't very important...

608
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,235
...yours is.

609
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:55,673
You've been sending weird mails around and setting everyone on me...

610
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,400
Right Hoshino?

611
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:10,512
If you keep fucking with me...

612
00:51:10,656 --> 00:51:13,250
...then I'm gonna put these lips all over you.

613
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,587
Just kidding.

614
00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:02,166
I'll pay for it. All of it.

615
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:27,354
You shouldn't eat it. You'll get AIDS.

616
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,427
During the closing ceremony...

617
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,596
The milk I drank had Miss Moriguchi's...

618
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,269
What Nao told me...it was too terrible.

619
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:45,977
Moriguchi is a demon.

620
00:52:46,385 --> 00:52:48,546
Nao! We're going to the hospital.

621
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:51,151
Forget it.

622
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:55,021
What're you saying!? If you died, I'd...

623
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,560
I'm a murderer.

624
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,060
You are not!

625
00:52:58,197 --> 00:53:00,757
You were just trying to protect your friend, so you took the body, and...

626
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,563
It wasn't a body. She was still breathing.

627
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:07,365
That's why I threw her in the pool.

628
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:13,808
S...so she was alive, and...

629
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:15,470
And you just didn't realise! That's right.

630
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:17,445
Not really.

631
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:23,580
She opened her eyes right in front of me.

632
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:35,832
So I just...

633
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:47,476
July.

634
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:57,651
Nobody dared to bully Shuuya anymore.

635
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:01,519
(Nobody dared to bully Shuuya anymore.)

636
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:14,300
Don't look! I'm writing a letter!

637
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,304
Huh? To who?

638
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,568
I'm not going to send it or anything.

639
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:21,672
But it's just...full of my feelings.

640
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:32,216
Cool.

641
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,259
This is awesome, Shuuya!

642
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:40,024
All I wanted...

643
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:46,367
All I wanted was for someone to recognise me.

644
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:54,740
I don't have a mother, and I've been alone all this time.

645
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,172
I told Shuuya...

646
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,047
...a secret I had kept from everyone else.

647
00:55:01,186 --> 00:55:05,850
That Lunacy girl...is my other side.

648
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,160
I let him see the real me, that I hid from everyone else.

649
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:18,602
Hey...

650
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,974
Is there anyone you really want to get rid of?

651
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:33,009
Go home!

652
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,883
Nao, are you there!?

653
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:39,479
Nothing's going to be solved by holing yourself up in your room!

654
00:55:44,763 --> 00:55:46,355
Don't think you're facing this alone!

655
00:55:46,498 --> 00:55:47,760
I'll help you!

656
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,959
I'll listen to anything you have to say!

657
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:52,434
Believe in me, Naoki!

658
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:55,199
You've got to come to the end of year ceremony tomorrow!

659
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,406
Everyone's waiting for you!

660
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:12,285
Mozuki... Thanks for always coming with me.

661
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:27,329
Naoki...isn't Naoki anymore.

662
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:32,968
The gentle Nao that I loved...is gone.

663
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:44,022
Yoshihiko...Mariko... Goodbye.

664
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:52,461
Forgive me. I'm going to take Nao with me t...

665
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:16,011
(...to heaven.)

666
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,501
Nao...

667
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:36,403
The next day, the end of term ceremony was postponed.

668
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:39,477
And in the afternoon, a staff meeting was called.

669
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:42,607
Because Nao...

670
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,575
...killed his mother.

671
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:55,357
I'm sure it's a shock to you that Nao did a thing like this, but...

672
00:57:55,494 --> 00:57:59,430
The police are wanting to make inquiries.

673
00:58:02,468 --> 00:58:03,730
Mozuki.

674
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:09,302
You just need to tell the teachers and the police whatever comes to mind.

675
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:11,806
I know.

676
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:18,808
Miss... Miss Moriguchi.

677
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:24,245
I want to ask you once more.

678
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,021
Is life a heavy burden to bear?

679
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:34,532
No matter whose life it is?

680
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:47,310
I've collected a range of different medicines.

681
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:52,712
I planned to use them to commit suicide.

682
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:58,217
But it's just as easy to take them...

683
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:00,291
...and mix them into Werther's tea.

684
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:04,725
Life isn't worth a thing.

685
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:10,596
I'm sure that's what you thought when you did what you did to Shuuya and Nao.

686
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:16,002
Though I'm not sure you did anything at all...

687
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:22,978
I'm actually a little bit afraid.

688
00:59:23,649 --> 00:59:26,049
Though part of me doesn't care...

689
00:59:26,852 --> 00:59:29,844
...whether a creep like Werther lives or dies.

690
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,919
I said whatever came to mind.

691
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:41,029
That everything Nao did... That him becoming the way he did...

692
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:46,798
Was all Werther's fault.

693
01:00:10,996 --> 01:00:16,161
Nobody taught me that killing people was wrong.

694
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:23,202
Where other kids got given beautiful picture books and

695
01:00:23,342 --> 01:00:24,536
my Mum taught me Ohm's law and Norton's theorum.

696
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:29,636
She only ever talked about electronics.

697
01:00:30,883 --> 01:00:34,182
She'd break cute toys to pieces,

698
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:43,154
and show me how they worked.

699
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:51,399
Mom dreamed of becoming a reasearcher in electrical engineering.

700
01:00:52,704 --> 01:00:57,437
She married the most unspectacular person you could imagine...

701
01:00:57,576 --> 01:01:01,478
...and gave birth to me.

702
01:01:03,282 --> 01:01:06,308
In order to raise me,

703
01:01:06,451 --> 01:01:11,354
Mom threw away her career as a researcher, and cast aside a shining future.

704
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,084
You're going to be a genius.

705
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:17,821
Because you've got my blood in your veins.

706
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:25,933
But she soon came to regret that decision.

707
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:29,466
And to hate me for it.

708
01:01:29,608 --> 01:01:33,806
Why don't you get it? Why can't you even do something like this!?

709
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:40,985
If only you weren't here.

710
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,314
If only I wasn't here.

711
01:01:45,357 --> 01:01:46,915
I'm sorry...

712
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:51,428
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

713
01:01:52,497 --> 01:01:53,623
What're you doing?

714
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,697
My dad couldn't stand the way she treated me, and divorced her.

715
01:01:59,438 --> 01:02:04,398
And Mom decided to go back to her dream of being a researcher.

716
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:07,470
Of course, that meant leaving me behind.

717
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,374
The only things she left me were...

718
01:02:11,516 --> 01:02:14,883
These are all wonderful books that have had a big impact on me.

719
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:17,588
I'm sure they'll be useful to you further down the line.

720
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:20,851
...a pile of books, and a few words.

721
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:23,826
You've got the same blood as me.

722
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:26,954
The same talent flows in your veins.

723
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,503
See you around.

724
01:02:58,764 --> 01:03:02,757
As she left, I heard...

725
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:09,840
...the sound of something important to me disappearing.

726
01:03:10,909 --> 01:03:13,901
(Confession: Shuuya Watanabe)

727
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:16,404
Pop...

728
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:21,679
Everyone will die.

729
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:30,258
Want a drink too?

730
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:35,424
Including me.

731
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:41,061
My entire world will...

732
01:03:42,707 --> 01:03:45,005
31st August.

733
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:48,441
I planted a bomb in the school.

734
01:03:55,454 --> 01:03:59,288
The detonator is tied to the dial button on my phone.

735
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:05,151
A piece I wrote on the topic of 'Life' during my first term...

736
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,322
...was 

737
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:10,958
And come tomorrow's start of term ceremony.

738
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:14,197
I'll be standing in front of every student in the school reading it.

739
01:04:15,774 --> 01:04:18,265
Realise the importance of life!

740
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:22,979
I'll never forget the words of Miss Moriguchi, who told me that.

741
01:04:24,149 --> 01:04:27,676
They were words of truth, from a woman...

742
01:04:27,819 --> 01:04:33,018
...who had lost her darling daughter.

743
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:50,435
When I've finished my speech, I'll trigger the detonator.

744
01:04:50,876 --> 01:04:55,836
And I'll be blown to pieces, along with all the idiots sitting in front of me.

745
01:04:58,617 --> 01:05:02,986
The media will be all over it, of course.

¿Ì°åÓ¡ÏóºÍÉç???

748
01:05:09,761 --> 01:05:16,530
So I'm leaving my last will and testament...on this website.

749
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:22,736
The year after he divorced my mom, Dad got remarried.

750
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:25,933
In perfect accordance with natural law...

751
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:28,409
...it was a union of two morons...

752
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,208
...so their child was just as stupid.

753
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:32,111
Your dad and I have been thinking...

754
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,649
...that maybe we could turn the storehouse into a study room for you.

755
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:36,652
The baby will be crying everyday, and...

756
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:40,989
it would be good for you not to be disturbed.

757
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:56,573
I read the books Mom left me every day.

758
01:05:57,075 --> 01:06:01,637
I could feel her blood burning in my veins.

759
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:05,780
I wanted to use the talents she had left me.

760
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,578
The morons were happier to keep...

761
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,847
me out of sight. So I shut myself away like...

762
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:13,480
some sort of monster.

763
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,178
What's this?

764
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,787
A backwards clock.

765
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:50,861
Idiots who only met up to uncensor porn movies...

766
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,257
...couldn't hope to understand my genius.

767
01:06:57,936 --> 01:06:58,732
(Einstein's Laboratory)

768
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,998
First I set up a website.

769
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,837
Then I visited the page of my mom's prestigious university,

770
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:07,835
and sent them the address.

771
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:11,471
(Here's a kid genius who's really into electrical engineering.)

772
01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:13,413
(He's posting some pretty amazing stuff!)

773
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:17,078
I thought maybe Mom might see it.

774
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:20,915
But...

775
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:22,686
(0 comments)

776
01:07:25,697 --> 01:07:29,997
It pissed me off that whenever I posted stupid junk...

01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:34,972

779
01:07:36,408 --> 01:07:41,937


780
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:47,575


781
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,186
Yoshikazu Seguchi. I was shocked to find his name among the judges.

782
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:54,691
A professor who had inspired Mom. Who she had looked up to more than anyone.

783
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,724
I wanted to show him my inventions.

784
01:07:58,396 --> 01:08:02,924
It was the perfect stage to demonstrate the talents Mom had left me.

785
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:05,701
If my inventions were just recognised on a big stage...

786
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:09,933
...then surely my mom would hear word of it too.

787
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:13,337
I tested my invention on our homeroom teacher...

788
01:08:13,678 --> 01:08:15,236
...with pleasing results.

789
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,875
And as expected, took first prize. But...

01:08:21,019 --> 01:08:22,350
(Lunacy Incident)
(Junior high student murders family of four)

791
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:25,581
A student of a city public school is being held under suspicion...

792
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,351
...of murdering four members of her family.

793
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:31,553
...the world didn't even blink an eye.

794
01:08:32,163 --> 01:08:34,256
Nobody noticed. Not even Mom.

795
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:39,127
I had to do something bigger. Something the media couldn't ignore.

796
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:44,233
A murder.

797
01:08:45,977 --> 01:08:48,571
A murder using the very gifts that...

798
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:54,015
...my mom had left me.

799
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:57,654
I didn't care who I killed.

800
01:08:57,789 --> 01:09:00,690
But I needed a helper.

801
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,957
Someone too stupid to notice what I was thinking.

802
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:07,929
Someone who would do as they were told.

803
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:11,998
Who would spread the word of my murder like wildfire.

804
01:09:12,137 --> 01:09:15,800
An idiot among idiots.

805
01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:18,404
I found him.

806
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,716
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

807
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:31,655
Don't worry about me trying to drag you into it.

808
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,123
I never thought of you as a friend anyway.

809
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:38,762
You're pathetic, untalented...

810
01:09:38,897 --> 01:09:41,457
...and utterly worthless.

811
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:44,500
All I did was tell someone stupid that they were stupid.

812
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:49,198
So why'd he go and...
(Four year old girl drowns in pool accident)

813
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,240
...mess everything up?

814
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:54,276
I wanted to be friends...

815
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:57,245
With you...

816
01:09:58,683 --> 01:10:00,310
I didn't have any friends.

817
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:02,818
Wanna watch a video together or something?

818
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:05,479
I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.

819
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:08,217
Nobody who paid me any attention at all...

820
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:10,452
You seem different to all those other idiots.

821
01:10:11,062 --> 01:10:14,054
Sort of easy-going. Like a grown up.

822
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:17,498
Nobody had ever acknowledged me before.

823
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:20,729
So I chose a target like you asked.

824
01:10:20,872 --> 01:10:22,703
How about Moriguchi's daughter?

825
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:24,138
Why Manami?

826
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:26,607
Why did Manami have to die?

827
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:28,109
I wonder...

828
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:30,009
I don't even remember anymore.

829
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:32,309
I just did what I was told.

830
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:35,751
I scouted around the pool.

831
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:37,485
But you...

832
01:10:37,622 --> 01:10:40,182
If you tell them all that I did it, they'll let you off.

833
01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:41,986
He...

834
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:47,554
He just wanted to kill someone.

835
01:10:48,366 --> 01:10:49,958
But he failed.

836
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:51,728
She was alive.

837
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:54,037
She was still breathing.

838
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,503
...and utterly worthless.

839
01:10:57,575 --> 01:10:59,042
I'm worthless?

840
01:10:59,577 --> 01:11:01,670
He wanted to kill someone and screwed up!

841
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:03,178
He's the worthless one!

842
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:04,338
Tough luck!

843
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:10,786
Looks like I'll do what he never did!

844
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:16,422
Why the hell did you do that!?

845
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,461
If you wanna spread rumours, do it yourself.

846
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:28,234
Pop.

847
01:11:28,373 --> 01:11:32,332
A month passed, and finally the dumb teacher put two and two together.

848
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:36,379
I'm not going to debate the police's conclusion.

849
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:37,879
God damn it...

850
01:11:38,016 --> 01:11:41,383
It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.

851
01:11:41,786 --> 01:11:46,189
...even taking into account that she was only four, it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.

852
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:47,655
This is fucking ridiculous...

853
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:51,853
I mixed a little something into the cartons of milk the two of them were drinking.

854
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:56,226
The HIV-contaminated blood of Masayoshi Sakuramiya.

855
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,909
Moriguchi, you're the best.

856
01:12:13,518 --> 01:12:16,043
A life-threatening illness is just what I need!

857
01:12:16,187 --> 01:12:20,954
My stupid dad'll have to let Mom know about this!

858
01:12:21,693 --> 01:12:23,957
She'll definitely agree to meet me!

859
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:27,656
She'll meet me, even if it's difficult for her.

860
01:12:27,799 --> 01:12:29,266
I'll meet Mom...

861
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:31,325
She'll look out for me...

862
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:34,666
And I'll show her just what she taught me!

863
01:12:38,476 --> 01:12:39,943
Pop.

864
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:45,943
Everything after that was just a way of burning time.

865
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:51,052
My smiles...

866
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:52,417
My tears...

867
01:12:52,557 --> 01:12:53,489
This and that...

868
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,649
All of it.

869
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,352
Even living...

870
01:13:00,865 --> 01:13:05,529
They were all just boring ways to pass the time.

871
01:13:11,009 --> 01:13:14,206
(That day, I met Miss Moriguchi by chance...)

872
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:20,878
How did he...? That talentless...

873
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:25,384
Worthless...

874
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,555
It's all Moriguchi's fault.

875
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:37,066
She wanted me dead, and even sent spies here.

876
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:40,432
But Mom just kept bad mouthing her.

877
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:42,869
That's why she's dead.

878
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:46,272
Even though I worked so hard to not infect her...

879
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,379
To keep everything clean...

880
01:13:48,513 --> 01:13:50,310
I'm gonna die too!

881
01:13:55,086 --> 01:13:59,250
Yet...I'm still alive.

882
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,024
(Confession: Naoki Shimomura)
I don't think it's fully dawned on me yet.

883
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:10,397
I stink...

884
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:13,095
But this is proof that I'm alive.

885
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:16,673
My teeth... My hair... My nails... This smell...

886
01:14:16,808 --> 01:14:19,606
And the fact that I'm still hungry.

887
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:35,258
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

888
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:37,554
I'm going to die... I'm only thirteen...

889
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,162
Moriguchi's going to kill me!

890
01:14:39,297 --> 01:14:44,030
I still haven't kissed anyone...or had sex...

891
01:14:44,769 --> 01:14:45,827
Why?

892
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,699
Because you're worthless.

893
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:50,137
I am not! I'm...

894
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:51,969
You're a good boy, Nao.

895
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,441
That's right, huh Mom?

896
01:14:53,578 --> 01:14:56,172
Exercise, study...

897
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,342
Killing people.

898
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,042
You can do anything if you put your mind to it.

899
01:15:13,364 --> 01:15:15,958
I'm sorry, Nao.

900
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:17,564
Why?

901
01:15:18,536 --> 01:15:19,867
Because you're worthless.

902
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:21,062
Shut up!

903
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:32,312
I'm sorry. It's my fault. I didn't raise you right...

904
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,077
Worthless.

905
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:52,493
The boy's actions and state of mind are yet...

906
01:15:52,637 --> 01:15:54,764
to be disclosed, but...

907
01:15:54,906 --> 01:15:59,468
According to his lawyer, he accepted the verdict calmly.

908
01:16:00,111 --> 01:16:03,376
(Miss Moriguchi, is life...)

909
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:10,081
Even though he loved his mom, he...

910
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:12,882
Just like you.

911
01:16:15,259 --> 01:16:16,749
Nothing.

912
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,863
What's just like me?

913
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:21,026
You're scaring me, Shuuya.

914
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,224
What the hell do you know about me?

915
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:30,407
I know everything.

916
01:16:32,777 --> 01:16:37,043
You were just...a way to pass the time.

917
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:42,286
Piss off.

918
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,682
Thinking you're so hot because you're Lunacy.

919
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:47,382
Playing at being a psychopath.

920
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:49,618
And gathering up this shit.

921
01:16:52,263 --> 01:16:53,958
Lunacy is your other side? The fuck is that supposed to mean?

922
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:57,932
Entertaining yourself with stupid daydreams.

923
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,028
I'm not buying it.

924
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:01,570
Shuuya.

925
01:17:02,406 --> 01:17:04,670
You have the guts to kill anyone, right?

926
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:08,540
Then drink this shit yourself and die.

927
01:17:14,252 --> 01:17:15,776
Oedipus complex.

928
01:17:17,288 --> 01:17:19,085
You're nothing more...

929
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:23,224
Than a little baby who's spent his whole life crying for a mother who left him.

930
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:27,263
You don't even have the guts to just go and see her.

931
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,362
You're scared, right? That if you go see her, she'll push you away.

932
01:17:31,502 --> 01:17:34,471
You don't want to think that she didn't wa...

933
01:17:44,715 --> 01:17:46,342
Miss Moriguchi...

934
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:51,955
That day, I came across you by chance...

935
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,855
And I...

936
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:33,025
There was no blood in the milk, was there?

937
01:18:34,165 --> 01:18:36,725
There's no way you'd...

938
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:40,629
...have the guts to do something like that.

939
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:43,197
I've been thinking that this whole time.

940
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:46,235
I don't even really know anymore.

941
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,640
I don't care if that Werther creep dies.

942
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:54,649
It seems Mr. Terada will be taking some time away from work.

943
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:58,650
Because Naoki ended up...

944
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:01,519
It was all Werther's fa...!

945
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:03,183
I'm responsible.

946
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:07,828
I've been meeting with Mr. Terada every now and then.

947
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:11,560
He's very serious about his job...and very na?ve...

948
01:19:12,036 --> 01:19:15,028
A textbook Sakuramiya fan.

949
01:19:15,973 --> 01:19:17,497
So I decided to tell him that Manami's deceased father...

950
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:21,771
...was none other than Sakuramiya himself.

951
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:26,214
I strung him along, and used him...

952
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,410
...to make them suffer.

953
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:36,956
Of course I didn't tell him why Manami died, but...

954
01:19:37,094 --> 01:19:40,222
He was good enough to take my advice to heart.

955
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:42,924
To make home visits to Naoki.

956
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,831
To not be discouraged, even if he wasn't greeted warmly.

957
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:48,404
To be sure to go at least once a week.

958
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:51,633
To call out to him, even if the door was shut in his face.

959
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:54,711
I told him that...

960
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:58,143
...Sakuramiya would have done the same.

961
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,386
As for Shuuya being bullied...

962
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:07,022
...I suggested fabricating a message from someone in the class.

963
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:10,457
I told him the students would find it easier that way.

964
01:20:11,796 --> 01:20:17,166
I told him precisely because...

965
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:20,899
...I knew it would only make things worse.

966
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:25,702
I was so disappointed to hear he wasn't being bullied anymore.

967
01:20:25,843 --> 01:20:28,744
I thought it best to surround him with hostile classmates...

968
01:20:28,879 --> 01:20:32,645
...until either he killed himself, or one of them did it for him.

969
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:36,113
I guess you're a nicer bunch than I thought.

970
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:38,244
Miss...

971
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,146
Here you go.

972
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:42,919
Thank you.

973
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:54,171
If you mix that blood into their milk,

974
01:20:57,174 --> 01:21:00,439
you'll only be repaying hatred with hatred.

975
01:21:01,412 --> 01:21:05,314
And your mind will never be at ease.

976
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:09,210
They're sure to see the error of their ways one day.

977
01:21:09,353 --> 01:21:11,355
Let's believe in them.

978
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:16,258
For in their redemption lies your recovery.

979
01:21:17,194 --> 01:21:19,458
That's what Sakuramiya told me.

980
01:21:19,997 --> 01:21:25,993
He always knew just what to say.

981
01:21:27,037 --> 01:21:28,868
But...

982
01:21:32,743 --> 01:21:36,611
I told them I did it anyway.

983
01:21:46,023 --> 01:21:48,958
Even had I done it,

984
01:21:49,093 --> 01:21:52,324
the chance of them being infected was almost zero.

985
01:21:54,798 --> 01:21:57,995
And even if they somehow were infected,

986
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:01,263
AIDS is no longer the death sentence it used to be.

987
01:22:01,872 --> 01:22:04,966
Its progress can be slowed through modern medicine.

988
01:22:05,943 --> 01:22:11,540
If only we had found Sakuramiya's cancer sooner...

989
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:14,446
...maybe he might have survived that too.

990
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:19,446
But they didn't know any of that.

991
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:23,751
And just hearing 'HIV' sent them into a panic.

992
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:27,230
A sea of confused, foolish faces.

993
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:36,734
Miss...

994
01:22:40,077 --> 01:22:43,103
I lost my family.

995
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:47,107
Please don't hurt Shuuya...

996
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,781
I won't forgive him.

997
01:22:57,161 --> 01:23:01,427
What about if I died? Would you care?

998
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:03,032
Of course.

999
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,204
He's just lonely.

1000
01:23:12,343 --> 01:23:15,801
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.

1001
01:23:17,448 --> 01:23:23,853
He just wants to be acknowledged by the mother who threw him away.

1002
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:25,922
And...

1003
01:23:50,414 --> 01:23:55,283
Miss... Is life...

1004
01:23:57,454 --> 01:23:59,479
It's light as can be.

1005
01:26:04,314 --> 01:26:06,578
Ridiculous...

1006
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:20,523
Her body was still warm. It creeped me out.

1007
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:23,224
So I stuck her in the fridge.

1008
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:27,368
I only killed another kid my age.

1009
01:26:27,504 --> 01:26:30,029
So juvenile law is on my side.

1010
01:26:30,174 --> 01:26:32,369
Nobody's going to punish me for it.

1011
01:26:33,911 --> 01:26:35,879
How dull...

1012
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:41,613
When I started making it, I actually had no idea what to use it for.

1013
01:26:42,252 --> 01:26:43,048
Three days ago.

1014
01:26:43,187 --> 01:26:44,677
Assistant Professor Yasaka.

1015
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:49,885
It was from my mother!

1016
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:55,129
She wanted to meet me.

1017
01:26:55,265 --> 01:27:00,134
Before I knew it, I was walking to the university.

1018
01:27:02,005 --> 01:27:05,941
The third research lab of the electrical engineering department.

1019
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:12,772
The door swung open, and there she was. I wondered if she'd

1020
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:17,944
burst into tears and embrace me if I called out to her. But I decided against it.

1021
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:22,923
What I wanted her to embrace wasn't my body, but something bigger.

1022
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:28,026
I wanted her to acknowledge my talent.

1023
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:31,227
To see the legacy I left to the world.

1024
01:27:32,336 --> 01:27:34,304
I left the university.

1025
01:27:34,438 --> 01:27:37,168
To fulfill my destiny.

1026
01:27:38,909 --> 01:27:41,377
I decided where to use my bomb.

1027
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:45,206
A massacre is about to unfold.

1028
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:49,342
And this time my audience won't just be one idiot like Shimomura,

1029
01:27:49,486 --> 01:27:53,320
but everyone who visits this site.

1030
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:58,652
I pray that news of my death, and of the...

1031
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:03,856
...bloody page I am about to write into history...

1032
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:06,970
...will find her. That my feelings will reach her.

1033
01:28:08,005 --> 01:28:11,964
I want...my mother to know what I've done.

1034
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:27,250
¡°There are men in existence who can, or more accurately, who have...

1035
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,082
...an absolute right to commit all kinds of wicked and criminal acts. For them...¡±

1036
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:33,557
For me...

1037
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:36,791
¡°...to a certain extent, laws do not exist.¡±

1038
01:28:37,501 --> 01:28:42,962
This is the justification cited by the protagonist of Crime and Punishment,

1039
01:28:43,106 --> 01:28:45,370
Raskolnikoff, after he murders his wife.

1040
01:28:45,976 --> 01:28:47,910
But I believe...

1041
01:28:48,378 --> 01:28:51,711
That life is... That every life is important.

1042
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,748
That every life is beautiful.

1043
01:28:55,519 --> 01:29:00,388
There isn't a single life in this world that can simply be cast away!

1044
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:10,362
Just kidding...

1045
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:00,814
Shuu, this is your mommy.

1046
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:03,249
I'm so sorry for leaving you alone this whole time.

1047
01:30:03,387 --> 01:30:04,479
Who the hell is this?

1048
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:08,356
It's Moriguchi. It's been a while.

1049
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:11,154
I picked up the little present you left in the gymnasium.

1050
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:14,627
It was the feeble work of a feeble mind.

1051
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:17,199
I had no problem disarming it.

1052
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:19,636
Though you helped me out blabbing all about it on that website of...

1053
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,429
Shut up!

1054
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:22,037
Not while I still have so much to say.

1055
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,372
I thought about how to take revenge on you...

1056
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:28,103
And even if I killed you, you don't seem to especially value...

1057
01:30:28,245 --> 01:30:31,806
your own life.

1058
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,849
I've been checking your site this whole...

1059
01:30:34,985 --> 01:30:38,011
time, wondering if there's no better way to punish you.

1060
01:30:38,555 --> 01:30:43,151
I saw that delightful little love letter you wrote to your mom.

1061
01:30:43,593 --> 01:30:45,652
But I won't have you lying to so many people.

1062
01:30:46,496 --> 01:30:48,225
As your former teacher, I must insist...

1063
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,493
...on correcting your work one last time.

1064
01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:55,404
Did you really think...

1065
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:58,406
...that the contact details I left you were from her?

1066
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,134
Mother...

1067
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:04,445
You set off the very next day, didn't you?

1068
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,482
The door swung open, and there she was. 

1069
01:31:07,617 --> 01:31:10,017
But you never did meet her...

1070
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:12,917
To fulfill my destiny...

1071
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:15,547
Telling a pathetic little lie like that...

1072
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,251
You bitch...

1073
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:20,227
You casually strolled into her laboratory.

1074
01:31:20,363 --> 01:31:23,298
Carefully carrying a bunch of junk...

1075
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:26,527
...that you planned on showing off to her.

1076
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:30,673
But she wasn't there,

1077
01:31:31,174 --> 01:31:34,405
was she, Watanabe?

1078
01:31:41,151 --> 01:31:44,177
Hey. What are you doing?

1079
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:49,649
This is Assistant Professor Yasaka, right?

1080
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,654
Yeah. You know her?

1081
01:31:51,795 --> 01:31:55,026
She's the person I admire most in the whole world.

1082
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,198
Right... But she's Assitant Professor Seguchi now.

1083
01:31:59,336 --> 01:32:00,633
Seguchi?

1084
01:32:01,171 --> 01:32:04,265
Yep. This person. They're on their honeymoon right now.

1085
01:32:04,407 --> 01:32:08,605
Kind of amazing, huh? Getting married at that age. H...hey!

1086
01:32:08,745 --> 01:32:13,478
You threw everything to the floor, and stormed out in tears.

1087
01:32:13,617 --> 01:32:15,949
I sure know a lot, huh?

1088
01:32:16,086 --> 01:32:18,145
I was watching the whole thing.

1089
01:32:20,357 --> 01:32:25,852
It was me who sent you her details.

1090
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:31,829
Kitahara... The girl you killed...

1091
01:32:31,968 --> 01:32:35,369
Told me about your Achilles' heel.

1092
01:32:35,505 --> 01:32:38,030
Shuuya's just lonely.

1093
01:32:38,175 --> 01:32:42,578
He just wants his mom...to look at him again.

1094
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:47,109
So I searched her out. It didn't take long to find her.

1095
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,981
To find the person you were so desperate to see that you resorted to murder.

1096
01:32:51,121 --> 01:32:53,919
To find out where she lived...what she was doing...

1097
01:32:54,057 --> 01:32:55,115
Shut up!

1098
01:32:57,894 --> 01:33:03,958
Plus I wanted to see just how much you cared about your mommy.

1099
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:11,967
Was the little boy who ran away crying really the same person who talked tough in those videos?

1100
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:14,099
I decided against it.

1101
01:33:14,244 --> 01:33:16,769
My beloved mommy threw me away.

1102
01:33:16,913 --> 01:33:19,279
Worse, she probably doesn't even remember doing it.

1103
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:20,883
I left the university.

1104
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:25,511
I hate this. I've had enough. I want to die.

1105
01:33:25,655 --> 01:33:29,352
Taking as many people with me as I can.

1106
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,161
These were the real thoughts that ran through your head as you set the bomb.

1107
01:33:35,465 --> 01:33:36,898
You idiot...

1108
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:39,558
What the fuck do you know?

1109
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:42,103
You're the one who's clueless here.

1110
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:45,835
Why do innocent people have to die for you?

1111
01:33:46,276 --> 01:33:50,303
This was between you and your mother.

1112
01:33:50,447 --> 01:33:54,008
So why did you have to drag Manami and Kitahara into it?

1113
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:55,811
I didn't care who I killed.

1114
01:33:55,952 --> 01:33:58,045
Then why not start with your beloved mommy?

1115
01:33:58,188 --> 01:33:59,519
Shut up!

1116
01:33:59,856 --> 01:34:01,847
What are you doing? Give me that!

1117
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:14,200
The police are on their way to your house.

1118
01:34:14,337 --> 01:34:18,034
It won't be long before they discover Kitahara's body.

1119
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:23,209
She was the only one...

1120
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:25,644
...willing to understand the proud, pathetic little creature that you are.

1121

1124

Even if the law protects you,

1125
01:34:35,558 --> 01:34:38,356
I'll never forgive you.

1126
01:34:42,465 --> 01:34:45,059
After disarming the bomb this morning,

1127
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:49,468
I took a trip to visit someone.

1128
01:34:50,573 --> 01:34:55,476
And took them that lovely little present of yours.

1129
01:35:13,096 --> 01:35:16,224
You were so desperate to meet her...

1130
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:19,494
...and it was so easy for me.

1131
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:24,004
She had just returned from her honeymoon the night before.

1132
01:35:28,678 --> 01:35:31,203
I told her everything.

1133
01:35:31,348 --> 01:35:38,311
How much you loved her. And how many people you had sacrificed for her.

1134
01:35:38,455 --> 01:35:44,257
She hadn't forgotten you, you know.

1135
01:35:44,694 --> 01:35:46,161
Stop...

1136
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:53,163
Anyway, I gave her your present...

1137
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:57,335
...that little invention of yours...

1138
01:35:57,474 --> 01:36:00,034
...and left.

1139
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,167
She was a wonderful person.

1140
01:36:32,308 --> 01:36:36,176
So I was praying that you wouldn't press the detonator.

1141
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:46,654
But you...went and did it anyway.

1142
01:36:49,826 --> 01:36:51,657
Just kidding...

1143
01:36:59,369 --> 01:37:04,033
I heard it too. The sound of something important to you disappearing.

1144
01:37:07,043 --> 01:37:12,743
But it wasn't a pop... It was more like...KABOOM!

1145
01:37:21,157 --> 01:37:23,091
Stop it!

1146
01:40:47,163 --> 01:40:49,563


1147
01:41:35,278 --> 01:41:36,802
Watanabe...

1148
01:41:36,946 --> 01:41:40,973
You're the one who made the bomb.

1149
01:41:41,117 --> 01:41:42,948
And you're the one who pushed the detonator.

1150
01:42:25,962 --> 01:42:29,125
This is my revenge.

1151
01:42:32,535 --> 01:42:34,730
I have plunged you into the depths of hell.

1152
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:57,451
This is the first step toward your redemption.

1153
01:43:13,009 --> 01:43:14,874
Just messing with you.
