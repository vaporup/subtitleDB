1
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,859
The mechanism of the human
brain is amazing and mysterious

2
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,993
Out of hundreds
of millions of brain cells

3
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,231
Human could only exercise
less than ten percent of them.

4
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:12,011
And the remaining 90%
that have always been dormant

5
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,045
Is known as the Forbidden Zone.

6
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,580
At last

7
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,808
Man could bear the temptation no more

8
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:20,886
They strove to seek access to the Zone.

9
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:24,351
3 years after the treaty
of global abolition of weapons

10
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,421
One hundred selected
policemen participated in developing.

11
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,462
The police defensive
device The Power Glove experiment,

12
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:32,588
Making use of biochemical technology,
the experiment was aimed at

13
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,166
Releasing energy from the Forbidden Zone.

14
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,402
However

15
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:40,333
The experiment was
aborted with unknown reasons ...

16
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,319
To ensure safety of
your personal life and property,

17
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,521
According to
the Federal Government Security Decree

18
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,326
And Anti-violence Code number 628,

19
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,559
Civilians are forbidden to carry

20
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,602
or possess any ammunition or weapon.

21
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:11,635
Once found,

22
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,467
police will treat
the owner as highly dangerous personnel.

23
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,444
Hi everybody,
today the air pollution index is black;

24
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,883
And the UV index is also black.

25
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,145
You are advised to take
all precautions to avoid sun-burnt.

26
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,321
Lastly, let us remind you that

27
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,086
The Observatory forecasts
that an unusually bright moon

28
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:37,060
Will appear next Friday night,
7th of July on the Lunar Calendar.

29
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,992
Once again, you can all expect to enjoy

30
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,363
An exceptionally beautiful
moonlit night on that evening.

31
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:45,869
Slow down? Wait for me!

32
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,406
Excuse me? Get out of my way!

33
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,165
Belle

34
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,597
Where are you? What took you so long?

35
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:15,860
It has already
started long time ago! Harder!

36
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,970
I'm coming!
I almost broke the cyber bike!

37
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,731
Okay,
you guys have fun, I will be there soon

38
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,544
Nova, not so fast! There're cops ahead.

39
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,143
Warning: there is a grav-way.

40
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,343
Reduce speed now, or face prosecution!

41
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,680
Bit me!

42
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:37,387
Warning: Reduce speed now!

43
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,043
Digital color on lips.
You'll fall in love with it!

44
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,825
More?! Let's go, the cops are after us!

45
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,992
Let's go! I am not waiting for you!

46
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,174
Hey what took you two so long!

47
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:09,440
You are so very late.

48
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:10,480
Why are you so late?

49
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,084
It's all your fault!

50
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,913
You put my bike in such bad shape.

51
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,957
The long-haired guy
is bound to lose. Don't worry about it.

52
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,719
What do you know? He is the most favorite

53
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,760
Won seven matches,
now in for eight-time consecutive championship

54
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,090
I am betting on him to win.

55
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,181
Yes! Won!

56
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,843
Time to collect our money ...

57
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,454
Let's go!

58
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,619
Iron-surfer wants to be
nine-times consecutive champion

59
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,625
Who wants to take him out?

60
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,490
It seems no one dare to challenge him,

61
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:00,131
is he to be a champion again?

62
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,530
What's up with you?

63
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,295
Are you still scared?
Your hand is shaking.

64
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,563
My hand is itching for a good fight.
Get him!

65
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,229
Look at this Hippie,

66
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,698
To beat him up or
be beaten by him will be just as cool.

67
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,342
You want to fight?

68
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,503
No, I promised Aunt Wing I wouldn't do it

69
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,747
Tell you what ... I will defeat him

70
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:20,479
And I will win enough money
to buy the Power Glove.

71
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,850
You won't stop me, will you?

72
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,956
Even if you really want to fight,
don't get too serious.

73
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,560
Otherwise Aunt Wing will know it ...

74
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,865
I don't like hitting people on the head,
neither do I want to be hit.

75
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,668
Now where are the fists?

76
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,234
Give it your best shot!

77
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,043
Don't think you can
save energy for the next match.

78
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,534
This is so fast!
It's faster than cyber bike!

79
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,053
Nova, don't get too serious!

80
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,505
Not bad! You can take a couple of punches

81
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,000
Way to go, Nova!

82
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:36,408
Good shot! We won!

83
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:42,838
My treat.

84
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,749
Sorry, I don't take cold drinks.

85
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,592
Try if it cold?

86
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,766
It's hot!

87
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,631
Quit flirting, Belle!

88
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:08,741
Collect our money.

89
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,343
Mind your own business.

90
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,590
Hi, Aunt Wing.

91
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:40,862
How angry do you think Mom is?

92
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,070
Let's test it out.

93
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:49,208
What is that?

94
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:50,576
Mood boy.

95
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,741
The music changes
according to a person's mood.

96
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,224
There's no need to be afraid!

97
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,204
Don't fret.

98
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,782
Go.

99
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,092
What are you doing?
You want to beat me up?

100
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,925
No, Aunt Wing, I'd never dare.

101
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:44,860
You taught us our fighting skills.

102
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:45,868
How can we compete with you?

103
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,632
Please don't move your hands.
Just your lips.

104
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:51,008
Okay, let me say this one more time!

105
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,203
Do not use The Avenging Fists!

106
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:55,973
You are saying that

107
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,878
The Avenging Fists is meant
for exercise and not for practice

108
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,413
So it means even if I use it,
nobody can tell.

109
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:03,819
It will be too late
if somebody finds out about it!

110
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,824
The Avenging Fists was created by Dad.
What is there to be afraid of?

111
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,086
If you can convince me,
I will do as you say.

112
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,623
I am your mother.

113
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,757
Convinced or not convinced,
you still have to do as I say!

114
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,027
No way!

115
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,096
You wouldn't even tell me how Dad died.

116
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,636
You never tell me anything.

117
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:21,467
Look,

118
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,973
Jazz and I have no relationship

119
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,211
But we never hide things from each other.

120
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:29,945
If you do not treat me like your son,

121
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,646
I don't know how to
treat you like my mother.

122
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,454
Nova

123
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:37,488
Mom. Nova misses Daddy, that's all.

124
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,681
Wait till he gets Power
Glove from the underground market,

125
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,519
he will be at ease.

126
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,291
Power Glove?

127
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,888
Power Glove? Only cops are
authorized to use Power Glove.

128
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,329
What do you want them for?

129
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,727
You are ready to stir trouble again?

130
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,125
Dad has one.

131
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,263
I want one too.

132
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,895
You can stop me
from doing a lot of things.

133
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,304
But you can't
stop me from missing my Dad.

134
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:57,700
Nova,
that's enough! You want some beating?

135
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,037
Just shut up, okay?

136
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,770
Please be quiet.

137
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,752
Even if you get Power Glove,
it will be useless to you!

138
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,587
Jazz, watch him for me.

139
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,050
Yes.

140
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,386
Don't let him get into trouble again!

141
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,293
Yes.

142
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,762
Aunt Wing must have good reason
for not telling you something.

143
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,161
Don't keep pressurizing her ...

144
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,078
Nova, your father is a cop.

145
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,516
I have my duties to do,
that's why I cannot always be with you.

146
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,414
I can't even be there at your birth.

147
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,223
So I am leaving you

148
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,656
the basic
techniques for The Avenging Fists.

149
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:51,160
So you can follow practise.
My son, watch this!

150
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,420
Practise well.

151
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,381
The Avenging Fists
might help me protect your mom

152
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,823
And you and your sister.

153
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:24,293
Goodbye, Nova.

154
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,955
How I wish I could hug you for a while.

155
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:28,859
Dad!

156
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:33,166
Dad, don't go!

157
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:46,736
Iron-surfer?

158
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,276
What a coincidence!

159
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:50,143
How about another match? Let me know when

160
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,342
You guys don't need to
fight every single time you hang out.

161
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,084
You can hang out for
entertainment like racing Cyber Bike.

162
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,288
Hey, don't fight!

163
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,517
What is that drink there?
Give us three glasses.

164
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,388
We only sell pure oxygen and alcohol

165
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,790
If you want Earthquake ...

166
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,962
Don't look!

167
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,402
You can tell those are no good guys

168
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,440
Staring for long will only
mess yourself up. Now look at me.

169
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,667
But what is there to see on you?

170
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:18,935
Hey, what is Earthquake?

171
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,987
First kiss?!

172
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:32,719
Let's go. Go ...

173
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,416
Why rush?
Sing and Kit aren't even here yet.

174
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,385
No, I have a feeling that this place ...

175
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:37,655
...is trouble-prone, I can smell it.

176
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,424
I promised Aunt Wing
I will take care of you.

177
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,725
Let's go ... Wait.

178
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,164
Sis,
he wants to have a good talk with you.

179
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,483
Hey,
can I borrow your phone for a while?

180
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:39,818
Mine just ran out of battery.

181
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:48,232
Is yours on vibration mode?
It is shaking bad!

182
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,335
I haven't.

183
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,471
BF999841112

184
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,399
Oh yes, I forgot to tell you.

185
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,568
You looked real cool in the rink.

186
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:01,935
Thanks.

187
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:06,276
Sing, you coming?

188
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,784
Stop messing with it. That can wait!

189
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,117
Come quick.

190
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:13,354
What are you doing?

191
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,790
Look at that smile
those dimples! Are you flirting?

192
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:18,726
Those guys are not coming.
You talk to them.

193
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,359
Not coming. Right, forget it!

194
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:23,567
What are you doing?

195
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,803
Sorry, I hung up on an impulse.

196
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,166
Does that hurt?

197
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,306
If you want to use a phone, use mine.

198
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:34,045
Some people don't care about hygiene;
they have dirty fingers.

199
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:35,703
What do you mean by dirty?
You think you are very hygienic?

200
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,074
The nails are black, look.

201
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:42,386
You danced quite well just now.

202
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,023
I'll bet you are thirsty.

203
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,187
I will treat you to a drink.

204
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,396
Who cares about your treat?
Do I know you?

205
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,528
We just danced together.

206
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:56,834
That's right. The dance is over.

207
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:03,600
Thanks.

208
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,283
That is so cool, I'm in!

209
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,782
What are you doing, you want a fight?

210
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,016
Somebody put Earthquake in her glass,
look at her.

211
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:48,445
Don't fight, don't fight.

212
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:49,645
Stop fighting!

213
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:50,880
You want to fight?

214
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,722
Do you really want to fight?

215
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,583
Fight with me!

216
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,308
Take them all!

217
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:52,075
Quick, split!
We can't let Aunt Wing know about this.

218
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:54,208
You are disgusting;
get your hands off me!

219
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:06,661
Go!

220
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,141
Don't utter a sound when we're there.

221
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,275
If wake my mom up,
we will both be in trouble.

222
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:25,413
Nova, is that you?

223
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:26,984
Yes!

224
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,615
See, you have shaken out trouble

225
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:35,352
Left ... right ...

226
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,086
Still practicing at this hour?

227
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,693
I'm okay, mom.

228
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,323
This girl was walking on the street ...

229
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,526
At night ... and she is afraid ...

230
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,861
So she wants
to learn some defensive technique.

231
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,600
Tell her not to shake side to side.

232
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,198
Lift the fists, want me to show her?

233
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,742
No, no need.

234
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,167
Don't move the head!

235
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,417
That is some progress, one more time.

236
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:03,777
You want some beating

237
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,186
Don't be so hard on her.

238
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,559
You got to have patience, take it easy.

239
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,164
How about that?

240
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,661
Are you faking dead?

241
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:20,766
Look, you can't even stand a single punch

242
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,464
Take your time, make it easy on her.

243
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,402
Good night.

244
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:31,176
You really passed out?

245
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:34,811
Don't shake anymore.

246
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:38,123
Don't you shake any more.

247
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,483
Let me tell you ...

248
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,825
Ask her not to keep bouncing

249
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,628
Do you need my help?

250
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,259
No Mom, No.

251
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:39,441
You little brat!

252
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,383
Hey, get up! Get on your feet!

253
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:45,456
Even I haven't tried it yet, how dare you?

254
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,558
I am going to call the cops!

255
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,450
Get her!

256
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,321
Get her? You still won't leave her alone?

257
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,622
I am calling the cops!

258
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:55,699
Miss, I don't think it is necessary.

259
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:56,858
You can give him a good beating.

260
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,697
And let out your anger.

261
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,302
Where do you want to hit? I will help you

262
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,133
Good, you go ahead and call the cops.

263
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,338
If I hadn't held you down last night.

264
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,440
You could have killed yourself
banging your head on the floor.

265
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:11,349
I thought I liked you before,
now you look disgusting.

266
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:13,776
Wait,
your clothes are not even messed up.

267
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,409
You don't think
it is just a misunderstanding?

268
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,520
That's right, Miss.

269
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,381
On the one hand, Nova never lies.

270
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,419
And on the other,
you clothes look really tidy.

271
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,187
You even have an extra top on.

272
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,454
Think about it.
It might be a misunderstanding

273
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:27,463
That's right, everybody
can see it is only a misunderstanding.

274
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,361
Why are you two so late?

275
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,834
She wanted to go
back to look for Iron-surfer

276
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,074
After all he had help us.

277
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,507
But when we got back,
we saw the cops taking him away.

278
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:40,905
We didn't have
enough money to bail him out.

279
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:42,445
So we came back
o see if you can do something.

280
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,549
Me? What can I do?

281
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,411
So what can we do now?

282
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,346
Take me to the police station.

283
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:47,850
I thought we settled it already,

284
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:48,714
why the police again?

285
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:49,786
What do you want from us?

286
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,148
Don't you want to bail your friend out?

287
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,461
Is that your friend?

288
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,948
You guys are all set.

289
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,814
Are you alright?

290
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:28,450
You don't need to thank us.

291
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,561
She bailed you out with her money.

292
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,957
Don't thank me.
From now on we don't know each other.

293
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:41,765
What a coincidence.

294
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:46,100
Next Monday is our birthday,
mine and Nova's.

295
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,939
Come and join our party.

296
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,610
Give me the data of those kids.

297
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:03,892
Practise well.

298
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:07,126
May be this leg-work kung fu
can protect you for me.

299
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:08,723
Goodbye.

300
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,799
How I wish I could
hug you with my own hands.

301
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:20,908
Are you done yet?

302
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,378
We will name this fighting art
The Avenging Fists, what do you think?

303
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,784
Feel this.

304
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:33,689
Thunder ...

305
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:49,133
I'm Dark.

306
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:53,475
I am just a little fatter.
Don't you recognize me?

307
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,346
I have met your kids.

308
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,556
If you dare say a word to them,

309
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:09,091
I will kill you!

310
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,892
Why do you let your
son practise The Avenging Fists?

311
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,423
I thought you lived
in hiding for the last 20 years

312
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,630
So that your kids
could lead a normal life.

313
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,869
The worst thing your husband had done

314
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:20,437
was to invent The Avenging Fists.

315
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,400
So that is why you killed him?

316
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:26,310
You killed your best friend.

317
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,611
Did you ever have
bad dreams in the last 20 years?

318
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:35,879
But at least,
I can see you have been eating well.

319
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,288
I just don't want the Avenging Fists
to end up in other people's hands.

320
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,218
Twenty years ago,
I had to make that punch.

321
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,497
I have kept this for 20 years.

322
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,497
Give this to Nova for me.

323
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,464
Then tell him his father's story.

324
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,843
The new millennium,
the new government of Combat 21

325
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:11,419
This is Republic Region.

326
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:13,988
I will inject in you
multi-beast genetic treatment.

327
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,959
By that time, you will all be like him.

328
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:20,428
The most powerful
warrior in the Red Dragon Army!

329
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,681
Did Dark send you here?

330
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:41,651
He is dying to know
what I am doing in here?

331
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:43,348
You want me to show you?

332
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,465
Dark, my friend.

333
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,029
Finally,
I am back in the Republic region.

334
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:11,943
Only this much?

335
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,982
I have given you so much time,

336
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,810
and this is all you could retrieve?

337
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,524
What are you thinking?

338
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:25,996
Think harder for me.

339
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,997
I want every move,
every stroke of The Avenging Fists.

340
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:31,334
How come there is

341
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:32,965
nothing in your brains?

342
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,705
Who did that?

343
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:45,610
A girl.

344
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,452
I want this girl, take her to me.

345
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,728
Sing, Kit, please don't stop, okay?

346
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,062
Help me fix the floaties.

347
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:07,535
I had problems accelerating,
how can I use it again?

348
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:08,969
You have problems accelerating.

349
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,836
Who asked you to race every night?

350
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,910
Why would I need such
an expensive one if I don't race?

351
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,436
I don't want to deal with you.
That must be Nova.

352
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,984
Happy Birthday, Nova!

353
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:21,115
Hi!

354
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:22,345
It's you?

355
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,714
Why would a man like
you have nothing better to do?

356
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,484
I was fired.

357
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:32,356
Well, since you were fired
and have nothing to do, come in.

358
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,162
Come in, go to the bar.

359
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:38,034
Iron-surfer

360
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,793
Happy Birthday! Thanks!

361
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:45,505
Mr. Dimple ... was fired.

362
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:50,605
Really? Go get some drinks, go.

363
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:53,877
Do you have a plan?

364
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:55,779
Why don't you stay to teach boxing?

365
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,514
No ... I can't.

366
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,852
The overhead
for our school is very tight.

367
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,252
How can we afford to hire someone?

368
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,361
I don't think
Aunt Wing will agree to this.

369
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:04,655
I will talk to mom myself.

370
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,427
Before you get another job,

371
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:07,895
you can stay here.

372
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,965
We can't afford much money,
but we can afford hot drinks every day.

373
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,631
You haven't forgotten?

374
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,273
Why are you afraid of getting cold drinks

375
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:24,174
I am not afraid of it,
I simply hate anything cold.

376
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:25,975
When I was a kid ...

377
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:30,644
One winter,
when I woke up, I found that ...

378
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,484
Mom was holding me very tight.

379
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,353
But in fact, she was chilled to death.

380
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:40,864
How absent-minded!
She should have fixed the heating device.

381
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,694
There was no heating device in the street

382
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:45,831
I am sorry, I mean ...

383
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:47,496
Anyway, I am sorry.

384
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,633
I got to go now,
tell Nova I wish him a happy birthday.

385
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,934
See if this is warm enough.

386
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:55,703
I don't know why,

387
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,405
I could do this since childhood.

388
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,083
But I can assure you

389
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,742
From now on,
whatever I give you will be warm.

390
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:04,920
Stay, okay?

391
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,001
Hi everybody, the observatory
forecasts in the coming week

392
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,535
The ozone layer will still be thin.

393
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,935
And the UV Warning will still Black.

394
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:23,333
So let us remind you that

395
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:24,874
Even though we can see

396
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,408
a bright moon tonight

397
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,671
You are advised not to stay
in an open area for too long

398
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:29,837
In case it might be dangerous.

399
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:54,130
Today I want someone

400
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,866
To wish me happy birthday.

401
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:01,936
I want ...

402
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,546
Erika

403
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,795
Meganova, Happy Birthday!

404
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,323
Thank you, Erika!

405
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,525
Did you know, Erika?

406
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,429
I really like you

407
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,471
Did you know, Erika? I really like you.

408
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:37,408
And ... you ...

409
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,284
You know why?

410
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,483
No? I will tell you why.

411
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,783
Because last time when
I was watching your commercial

412
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,490
I kissed you. Do you still remember?

413
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:53,691
The feeling was good.

414
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:55,592
And since then,

415
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,496
every time I see you on TV

416
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,736
My heart pounds madly.

417
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:06,937
Now I know how much I like you.

418
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,943
But now ...

419
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,443
I am beginning to dislike you.

420
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:17,681
I found a very disgusting person in you.

421
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:20,322
You are pretty but unconscientious.

422
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,623
More appropriately speaking, you are ...

423
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,628
Narrow-minded, brainless

424
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:30,257
Arrogant, ungenerous.

425
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:35,234
And you still haven't
wished me a Happy Birthday.

426
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,376
Yes, in fact you should be ...

427
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,370
More gentle.

428
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:45,913
You know why? Because ...

429
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,752
Because all men want

430
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,481
their women to be more gentle.

431
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:52,647
That's more like it.

432
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,886
I admit that
there was a moment when you were cute

433
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,661
Do you know when?

434
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:01,126
That's now.

435
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,127
If you are always a virtual commercial

436
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,604
Smiling so sweetly at me like now

437
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:13,739
I am sure I will love you forever.

438
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,407
But why are you so
long-winded in real person?

439
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:18,943
You even took Earthquake

440
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,573
And I took care of you,
but you said I took advantage of you.

441
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,151
You are not gentle at all!

442
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:26,747
Wish me Happy Birthday.

443
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,691
Happy Birthday!

444
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:32,185
Yes, that's right.

445
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,367
Let me tell you

446
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,025
Today is my birthday

447
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:42,239
And I heard that
the moon is going to be out.

448
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,839
That's why I
wish I could take you up there.

449
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:46,944
To see it.

450
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:48,272
And then when we are up there

451
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,740
You will gently wish me ...

452
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,311
Meganova, Happy Birthday.

453
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:58,650
Okay?

454
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,033
How come you are here?

455
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:15,102
I was planning on
going to your birthday party.

456
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:18,364
Who would have thought
you came here by yourself ... what?

457
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,471
Wait ... wait a minute.

458
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:24,138
Are you not coming to my birthday party?

459
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:28,748
Then let's go together.

460
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:35,884
Don't drive too fast,
I don't want to hold you too tightly.

461
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,848
Here comes the cake!

462
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,783
Hand in hand? So sweet!

463
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,353
She's my girl now.

464
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,222
Happy Birthday.

465
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,579
Wonderful ...

466
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:58,464
Is that it?

467
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,400
Light it up again.

468
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,197
No more.

469
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,465
Why don't you have a go? You wish.

470
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:03,403
Aunt.

471
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,565
Happy Birthday!

472
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:05,505
Thanks Mom!

473
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:06,837
Thanks Mom!

474
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,815
This thing, I have to give you.

475
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,080
This present is something
I never wanted you to receive.

476
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,719
Power Glove

477
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,694
It is something your father left you.

478
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,864
About your father's story

479
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:35,265
I think it is time let you know.

480
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:40,333
This is definitely
the best birthday present!

481
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,407
Let's not keep talking

482
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:43,241
You two make a wish.

483
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:45,008
Come.

484
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,621
Jazz ...

485
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:30,727
Jazz! Jazz!

486
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,163
You okay? Get up!

487
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:00,490
You have forgotten about me?

488
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:02,686
Mom!

489
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:06,153
Mom! Mom!

490
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:21,902
Jazz, you okay?

491
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,480
Put this on, go and save Belle.

492
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:05,748
Stop fighting, Nova!

493
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,188
He's dead! Nova ...

494
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,226
Stop it ...

495
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:14,593
Stop it ... he's dead.

496
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,498
Nova!

497
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,233
I killed someone.

498
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,435
I killed someone

499
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,475
I killed someone ...

500
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:31,308
It's okay ...

501
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,116
Put her down!

502
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,321
Don't fight, don't fight anymore.

503
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,074
Iron-surfer!

504
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:22,984
Mom, you are going to be fine.

505
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:25,953
I'll take you to the hospital

506
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:27,997
- Put me down...
- Mom!

507
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,224
Mom!

508
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,164
Listen

509
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:36,364
Enter your dad's pc number

510
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:41,375
into The Avenging Fists' data disc.

511
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:47,643
Then look for
a police inspector called Dark

512
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:52,589
He will tell you
all about your Dad's story.

513
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,291
All.

514
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:01,893
Mom ... don't ...

515
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,832
Mom, listen to me.

516
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:06,095
Mom ... I promise you

517
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:08,205
I won't fight again, I mean it.

518
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:14,266
Mom ...

519
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:16,839
That's ...

520
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,245
My ...

521
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,183
Boy ...

522
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:31,917
Promise me

523
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:38,596
Forgive your father.

524
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:45,165
He ... didn't know ...

525
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,240
What he was doing.

526
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,207
Promise me.

527
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,011
Did you hear me?

528
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:58,017
Did you hear me!

529
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,452
I heard you ...

530
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:01,921
I heard you!

531
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,597
The genes insides you

532
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,661
is an art of perfection.

533
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,166
You don't even need the Power Glove

534
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:51,103
And still you can
start up the energy of God.

535
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,972
What is your name?

536
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:59,180
You don't want to say it, that's okay.

537
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,942
Your past is no longer important.

538
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:05,719
Now you belong to me, did you know?

539
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,417
This is the first time
I think so important of a woman.

540
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,877
What's up?

541
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:36,310
Where am I?

542
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,852
I can't be here.

543
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,083
I have to go back!

544
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:40,588
You passed out you passed out just now!

545
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:41,418
Take it easy!

546
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:42,991
Where is Aunt Wing?

547
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,856
Why don't you save Aunt Wing?

548
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:47,987
Let's wait till you get well.
Don't do this!

549
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:49,190
I don't know!

550
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:50,999
You go find her!

551
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,966
Stop it! Leave him alone ...

552
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:54,804
Hold him up ... you get out.

553
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:56,929
Let wait till you get better, Jazz!

554
00:49:58,108 --> 00:49:58,904
I will find her!

555
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,170
Go outside. Let him rest.

556
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:01,937
Pulse rate 120.

557
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,307
There are brain malfunction symptoms.

558
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,141
Meganova

559
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,578
Who are you?

560
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:08,708
I am Senior Commander of
the Region's Police Division, Dark.

561
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:10,979
You have been suspected of murder.
You are under arrest.

562
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:22,459
The sky here used to be blue.

563
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,860
But I don't think you will have the chance to see

564
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:29,099
Since Year 2000

565
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:31,065
When men completely

566
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,142
decoded the human genome

567
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:37,511
Development in the genetic
project has soared beyond imagination.

568
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,248
Some say because
men have surpassed God's zone

569
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:43,845
God has abandoned men.

570
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:46,656
So the sky began
to grow darker and darker.

571
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,393
Ever heard of the Forbidden Zone?

572
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,091
Normal men could only
use one tenth of our brain cells.

573
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:59,566
The rest are always in a dormant state.

574
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:02,531
Scientists believe
that if these cells wake up

575
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:04,573
The energy
they can release is unbelievable.

576
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,609
That's why
it is known as the Forbidden Zone.

577
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:09,740
It is an area
locked up by God's own hands.

578
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:15,909
The Power Glove
can open up the Forbidden Zone?

579
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:21,789
Only its first generation could.

580
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:23,784
But there are only three in the world.

581
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:25,517
What the police is
using now is the second generation.

582
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:28,758
It is only muscles
empowered by biochemical electric current

583
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,696
Releasing energy that is more powerful than human

584
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,932
So my father's Power Glove
belongs to the first generation?

585
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:38,941
How did he die?

586
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:40,509
20 years ago

587
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:43,505
The Federal Government selected
100 elite fighters from the police troop

588
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:45,205
To join in a Power Glove experiment.

589
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:48,845
My best friend ...

590
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:50,142
Your father Thunder

591
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:51,948
and your mother were both in it.

592
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,188
The experiment was quite successful.

593
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:56,056
The Power Glove could effective trigger

594
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:57,820
40% of the brain cells in the forbidden zone.

595
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:01,196
I can still remember
the first time when I put them on.

596
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:03,989
I felt like God, not human anymore.

597
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,206
Shortly afterwards,
the third Power Glove fell

598
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,605
into the hands of Combat 21.

599
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,669
Then Combat 21 and Thunder started a coup

600
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:18,645
They destroyed all
the research data of Power Glove

601
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:20,875
Stole one and escaped with it.

602
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:24,843
Left with no choice

603
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:26,512
I had to strike at my best friend.

604
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:27,919
Why?

605
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:35,427
Only one man can claim the throne,
you are redundant.

606
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:17,639
You killed my father?!

607
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:21,775
Thunder was a combat genius.

608
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:24,779
He created The Avenging
Fists from ancient Chinese martial arts.

609
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,176
The power of the
Forbidden Zone plus The Avenging Fists

610
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:29,080
Worked like bullet and gun

611
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,153
The power was frightening.

612
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:33,215
That is Combat 21 had to get your father.

613
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:35,382
Is that your reason for killing him?

614
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:38,293
That is only one of the reasons.

615
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:42,093
There are a lot of
side-effects from using the Power Glove.

616
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,735
One of it being
an insatiable urge for killing.

617
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,697
One will experience
an uncontrollable deviation in the mind

618
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:51,071
That's why I believe a coup was
never what your father's intention.

619
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:53,108
He simply couldn't control himself.

620
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:54,636
Not long after,

621
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:57,874
Combat 21 established an underground army

622
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:00,750
The aim of which was to
overtake the present Federal Government.

623
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:04,411
You are a liar.

624
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:06,753
If Power Glove has side-effects,

625
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:08,881
How come nothing ever happened to you?

626
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,352
Says who?

627
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:13,890
I had been very thin.

628
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:16,589
I am not in a mood for your jokes.

629
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:19,729
Neither am I.

630
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:21,903
There is one more
thing you will not believe.

631
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:22,903
20 years ago.

632
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,598
another experiment
was carried out simultaneously

633
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,732
Scientists resolved to use genes

634
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:28,344
To create a new genre in men.

635
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:30,446
that can exercise the Zone liberally

636
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:32,270
So they picked

637
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,247
your father's
spermatozoon for genetic transformation.

638
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:39,284
But

639
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:41,015
your mother did not want
you to become an experimental product

640
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:42,125
So she took both of you plus

641
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:44,625
The Avenging
Fists' data disc and hid away.

642
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,595
But you still
haven't learned how to use your power.

643
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:51,059
Up until now,
you will still need the Power Glove.

644
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:55,232
And ...

645
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:57,404
Your father is not dead.

646
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,338
I am not waiting anymore!
How much do you want?

647
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:05,275
Miss, Meganova
is suspected of first degree murder.

648
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:07,440
Without the judge's permission,
nobody can bail him out.

649
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:08,846
Then arrest me too.

650
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:13,681
Don't chase him!

651
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:16,718
Put a warrant on Meganova!

652
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,952
Yes, Sir!

653
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:20,821
Civilians are asked
to watch out for a man

654
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:24,964
Named Meganova, twenty years old,
suspected of first degree murder.

655
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:28,169
His father Thunder used to be
Senior Combat Coach for the police force.

656
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:30,565
Meganova had
inherited his father's combat skills

657
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:32,334
and therefore is
a highly dangerous personnel.

658
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:33,970
If any civilian knows his whereabouts

659
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:35,976
Please contact the police.

660
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:37,407
Your son?

661
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:40,046
That means ...

662
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:45,421
The genetic experiment
held 20 years ago actually succeeded.

663
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,820
How about a family reunion?

664
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:08,262
Nova, the Avenging Fist was originated

665
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:10,839
from the essence of Chinese
combat skills over the last 3000 years.

666
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:12,405
The moves were computerized,

667
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:14,772
restuctured and consummated
into this highly competent martial art.

668
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:18,578
Every move will reflect
the ultimate power of the human body.

669
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,380
The first four strokes are the basics.

670
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,485
comprising
of both defend and attack moves

671
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:25,513
The latter four are dynamic attack
moves the ultimate killer storkes.

672
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:27,914
If they are realized with the Power Glove

673
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:30,390
The power
liberated is dynamic and devastating.

674
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:34,923
Remember this, the ultimate
power of ancient Chinese combat skills

675
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:36,996
Lies not in hatred or wrath

676
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,801
But in love.

677
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,468
Moreover, every time the fighter uses it

678
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:51,479
He does it to defend his beloved.

679
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:56,714
The move just now is the last move
in the Avenging Fist the Wrath of Heaven.

680
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,980
The key of which lies in its own name.

681
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:06,352
Use it together with the Power Glove

682
00:58:06,797 --> 00:58:09,698
And you can wipe
out the deadliest of devils.

683
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,229
I really want to know

684
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:49,536
What is inside
you that is different from me?

685
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:52,674
I really want to know

686
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:55,307
One who can actually
exercise the Forbidden Zone

687
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:57,079
How does it feel like?

688
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:00,412
I see you still not realized

689
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:02,276
the power of the Forbidden Zone.

690
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:06,148
One day, you will understand

691
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:09,152
That the power of strength is
equivalent to the pleasure of authority

692
00:59:09,826 --> 00:59:11,293
I am not crazy like you.

693
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:12,861
How did you know I am crazy?

694
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:14,393
Dark told you that?

695
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:16,592
Don't be afraid.

696
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:20,436
I don't intend to hide anything from you.

697
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,370
I am not your enemy.

698
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,235
If not for me

699
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:28,737
He could still be an experimental
dummy of the Federal Government.

700
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,706
That's right, I forgot to tell you

701
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:35,347
The strongest
fighter in the police force then

702
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:37,945
Has become my dog

703
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:40,522
Your father Thunder.

704
00:59:42,492 --> 00:59:44,790
What did you say? You are the dog!

705
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:47,489
He is not my father.

706
00:59:58,508 --> 00:59:59,770
Heart-breaking, isn't it?

707
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:03,107
Are you beginning
to feel that he is your father?

708
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:10,375
Tell your son

709
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:13,217
Are you one of my dogs? Combat 21's dog.

710
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:24,466
Hold it! Stop fighting!

711
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,533
Now what?
You are beginning to believe me now.

712
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:29,405
Are you
interested in following his footstep

713
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:30,936
And be another dog of mine?

714
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:33,304
Combat 21, I will kill you!

715
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:34,637
I will!

716
01:00:35,345 --> 01:00:39,076
If you have the ability to do so,
I will let you kill me.

717
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:42,717
This is the world for the fittest.

718
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:47,987
Only the fittest survive,
it is the law of nature.

719
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:50,852
Whoever the fiercest,
whoever is the boss.

720
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:54,424
Whoever that goes against me,
whoever is my enemy.

721
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:56,298
If you can defeat me,

722
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:59,764
you can have my power.

723
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:03,502
Then whatever you do will be right.

724
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,468
Even using live human

725
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:09,367
beings in experiments.

726
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:13,277
That is where
your father's tragedy came in.

727
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,475
And how
crazy people like me came into being.

728
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:20,648
But at least I treat you all as equals

729
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,187
You are equally my dogs.

730
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,418
When the time comes,

731
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:26,722
there will be no special rights,
hatred or tears.

732
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:30,330
No more ruthless genetic experiments.

733
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,291
Am I really crazy?

734
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:36,401
Or is this world crazier?

735
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:00,054
I see ...

736
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:02,096
You can only utilize

737
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,132
50% of the power of the Forbidden Zone.

738
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:06,927
Want to know what 100% of it looks like?

739
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:11,296
There is no rush,
just be good and be my dog.

740
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:31,990
An informant claims that the Red
Dragon Army is ready for a terrorist move

741
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,322
Their target is Republic Region.

742
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:34,957
Combat 21 knows you are here.

743
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:36,224
He will come for you.

744
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:38,160
Because you will be his only true enemy.

745
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,293
Kill him whenever you have the chance.

746
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:41,563
And save your father.

747
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:43,461
But
I am afraid you still haven't realized

748
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:45,267
The key to exercise the Forbidden Zone.

749
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,471
If the Red Dragon Army brain-washes you

750
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:50,710
BT38 might be able to help you.

751
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:52,373
After you have been brain-washed

752
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:54,449
It will
help restore your brain activities.

753
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:56,049
And retrieve your memory.

754
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,116
But
it has never been formally tested out.

755
01:02:58,354 --> 01:02:59,821
No one knows the consequences of it.

756
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:03,187
Who is my father? Who is he?

757
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:05,827
He might be
the one who killed your mother.

758
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,600
Welcome to the century's greatest

759
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:21,294
DNA union ceremony.

760
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,837
Nova, save your sister!

761
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:29,470
Nova!

762
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:33,812
She has already found her true man.

763
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:36,947
She will never leave me.

764
01:04:38,555 --> 01:04:39,886
Don't you touch her!

765
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:47,022
Meganova, freeze him up!

766
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,360
Nova, save your sister!

767
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,168
Save your sister!

768
01:04:57,473 --> 01:04:59,236
Nova, save your sister!

769
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:01,169
Nova!

770
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,734
Nova, wake up!

771
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:28,971
Nova,
he is the one that killed your mother!

772
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:31,273
You saw it with your own eyes!

773
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,066
Get up! Wake up!

774
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,537
And Jazz,
he is waiting for you in the hospital!

775
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:38,239
Get up!

776
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,441
Nova, save your sister!

777
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:12,510
Belle ...

778
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:24,526
Belle ...

779
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:36,102
What is Combat 21's intention?

780
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:37,866
Revenge

781
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,674
All that Combat 21 is doing now

782
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:45,012
Is to express
his wrath for the government.

783
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:47,048
The people have
always loved the Federal Government

784
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:49,083
There is nothing that deserves his wrath.

785
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:51,649
There is. At least 20 years ago,

786
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:53,221
you didn't treat him like a human being.

787
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,716
Only a laboratory specimen.

788
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:57,348
You mean the Power Glove experiment?

789
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,356
Although the Power Glove can open up

790
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:00,792
the Forbidden Zone,

791
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,592
It has different side
effects on different people.

792
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,227
Combat 21's side effect is this.

793
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,997
The Power Glove is basically useless.

794
01:07:09,572 --> 01:07:11,130
You were part of the experiment then too.

795
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:15,102
Apart from getting a little fat,
nothing is wrong with you.

796
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:17,137
If I tell you now

797
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,811
The Power Glove
lets me know when I am going to die.

798
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:20,745
Will you believe it?

799
01:07:20,883 --> 01:07:22,043
When?

800
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,082
One hour
fifty-four minutes and twenty seconds.

801
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:31,660
19; B18; B17 ...

802
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,060
You cannot
question the government in everything.

803
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:38,597
Don't forget
you belong to the disciplinary forces.

804
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:40,962
And don't you forget ...

805
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:43,534
All one hundred
police elites were human beings.

806
01:07:43,773 --> 01:07:46,401
All with flesh and blood and brains.

807
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:48,802
All you trash in the old government,
listen up!

808
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:51,444
From this moment onwards, here has become

809
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:53,606
Combat 21's
laboratory for genetic experiment.

810
01:07:53,883 --> 01:07:56,010
First it's the center of the city

811
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:06,951
20 years ago,
the old government used me as a specimen.

812
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,358
Today all civilians in Region 3

813
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,297
have become white
mice for Combat 21's laboratory.

814
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:14,231
All I have to do is move a finger

815
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:16,196
And the toxic gas

816
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:18,500
hidden
in the Republic Region will explode

817
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:20,268
Your only way out is to

818
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:21,669
take an oath

819
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:23,972
and be my civilians.

820
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,440
Combat 21, what exactly do you want?

821
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:30,953
Well, then let us talk.

822
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:35,421
I want 50% of the World's reserves.

823
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:37,826
Otherwise, in one hour's time,
Region 3 will become ...

824
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:41,362
Half our reserve? That's impossible!

825
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:44,365
Don't be stingy, the money is not ours.

826
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,398
Call the bank.

827
01:08:45,535 --> 01:08:47,025
The government requests
to utilize the World's reserves

828
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:48,603
Quick, call!

829
01:08:49,205 --> 01:08:51,673
Dark, if you want to get me

830
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,665
You will have to come to me by yourself.

831
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:57,238
Meganova is not up to it yet.

832
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:06,650
Meganova, your eyes have betrayed you.

833
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:08,550
The people that have been brain-washed

834
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:11,988
have no hatred or misery in their eyes.

835
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:14,287
Only loyalty.

836
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:16,162
Thunder, give your son a good lesson.

837
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:04,106
Iron-surfer, wake up.

838
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,048
It's Belle, can you hear me?

839
01:10:07,517 --> 01:10:08,745
Iron-surfer

840
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:34,101
You almost gave up your life to save me.

841
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,905
I cannot let you give it up for me again.

842
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:46,021
Iron-surfer ...

843
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:47,713
Don't sleep anymore.

844
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,842
My only way to save you

845
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,811
is to open up
the Forbidden Zone inside you.

846
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:17,476
And release the power hidden inside.

847
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:20,012
No, you will die if you do that.

848
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:21,548
I will not die.

849
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:24,020
I will live in your heart forever.

850
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:26,053
Forever.

851
01:14:58,274 --> 01:15:00,674
The Red Dragon Army only needs useful men

852
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:22,796
Civilians please leave the subway station

853
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:24,522
Joining the Red Dragon Army
is definitely not a solution.

854
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:25,856
Leave now!

855
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,430
Whoever that kills a cop

856
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:29,971
will become an honorary citizen of

857
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:32,801
Combat 21's new government.

858
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:37,242
Hit him, hit him!

859
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,473
Stop! Stop it!

860
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:57,097
You okay?

861
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:00,399
Go to hell!

862
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:01,634
I killed a cop!

863
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,364
I want to join the Red Dragon Army!

864
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:46,638
Get on the bike!

865
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:52,217
You are very heavy!

866
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,085
Give this to Nova.

867
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,020
Where are you going?

868
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,322
Combat 21 wants to see me.

869
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:06,299
Or he will never show his headquarters.

870
01:17:07,236 --> 01:17:10,399
But ... can you make it?

871
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:15,875
It won't take long.

872
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:18,510
Remember this, you have to find Nova.

873
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:34,550
Hit him back for me.

874
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,952
I can't, he is my father.

875
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:37,817
Who gave you this?

876
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:40,785
Dark gave me this, and this.

877
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,329
Sorry, your account has been frozen.

878
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:51,598
I have no money.

879
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:02,013
Transfer accepted,
virtual projection service commences

880
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:14,287
Nova, your father is a cop.

881
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,762
I have duties to fulfill,
that is why I cannot always be with you.

882
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:19,160
I cannot even be there at your birth.

883
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:20,363
Therefore I am leaving you

884
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,561
the basic
techniques of The Avenging Fists.

885
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:24,069
You should practise well.

886
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:51,559
Is he really your father?

887
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:53,158
He has been brain-washed.

888
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:54,863
He doesn't know who I am.

889
01:19:57,473 --> 01:19:58,804
Dad! Dad!

890
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:04,176
Dad! Don't do this! Dad ...

891
01:20:04,313 --> 01:20:06,076
Dad! Wake up! What are you doing?

892
01:20:06,215 --> 01:20:08,376
Dad ... Please don't!

893
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:11,486
Listen to me, I am your son!

894
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,691
Dad! Don't do this!
You have already killed mom.

895
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:20,727
I won't let you keep doing wrong!

896
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:28,058
Dad ...

897
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:41,270
Nova, your mother's death ...

898
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,640
That's not important, you are my father

899
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:46,373
Don't leave me!

900
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,245
Nova

901
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:56,249
The biggest power of The Avenging Fists

902
01:21:57,259 --> 01:22:00,660
Comes not from vengeance or wrath

903
01:22:02,164 --> 01:22:04,724
But from love.

904
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,801
Nova

905
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:12,368
You have to ...

906
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:17,435
Protect the ones you love most.

907
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:27,784
No!

908
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:33,092
Dad ...

909
01:22:33,228 --> 01:22:36,356
Dad don't leave me.

910
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,275
It's been a long time.
You have grown fat.

911
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:23,469
I can't even recognize you now.

912
01:23:23,612 --> 01:23:25,443
Not like you,
I don't think of evil deeds.

913
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:27,409
So naturally, I eat well and sleep well.

914
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,782
You think you can kill me?

915
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,247
Even if I can't,
I have no other alternative.

916
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:34,179
No matter what, I will have to try once.

917
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:38,323
15 tons of toxic
gas are hidden underground here.

918
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,021
They will explode by 12 midnight tonight.

919
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:43,961
If you kill me,
you will still stand a chance

920
01:24:16,798 --> 01:24:18,060
Do you know who set you up?

921
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,098
It's the good civilians and government

922
01:24:19,234 --> 01:24:20,826
that you have been protecting.

923
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:22,762
If you weren't wounded

924
01:24:22,904 --> 01:24:24,303
May be you can still run.

925
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:26,707
Why are you still loyal to them?

926
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:29,301
It is not loyalty to any body.

927
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:32,104
But I regret for
not killing you twenty years ago.

928
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:38,519
Dark, everybody is afraid to die,
give it up.

929
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:40,311
I will turn you into any Thunder

930
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:41,479
No happiness, hatred or misery.

931
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:43,750
By that time, you will
understand the happiness of being.

932
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,717
I'm not afraid to die.

933
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:47,328
This is the fact.

934
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,133
Power Glove is no use to me anymore.

935
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:02,636
Why not be another dog of mine,

936
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:04,177
just like him?

937
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:06,636
Combat 21!

938
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:23,396
Just in time

939
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:25,394
There is still time
for me to say my last words.

940
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:27,760
Are you okay?

941
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:32,631
The Power Glove
has been wasting my life energy.

942
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:36,233
Now at last, it has come to an end.

943
01:25:37,479 --> 01:25:40,346
Iron-surfer, are you afraid to die?

944
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:45,851
Put the glove on.

945
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:50,413
If you don't die,
then you can help Nova kill Combat 21.

946
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:52,520
But over-using
the power of the Forbidden Zone

947
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:53,753
will kill you too.

948
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:55,621
Are you afraid of dying?

949
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:04,369
Iron-surfer, put this on.

950
01:26:07,576 --> 01:26:09,840
Tell me, are you afraid of dying?

951
01:26:10,111 --> 01:26:11,271
I am.

952
01:26:12,914 --> 01:26:14,381
But still, I have to fight.

953
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:09,899
Meganova,
I get no satisfaction fighting with you

954
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:11,699
Is that all the power you have?

955
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:14,171
Come here

956
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:17,839
Kill me.

957
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:21,039
Let me know
there is still somebody able to kill me.

958
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:24,018
Let me know
I don't deserve to own this world.

959
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:26,211
Come, Meganova.

960
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:28,721
Until now, you can only use

961
01:27:28,857 --> 01:27:31,485
70% of the energy of the Forbidden Zone.

962
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,423
I am very disappointed with you.

963
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:35,125
You don't deserve to kill me.

964
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:37,024
You don't deserve
to kill somebody that can use

965
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:39,030
100% of the power of the Forbidden Zone.

966
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:41,465
No, I am not human.

967
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:43,498
I am God, I am God!

968
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,568
Vanish, Meganova.

969
01:27:52,614 --> 01:27:53,774
Combat 21

970
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:13,996
Iron-surfer,
I can hear my sister's voice.

971
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:16,035
Nova, I have already
mingled with Iron-surfer forever.

972
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:17,468
We will never be separated.

973
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:19,005
Belle

974
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,511
Nova, this is no time for tears.

975
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:29,578
Listen up, wrath is not the strongest
energy of The Avenging Fists.

976
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:32,480
Then what is it? What is it?

977
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:33,854
Daddy said

978
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:35,217
that the secret
of the move God-rage lies in its name.

979
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:36,551
What?

980
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:37,521
God has to be angry.

981
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:38,523
Because men have to

982
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,287
destroy all his creations.

983
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:42,056
That's right.

984
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:45,591
Protect the ones you love.

985
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:51,537
Protect this
land that we have been raised upon.

986
01:28:53,274 --> 01:28:55,208
This did not come from wrath

987
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:57,844
But from love.

988
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:00,939
Dark had once said

989
01:29:01,249 --> 01:29:04,275
Over-using
the Forbidden Zone will lead to death.

990
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,209
Are you afraid of death?

991
01:29:07,756 --> 01:29:09,121
Yes.

992
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:11,886
But still I have to fight!

993
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:13,926
Combat 21's Forbidden Zone

994
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:15,324
has been totally opened up.

995
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:16,589
There is not much time left.

996
01:29:17,432 --> 01:29:18,330
You have
connected yourselves to each other.

997
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:20,195
Nova, as long as
you have God's wrath inside you.

998
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,031
Iron-surfer can also make the same move.

999
01:29:37,052 --> 01:29:39,247
Power released by
the Glove is never like power released

1000
01:29:39,387 --> 01:29:42,049
from truly
triggering off the forbidden zone.

1001
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:18,291
Nova!

1002
01:30:18,893 --> 01:30:20,326
Nova!

1003
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:22,527
Nova!

1004
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,913
Remember this, Nova

1005
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:42,276
The ultimate
power of ancient Chinese combat skills

1006
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:45,215
Lies not in hatred or wrath, but in love.

1007
01:30:45,687 --> 01:30:47,382
In protecting one's true love ...

1008
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:49,356
Fighting for my true love ...

1009
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,468
Protect the ones you love.

1010
01:32:44,873 --> 01:32:48,036
Protect this land
that we have been raised upon.

1011
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:50,574
This did not
come from wrath, but from love.

1012
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,291
Belle!

1013
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:43,991
Sis!
