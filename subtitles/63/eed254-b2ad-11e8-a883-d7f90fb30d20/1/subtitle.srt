1
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,453
Good night, John.

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,257
- Good evening, Your Excellency.
- Good evening, Mrs. Russel.

3
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,561
Did the...? Did the meeting go well?

4
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,169
Oh, very well, indeed.

5
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,239
In fact, I feel certain now that
the opera gala will be a triumph.

6
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:20,903
Isn't that marvelous?
It's so exciting, so ecumenical, so...

7
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,741
Precisely. Good night, Mrs. Russel.

8
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,645
Good night, Your Excellency.

9
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,631
Great.

10
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,767
Perfect. Is that a shot?
Thank you.

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,675
- Janet, hi!
- Hi, how are you?

12
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,474
- Hello, how are you?
- You look so lovely.

13
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,481
- Thank you.
- Congratulations on your...

14
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,822
And I have no intention...

15
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,627
Excuse me.

16
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,896
Uh-oh. There we go.
My fault. Very much my fault.

17
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,754
Hey, come over here.
I wanna talk to you.

18
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,885
Sit down.
Now, what's this about you leaving?

19
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,129
I wanna take a ride along the coast,
and then I have to get back to the city.

20
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,697
And don't worry.
I promise I'll be here for your wedding.

21
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,768
You better. I need you.
So, what's going on tonight?

22
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,098
Oh, nothing special.
I'm gonna go to a movie.

23
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,603
- By yourself?
- Yes.

24
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,639
Gloria, this has got to stop.

25
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,401
Just because you've had one
bad experience

26
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,772
doesn't mean that you give up.

27
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,744
I haven't given up.
I came to this party, didn't I?

28
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,110
Ever since the divorce,
you lock yourself in that library

29
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,151
and hide behind those glasses.
Look at you.

30
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,519
You used to be a cheerleader.
You used to show some cleavage.

31
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,853
- What?
- Let's see some skin.

32
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,427
Shake your booty,
take some chances.

33
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,099
- What are you playing, old maid?
- I'm not playing anything.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,733
That's the trouble.

35
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,699
- OK. OK, I get the message.
- Sure, you do.

36
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,203
Now, take tonight. Why don't you
go out there and mingle,

37
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,673
pick someone...
Oh, just a second.

38
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,276
- She's right, you know.
- What?

39
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,217
Nice party. Lot of chances.

40
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,948
Didn't anyone ever tell you that
eavesdropping is not nice?

41
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,625
My single worst problem as a child.

42
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,889
I'll never forget my mother and parole
officer getting together with the priest

43
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,863
- and discussing the difficulties I had...
- Excuse me. I've gotta go.

44
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,630
You're gonna love this. Hey, come on,
I'm sorry. I was just kidding around.

45
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,636
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

46
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,105
Yes, and it seems to be
in your mouth.

47
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,675
OK, I deserve that.
But listen, it's Gloria, right?

48
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,509
You're a really nice girl,
and I'm a nice guy,

49
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,345
and you're very pretty
with or without cleavage and...

50
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,385
What do you say?

51
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,146
Would you like to take a shower?

52
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,758
- I don't pick up strange men.
- Well, that's your problem.

53
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,861
So why don't you try it?

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
<music>Barry Manilow: Ready to take a chance again</music>

55
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>When you go for it
Well...</i>

56
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,149
Hi. Thanks.

57
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,618
I'm really in a bind.
I've gotta be in the city by 5.

58
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,121
- Well, I'm going to...
- Thanks.

59
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,217
OK.

60
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,440
- What was wrong with your car?
- Radiator.

61
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,806
Oh, too bad. Do you live in the city?

62
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,140
Huh? Oh, yeah.

63
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,784
- So do I. It's fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.

64
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,420
Looks like we might have some rain.

65
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,218
Of course, you never know
with San Francisco weather.

66
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,524
One day it's wet and foggy, and three
hours later it's bright sunshine.

67
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,965
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

68
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,229
- That's a pretty name.
- Thank you.

69
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,834
Mine's Bob Scott.
Everybody calls me Scotty.

70
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,104
- Nice to meet you.
- It's really nice to meet you.

71
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:46,081
It's not every day I get rescued
by a girl in a yellow convertible.

72
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,515
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

73
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,121
Yeah. I'm trying to
give them up myself.

74
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,451
- You'll live longer.
- Yeah.

75
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,263
That's my plan.

76
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,986
- Come on, Gloria. It'll be fun.
- Oh, I don't know.

77
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,154
Look, I'll meet you
in front of the theater.

78
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,262
- Where'd you say it was?
- The Nuart on Union Street.

79
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,496
Come on, Gloria, take a chance.

80
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
What have you got to lose?
I'll buy the popcorn.

81
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,005
Oh, all right.
But it is a retrospective, you know.

82
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,005
Hey, I love old movies.

83
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,407
Damn it. Three left.

84
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,342
Gloria, do me a favor.

85
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,948
Would you hold these for me
till this evening?

86
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,919
I'm trying to keep it down
to a pack a day.

87
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,652
- OK, if it'll help.
- It will be a big help, believe me.

88
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,523
Out of sight, out of mind.

89
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,727
I'll just put them in your purse.

90
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,932
Gee, gotta run.

91
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,845
- See you at the movies.
- Eight o'clock sharp.

92
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,744
Well, hello, there. I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

93
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,309
I know, the weather's awful outside.

94
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,506
That's why I bought my ticket
and came on in.

95
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,908
Cigarettes?

96
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,245
Oh, I don't think they let you
smoke in here, Scotty.

97
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,888
Here, have some popcorn.

98
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,251
Go ahead, take it. I'm finished.

99
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,123
- The film.
- Oh, well, you haven't missed much.

100
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,958
You see the man in the overcoat?

101
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,794
He's waiting for the Chinese sailor,

102
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,937
the one Alan Ladd thinks
kidnapped the old gypsy.

103
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,963
But the secretary told
the cab driver that...

104
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,938
Wait a minute.

105
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,820
There's going to be a murder.

106
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,654
Oh, I'm sure of it.

107
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,357
The police... Contact the police.

108
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
Well, actually, the cab driver
is with the police.

109
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,470
Except the Chinese sailor
doesn't know that.

110
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,206
What?

111
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,675
The Dwarf.

112
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,539
Beware of The Dwarf.

113
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,584
Gee, Scotty, I don't think there
is a dwarf in this movie.

114
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,486
Scotty? Are you all right? Scotty?

115
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,307
Come quickly!
There's a man dead in there!

116
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,039
- Where?
- In there!

117
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,775
I'm sorry.
You'll have to see the manager.

118
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,715
- Where is he?
- In his office.

119
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,151
But I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

120
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,318
- Handsome Harry...
- Are you the manager?

121
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,258
Yes.

122
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,330
Quickly. A man's been killed!

123
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,831
- Killed? What? Where?
- In there!

124
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,401
Stop the film. Call the police.

125
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,737
Fred, turn off the projector.
Put on the houselights.

126
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,843
- Quickly, come with me.
- Not in my theater.

127
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,945
Harry!

128
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,183
All right! OK!

129
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,417
- He's gone.
- What the hell is this?

130
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,922
- I mean, my date. He was right here.
- Who?

131
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,427
My date. He was right here.
I swear.

132
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,326
Your date is the one who's
supposed to be dead?

133
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,470
Yes. He was sitting right next to me.
I gave him my popcorn. Where is it?

134
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,701
OK. All right, lady.
Just come with me.

135
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,571
- All right! We'll have it on in a minute.
- You've got to believe me.

136
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,007
- Yeah.
- Did you see my date?

137
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,976
Look, we'll talk about
it in the lobby, huh?

138
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,377
- I believe you, really.
- Did you see my date? Did you...?

139
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,485
Come on. We'll talk in the lobby. OK!

140
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,280
All right!

141
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,594
You tell Fred to start that projector
and bring down those houselights!

142
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,289
You've gotta believe me!

143
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,765
Lady, you made a fool
out of me in there!

144
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,734
I saw you out front.

145
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,407
- You didn't have any date.
- No, he came in late.

146
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,941
He was all wet and bleeding.

147
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,646
Sylvia. Where you going, honey?

148
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,840
Look, I'm sorry, Harry.
Intermission's in 20 minutes,

149
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,817
and I gotta go warm up
the weenies.

150
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,990
But, Sylvia... Sylvia.

151
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,422
He said, "Beware of the dwarf."

152
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,192
Dwarf? Listen...

153
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,524
...why don't you do me and you
a great big favor.

154
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,168
Why don't you just go home
and sleep this whole thing off.

155
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,033
I don't understand. He was dead.

156
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,140
I don't know what could have
happened to him.

157
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,278
Listen. You shouldn't go to picture
shows like this and smoke that stuff

158
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,677
if it's gonna affect you
the way it does, huh?

159
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,481
Dingbat!

160
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,551
Oh, Mr. Hennesey. It's you.

161
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,017
Whatever happened to you,
my darling?

162
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,691
- You look like you've seen the dead.
- I have.

163
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,487
In that case, come inside.
Tell me about it.

164
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,164
We'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

165
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,634
But it was so real. And that warning
about the murder was so sinister.

166
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,333
Well, my darling, Gloria,
people just don't drop dead in cinemas,

167
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,071
watching horror movies
and whispering, "Look out for the elf."

168
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,550
It was, "Beware of the dwarf."

169
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,918
Well, whatever.
He was playing a prank, that lad.

170
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,283
So you shouldn't take it
so seriously.

171
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,153
- Well, he did act rather strangely.
- Well, you see?

172
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,090
So you don't think I should
call the police?

173
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,264
The police? Whatever for?

174
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,094
I don't know.
I just have this strange feeling

175
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,894
that somebody's trying to kill me.

176
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,969
To kill yous? Well, you gonna
call the police and tell them

177
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,939
that you have a strange feeling?

178
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,812
I mean, they got killings of their own
to worry about, you know?

179
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,507
You're probably right.

180
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,653
They have killings and executions
and assassinations.

181
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,155
I think it's time we made
"murder" a four-letter word.

182
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,322
- Would you have a cookie?
- OK.

183
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,094
- They're good.
- Aren't they?

184
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,463
Well, when you've been an
anthropologist as long as I have,

185
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,604
you're working most of the time
in the field.

186
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:38,367
You acquire what my old father
used to call "culinary expertise".

187
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,648
I remember in Africa, in Kenya,

188
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,252
I was studying the lbutu tribe,
fascinating society,

189
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,718
and we could take a leaf from
their book, if they had books.

190
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,451
But they did have this wizened
old witch doctor,

191
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,688
and his name was Kiyato,
and he was a pretty good cook.

192
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,194
Here, I've got a picture of him.
I'll show you.

193
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,170
Esme! Get away from those cookies!
Esme, get away!

194
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,604
Get away from that! Hear?

195
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,870
Oh, poor Esme. You frightened her.

196
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,809
Well, she's getting too uppity.

197
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,006
She steals me out of
house and home.

198
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,914
Don't you, you wicked girl?
Don't you?

199
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,645
Where was I? Yes, the lbutu.

200
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,590
This is a commendable society.

201
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:33,822
It has severe taboos on murder
and light taboos on sex.

202
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,836
Thank you, Mr. Hennesey.
You've been wonderful.

203
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,008
Well, you're my favorite tenant.

204
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,042
And if anything disturbs you
in the middle of the night,

205
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,577
you just scream

206
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,272
and I'll be upstairs in a flash,
kicking ass.

207
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,279
Good night, I'll remember that.

208
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,887
Esme...

209
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,571
<i>Pope Pius XIII, on the first leg
of his American tour,</i>

210
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,005
<i>today addressed a special meeting</i>

211
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,874
<i>of the United Nations
General Assembly in New York.</i>

212
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,948
<i>Stressing the urgency of world peace
and international harmony,</i>

213
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,279
<i>the smiling 72-year-old pontiff
received a warm reception</i>

214
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,616
<i>with the U.N. delegates frequently
breaking into spontaneous applause</i>

215
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,553
<i>during his speech.</i>

216
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,161
<i>New York is the first of five stops
for His Holiness in this country.</i>

217
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,729
<i>He'll meet with the president and
congressional leaders tomorrow</i>

218
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,867
<i>in the nation's capital, then travel
to Chicago and Los Angeles,</i>

219
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,403
<i>with a final stop here in San
Francisco, before flying on to Japan.</i>

220
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,871
<i>Vice president Abernathy
arrives in Guam tonight,</i>

221
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,237
<i>ready to begin talks tomorrow
with foreign ministers</i>

222
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,709
<i>of the now defunct SEATO pact.</i>

223
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,439
<i>The purpose of the new meetings
is to establish a new framework...</i>

224
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,199
- You wanna have lunch today?
- Yeah.

225
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,036
Listen, I got a lot to tell you.

226
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,476
- Oh, yeah? What?
- I'll tell you at lunch.

227
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,818
Really, Gloria. Do you know the
percentage of rapes from hitchhikers?

228
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,318
- Have you any idea?
- No.

229
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,151
Plenty. And look at you,
with no protection.

230
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,952
Well, now, he didn't seem
to be after sex.

231
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,425
Rape is not an act of sex.

232
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,930
Rape is an act of violence.
Remember that.

233
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,326
Suppose that guy attacked you

234
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,734
instead of pulling that weird stunt
in the theater, huh?

235
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,000
What would you have done?

236
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,576
I would have hit him
with my umbrella.

237
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,337
Talk about ancient.

238
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,573
Really, honey, you gotta
drag yourself into the '70s.

239
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,845
You gotta get some merchandise.

240
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,955
You see this?
It's called "The Screamer".

241
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,855
They make a grab for your tits,
you just flick the switch.

242
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,704
Then you got your mace. Zap.
Right in the face.

243
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,508
And finally, for infighting,
the punch of power.

244
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,686
Crunch. Right in the nuts.

245
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,686
You certainly are prepared.

246
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:49,025
Nobody's gonna mess with Stella
unless Stella wants to be messed.

247
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,258
I don't know, all this stuff...

248
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:57,731
Gloria, sweetheart, we live in a
violent society. Weirdoes all around.

249
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,872
Get them before they get you.

250
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,149
- Good night, Mrs. Monk.
- Oh, good night.

251
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,219
- Taking your work home with you?
- Oh, yes.

252
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,517
I'm on to a fascinating sleuth,
you know, research is so exciting.

253
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,854
- Well, you're the best. Good night.
- Oh, well. Good night.

254
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,793
Oh, by the way, Gloria,
I almost forgot.

255
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,794
While you were out to lunch,
someone was inquiring for you.

256
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,837
He said he knew your pastor
and would get in touch with you later.

257
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,631
A nice little man. You know, a dwarf.

258
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,440
Well, good night again.

259
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,720
Oh, you frightened me.

260
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,387
I thought you were a dwarf.

261
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,391
You gave me quite a shock.
The library is closed.

262
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,368
Didn't you hear the bell? Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.

263
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,871
Anyway, I've already locked the front.
You can go out the back

264
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,239
with me if you want, but I just
have a few things to do before...

265
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,101
That way!

266
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,603
- Take me home.
- What?

267
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,431
Take me home, please.

268
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,039
Sure.

269
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,043
- My place or...? Or yours?
- Which is closer?

270
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,812
Well, I have a little pad
just around the corner.

271
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,818
Perfect.

272
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,992
- Do you mind if I finish my drink?
- Oh, no! Please. Do you have to?

273
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:25,068
No. No, I don't have to, Miss...

274
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,232
Mundy. Gloria Mundy.

275
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,972
Moria Glun... Moria Glundy.

276
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:38,679
- Can we go out the back way?
- The back way.

277
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,282
Fine with me, Gloria.
Anything you say.

278
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,549
My name is Stanley Tibbets.
Do you go to these bars often, Gloria?

279
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,126
I mean, not that there's anything wrong
with that. I mean, human desire...

280
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,593
It's a fascinating thing.
I mean, take me for instance.

281
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,700
I... I have an interesting job.
I... I work for the city.

282
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,770
- But every now and then...
- Couldn't we walk just a little faster?

283
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,770
Oh, you seem to be in a hurry.
Not that I object.

284
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,341
I mean, God, any man would love
a woman who lays it on the line.

285
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,909
Take, for instance,
the average woman,

286
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,513
who takes two weeks of dinners
before you even get to first base.

287
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,649
I mean, I've been in America
for two years, and...

288
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,480
- Mr. Tibbets, please!
- Oh, call me Stanley.

289
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,027
Here it is, my own little beaver trap.

290
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,625
Oh, don't turn the lights on just yet.

291
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,529
I'll go and close the curtains.

292
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,037
Oh, sure thing, baby.

293
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,872
Anything you say.

294
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,222
How's that?

295
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:59,726
Oh, listen. I don't want you to think that
I'm acting too strangely, but I have to...

296
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:04,868
No, no, no, no. No, I understand.
Make yourself comfortable.

297
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,594
- Oh, thank you.
- Let me get you a drink.

298
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,105
- That would be nice. Thank you.
- What would you like?

299
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,776
I've got it all.

300
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,114
I don't know.

301
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,576
Leave it to me. I know just
the thing for your mood.

302
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,000
<music>Bee Gees: Stayin' Alive</music>

303
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,781
How about that music?
<music>Bee Gees: Stayin' Alive</music>

304
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,593
- Fine.
- Great beat.

305
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:34,526
- Yes.
- Hidden speakers. Quadraphonic.

306
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,163
- Really?
- Yeah, I got it all.

307
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,816
Here we are, foxy loxy.

308
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,717
- Gloria.
- Gloria.

309
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:41,194
- Tastes like Tabasco.
- It's called Spanish fly.

310
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,233
I've never had it before.

311
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,368
Well, I know a few people...

312
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,538
...in Spain.

313
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,776
What about that, then?

314
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,549
- Look, Mr. Tibb...
- Stanley.

315
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,916
Stanley, I hope you don't mind
that I stay here just a moment.

316
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,923
- I just wanna make sure...
- No. No need for explanations.

317
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,789
Listen, as you say over here,

318
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,362
"You're put on this world
to do your thing.

319
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,692
"I'm put on this world
to do my thing.

320
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,097
"And if, perchance, our things...

321
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,731
"...do...

322
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,876
"...meet...

323
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,804
"...that's... That's groovy."

324
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:34,844
- I just wanna look out the window.
- Fine. Fine.

325
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,153
Do you...? Do you mind if I
make myself comfortable?

326
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,188
- Huh? No.
- No!

327
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,319
Do you have any binoculars?

328
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,615
What'd you say? Binoculars?

329
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,156
Are you into that too? Me as well.

330
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,591
<i>I read about it in Penthouse.
Just a second.</i>

331
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,211
Here you are, sweet thing.

332
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,008
- Thank you.
- Anything you want, doll face.

333
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,309
I got it all.

334
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,269
OK, Gloria!
What are we waiting for?

335
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,813
Oh, my God!

336
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,210
What's the matter, baby?

337
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,114
Well, what is this?
What are you doing?

338
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,448
Why are you undressed?

339
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,395
I don't believe it!
Did you think that I...?

340
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,258
Didn't you want to...?

341
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,956
Stanley, really.

342
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,898
- Where did you get the idea that...?
- It was just a bit of fun.

343
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,072
You know, a... A few laughs.

344
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,266
- What's this on the wall?
- That is... nothing.

345
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,810
It's... a training film.
It's purely educational.

346
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,379
- And what's over here?
- Oh, God!

347
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,915
Oh, my God. Did you...?
Where did you find all this stuff?

348
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,984
I'm sorry, I don't do this very often.

349
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,748
I never knew there was
such diversity.

350
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,859
- Please come back!
- It's amazing, just amazing.

351
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,052
- I got this for my nieces.
- Oh...

352
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,495
- No, I... I borrowed it for a party.
- Here, here, let me do that for you.

353
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,331
- Maybe I should call you a cab.
- Yes, please.

354
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,784
Mr. Hennesey?

355
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,638
<i>Formal sentencing
will be in two weeks.</i>

356
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,751
<i>It's expected he will be given
the maximum penalty.</i>

357
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,354
<i>Continuing on his international
goodwill tour, Pope Pius Xlll</i>

358
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,855

an informal visit with the president.</i>

359
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,893
<i>The two talked for more than an hour,
after which the pontiff was honored</i>

361
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,302
<i>nearly every major dignitary

362
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,575
<i>... world peace and
universal brotherhood.</i>

363

<i>Next up, the vice president

364
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,713
<i>But first, this message.</i>

365
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,323
<i>Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
Oh, what a relief it is</i>

366

<i>Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
Oh, what a relief it is</i>

367
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,494
Come over here.

368
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,330
Where is it?

369
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,199
- Where is it?
- What?

370
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,108
Lady... I don't want any trouble.

371
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,383
Just give me what
Scott gave you yesterday.

372
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,943
But he gave me nothing.

373
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,946
What did he give you in the car?

374
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,191
I swear he gave me nothing
except a pack of cigarettes.

375
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,786
- Where are they?
- In my purse.

376
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,527
Where's your purse? Where?

377
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,600
Over there, on the couch.

378
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,134
OK, stay.

379
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,657
No...

380
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,766
Hello? Police?

381
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,800
Oh, something terrible's happened.
What?

382
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,167
A murder. I wanna report a murder.

383
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,366
Oh, all right, but hurry!

384
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,370
Hello? Yes.

385
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,210
A man broke into my apartment,
and I think I've killed him!

386
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,944
Well, no.

387
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,021
No, it happened just now.

388
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,557
Just now, I came home
and he was here.

389
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,654
What? What?

390
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,925
Oh, all right, I'll hold on,
but hurry!

391
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,201
Gloria Mundy.

392
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,277
430 Vallejo, second-floor apartment.
Please, come right away...

393
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,980
Oh, no!

394
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,020
No! No!

395
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,556
Hello. How you feeling?

396
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,453
You. What are you doing here?

397
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,953
They're from the police.
Are you all right?

398
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,824
I'm inspector Ferguson, ma'am,

399
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,592
and this is my sometime partner,
Lieutenant Carlson.

400
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,530
They said you'd called about a murder.

401
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,035
I had to break the lock.

402
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,139
The body! Where's the body?

403
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,401
- What body?
- The dead body!

404
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,875
It was right there!
Didn't you see it?

405
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,672
Who?

406
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,241
And the phone...

407
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,713
And the window...

408
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,117
Oh, my God, it happened again.

409
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,920
- What's happened again?
- Just like last night.

410
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,223
- Just like in the movie theater.
- What?

411
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,765
The dead body.
It's gone! It vanished!

412
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,561
Well, maybe it was embarrassed.

413
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,069
Come on in here.
I think you better sit down.

414
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,709
But you don't understand.
The body has disappeared.

415
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,901
- Whose body was it?
- I don't know.

416
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,477
A man with a scar.

417
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,275
He tried to murder me,
but I stabbed him with the needles.

418
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,007
Oh, narcotics, huh?

419
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,119
No, knitting. And...

420
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,847
Oh, I put them back in the basket.

421
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,549
And the poker too.
Or did you do that?

422
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,694
Hey, relax.

423
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,896
All we did was get
an emergency call on a homicide.

424
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,591
We got here, broke in the door
with your landlord,

425
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,771
and found you unconscious
on the kitchen floor.

426
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,537
I carried you to the couch...

427
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,104
- You carried me?
- Yes.

428
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,701
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

429
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:37,108
And you woke up insisting
that there's a dead body around here.

430
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,713
Look, I know it sounds strange,
but somebody cleaned the place up.

431
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,355
- And took away the dead body?
- Right.

432
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,421
Wait a minute!

433
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,788
I've got it!
It must have been the albino.

434
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,792
Who's the albino?

435
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,896
He's the one who killed
the man with the scar.

436
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,627
You said you killed
the man with the scar.

437
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,601
I did. Except he killed him
after I killed him.

438
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,800
See, I didn't really kill him.
I just stabbed him with the needles.

439
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,445
Right after he heard the cuckoo.

440
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,928
Oh, you don't believe me, do you?

441
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,294
But it's true. It really happened.

442
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,333
You believe me, don't you,
Mr. Hennesey?

443
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,301
My darling, if you believe it,
I believe it.

444
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,374
There's some very
mixed-up people out there.

445
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,739
They're puny spirits with small minds.

446
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,506
Like that man told you
in the movies last night,

447
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:49,174
"Beware of the midgets.
They're taking over the world."

448
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,388
Mr. Hennesey, he didn't.
He said, "Beware of the dwarf!"

449
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,683
A dwarf?

450
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,128
Well, whatever. Now,
you're not to worry about anything.

451
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,493
I'm here to make sure
that you're safe. In fact...

452
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,068
...l'm going to put a brand-new lock
on this door, right now.

453
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,636
A big one, yeah.

454
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,737
Oh, he doesn't believe me.

455
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,809
He thinks I've been dreaming
or something.

456
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,877
Don't be silly.

457
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,579
Gloria...

458
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,848
...did you drop acid
a little earlier tonight?

459
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:31,253
No. No, you don't understand!
A man tried to kill me here tonight.

460
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,089
- The albino?
- No, no!

461
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,265
- The man with the scar?
- Yes!

462
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,400
See, the albino tried to kill me earlier,

463
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,092
- but I smashed him with my umbrella.
- Your umbrella?

464
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,034
I'd never met
the man with the scar before.

465
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,198
Unless he's the one that was driving
that black limousine.

466
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,008
Why did he wanna kill you?

467
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,840
- Who?
- Man with the scar.

468
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,108
I'm not sure, but I think it was
because of the cigarettes.

469
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,950
- He wanted a cigarette, or...?
- No, he wanted the whole pack.

470
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,350
Kind of greedy.

471
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,217
The albino must have wanted
the cigarettes too.

472
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,461
So he killed the man with the scar
to get them.

473
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,891
Right.

474
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,793
And I'll bet he's the one
who killed Scotty.

475
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,034
- Scotty?
- Who's Scotty?

476
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,939
Look, Gloria...

477
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,942
...I know you've been through
something here tonight,

478
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,271
real or imagined. But I just wanna
bring you down to earth a bit.

479
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,213
You gotta see how absurd
this whole thing is.

480
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,817
We have no dead body,
there's been no sign of violence.

481
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,651
Our suspects are albinos
and chain-smokers.

482
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,617
Wait a minute! I've got it!

483
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,292
The albino is working for the dwarf.

484
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,162
I tell you, I've been on some dumb calls
in my time, but this one tops them.

485
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,805
Where'd you meet
this ding-dong, anyway?

486
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,770
What's all that stuff about
having her for lunch

487
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,272
down at the station house tomorrow?

488
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,445
You're not even supposed to be
riding around with me.

489
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,171
- It's fate, Fergie. Kismet.
- Kismet, my ass.

490
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,850
- Listen, this girl is weird, Tony.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

491
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,019
But she's got the prettiest green eyes
I've ever seen.

492
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,380
Yeah, they're blue.

493
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:08,217
And behind those blue eyes is
a fruitcake with a homicidal umbrella.

494
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,722
- Wait a minute!
- What?

495
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,724
You have the prettiest
green eyes I've ever seen.

496
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,453
Cut that out.
I hate it when you do that.

497
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,689
- Don't do that anymore, all right?
- Let's go, beautiful.

498
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,794
Gloria, I don't believe you.

499
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,697
How can you be so gullible?

500
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,203
You have got albinos chasing you
down the street,

501
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,401
prowlers breaking into your apartment.
Don't you see?

502
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,409
They're only after one thing.

503
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:34,175
- They wanna get into your pants.
- I don't think so.

504
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,443
And now you have this cop
inviting you

505
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,554
down to the station house
on your lunch hour.

506
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,281
Do you think he's not gonna try
for a little nookie?

507
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,925
He's really nice.

508
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,721
- Gloria, I'm your friend, right?
- Right.

509
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,364
And I wouldn't steer you wrong,
would I?

510
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,193
No.

511
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,108
Take these.

512
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:10,582
Without them, you are a walking
light bulb waiting to be screwed.

513
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,826
Let's see. One, two, five, six.

514
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,428
Six.

515
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:45,895
They used to have the most
beautiful dude ranch near Phoenix.

516
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,265
"Happy Trails", I think they called it.

517
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,770
Of course, this was before the war.

518
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:58,573
Here we are, with a 13
and a Double Word Score.

519
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:03,486
- That makes 26.
- Twenty-six.

520
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,608
<i>Ever see that Arizona Highways?</i>

521
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,981
Oh, it is the most beautiful magazine,
isn't it?

522
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,985
Let me see, now...

523
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:45,493
One, two, seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11, four... 15.

524
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,364
Such lovely pictures.
I wonder if they still put it out.

525
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,267
Why, I see them now and again
at the library.

526
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,533
And here we go.

527
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,739
Eight, nine, ten, 11...
And double that...

528
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,678
We have 15, we have 26,
and double is...

529
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,681
- Fifty-two!
- Wait, Elsie.

530
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,080
I think you're wrong.

531
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,381
I think you spell that word
with a hyphen.

532
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,992
Really?

533
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,689
I was just taking a shot.

534
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,462
There she is!

535
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,583
Oh, no.

536
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,854
Oh, yes. They tried it again.

537
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,526
Gloria, just sit back and enjoy the fire.

538
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,001
I'm pouring you a nice,
warm albino martini.

539
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,145
Here you go.
Drink this, and it's off to bed.

540
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,979
You should have been a doctor.

541
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,815
OK, we'll play whatever you like.

542
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,020
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

543
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,294
You know, it's funny.
My father was a doctor.

544
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:30,125
- Wanted me to be one too.
- What happened?

545
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,062
Well, I went to medical school.

546
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,362
It was tough. All those books.

547
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,267
Then I joined the paramedics.
That was tougher.

548
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,407
Besides... I always had a yearning
for the criminal life.

549
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:45,177
- But you're a cop.
- Same difference.

550
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,943
- How's the milk?
- It's great.

551
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,282
- Lieutenant...
- Tony.

552
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,513
I don't understand.

553
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,551
Last night, you didn't believe
the story I told you, did you?

554
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,792
- I believed that you believed it.
- What about tonight?

555
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,486
Did you believe I was kidnapped?

556
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,394
I know the address of the building
they held me in.

557
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,631
- It seems that...
- Look,

558
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:09,100
I promise I'll check that out
first thing in the morning.

559
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,740
And the license plate
of the black limousine, 121 TCE.

560
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,967
- Got it.
- Tony, I'm not lying.

561
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,978
No one thinks you are.

562
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,309
Why would anybody wanna kill me?

563
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,677
Hey.

564
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,020
Come on.

565
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,347
You're safe here.

566
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,385
I checked all the windows
and the doors, everything.

567
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,687
You trust me, don't you?

568
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,291
Here, finish your milk.

569
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,605
Good girl. Full?

570
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,444
- Feel better, don't you?
- Yes.

571
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,846
I'll call you tomorrow.

572
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,516
Oh, I'm not working tomorrow.
I'm home.

573
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,379
Fine.

574
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,386
Would you like me to carry you
to your bedroom?

575
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,458
No, thanks. I can walk.

576
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,126
OK, then I'm gonna take off.

577
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,151
Don't worry, Gloria.

578
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,661
If there really is somebody out there
trying to kill you,

579
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,993
I promise you,
we'll find out who and why.

580
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,453
Well, the room checks out.
Nobody up there.

581
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,687
Landlord said it's been
empty for months.

582
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,732
It's rented on a yearly basis
to a guy called... Stiltskin.

583
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,362
Stiltskin...

584
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,302
I've heard that name
somewhere before.

585
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,283
Oh, no.

586
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:04,681
I thought when you were suspended,
I'd have a three-week vacation.

587
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,116
I was framed.

588
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,449
You're lucky you've still got
your badge.

589
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,491
Arresting the mayor for speeding
and then cuffing him.

590
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:12,922
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,154
I'm telling you,
he was wearing eye makeup.

592
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,855
Get out of here!

593
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,931
Hey, listen, this is serious.

594
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,296
What was that story,
wasn't too long ago,

595
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,836
about a guy named Stiltskin?

596
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,371
You been talking to Donahue?

597
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,304
No, why?

598
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,345
You know this guy?

599
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,214
Yeah, I've seen him around.
Works undercover, right?

600
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,750
He did. His name's Bob Scott.

601
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,722
And we just fished his body
out of the bay.

602
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,652
Scotty.

603
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,260
Yeah, he was working on a tip
that a major assassination

604
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,829
is gonna take place here
in the city, Thursday night.

605
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,398
- Tomorrow night.
- The biggest hit man west of Chicago

606
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,296
has been hired for the job.

607
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,300
His name is Stiltskin,

608
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,267
Rupert Stiltskin.

609
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,269
Stiltskin?

610
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,774
Yeah, alias "The Dwarf".

611
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,603
Holy shit.

612
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,546
Oh, no. He's nice, really.

613
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,119
He brought me home
last night, and...

614
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,656
And then he had the police bring
my car back this morning.

615
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,294
- Who is it?
- Special delivery.

616
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,092
Just a second, Stella.
Somebody's at the door.

617
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,696
- Miss Mundy?
- Yes.

618
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,772
Just a moment.

619
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,673
Hiya, toots.

620
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,041
I've been looking forward
to this meeting for some time.

621
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,978
- You... You're a dwarf.
- True, true.

622
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,849
J.J. MacKuen's my name,
and life's my game.

623
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,684
Not life insurance,
but life everlasting.

624
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,421
Interested?

625
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,256
- Oh, my God.
- Sure you are.

626
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,829
Please. If I'm gonna do this right,

627
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,435
I've got to have
your undivided attention.

628
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,201
She'll call you right back.

629
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,807
You... You're the dwarf.

630
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,708
Well, actually, we prefer
to be called "little people".

631
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,008
It was you who was asking for me
at the library.

632
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,880
True, true. But, unfortunately,
our paths didn't cross.

633
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,486
No matter.

634
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,680
Today, I have brought with me
a little present

635
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,018
that my employer wants you to have.

636
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,757
And all that is required of you

637
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,562
is to consider the possibility
of coming closer to God.

638
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,000
Keep away from me!

639
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,004
Miss Mundy, why take this attitude?

640
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,973
I'm merely a salesman
of the divine Word.

641
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,613
Look upon me as an instrument

642
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,680
who will release you
from the worries of the world

643
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,785
and bring you the promise
of eternal rest.

644
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,454
Keep away from me.

645
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,253
Miss Mundy...

646
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,924
...do you believe in life after death?

647
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,251
Somebody help me!

648
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,265
Stop this thing!

649
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,734
Please, help! Oh, my goodness.

650
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,275
- Gloria.
- Tony!

651
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,377
Gloria, what are you doing?

652
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,193
Did you see him? That was him.
That was the dwarf.

653
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,694
That's who Scotty told me about.

654
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,893
He tried to kill me.

655
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,692
Oh, I knew he was out to get...

656
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:26,810
<i>"The new American Bible.
The translation you can believe in.</i>

657
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,881
"J.J. MacKuen."

658
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,015
Oh, he was a Bible salesman?

659
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,820
You mean I...?

660
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,390
That's right, honey.

661
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,118
You have attacked
an innocent dwarf.

662
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:53,142
X-ray technician, please call
extension...

663
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,444
Mr. MacKuen?

664
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,247
It's Gloria Mundy.

665
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,079
- Who?
- Remember me?

666
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,654
You came to see me this morning.

667
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,287
Oh.

668
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,019
How are you feeling?

669
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,025
So-so.

670
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:17,627
Thanks for the flowers.

671
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,665
Oh, that's all right.

672
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,427
My pleasure.

673
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,628
Here, I bought you some more.

674
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,603
I felt it was the least I could do.

675
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,749
I'm awfully sorry.

676
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,362
Well, I was thinking
of leaving the job anyway.

677
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,929
Oh, really?

678
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,192
Yeah, I never should have taken it.

679
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:56,167
I'm too pushy. I annoy people.
That's my personality.

680
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,440
And you can't move merchandise
like that anymore.

681
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:03,376
They... They look like
lovely Bibles to me.

682
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,137
Oh, they're top quality.

683
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,339
It's me that's no good.

684
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,142
I come off too strong.

685
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,455
Well, you did give me quite a shock.

686
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,122
You don't have to apologize.

687
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,952
I'm a putz.

688
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,552
Oh, no, Mr. MacKuen.

689
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,325
I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

690
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,436
Well, maybe everything
will turn out for the best.

691
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,866
Really.

692
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:33,701
I always feel that you can see
a positive side to everything.

693
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,476
Yeah. I was thinking of opening up
a gas station in the desert

694
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,581
and I think you helped me
make up my mind.

695
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,243
I'm so glad I could help.

696
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,691
Oh, no!

697
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

698
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,724
I was just gonna kill a fly.

699
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,300
I'm sorry.

700
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,939
- Well, I guess I better be going.
- OK.

701
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,674
I'll come back tomorrow after work.

702
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,539
Oh, no, no. I'm sure I'm gonna
be out of here by tomorrow.

703
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,581
Oh.

704
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,216
All right.

705
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:20,984
Well,

706
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,648
it was nice meeting you again. Bye.

707
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,567
Oh, that poor little man.

708
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,894
To think that I was responsible,

709
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,971
that I was capable,

710
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,575
that all that violence is within me.

711
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,472
Yeah, I know.

712
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,546
And lucky for him,
you didn't have your umbrella.

713
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,741
Come on, let's go.
Tony's waiting for you at the station.

714
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,044
Gloria, I need your help.

715
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,848
Somebody's gonna
be murdered tomorrow night,

716
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,649
and we gotta prevent it.

717
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,892
I want you to take a look
at something.

718
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,992
- You recognize these people?
- That's the man with the scar.

719
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,827
- Right.
- That's the albino.

720
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,730
Right, his name is Whitey Jackson.

721
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:11,625
- I don't know.
- That's Rupert Stiltskin,

722
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:14,694
alias "The Dwarf". He's the head
of the assassination team.

723
01:05:15,264 --> 01:05:17,528
Scarface wanted to
double-cross his buddies

724
01:05:17,733 --> 01:05:20,964
and gave Scotty some evidence
about tomorrow's job.

725
01:05:21,437 --> 01:05:24,099
They found out about it,
killed Scotty.

726
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:26,440
Scarface wanted to protect himself.

727
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:27,973
Tried to get the evidence back.

728
01:05:28,177 --> 01:05:30,737
But they were onto him.
They killed him.

729
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,472
So the evidence was in the cigarette
package that Scotty gave me.

730
01:05:34,683 --> 01:05:36,480
- Right.
- Well, but they took

731
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:38,915
the cigarette pack when
they took Scarface's body.

732
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:41,316
- Right.
- Then what do they still want me for?

733
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,758
I don't know, but they do.

734
01:05:43,959 --> 01:05:45,756
And that's why I've been assigned
to protect you.

735
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:47,485
You have?

736
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,062
Well, what does that entail?

737
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,062
The usual.

738
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:57,137
We move into your house,
set up a round-the-clock surveillance

739
01:05:57,339 --> 01:05:58,567
and send out for pizza.

740
01:06:01,277 --> 01:06:03,245
I traced the number
on that black limousine.

741
01:06:03,612 --> 01:06:04,874
- Great!
- What is it?

742
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,342
You're not gonna like it.

743
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:09,312
It's registered to the archbishop
of San Francisco.

744
01:06:17,293 --> 01:06:18,692
Fancy layout.

745
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:24,422
- Yes?
- Lieutenant Carlson, ma'am.

746
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:25,930
Is Archbishop Thorncrest in?

747
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:27,693
Just wanna ask him
a couple of questions.

748
01:06:28,103 --> 01:06:29,365
Certainly.

749
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:31,004
Won't you please come in?

750
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:32,434
That's right.

751
01:06:32,641 --> 01:06:36,543
We really expect almost everyone to be
seated when the motorcade arrives.

752
01:06:36,745 --> 01:06:38,007
Of course.

753
01:06:38,213 --> 01:06:39,612
Exactly.

754
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:42,283
Well, thank you.
And thank you so much for calling.

755
01:06:42,718 --> 01:06:43,946
Goodbye.

756
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:47,045
Good afternoon.

757
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:49,190
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry to bother you.

758
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:51,359
I'm Lieutenant Carlson.
This is Inspector Ferguson.

759
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,027
This is Miss Mundy.

760
01:06:53,228 --> 01:06:55,856
Very happy to meet you.
Please, sit down.

761
01:06:57,733 --> 01:07:00,327
Now, what is it
I can do for you?

762
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:02,766
We're investigating
a black limousine...

763
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:04,563
Oh, you found the car.

764
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:06,001
Good news.

765
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,369
- Did you catch that rascal, Turk?
- Who?

766
01:07:08,577 --> 01:07:10,306
Turk Farnum,
the man who stole the car.

767
01:07:10,512 --> 01:07:11,740
Don't tell me he got away.

768
01:07:12,114 --> 01:07:14,082
We've had no report
that the car was stolen.

769
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,084
No report? But yesterday I...

770
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,585
- Miss Casswell?
- I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

771
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:24,554
I thought I'd give him
one more day to come back.

772
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,285
- After all, he's such a...
- Really, Miss Casswell.

773
01:07:27,496 --> 01:07:30,192
The car has been gone two days.

774
01:07:30,399 --> 01:07:33,835
Now, I think somewhere we have to
draw the line on christian charity.

775
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:38,139
Could you describe this Turk?

776
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:40,940
- Large, heavyset.
- Bald?

777
01:07:41,143 --> 01:07:43,475
Yes. He came to us
as a chauffeur about...

778
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:47,214
- What was it? Three months ago?
- Yes.

779
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:49,646
From St. Damien's halfway house.

780
01:07:50,586 --> 01:07:52,781
You see, he's an ex-convict.

781
01:07:54,256 --> 01:07:55,883
We'd have a file on him.

782
01:07:56,091 --> 01:07:58,616
- What's his present address?
- He lived above the garage.

783
01:07:58,827 --> 01:08:01,591
Miss Casswell, why don't you show
the lieutenant Turk's quarters.

784
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:03,128
Maybe they'll come up
with something.

785
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:06,460
Yes, Your Excellency.
Would you come this way, please?

786
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,769
Miss Casswell,
then come right back here.

787
01:08:11,974 --> 01:08:13,441
I want to have a word with you.

788
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:24,378
He was such a nice man.

789
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:29,080
A little simple, perhaps.
But then, he had very little education.

790
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,351
You see, no one
was ever kind to him.

791
01:08:32,561 --> 01:08:35,860
Throughout his whole life,
no one had ever given him a chance.

792
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:39,124
- There's nothing around here, Tony.
- OK.

793
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:42,635
Miss Casswell, does the name
Stiltskin mean anything to you?

794
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:45,636
- No.
- How about Whitey Jackson?

795
01:08:45,841 --> 01:08:50,244
Is he that football player that wears
the pantyhose on television?

796
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:51,811
No.

797
01:08:56,885 --> 01:08:58,546
Well.

798
01:08:58,754 --> 01:09:01,154
Now the shit has really hit the fan.

799
01:09:25,848 --> 01:09:28,908
Oh, Stella, he's not like that at all.

800
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:32,954
- I like him.
- How's he feel about you?

801
01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:35,449
<i>- I think he likes me.
- Oh.</i>

802
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:38,626
That's OK. If they say
"I like you", it's not so bad.

803
01:09:38,827 --> 01:09:41,421
It's when they say "I love you"
that you gotta watch out.

804
01:09:43,432 --> 01:09:44,660
Listen, I have to go.

805
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:46,892
Just have Mrs. Monk see what
she can come up with.

806
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:48,535
They've never heard of it
around here.

807
01:09:48,737 --> 01:09:50,898
OK, Gloria. Be careful.

808
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,233
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

809
01:09:54,243 --> 01:09:58,907
Mrs. Monk, what do you know about
the Tax the Churches League?

810
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:04,517
Well, I'm calling it a day.

811
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,312
Any more news on Turk?

812
01:10:06,522 --> 01:10:09,355
We've checked everything on his file.
All known associates,

813
01:10:09,558 --> 01:10:13,016
places he frequents, clubs, bars...
Nothing so far.

814
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:15,253
Well, I just asked
my girlfriend at the library

815
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:17,364
to find out about the
Tax the Churches League.

816
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:19,329
That's a funny group
for Turk to belong to.

817
01:10:19,535 --> 01:10:22,800
Hey, I play detective.
You play lady in distress.

818
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:25,599
Hey, wait a minute.
It's my ass they're after.

819
01:10:25,807 --> 01:10:27,798
I'm sorry. You're right.

820
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,639
That was a stupid, glib,
chauvinist remark and I apologize.

821
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:34,907
It is your ass they're after,

822
01:10:35,117 --> 01:10:38,143
and it's my job to see to it
that I get there first.

823
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:42,616
What do you say to two juicy steaks
and a bottle of wine?

824
01:10:43,258 --> 01:10:45,158
Well, you could start
by saying "hello".

825
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:48,323
I'm gonna take you home.

826
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:53,729
OK, Fergie, listen.
If anything should come up,

827
01:10:53,936 --> 01:10:57,565
you know where to get ahold of me.
Right. Good night.

828
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,372
Hey, this is the way to the bridge.

829
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:02,669
I thought you said you were
gonna take me home.

830
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:04,470
I did.

831
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,238
My home.

832
01:11:15,591 --> 01:11:17,786
Oh, you're really full of surprises.

833
01:11:17,993 --> 01:11:20,860
I never met anybody who ever lived
on a houseboat before.

834
01:11:21,063 --> 01:11:22,325
That's fantastic.

835
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:25,329
Well, my brother built it,

836
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:27,661
and when he got married,
I moved in.

837
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:29,666
It's so beautiful here.

838
01:11:29,871 --> 01:11:32,635
Yeah, on a clear day
you can see Alcatraz.

839
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:34,069
How nice.

840
01:11:34,843 --> 01:11:36,435
Be careful here.
It's very slippery at night

841
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:37,873
- on the gangplank.
- OK.

842
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,741
- Hold onto something.
- OK.

843
01:11:47,889 --> 01:11:49,481
You OK?

844
01:12:08,276 --> 01:12:11,302
- Nice fire.
- I just turned on the switch.

845
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,645
- Come here.
- Hey. Hi, little one.

846
01:12:15,851 --> 01:12:18,319
- Hi, little dog.
- Hey, Chaucer, what do you think?

847
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,819
You play your cards right and she'll
take you out for a sea-gull dinner.

848
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:25,192
Chaucer and I, we've been
getting along just great.

849
01:12:25,394 --> 01:12:28,693
- Yeah, he likes you.
- He told me all about Monica.

850
01:12:28,897 --> 01:12:30,694
How do you know about Monica?

851
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,332
I think this is for you.

852
01:12:36,004 --> 01:12:37,232
What is that?

853
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,272
"Darling, you are out of eggs
and cottage cheese.

854
01:12:40,475 --> 01:12:42,272
"I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Love, Monica."

855
01:12:43,412 --> 01:12:46,210
Oh, that Monica. She's my maid.

856
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:47,905
She sounds very efficient.

857
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:49,378
She's terrific.

858
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:52,382
She comes in twice a week
and really clears the decks.

859
01:12:52,788 --> 01:12:54,585
Trims the sails?

860
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,314
Blows the pipes.

861
01:12:57,192 --> 01:12:59,285
How long has she
been doing all this?

862
01:12:59,828 --> 01:13:01,386
Well, she won't be back.

863
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:02,961
Monica drowned this morning, and...

864
01:13:03,165 --> 01:13:04,757
- Just like that, huh?
- Yeah.

865
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:09,403
I think we both knew it was coming,
and it was kind of sad for both of us.

866
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:11,196
Good shot.

867
01:13:11,907 --> 01:13:13,306
How about a joint?

868
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:15,475
No, thanks.

869
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:18,009
You sure? You know what they say,

870
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:19,874
"Cops have the best dope."

871
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:22,050
No, I don't do that anymore.

872
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,683
I don't think it's necessary.

873
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,948
Right.

874
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:27,883
Just testing.

875
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,921
Never touch it myself.

876
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,353
Not me, nope.

877
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:34,858
You're funny.

878
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:38,761
And you have the prettiest
green eyes I've ever seen.

879
01:13:40,435 --> 01:13:42,869
They're blue. Drink your milk.

880
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:05,351
So go on.

881
01:14:06,128 --> 01:14:07,993
What happened after the divorce?

882
01:14:08,196 --> 01:14:12,565
Nothing. I went back
to the library to work...

883
01:14:13,268 --> 01:14:16,066
...and I guess I did become
kind of a hermit.

884
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:18,762
My girlfriend Sally,
she's getting married on Saturday.

885
01:14:18,974 --> 01:14:21,238
Oh, you know her.
The one at the party.

886
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:24,469
Oh, yeah. The one that kept
telling you to start taking chances.

887
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:26,613
Right. Look what happens.

888
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:28,680
Oh, it didn't work out so bad.

889
01:14:28,884 --> 01:14:30,078
I almost got killed.

890
01:14:30,285 --> 01:14:33,686
Well, yeah, but you met some
pretty interesting people.

891
01:14:35,524 --> 01:14:36,752
True.

892
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,858
I guess you can't trust
first impressions.

893
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:41,558
What does that mean?

894
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:44,989
Well, when I first met you -

895
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,067
- I thought you were a bore.
- Yeah?

896
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,504
- What about before that?
- Before that?

897
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:53,934
Yeah, when you first saw me.

898
01:14:54,509 --> 01:14:57,034
I thought you were a klutz.

899
01:14:58,146 --> 01:15:00,273
And what about before that?

900
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:03,076
- Before...?
- Yeah, when you very first

901
01:15:03,285 --> 01:15:06,118
laid eyes on me.
What were you thinking?

902
01:15:06,655 --> 01:15:09,453
I thought you...

903
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:11,853
I thought you had a nice smile.

904
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,687
You did?

905
01:15:13,895 --> 01:15:15,294
What else?

906
01:15:17,165 --> 01:15:18,826
I...

907
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:22,067
I thought you were cute.

908
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,635
What else?

909
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:25,306
Oh...

910
01:15:25,507 --> 01:15:28,032
What did you think of me
when you first met me?

911
01:15:28,243 --> 01:15:30,404
When you first laid eyes on me?

912
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,777
I thought...

913
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:37,211
I thought you had a nice smile.

914
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,710
What else?

915
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,282
I thought you were cute.

916
01:15:44,492 --> 01:15:46,483
Extremely cute.

917
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:49,963
What else?

918
01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:54,159
I thought it would be nice
to kiss you.

919
01:15:55,704 --> 01:15:59,071
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

920
01:15:59,274 --> 01:16:01,265
- Me too.
- You did?

921
01:16:01,843 --> 01:16:03,640
Then? Right then?

922
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,071
Thought it would be nice to kiss you.

923
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:13,520
See?

924
01:16:14,256 --> 01:16:17,123
You should always trust
your first impressions.

925
01:16:19,995 --> 01:16:21,223
You know something?

926
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:25,126
I'm really glad that you were
assigned to protect me.

927
01:16:26,301 --> 01:16:28,531
I do my job pretty well.

928
01:16:29,738 --> 01:16:32,070
You do your job very well.

929
01:16:33,008 --> 01:16:34,532
Thank you.

930
01:17:30,398 --> 01:17:32,423
Hey, Chaucer,

931
01:17:32,634 --> 01:17:33,896
how you doing?

932
01:17:34,102 --> 01:17:36,662
That's a boy. Go on.
Go make breakfast.

933
01:17:40,608 --> 01:17:42,075
Good morning.

934
01:17:42,277 --> 01:17:43,801
Good morning.

935
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:45,912
You look very pretty.

936
01:17:46,114 --> 01:17:47,604
Come here.

937
01:17:56,224 --> 01:17:59,489
- I could get used to this.
- Me too.

938
01:18:06,434 --> 01:18:07,901
Yello.

939
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:10,367
Hi, Fergie.

940
01:18:10,872 --> 01:18:12,169
What?

941
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,142
All right, tell Coleman
I'll be there right away.

942
01:18:16,344 --> 01:18:18,539
Listen, you meet me at Gloria's.

943
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:20,510
I want you to stay with her all day.

944
01:18:20,715 --> 01:18:21,807
Right. Bye.

945
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:25,282
- Come on. I'm taking you home.
- I have to go to work today.

946
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,546
No, you're not.
Fergie's gonna stay with you all day.

947
01:18:27,756 --> 01:18:30,224
We may have a lead.
I think they got Scarface.

948
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,103
What's happening?

949
01:18:48,309 --> 01:18:50,368
- Recognize the corpse?
- Scarface?

950
01:18:50,578 --> 01:18:52,307
Yeah, we found him over there.

951
01:18:52,514 --> 01:18:54,573
An early-morning fisherman
spotted him.

952
01:18:54,783 --> 01:18:56,751
- Anything on the body?
- Nothing.

953
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:58,350
I guess it's back to basics.

954
01:18:58,553 --> 01:19:00,521
Search the area, try to find
some witnesses, huh?

955
01:19:00,722 --> 01:19:02,212
Yeah, Morgan's on that.

956
01:19:02,424 --> 01:19:05,154
I don't mind telling you, Tony,
that this one's got me scared.

957
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,191
An assassination
is gonna take place tonight,

958
01:19:07,395 --> 01:19:09,158
and we're digging up
nothing on nothing.

959
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:10,695
I know.

960
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,791
There's gotta be
something somewhere.

961
01:19:14,769 --> 01:19:16,862
What is it? What's the clue?

962
01:19:17,072 --> 01:19:18,471
What have we overlooked?

963
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:23,699
I thought Sergeant Ferguson
was supposed to be here.

964
01:19:23,912 --> 01:19:25,777
- He was.
- Well, why is it...?

965
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,607
Esme.

966
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,615
Esme.

967
01:19:30,985 --> 01:19:32,213
Come on.

968
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,412
We'll get you out of here.
How about that, huh?

969
01:19:35,924 --> 01:19:39,155
How'd you like to take a little bath?
Would you like that?

970
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,158
How'd you like a little soak
in the bathtub?

971
01:19:43,932 --> 01:19:47,163
- What do you think?
- Oh, my darling. My dear.

972
01:19:47,368 --> 01:19:50,235
I'd have never had me a daughter,
but if I did,

973
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:51,735
I'd want her to be you.

974
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,938
Oh, Mr. Hennesey, that's sweet.

975
01:19:55,143 --> 01:19:56,906
Well, this is my bridesmaid's dress.

976
01:19:57,245 --> 01:19:59,679
And look, I just do that

977
01:19:59,881 --> 01:20:02,372
and goodbye, bridesmaids,

978
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:04,415
and I'm ready for a night
out on the town.

979
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:07,352
I think I'd rather see you as a bride.

980
01:20:08,523 --> 01:20:12,459
- I'm working on it.
- Come on. Gonna take a little swim.

981
01:20:14,963 --> 01:20:16,191
Hello?

982
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:17,830
Fergie.

983
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,696
Yes, if Tony wants me to,
I'll be there.

984
01:20:21,903 --> 01:20:23,370
What's the address?

985
01:20:27,442 --> 01:20:29,808
If it's that important,
I'll come right away.

986
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:31,911
What? Bring my umbrella?

987
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:34,013
But it's beautiful outside.

988
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:35,977
Hello?

989
01:20:36,184 --> 01:20:37,549
Hello?

990
01:20:38,953 --> 01:20:40,181
He hung up.

991
01:20:40,388 --> 01:20:43,619
I wasn't trying anything. I just told her
what you told me to tell her.

992
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:46,089
Watch your mouth.
Watch it.

993
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:34,641
Hello?

994
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:44,182
Anybody here?

995
01:21:53,294 --> 01:21:55,023
Tony?

996
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:57,123
Fergie?

997
01:21:57,332 --> 01:21:59,163
Run, Gloria. It's a trap!

998
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:08,604
Let go of me!

999
01:22:30,164 --> 01:22:33,497
- She got away.
- Oh, goddamn it.

1000
01:22:33,701 --> 01:22:35,191
Get her.

1001
01:22:45,146 --> 01:22:46,977
Hello there, can I help you?

1002
01:22:47,181 --> 01:22:49,911
- Just a minute.
- We're having a special today.

1003
01:22:50,118 --> 01:22:52,484
- A rub in a whirlpool.
- No, no. Listen...

1004
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:55,986
Pay for one and you get one free.

1005
01:23:04,766 --> 01:23:07,098
Excuse me.
This will just take a second.

1006
01:23:08,536 --> 01:23:10,663
Take your time, pussy pie.

1007
01:23:10,872 --> 01:23:13,397
We've got all day
for an afternoon's delight.

1008
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:17,735
<i>I feel the earth move
Under my feet</i>

1009
01:23:17,945 --> 01:23:21,813
<i>I feel the sky tumbling down
A- tumbling down</i>

1010
01:23:22,016 --> 01:23:25,713
<i>I just lose control</i>

1011
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,616
Oh, sing it, Stanley, baby.

1012
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:33,186
<i>Down to my very soul
I just...</i>

1013
01:23:35,196 --> 01:23:37,289
Oh, my God, it's you.

1014
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:39,193
Why? Why are you following me?

1015
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,265
Why? What have I
ever done to you?

1016
01:23:41,469 --> 01:23:43,664
Stanley! What are you doing here?

1017
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:46,738
- Never mind. You've gotta help me.
- Oh, please.

1018
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:50,104
Please, don't tell anybody
you saw me here. It's my first time.

1019
01:23:50,311 --> 01:23:52,802
I swear. I'll never do it again.
I promise.

1020
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:54,242
Be quiet.

1021
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:56,644
What's so bad, anyway?

1022
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:58,944
I didn't do anything.

1023
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,848
I never do anything.

1024
01:24:01,055 --> 01:24:02,750
Stanley, listen to me.
You've gotta help me.

1025
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,983
Help you?
I don't know this place.

1026
01:24:06,194 --> 01:24:08,788
But it's a matter of life and death.
It's very important.

1027
01:24:08,996 --> 01:24:10,463
What do you want me to do?

1028
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:12,656
Hey, give me that.

1029
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:15,067
There's a phone out by the pool.

1030
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:17,396
Go out there and call the police.

1031
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:19,129
The police?

1032
01:24:19,607 --> 01:24:22,371
- Oh, my God, the police?
- Yes, tell them to get here right away.

1033
01:24:22,577 --> 01:24:24,807
- Tell them to raid the place.
- A raid?

1034
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,749
You want me to go and call for a raid?
Are you crazy?

1035
01:24:30,952 --> 01:24:32,852
Do you know what
they would do to me?

1036
01:24:33,054 --> 01:24:34,646
The headlines. Hey!

1037
01:24:34,856 --> 01:24:38,758
Listen. Many lives are in danger.
My life, your life.

1038
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,621
There are men out there
who are killers.

1039
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:44,161
What? But why me?
They don't know me.

1040
01:24:44,365 --> 01:24:45,923
I'm not even using
my real name.

1041
01:24:46,134 --> 01:24:48,227
Take this dime.
Now, get out there and call the police.

1042
01:24:48,436 --> 01:24:50,063
You don't have to be here
when they get here.

1043
01:24:50,805 --> 01:24:52,500
Go on. Go and I'll keep
an eye on your clothes.

1044
01:24:52,707 --> 01:24:54,265
But I can't do it.

1045
01:24:54,475 --> 01:24:57,603
God. Never do it again.

1046
01:25:07,455 --> 01:25:08,888
Hello.

1047
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:10,648
Yeah, well...

1048
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:13,920
Yeah, I'd like to see...

1049
01:25:14,128 --> 01:25:15,459
Could you get me the police?

1050
01:25:23,037 --> 01:25:24,504
Help!

1051
01:25:27,675 --> 01:25:30,769
- It's a matter of life and death.
- Tell Tony Carlson! Tell Lieutenant...

1052
01:25:30,978 --> 01:25:33,003
Hey, hey. What's...?

1053
01:25:33,214 --> 01:25:34,977
What are you doing here?

1054
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:36,514
What?

1055
01:25:37,485 --> 01:25:39,282
This is what you want?
All right.

1056
01:25:45,893 --> 01:25:47,258
Thank you very much.

1057
01:25:48,396 --> 01:25:50,591
- Anything from the FBI?
- No, nothing.

1058
01:25:50,798 --> 01:25:52,356
- How about the C.I.I.?
- Nothing.

1059
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:55,161
Nothing. Nothing on nothing.
This is just great.

1060
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:58,361
Are you Tony Carlson,
the cop friend of Gloria's?

1061
01:25:58,573 --> 01:25:59,835
- Yes.
- Well, we found

1062
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,033
this file at the library on
the Tax the Churches League.

1063
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:04,472
I thought I would bring it over.

1064
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:08,513
It has some pictures there,
and Gloria felt maybe it would help...

1065
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:10,415
Wait a minute.

1066
01:26:10,952 --> 01:26:12,385
This is Miss Casswell.

1067
01:26:12,587 --> 01:26:14,214
No, I think that's Delia Darrow.

1068
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:15,889
It says there that
she and her husband

1069
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:19,548
founded the league and then
in 1963 were sent to prison.

1070
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,753
They tried to kidnap the Reverend
Billy Graham. Where's Gloria?

1071
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:26,195
Dickinson, find out everything
you can on this Delia Darrow.

1072
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,628
Right.

1073
01:26:27,835 --> 01:26:30,531
Really, I don't know what happened.
I wasn't doing anything.

1074
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:35,368
Really. Look, I've never been
to one of those places before.

1075
01:26:35,576 --> 01:26:37,407
I thought it was a health club.

1076
01:26:39,313 --> 01:26:41,178
- What weirdoes.
- Look,

1077
01:26:41,382 --> 01:26:42,644
thanks for coming by.

1078
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,442
It's the first real lead
we've had today.

1079
01:26:44,652 --> 01:26:46,244
I will tell Gloria.
She's back at the house.

1080
01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:48,115
No, she's not.

1081
01:26:48,322 --> 01:26:51,621
I spoke with her landlord, and he said
that she left this morning to meet you.

1082
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:53,958
What are you talking about?

1083
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:56,823
That's what he told me.
I expected to see her down here.

1084
01:26:57,031 --> 01:26:58,896
Hey, what... Where you going?

1085
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,364
I didn't... I didn't know
what sort of place it was.

1086
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:03,764
- Who cares?
- Look, of course I paid the money,

1087
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:06,940
but I wanted a massage.
I had this bad back.

1088
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:09,735
I've got this pain up and down here.
All I wanted was a little...

1089
01:27:09,944 --> 01:27:13,971
Hey, watch those hands, buster.

1090
01:27:17,518 --> 01:27:19,076
God.

1091
01:27:19,287 --> 01:27:20,914
- Didn't you get the address?
- No.

1092
01:27:21,122 --> 01:27:23,352
She just said Fergie called
and told her to meet you.

1093
01:27:23,558 --> 01:27:24,786
Come to think of it,

1094
01:27:24,992 --> 01:27:27,460
she was a little puzzled when
he told her to bring her umbrella.

1095
01:27:27,662 --> 01:27:29,129
Damn it, I should have
stayed with her.

1096
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:31,662
Do you think she's been
kidnapped by this fellow, Stiltskin?

1097
01:27:31,866 --> 01:27:33,993
I'm sure of it. But I think I know
where to begin looking.

1098
01:27:34,201 --> 01:27:35,964
Wait!

1099
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,762
If Gloria's in trouble,
I'm going with you.

1100
01:27:37,972 --> 01:27:40,463
No way. I can't be responsible
for your safety too.

1101
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:42,142
Watch.

1102
01:27:45,313 --> 01:27:46,780
Oh, shit!

1103
01:27:51,786 --> 01:27:53,617
Black belt, 1945.

1104
01:27:53,821 --> 01:27:55,379
OK, but hurry up,
we haven't got much time.

1105
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:57,217
- We've gotta get to the archbishop's.
- Esme.

1106
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:59,188
You be a good... Esme!

1107
01:27:59,393 --> 01:28:02,590
How many times have I told you?
Do not eat the cigarettes!

1108
01:28:02,797 --> 01:28:04,424
Come on, let's go.

1109
01:28:04,632 --> 01:28:06,998
Right. Do you think Gloria's
at the archbishop's?

1110
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:08,725
I wouldn't be surprised.

1111
01:28:48,242 --> 01:28:50,176
Hello, Turk. Been looking for you.

1112
01:28:55,783 --> 01:28:58,013
- Very impressive.
- Jungle training.

1113
01:28:58,219 --> 01:29:01,017
Drag him in the bushes.
Meet me around back.

1114
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:45,756
Fergie.

1115
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:48,498
What's that?

1116
01:29:48,703 --> 01:29:50,364
Must be that idiot, Turk.

1117
01:29:50,571 --> 01:29:53,540
God knows what's keeping him.
We're late as it is.

1118
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:04,748
- You all right?
- Tony...

1119
01:30:04,952 --> 01:30:06,419
Tony, you gotta...
You gotta stop them.

1120
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:09,145
- What?
- Stiltskin was hired to kill the pope.

1121
01:30:09,356 --> 01:30:11,415
- The pope?
- At the opera tonight,

1122
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,115
before the reception.

1123
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:15,488
- And the archbishop too?
- That's not the archbishop.

1124
01:30:15,696 --> 01:30:17,323
They killed him.
That's his twin brother.

1125
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:19,362
His twin brother?

1126
01:30:19,567 --> 01:30:20,864
What about Gloria?
Where is she?

1127
01:30:21,068 --> 01:30:23,536
They got her upstairs.
I'm all right. Go on.

1128
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:57,798
Don't move, lieutenant.

1129
01:30:58,005 --> 01:30:59,802
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot.

1130
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:11,115
I don't get this. Stiltskin's dead.
Police know all about you.

1131
01:31:11,318 --> 01:31:13,786
There's no way for your plan
to work now.

1132
01:31:14,255 --> 01:31:16,314
They may know about Delia Darrow,

1133
01:31:16,524 --> 01:31:18,856
and they may find out
about Charlie here,

1134
01:31:19,059 --> 01:31:21,425
but the plan is still gonna work.

1135
01:31:21,629 --> 01:31:23,460
The statement will be made.

1136
01:31:23,664 --> 01:31:25,962
Don't you think we should get out
of here? Turk's disappeared.

1137
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:29,830
- What are we waiting around for?
- All in good time, Charlie.

1138
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:32,034
It's only 6:45.

1139
01:31:33,574 --> 01:31:36,839
The quarry is just entering the trap.

1140
01:32:15,449 --> 01:32:17,940
You see, lieutenant,
your relentless pursuit

1141
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:20,780
forced us to come up
with a contingency plan.

1142
01:32:20,988 --> 01:32:23,013
It is foolproof.

1143
01:32:23,224 --> 01:32:27,320
If by the end of the first act
the pope has not yet been dispatched,

1144
01:32:27,528 --> 01:32:29,962
Whitey Jackson will open fire
from the organ bay.

1145
01:32:30,164 --> 01:32:33,895
He will also fire if the pope
unexpectedly leaves his seat

1146
01:32:34,168 --> 01:32:36,602
or if the police arrive
in the auditorium.

1147
01:32:36,804 --> 01:32:39,295
But why kill the pope?
He means nothing to you.

1148
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,232
He is a symbol,

1149
01:32:41,442 --> 01:32:43,706
a symbol of the vast wealth
and corporate power

1150
01:32:43,911 --> 01:32:45,003
of the world's churches.

1151
01:32:45,212 --> 01:32:46,736
Like my dear, dead brother.

1152
01:32:47,381 --> 01:32:49,008
Always the good one...

1153
01:32:49,216 --> 01:32:52,982
...hiding behind the skirts of this sham
called organized religion...

1154
01:32:53,554 --> 01:32:57,581
...whose sole aim is to rob
true spirituality of its life...

1155
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,821
...and perpetuate
an implacable authority.

1156
01:33:01,028 --> 01:33:03,292
Shut up, Charlie.
Don't excite yourself.

1157
01:33:03,497 --> 01:33:05,362
My brother.

1158
01:33:05,766 --> 01:33:06,960
Is this a stable?

1159
01:33:08,602 --> 01:33:11,366
Or is it a palace for
the prince of the church?

1160
01:33:11,572 --> 01:33:15,269
In the past, people rose up
and slaughtered their kings.

1161
01:33:15,509 --> 01:33:18,000
Tonight's the beginning
of a revolution long overdue.

1162
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:22,010
Ten years ago, we attempted
a peaceful campaign

1163
01:33:22,216 --> 01:33:25,617
for the taxation of these
billion-dollar corporations.

1164
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,719
But...

1165
01:33:27,922 --> 01:33:29,947
...they support the economic system.

1166
01:33:30,157 --> 01:33:32,557
And so the economic system
supported them.

1167
01:33:32,927 --> 01:33:36,055
We were attacked, laughed at...

1168
01:33:36,263 --> 01:33:38,527
...and finally imprisoned.

1169
01:33:38,766 --> 01:33:41,200
But it was there, in those hellholes,

1170
01:33:41,435 --> 01:33:44,063
where the mind is bound
and the spirit is shackled,

1171
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:47,331
that we realized that
the single most effective way

1172
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:51,978
to bring about radical change
is the historically proven path...

1173
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:54,211
...of violence.

1174
01:34:15,736 --> 01:34:17,067
Oh, Mr. Hennesey...

1175
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:54,234
She was one tough old mama.

1176
01:35:54,435 --> 01:35:56,369
Come on.
We gotta get to the opera house!

1177
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:59,903
But the opera house is clear
across town, and it's already past 7.

1178
01:36:00,107 --> 01:36:02,007
The opera must have already started.

1179
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
<music>The Mikado, Act I, Part I</music>

<i>We figure in lively paint
Our attitude's queer and quaint</i>

1185
01:36:59,933 --> 01:37:01,992
Call Coleman. Tell him to have
all units in the vicinity

1186
01:37:02,202 --> 01:37:03,362
meet me outside the opera house.

1187
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:05,868
On no account are they to take
any action until I arrive.

1188
01:37:06,073 --> 01:37:09,509
- Take care of Fergie.
- You might need this.

1189
01:37:11,245 --> 01:37:14,544
- It's 7:15! We'll never make it!
- We'll make it.

1190
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:52,812
- Tony, this is a one-way street!
- Son of a bitch!

1191
01:37:54,121 --> 01:37:55,588
Look out!

1192

1196
01:38:26,987 --> 01:38:28,545

Uh-oh, look out!

1205
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:12,298

- OK, come on. Let's get outta here.

1208
01:39:37,591 --> 01:39:40,389
- Are you crazy?!
- It's all right, everybody! It's OK!

1209
01:39:40,594 --> 01:39:43,085
- Nobody's hurt! It's an emergency!

1210

- You break my restaurant!
- I'm a police officer.

01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:47,333
- Are you crazy?!
- Don't worry. Enjoy your dinner!

1212
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:48,796
Nothing to worry about!

1213
01:39:49,303 --> 01:39:52,670
There's nothing to... I am
a police officer. It is an emergency.

1214
01:39:52,873 --> 01:39:54,602
We must leave.
We'll give back the telephone...

1215
01:39:54,808 --> 01:39:57,106
- Police! Police! Luigi!
- It's a very large order. Big order.

<i>- Large order.
- They're breaking my ristorante!</i>

Hey, you! Look, I'm a police officer.

1218
01:40:05,952 --> 01:40:07,977
I gotta get to the opera house,
and you gotta drive me.

- Great, yeah. Get in the front, Gloria.

so move over, buddy.

1240
01:42:55,155 --> 01:42:58,022
I'm with the police. We need some
assistance. You wanna help us out?

1241
01:42:58,225 --> 01:43:00,193
- Sure, no problem.
- Follow that cowboy. He's with...

1242
01:43:00,393 --> 01:43:02,793
He's with the FBI.
Gloria, get in.

1243
01:43:07,467 --> 01:43:09,867
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!

1244
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,317
Tony! Hello.

1245
01:43:29,756 --> 01:43:32,520
Tony, there's an old couple back there.
They don't speak any English.

1246
01:43:32,726 --> 01:43:34,159
They just arrived in America.

1247
01:43:34,361 --> 01:43:37,159
That's great. Just tell them
to hold on tight. I can't stop now.

<i>Three little maids is the total sum
Three little maids from school</i>

1253
01:44:14,701 --> 01:44:17,192
So you see?
There's nothing to worry about.

1254
01:44:17,737 --> 01:44:21,332
Everything is gonna be all right.
We're perfectly safe.

1255
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:25,302
Tony, here, he's a policeman.
You know, a cop?

1256
01:44:25,512 --> 01:44:29,471
- You know, bang, bang, like Kojak?
- Kojak?

1257
01:44:29,683 --> 01:44:31,708
- What?
- Kojak? Bang, bang?

1258
01:44:31,918 --> 01:44:35,513
- Right! Right!
- Kojak!

1259
01:44:38,758 --> 01:44:39,850
Kojak!

1271
01:46:50,457 --> 01:46:53,756
OK, now, when we get inside,
I want you to point out the albino.

1272
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:56,190
You're the only one who's seen him,
he may wear a disguise.

Oh, God! He'll be in one of
the two organ bays, won't he?

1274
01:46:59,799 --> 01:47:02,290
That's what the lady said.
Look out. Hold on.

You guys, come on!

Tell Morgan I'm here.
You check with security. Let's go.
