1
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,096
Gita!

2
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:19,428
I want to talk to you
about something important.

3
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,431
I cannot keep it in me anymore.

4
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:24,941
Go on.

5
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,104
I had recognized you at the
bookshop in Delhi.

6
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:32,946
And I'd guessed that you had
come to take Kaveriamma away.

7
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:36,652
You did not make a mistake
in the address of Charanpur.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,717
I had deliberately given you
the wrong directions.

9
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,161
Why is that?

10
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:47,228
Call me childish...

11
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,395
... but I did not want you
to reach Charanpur

12
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,738
and to meet Kaveriamma.

13
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:59,404
For all that you're doing for the
school, I'd like to thank you!

14
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,411
But I cannot let you take
Kaveriamma away.

15
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:04,480
Why?

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,474
You want her so that

17
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,255
she can take care of your house
and do all the household chores.

18
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:11,423
How dare you say that?

19
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:13,751
How can you accuse me
of such a motive?

20
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:15,923
I have travelled 12,000 miles
only out of concern for...

21
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:17,929
... Kaveriamma's well being.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,757
If you were so concerned

23
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,600
then where were you when she
was in an Old Age Home?

24
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,065
It was I who traced her
and got her here.

25
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,099
Maybe, that's because

26
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:31,468
you needed someone to take
care of Chikku and your house.

27
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,775
Why did you come back?

28
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,115
Why did you have to come back?

29
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:45,290
We were so happy.

30
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,986
You have everything in life.

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,289
But all we have is Kaveriamma.

32
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,501
You are not the only one
with a right over her.

33
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:07,135
I agree that she is
like a mother figure to you...

34
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,473
... and you like a son to her.

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,477
But she is a mother to me too.

36
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:21,155
I don't want to
become an orphan again!

37
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,520
I understand Gita.

38
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,663
I will not allow you to take
Kaveriamma away from me.

39
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,609
Kaveriamma will come
with me to America.

40
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:46,442
Whether you like it... or not!

41
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,774
I'm in a dilemma Fatima.

42
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:16,207
Mohan is asking me to go with him,
while Gita expects me to be here.

43
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,541
I just don't know what to do.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,880
Allah knows, when Mohan arrived
I was so happy for you.

45
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,181
But I never thought things
would get into such a tangle.

46
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:28,825
You'll have to disappoint
one or the other.

47
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:34,593
I'm not clear whether I should go to
America with Mohan or not!

48
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:40,235
I don't understand why he
wants to take you there?

49
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,808
To work there? Did you ask him?

50
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:51,743
No Fatima. He respects me.
He'll take good care of me.

51
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:54,952
Well, I hope you are right Kaveri.

52
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:58,984
Otherwise who is to know what
tomorrow has in store?

53
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:06,655
Kaveri, why don't you ask
Mohan to stay on over here?

54
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:10,330
No, he won't agree.

55
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,831
Remember one thing...

56
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:17,107
... every piece of ice is inevitably
ordained to melt in its own water!

57
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:20,176
Get him to understand
this perfectly well.

58
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,760
We played a lot.

59
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:44,735
Kaveriamma...

60
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,870
... you can stop looking
for a groom for me!

61
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:51,142
I have decided... not to get
married at this point!

62
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,004
But why?

63
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:59,879
Yes. I want to focus all my time on the
children and the school's progress.

64
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,416
That's alright, but...

65
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:06,852
Furthermore, I'm not yet prepared
for marriage!

66
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,466
Well done!

67
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,930
This is a good move
to stall Kaveriamma from leaving.

68
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,439
But then, come to think of it
who will want to marry you anyway?

69
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,614
Now, don't get me wrong!
I'm not saying you're not beautiful.

70
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:35,184
But this attitude, tonnes of
ideals and principles...

71
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:37,252
... who'll suffer all this?

72
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,825
It's a good thing, you have
decided to opt out yourself.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,964
But there is one crazy guy,
who might want to marry you.

74
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,711
Yes Mohan, the precipitation
measurement list has been drawn up.

75
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:05,848
You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes Vinod.

76
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:10,384
We've tested the dual frequency radar,
the horizontal & vertical resolution's fine

77
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:17,222
Yes, but the waveforms need to match
with the longitudinal parabolas.

78
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,226
Of course, of course
they work in alignment.

79
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:20,860
Nivaaranji... Nivaaranji...

80
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,393
Here speak to Steve.
- Hi Mohan.

81
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:27,732
Steve, what about the
geometrical axis function?

82
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:33,006
It's being calibrated. The baseline
parameter's been optimized.

83
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:38,815
See, the sun-synch orbit needs to be in
alignment with the radiometers of TRMM.

84
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,749
Ok, I'll make the remaining readings
and call you in a couple of days.

85
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,316
Ok, thanks.

86
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,316
Hey Mohan so how's everything else?

87
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,651
Everything's fine. All is well.

88
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:51,930
So, have you found yourself
a village belle?

89
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,423
Actually, you can say yes.

90
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:54,897
What?

91
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,658
You're kidding me right?
- No.

92
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,795
What's her name?

93
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,540
Her name is Gita.
Kaveriamma lives with her.

94
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,471
I don't believe this!

95
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,473
Except, she's no village belle...

96
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,476
She studied in Delhi
and now she runs a school here.

97
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,948
Have you told her?

98
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,616
Does she know?

99
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,956
How can I tell her?
- What do you mean?

100
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,555
I mean...

101
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:25,627
I mean she's got a different set
of ideals et al. She's just different.

102
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:28,398
Come on!
You can't make that mistake.

103
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,134
You have to tell her how you feel.

104
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:32,129
All right... if you say so.

105
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,464
Listen I'll catch up with you later,
gotta go now.

106
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:38,336
Your two weeks are almost up!

107
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:40,069
I know.

108
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:41,471
I'll be back soon.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,275
You should have been back already.
- But let me propose to her first.

110
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:48,084
I'll be leaving soon,
catch up with you later, bye.

111
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,209
Bye.

112
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,347
Gurnaamji, how much was that?

113
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,194
32 minutes. Is it ok if I pay tomorrow?
- Yes.

114
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:03,331
My apologies Mohanbabu!
The electricity is problematic here.

115
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,031
Why are you trying to
corrupt Chikku's mind?

116
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,862
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:42,529
Haven't you been talking to him and
his friends about going to America?

118
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,208
No Gita, I was just explaining...

119
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:48,709
Am I teaching these kids so that they can
go abroad and settle down like you?

120
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,974
You NRI. Non-Returning Indian!

121
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,278
Hand me the mug, please.

122
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:01,726
You don't even know how to have a bath.
You should learn from Chikku.

123
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,394
Gita, I think you need a vacation.

124
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,026
Why don't you come back
with me for one?

125
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,063
Gita, you are very mischievous.
Where's the bucket?

126
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,735
Listen...
- No. You listen to me.

127
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:15,737
What?
- I like you very much... Gitli!

128
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,076
What?!
- It's true, Gitli!

129
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:23,039
I liked the way you handled
that man in the bookshop.

130
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:27,750
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Kaveriamma will stay here... with me!

131
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:30,581
You're misunderstanding.
I really like you.

132
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:34,084
Shut up! And don't you try
to corrupt the kids again, ok?

133
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:37,557
I'm not corrupting anyone.
I'm only bathing.

134
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:44,396
More than the kids, you're the
one who needs an education!

135
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,707
You can keep calling out to
YOUR Kaveriamma now.

136
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:10,652
All right now, remove your notebooks.
The topic is General Knowledge.

137
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,224
So who's going to tell me...

138
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,730
... the names of five of the most
important rivers in the country?

139
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,798
I'm sorry to be late teacher.

140
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,080
Look ahead.

141
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:39,884
Today I'm going to take your class!

142
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,725
First question...

143
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,328
... name five main rivers in India?

144
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,164
You...

145
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,962
... tell me!

146
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,337
Let me think.

147
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:02,602
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...

148
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,010
... Bharati...

149
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:09,679
... Panchgani...

150
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:14,154
Bharati? Panchgani??
Are they rivers?

151
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,221
Vidya, you tell me.

152
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:22,363
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...
Godavari and Brahmaputra.

153
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,161
Excellent Vidya!

154
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,239
Second question...

155
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:36,980
... name the new state that has
been formed in North-West India?

156
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,318
I know this one.
It was a part of Uttar Pradesh, right?

157
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,316
Yes Chikku. You tell us!

158
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:50,060
It's Uttaranchal!
- Oh yes, Uttaranchal!!

159
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,196
How could I have missed it?
I forgot!

160
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,690
Well done, Chikku!

161
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,595
Now the last question...

162
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,463
... if our new student does
not know the answer...

163
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,841
... we'll have to demote him to
a lower class.

164
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,518
How many lion heads does
the Ashoka pillar have?

165
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,065
This one is easy.

166
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,297
Three.

167
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,570
Noooooo! It's got four!

168
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,110
Excellent, children!
The lesson of the day is...

169
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,279
... before gaining knowledge
about foreign lands,

170
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,140
it is important that one should
know one's own country first.

171
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,850
Don't forget to do your homework.

172
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:03,868
The rivers Ganga and Jamuna have
their confluence point in Allahabad.

173
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,932
The new state Uttaranchal...

174
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,470
... is the 27th state of India
with Dehradun as its capital.

175
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,472
This is the land where the
Mahabharata was written!

176
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:15,039
The Ashoka pillar rests
in a circular abacus,

177
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:18,475
which is girded by four animals.
The bull of the West...

178
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:26,554
... the elephant of the East,
the horse of the South...

179
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,758
... and lion by the North.

180
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:38,996
Gita, the blackboard is clean.

181
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:48,175
Gita... I am...

182
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:53,612
Gita... !

183
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,720
But all my answers were correct.

184
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:04,025
This is Natthu, the potter and
this is Shankar...

185
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,355
... he makes baskets.

186
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:09,499
Both of them want us to admit
their children in school.

187
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:12,362
What Mohanbabu said to us
the other day touched our hearts.

188
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:16,730
We don't want our
children to suffer like us.

189
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,369
On the morning of Dussehra
<i>(Indian festival)</i>

190
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,372
you can come and enroll your
children in the school.

191
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,275
Yes ok.

192
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,380
The tides have begun to
change direction.

193
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:32,154
Haven't they?

194
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,324
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,247
Mohan!- Yes?

196
00:14:57,615 --> 00:15:01,574
Mohan, I have some work for you.
- What work?

197
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,913
There's a place called Kodi a
few miles from here.

198
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:06,416
Gita has some family property there,

199
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,259
which has been leased to a
farmer called Haridas.

200
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:12,118
He has not paid his rent for
some months.

201
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:14,060
I want you to go an
recover the money.

202
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,758
Me?

203
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,932
But why do you want me to go?
Can't you send someone else?

204
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:22,331
If you go and ask
he just might pay up.

205
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,507
Oh! So you want me
to be a collector now!

206
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,974
Ok, when should I leave?
I have to fuel up the caravan.

207
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,283
You have to leave now.
- Now?

208
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:35,942
Yes, and you can't take the caravan there.
- Then?

209
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,448
You will have to take the train
for three hours to Narsinga...

210
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,715
... then a boat journey across
the river to Maangaon...

211
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,290
... and finally three hours by bus...
and you've reached Kodi!

212
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:49,058
Sure, that's pretty closeby!
- You'll return by tomorrow evening.

213
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:53,566
And Mela Ram will go with you.
He knows the way.

214
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,205
Kaveriamma...
- Yes?

215
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:03,380
My vacation is nearing it's end.
What have you decided?

216
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:07,315
You finish this work first.

217
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,889
Come on Collector saheb... !

218
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:20,262
Why are you sending Mohan?

219
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:23,161
I sent Haridas a message only
a few days ago.

220
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,898
I know what I'm doing!

221
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:38,173
Good morning sir.
- Good morning Melaram.

222
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:41,784
I'm all set to take you on a
sightseeing trip of the village.

223
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,553
Ok, I'll take your leave.

224
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:52,560
Mohanbhaiyya, you'll
bring me a toy, won't you?

225
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,131
Of course! Gimme five... yes!

226
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,974
And what shall I bring for you?

227
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,847
Nothing.

228
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,710
I know you don't want me to leave,
but I have to go for Kaveriamma.

229
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:21,415
And listen, don't think
about me too much.

230
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,856
Don't miss me too much.

231
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,865
Now what makes you think
that I'll miss you?

232
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,866
The look in your eyes!

233
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,634
They give your feelings away.

234
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:17,941
O beloved, most beloved, surely

235
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,209
I am infatuated with thee

236
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,614
Thou hast endeared my heart

237
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:28,280
O beloved...

238
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,960
O beloved, most beloved, surely

239
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:37,233
I am infatuated with thee

240
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:40,630
Thou hast endeared my heart

241
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:43,705
O beloved...

242
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:46,967
My heart's bewildered

243
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:50,147
My body with fire kindled

244
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:53,317
It's monsoon of my dreams

245
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,487
The courtyard of my eyes streams

246
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:59,823
The pitcher of my heart is overflowing

247
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:06,987
O beloved...

248
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:47,769
O dear who hast drawn so near!
O dear who hast endeared my heart!

249
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,870
How canst I recount

250
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:55,338
What hath been thy bequest pray how?

251
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,216
Somewhere art buds of
a throbbing heart

252
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,386
Somewhere the dream-lanes

253
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:05,556
Mirth that dwells in the heart,

254
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:08,385
How shallst I articulate?

255
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:11,562
Thou swayeth me so

256
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:16,598
That oft times I am embarrassed

257
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:23,138
It seems I have lost
my path

258
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:29,337
Ever since I have seen the
haven of love

259
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:32,380
Haven of love

260
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:35,878
O beloved, most beloved,
surely

261
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,988
I am infatuated with thee

262
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:42,283
Thou hast endeared my heart

263
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,690
O beloved...

264
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:28,037
Now that thou hast met me
This world's transformed

265
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:34,235
Methinks the flowers have begun
to beset my path

266
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:39,940
And I fancy too
That this earth's renewed

267
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:47,319
The sky too freshly spun
in our love

268
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,593
Wanton breeze singeth some melody

269
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:55,732
River too narrates some tale

270
00:21:55,933 --> 00:22:02,270
All's changed, my love
since my eyes courted thine

271
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:08,571
I have lost presence of my mind,
gone is my treasured selfhood

272
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,738
O beloved...

273
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,803
Haridasji!

274
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:38,198
Haridasji!

275
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:39,867
Yes?

276
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:47,845
I'm Mela Ram and this is
Mohan Bhargavaji.

277
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,209
Tell me.

278
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:53,722
Kaveriji and Gitaji have sent me.
It's about the land's rent.

279
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:57,221
I understand.

280
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,830
Come in.

281
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,270
You have travelled a long way.
You must be tired. Please rest.

282
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,143
Make some bread.

283
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:16,839
Run along now.

284
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:19,141
Please come in.

285
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:38,599
You really shouldn't have bothered.

286
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:43,768
How is that possible?
A guest is like God!

287
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:48,007
We've served what we have;
you eat and then we'll talk.

288
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:49,568
Ok.

289
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:08,130
If I had the capacity to pay,
I would have come to Charanpur myself.

290
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:12,600
Sir, I was a weaver before I
took up farming.

291
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:16,239
Since the advent of machine
woven fabrics in the market,

292
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,875
weaving had ceased to
be a lucrative business.

293
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:24,773
So I became a farmer.
I took Gitaji's land on lease.

294
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:32,222
I'd imagined, once the crops flourished
the children's life would improve.

295
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,815
But it was not to be!

296
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:38,652
Why?

297
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:43,764
By taking up farming,
I had changed my profession.

298
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:50,005
The village elders did not accept this
and looked upon me as an outcast.

299
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:57,039
They felt a weaver should remain a weaver,
even if it meant, that he had to go hungry.

300
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:04,250
I cried, pleaded...
but no one listened to me!

301
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,051
Nobody offered a drop of
water to irrigate my land.

302
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,853
Entire crop dried up...

303
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,932
.... and whatever survived,
the villagers refused to buy.

304
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:23,697
It is because of this, I've not
been able to pay Gitaji's rent.

305
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:26,935
But this is wrong.

306
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:34,041
It's unfair. It is an outrage!

307
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,611
It is the way things work here.

308
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,554
Not a morsel to
fill our stomach,

309
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:45,890
no clothes to wear,
no roof above our heads,

310
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:49,628
no education for children,
nor land!

311
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:56,431
The thirst in my heart alone
knows the taste of my tears!

312
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,237
Then what did you do?

313
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,837
What could I do?

314
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,778
I thought about migrating to the city,
hoping life would be better there.

315
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:11,578
Those who had been there,
recounted the anguish in the cities.

316
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:18,518
A labourer goes there to work,
and falls into the grip of contractors.

317
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:25,760
He either returns hungry,
or never returns.

318
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,837
And soon, the wife has to
sell the little land she has.

319
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,266
No sir, no!

320
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:37,946
I couldn't feed my
children in this life...

321
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,612
... what is to happen after me?

322
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:45,813
And about Gitaji's money,

323
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:51,892
I have nothing to offer
except helplessness and shame.

324
00:26:53,597 --> 00:26:54,621
Nothing...

325
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,915
Thank you for the food, Haridasji.

326
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:53,187
Haridasji, I'll take your leave.

327
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:02,697
Please don't mind. Here's
some money. Keep it.

328
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:07,297
Mohanbabu, it's very kind of you
but I can't accept it.

329
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:09,468
Please Haridasji, I want you to keep it.

330
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:12,369
When you have it, you can
return it to me.

331
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:16,442
But I don't know when I will
be able repay it.

332
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:19,873
Don't worry about it.

333
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:26,247
Here Chotu, this is for you.
Share it with your sisters.

334
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:33,892
Please give Gitaji
and Kaveriji my respects.

335
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:15,429
Water for sale... water for sale...
25 paise for a glass...

336
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:29,010
25 paise for a glass of water...

337
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,504
Saheb, please have a glass of water.

338
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:24,894
Mohan you're back!

339
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:34,494
How was your journey?

340
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:38,036
Ok.
- Did you meet Haridas?

341
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:41,809
Yes. But I could not get the money.

342
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:50,811
His situation is pathetic.
He can't pay the rent!

343
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:54,579
Instead, sir gave him money
from his own pocket, before leaving.

344
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,822
I couldn't bear to see
Haridas' condition.

345
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:04,464
I don't think you should expect
any rent from him.

346
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,230
Mohanbhaiyya, did you get me my toy?

347
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:14,534
I couldn't get anything.

348
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,676
Come Chikku.

349
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:30,627
Mohan this is the general
state of affairs.

350
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:35,757
What is money when compared
with the value of human life?

351
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,692
I'm glad you gave him money.

352
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:45,536
Now don't get disheartened.
Rest a little.

353
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,216
Kaveriamma...

354
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,690
... how do I wrap this around?

355
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,725
Kaveriamma has left for school.
For the decorations.

356
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:16,104
I don't know why she wants
me to wear this dhoti?

357
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,068
What's wrong with my jeans anyway?

358
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:21,177
It is the appropriate thing to
wear on Dussehra.

359
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:22,709
If you wish I can tie it for you.

360
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,347
How do you know?
Have you ever worn one?

361
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:27,016
It's not a saree, ok!

362
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:29,249
Ok then! Do it yourself.

363
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:33,413
All right, all right.
Just do it quick.

364
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,914
Come...

365
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:40,587
Give...

366
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:43,757
Hold it.

367
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:03,317
What the...

368
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,225
There, it's done.

369
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:48,287
Sure, it's done...

370
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:52,200
... but I hope it doesn't
unravel in a crowd! Or else...

371
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,426
Shut up!

372
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:59,764
Today is the auspicious day of Dussehra.
It was on this day that Lord Rama...

373
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:05,107
had slain Ravana and marked the
triumph of good over evil!

374
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:11,584
I am very happy that on this day
we initiate new students in the school.

375
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,800
May the Goddess of Knowledge
be with you.

376
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,263
It's Lajwa.

377
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:37,207
This is our little granddaughter Kusum!

378
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:43,883
Now, go and play.

379
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:54,289
Mohanji, where are you off?
Why don't you spend some time with us?

380
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:59,160
I'm impressed. How well you've
tied your dhoti Mohanbabu?

381
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:01,166
How did you manage to learn so quickly?

382
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:03,839
It's pretty easy. It was tied in seconds.

383
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,735
You're looking like a bridegroom.

384
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:09,241
Thank you.

385
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:13,475
So how long have you lived abroad?

386
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:16,015
It's been almost twelve years now.

387
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:19,086
You must have adapted yourself
completely to their way of living?

388
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,851
We would also like to know a
thing or two about America.

389
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:31,231
Well... America is a big country...

390
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:35,360
We've heard that it's also very rich?

391
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:39,004
Rich it is. But there are several
reasons for that.

392
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:43,679
One among them is that their land
is rich in mineral resources...

393
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:47,247
Even our land is rich, but in crops.

394
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:50,011
Our strength... lies in our fields.

395
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,388
Do they have problems of rain?

396
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:56,047
Are they affected by drought
and famine like us?

397
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:58,056
And what about electricity?

398
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:05,565
They've set up infrastructure to provide
all the basic amenities to the common man.

399
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:11,833
Electricity, housing board, healthy
food and free education.

400
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:19,414
We have one thing,
they don't have and will never have.

401
00:38:20,784 --> 00:38:21,808
What?

402
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,583
Culture and tradition!

403
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:25,948
Yes, agreed.

404
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:31,924
And till we have that,
no one can destroy us.

405
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:35,924
Ours is the greatest country in the world!

406
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:37,262
Absolutely!

407
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:42,666
Culture and tradition is our strength,
don't you agree?

408
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:47,940
Munishwar...

409
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:53,844
I don't think... Mohanbabu agrees!

410
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,178
Do you Mohanji?

411
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:57,346
You're right.

412
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:01,347
I don't agree that ours is the greatest
country in the world!

413
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:11,028
But I do believe that we have the
potential and strength to become great.

414
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:18,106
Both these countries are economically,
sociologically and culturally apart.

415
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:23,302
I shouldn't say this but since you have
broached this topic, let me say that...

416
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,774
... whenever we suspect losing
in comparison...

417
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:29,447
... we clutch on to our favourite refuge...

418
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:31,843
... culture...

419
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,853
... and tradition!

420
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,083
America has progressed
on its own strengths.

421
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,161
They have their own culture
and own tradition.

422
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:42,490
It would be wrong to claim
that their culture

423
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,896
their tradition and beliefs
are inferior and ours are laudable.

424
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:47,897
It's wrong.

425
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:51,766
But I have heard that

426
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:57,641
there they discriminate against
members of ethnic races.

427
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:01,339
Yes! There are clashes sometimes.
Aren't they everywhere?

428
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:05,920
What is important to analyze is that
we make differences based on caste.

429
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:15,626
You talk as if we have created the caste,
class, religion and the social system.

430
00:40:16,132 --> 00:40:20,125
This hierarchy of caste is ancient
as is culture and religion.

431
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,204
And colour and creed.

432
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:27,536
Remember, one's caste is
a thing that can never die!

433
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:30,872
Just because a custom is ancient,
it does not have to be right.

434
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:36,548
Why are you imposing your
views on us Mohanbabu?

435
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,579
I am not imposing any views.

436
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:44,223
I am only speaking of things I've
experienced while living here.

437
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:47,555
And I've realized that we keep
fighting amongst ourselves...

438
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:52,226
... when we must fight against illiteracy,
over-population and corruption.

439
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:57,235
Every day, in our streets and homes,
each one of us keeps saying

440
00:40:57,574 --> 00:41:01,840
"The country has gone to dogs. The
country is on the path of destruction!"

441
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:06,406
If we keep saying this, we will
one day actually land up there.

442
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:08,345
You'll need to do
something to remedy this.

443
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,748
You too!

444
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:12,615
Not just the members of the Panchayat
but everyone in the village.

445
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,387
You are blaming the members of the
Panchayat for your problems.

446
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:22,757
But when you step into their shoes, you'll
do the same thing. This applies to me too!

447
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,463
The dalits blame the brahmins...

448
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:29,333
... and brahmins claim that their
piety is despoiled by the dalits.

449
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:33,272
The blacksmith and potter blame
the moneylender.

450
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:37,906
The land owners blame the peasants,
but they don't give them their rights.

451
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:41,943
In what way are we great then?

452
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:44,883
If we have problems in the village,
we point our finger at the State...

453
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:49,855
... and the State at someone else.
We all are finding fault with each other!

454
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:53,729
The fact is that we're all to be blamed.

455
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,798
Because the problem... is us!

456
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,226
Me... you...

457
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:01,793
... all of us!

458
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:06,440
Have you lost your head?
What are you saying?

459
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:08,735
All I know is that...

460
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:14,113
... a weaver who changed his
occupation by becoming a farmer...

461
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,548
... cannot feed his family

462
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:23,287
or give his children an education.

463
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,627
He can only watch his kids
die of malnutrition.

464
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:20,379
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

465
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:27,389
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

466
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:32,828
Come, O Raghu stalwart,
O lord, I beseech thee

467
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:37,159
Adorable lord of my heart,
O my good Ram, appear

468
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:41,997
I recite thy Name,
hear thou O Ram and come

469
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,173
I recite thy Name,

470
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:48,071
hear thou O Ram and come

471
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,143
Proclaim glory of truth
by beat of drum,

472
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,741
burn Lanka of sins

473
00:43:53,016 --> 00:43:57,749
At once come, rescue me and
heed loud proclamation mine

474
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:04,291
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

475
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:11,063
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

476
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,946
Forget Ram, look!
It's Ravana who hast come

477
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:29,515
His mighty shadow hath
spread over all quarters

478
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:35,518
Why dost thou recite Name of Ram?
Why dost thou sing rosary of Ram?

479
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:39,955
This Ram - Ram thou hast
begun by rote

480
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:41,425
O Sita!

481
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:45,658
what virtue didst thou
see in Ram to quote?

482
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:50,171
Who can recount all His virtues?

483
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:54,934
Lexicon too falleth short

484
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:59,404
Who can reach the summits

485
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:04,086
Where my adorable Ram sits

486
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,990
Ram is most excellent in this world,
unswerving in virtue

487
00:45:09,192 --> 00:45:13,424
Most puissant yet
possessed of restraint

488
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,828
But now his restraint too
hath suffered diminution

489
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:22,562
O Ravana! It's not too
late to beg for mercy!

490
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:24,631
May the glory of truth be
proclaimed by beat of drum!

491
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:27,100
Lanka of sins shouldst burn

492
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,537
Here cometh Ram; we bow unto Him

493
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:32,044
Accompanied by noble
brother Lakshmana

494
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:38,448
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

495
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:48,596
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

496
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:56,236
Shouldst Ram possess strength;
shouldst He valour proclaim

497
00:45:56,472 --> 00:46:00,374
Why hast He not come to rescue thee,
thy fame?

498
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:04,376
He whose glories thou
singeth untiring

499
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,880
Pray, where is that Ram at
this moment, uncaring?

500
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,567
Ram resides in mine heart;
Ram is mine breathing part

501
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:33,868
Ram is soul mine,
Ram doth my life define

502
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:38,575
Ram in all my moments liveth,
it's Ram in every breath

503
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:43,445
Ram is in every hope of mine;
Ram is in every wish and pine

504
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:50,757
Ram verily in compassion stayeth,
in peace too dwelleth Ram

505
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,363
Ram for sure in unity is,
progress too is glory His

506
00:46:56,933 --> 00:47:00,767
Ram, in contemplation of devotees,
and of enemies alike liveth

507
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,736
Forsake sin, O Ravana! And thou
shalt find Ram in thy heart

508
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:08,843
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

509
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:12,776
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

510
00:47:12,982 --> 00:47:16,941
Ram in every home and abode,
Ram at every threshold

511
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:21,917
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

512
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:31,759
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

513
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:47,972
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

514
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:57,716
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

515
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:09,136
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

516
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:13,832
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

517
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:18,207
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

518
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:33,091
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

519
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:32,885
Siyavar Ramchandra Ki... Jai!
<i>(Glory unto Lord Ramchandra)</i>

520
00:49:52,642 --> 00:49:57,045
The burning Ravan is looking
prettier in the darkness.

521
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:35,709
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

522
00:50:35,918 --> 00:50:38,546
Quiet! Please be quiet!

523
00:50:40,022 --> 00:50:41,614
Why do I feel that...

524
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:45,150
... all of you have started
enjoying living in this darkness?

525
00:50:45,695 --> 00:50:47,560
You've adjusted to this darkness?

526
00:50:48,731 --> 00:50:53,691
For how long are you'll going to
take your problems lying down?

527
00:50:55,705 --> 00:50:58,230
But what else can we do, Mohanji?

528
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:01,107
Will you do as I ask?

529
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:04,904
Have you once again come up
with some strange solution?

530
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,012
Please have mercy on us!

531
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:10,318
Wait Munishwar...

532
00:51:11,187 --> 00:51:12,586
What do you want us to do?

533
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:15,248
Is there a spring on
the nearby mountain?

534
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,517
Yes there is. So?

535
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,524
I need a hundred men.

536
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:21,863
A hundred men?

537
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:23,858
You shall have them.

538
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,932
You shall have a
hundred men!

539
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,796
Thank you Dadaji.

540
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:35,371
Sir, one hears lightning had struck
this spot several years ago.

541
00:51:35,578 --> 00:51:37,443
Since then there has been
this gush of water.

542
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:04,399
Wonder what he's upto!

543
00:52:07,276 --> 00:52:11,975
This is Point A1

544
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,748
We shall build a reservoir here.

545
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,088
I mean a water tank.

546
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:22,553
The water will be
acccumulated here.

547
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:26,985
From here, there will be a water pipe
which leads to Point A3.

548
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,727
A3 will have a shed with a turbine,
I mean a machine.

549
00:52:32,968 --> 00:52:37,029
When the water falls on the turbine,
it will rotate with great speed.

550
00:52:37,306 --> 00:52:42,039
And if all things go right,
electricity will be generated.

551
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:48,676
We'll form four groups.

552
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:51,446
The blacksmiths will cast the moulds.

553
00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:55,613
The 2nd and 3rd group will do the
digging work for the tank and so on.

554
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:58,350
Now let's form the groups.

555
00:52:58,694 --> 00:52:59,718
Quickly!

556
00:53:00,162 --> 00:53:02,960
This boy looks promising!

557
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:05,030
Surely seems like.

558
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:09,794
Reservoir will be made here.
Length 5 metres and breadth 1 metre.

559
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:11,462
I mean, 5 arm's
by 1 arm's length.

560
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,404
For this we will have to clear out
all the stones and bushes.

561
00:53:14,577 --> 00:53:16,306
Is that clear?
- Yes.

562
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:31,822
It's 7 feet and 6 inches.

563
00:54:07,229 --> 00:54:08,526
Shall I try it?

564
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:35,681
Where's Mela Ram?

565
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:41,727
What is this?
- From boot to suit, total American sir!

566
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:44,892
But why?

567
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,590
Now that we are going to do
business together...

568
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:49,031
I thought that I should look
like a 40% partner!

569
00:54:51,106 --> 00:54:54,439
This is my passport and this is
my VISA form, fully filled out!

570
00:54:54,944 --> 00:54:56,639
Once it's stamped...

571
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,389
Ballu, show him an
alternator powered 24 watts.

572
00:55:12,628 --> 00:55:13,959
Please come in sir.

573
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:47,022
Here's your water, Dadaji.
- Thank you, Santaram.

574
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:49,794
How's the work progressing on the hill?

575
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,227
It's getting on perfectly fine.

576
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,128
How long will it take?
- It will be completed very soon.

577
00:55:54,336 --> 00:55:55,701
You take rest!

578
00:55:59,842 --> 00:56:02,777
I'll take your leave now.
Jai Ramji Ki!

579
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:18,622
By the way Vinod, will the turbine
principle work in power generation?

580
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:21,389
Yes. Why do you ask?

581
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:25,091
You know what, I am trying to
generate electricity here.

582
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:27,927
Electricity? What the hell
are you talking about?

583
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:31,567
No, no Vinod, I'm lighting a bulb here.

584
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:34,835
John is beginning to lose it by the day.

585
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:36,773
Speak to him, and
buy me some more time.

586
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:39,676
We've started working nights.
- Common Vinod handle it for me.

587
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:41,179
I'll talk to you later.

588
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:43,012
Bye.
- Bye.

589
00:56:51,894 --> 00:57:00,427
25 x 75 is equal to...
- 1875.

590
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:15,046
23.3 x 33.9

591
00:57:20,756 --> 00:57:24,385
789.87 = 790.

592
00:57:52,688 --> 00:57:55,885
I'm about to finish this.

593
00:58:09,138 --> 00:58:10,901
I've fallen in love with you.

594
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:25,450
What did you say? Come again.

595
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:41,397
See! Just see!

596
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,334
It's you and me, and long solitude!

597
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:50,805
See! Just see!

598
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:56,041
How delicate are these shadows!

599
00:58:56,351 --> 00:59:00,754
Listen in; heed the heartbeats

600
00:59:01,023 --> 00:59:05,153
Listen in; heed the song of silence

601
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:14,492
Listen in; heed what the night hath to say

602
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,838
Night's come;

603
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,166
with desires nameless and many

604
00:59:19,374 --> 00:59:23,640
She narrateth a hundred woes;
I listen to her epiphany

605
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:28,179
Night unwindeth,
unabashed stripeth her cloak

606
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:33,286
Pearls, scattered as it were; I pick

607
00:59:35,224 --> 00:59:38,853
You have chanted some spell in words

608
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:44,124
Lamps are alit in my eyes

609
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:48,130
You have chanted some spell in words

610
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:53,238
The darkness of my
nights hath poured out

611
00:59:57,913 --> 01:00:00,381
Melaram ready?
- Ready sir.

612
01:00:00,749 --> 01:00:02,307
Release the valve.

613
01:00:08,423 --> 01:00:13,952
Release the valve further.

614
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:16,390
Good!

615
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,258
The water will gush to this
turbine through this pipe.

616
01:00:47,462 --> 01:00:50,124
The turbine will rotate with
the force of water.

617
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,200
With this steering wheel, we can
control the water flow.

618
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:57,404
We need to release enough water
to make this pulley rotate

619
01:00:57,673 --> 01:01:03,441
and make this alternator spin
at the speed of 1500 rpm.

620
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:06,774
And if this happens,
electricity will be generated.

621
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:12,885
Lonely went the day
and nights sans you,

622
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:17,787
overcast with desolation

623
01:01:18,727 --> 01:01:21,890
And now it seemeth the nights,
kissed by the day art perfumed

624
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:27,831
for you art my companion

625
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:37,405
I was incomplete sans you,
more complete now none couldst be

626
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:46,485
In yours, my world I discovered,
yet I am all lost

627
01:01:46,688 --> 01:01:50,988
Both of us have now learned,
art of living well earned

628
01:01:51,193 --> 01:01:55,527
Like Midas touch, our living
how well hath altered

629
01:01:55,731 --> 01:02:01,067
Both of us have now learned,
beauty of life well earned

630
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:10,338
O joys, we owneth a score,
enough and more

631
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:40,131
What are you'll doing?

632
01:02:41,243 --> 01:02:45,373
There will be electricity in
your house, Dadi Setu!

633
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:56,256
The wires are up. Now all that
we have to do is wait.

634
01:02:57,192 --> 01:03:00,958
Ready...- Ready sir.

635
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:07,195
Nivaaranji ok?

636
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:08,495
Yes Mohanji.

637
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:11,901
Mela Ram, release the water.
- Ok sir.

638
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:21,872
Open the valve...

639
01:03:22,217 --> 01:03:23,275
Slowly...

640
01:04:01,757 --> 01:04:04,521
Electricity will be generated at 230 Volts.

641
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:44,028
Come on...

642
01:05:02,984 --> 01:05:06,044
Nivaaranji, is the valve fully open?
- Yes Mohanbabu.

643
01:05:11,493 --> 01:05:15,259
Mela Ram, is the valve fully open?

644
01:05:16,198 --> 01:05:18,723
Fully open sir. Totally open.

645
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,130
Sure?
- Sure Sir.

646
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:28,804
Gita, come.
Hold the steering.

647
01:05:29,611 --> 01:05:30,703
Hold it.

648
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,931
If the valve is fully open,
how come there's no pressure?

649
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:43,744
Has the pressure increased?

650
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,250
Yes!

651
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:11,704
Jafarbhai, how many rpm?

652
01:07:15,116 --> 01:07:16,640
800 sir.

653
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:49,542
I say, how long now for the electricity?

654
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:52,514
Have patience Munishwar, patience!

655
01:08:28,356 --> 01:08:29,914
Electricity!

656
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:47,299
Electricity.

657
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:16,663
Mohanbabu, we have done it.

658
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:20,671
Electricity of our own village!
Generated with our toil and sweat.

659
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:24,705
Just like this project, we must
think of newer and innovative ways

660
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:27,006
to solve our village problems.

661
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:32,447
Sarpanchji, come quickly!
Dadaji's health has deteriorated.

662
01:09:44,933 --> 01:09:46,195
Dadaji...

663
01:09:53,108 --> 01:09:55,474
Electricity? Is it here?

664
01:09:57,112 --> 01:09:58,374
Yes.

665
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:05,780
The day...

666
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:07,720
... I saw you...

667
01:10:09,124 --> 01:10:10,216
... I felt...

668
01:10:11,793 --> 01:10:15,854
... something special about you...

669
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:25,568
Now that you're here...

670
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:29,443
... I can...

671
01:10:29,911 --> 01:10:33,779
... die in peace.

672
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:45,345
But Mohan, you've already been away
for five weeks. This really isn't right..

673
01:11:45,553 --> 01:11:49,614
I'm extremely sorry John. I've just been
caught up with some personal work and...

674
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:54,521
We are in Phase II of Core design here.
There can't be any further delays!

675
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:58,790
I understand John. I've just finished
what I needed to do here and

676
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:01,159
I'll be back in three days.

677
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:06,097
Three days it is!
- Of course John. Yes... I will.

678
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:31,228
What surprises me is how you
can think of going

679
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:34,230
after all that you have seen
and learnt here.

680
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:36,031
It's true Gita.

681
01:12:36,604 --> 01:12:39,471
I have learnt so much here,
gained so much here.

682
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:41,841
Felt the problems here...

683
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:45,105
... but I cannot live here.

684
01:12:46,114 --> 01:12:48,412
And I cannot live out of this country.

685
01:12:51,286 --> 01:12:53,447
I am willing to marry you...

686
01:12:54,122 --> 01:12:56,249
... but I won't go to America.

687
01:13:17,478 --> 01:13:19,708
I know that you are not going to
come with me.

688
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:24,645
Mohan, I've given it lot of thought.

689
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:34,728
At this age, I'll not be able to adopt the
ways and customs of another country.

690
01:13:35,663 --> 01:13:40,157
I am happy here.

691
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:46,037
Now that you are leaving...

692
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:52,507
... I will miss you very much.

693
01:13:55,683 --> 01:13:59,380
If you were here, our family
would have been complete.

694
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,444
I'll take your leave.

695
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:32,117
May you live a long life son!

696
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:37,419
We had forgotten that you were a guest.

697
01:14:37,725 --> 01:14:40,558
A visitor must leave one day.

698
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:49,999
We'll miss you very much.

699
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:54,499
When you come here next

700
01:14:54,742 --> 01:14:58,872
you'll surely find Internet
in Charanpur Post Office.

701
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,344
Every little lad will email you.

702
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:05,348
What we couldn't have,
is our wrestling match.

703
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:13,822
I am sorry Mela Ram that
I have to leave suddenly.

704
01:15:14,095 --> 01:15:17,553
But I'll surely send you
the sponsorship papers.

705
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:21,368
I don't need them anymore.
I'll be fine here.

706
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,399
Your presence in the village has
changed some things around here.

707
01:15:26,774 --> 01:15:28,503
Some things have definitely changed.

708
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:31,870
But you had planned your migration.

709
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:35,913
When the creeper in your house crosses
into your neighbor's compound...

710
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:38,312
... one's own house is ruined.

711
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:45,149
It's like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to the neighbour's house.

712
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,018
All the best Sir.

713
01:15:48,196 --> 01:15:49,754
Thank you Mela Ram.

714
01:16:02,143 --> 01:16:04,907
Mohanbhaiyya, this is for you.

715
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:14,416
I will put this up in my house.

716
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:18,122
Listen, study well.
Right!

717
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:39,271
Where is Gita?

718
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,444
I haven't seen her around since morning.

719
01:16:44,852 --> 01:16:46,217
I have to leave now.

720
01:16:46,521 --> 01:16:49,081
Or else I'll miss my flight.
- Ok.

721
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,351
Please explain to her, ok?

722
01:16:54,529 --> 01:17:02,800
Go son! My love and blessings
are always with you.

723
01:17:10,211 --> 01:17:12,111
Don't worry...

724
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,619
Bye.

725
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:14,832
Gita, you're impossible!

726
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:16,633
You're here and...

727
01:18:17,612 --> 01:18:19,944
... I've been looking for you all over.

728
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:24,449
I did not want to talk to you
before the villagers.

729
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:28,778
I'm saddened with your decision

730
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:32,357
but I can understand your predicament.

731
01:18:33,728 --> 01:18:35,161
I can understand.

732
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:40,593
Gita, I too understand...

733
01:18:42,136 --> 01:18:45,970
... but please don't mistake
my helplessness for betrayal.

734
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:49,901
I did not mean to hurt you...
- Mohan.

735
01:18:51,145 --> 01:18:53,204
I love you.

736
01:18:53,981 --> 01:18:57,712
I want you to be happy wherever you are.

737
01:18:59,987 --> 01:19:01,181
This is for you.

738
01:19:05,192 --> 01:19:06,591
What is this?

739
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:08,192
Open it.

740
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:18,233
What's all this?

741
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:23,139
The summation of all our traditions!

742
01:19:23,778 --> 01:19:26,474
Little flowers of our profound faith!

743
01:19:27,848 --> 01:19:29,475
Our fields...

744
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,411
... our greenery...

745
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:32,881
... rivers...

746
01:19:33,387 --> 01:19:35,287
... our culture...

747
01:19:39,393 --> 01:19:42,226
... all these will keep reminding you of us!

748
01:19:43,097 --> 01:19:44,655
And maybe...

749
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:49,230
... maybe compel you to return!

750
01:21:00,408 --> 01:21:02,137
Please stop! Don't go!

751
01:22:01,502 --> 01:22:07,202
And as we can see, we have some points
here that the satellite travels

752
01:22:07,408 --> 01:22:11,640
along the way to capture data
of the Global Precipitation.

753
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:15,805
Next we're going to see the territory
of the GPM instrument,

754
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:21,682
as it goes from Australia to India

755
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:21,639
This country, thy soil

756
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:25,250
It's thy motherland!

757
01:23:25,586 --> 01:23:31,889
She calls thee

758
01:23:33,027 --> 01:23:39,023
This is a bond that can
never be severed

759
01:23:46,006 --> 01:23:49,533
The scent of the soil:

760
01:23:49,877 --> 01:23:53,040
How canst thou fail to remember?

761
01:23:53,280 --> 01:24:00,379
No matter where thou wanderest
Thou art bound to return

762
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:04,079
From newer paths thou toureth

763
01:24:04,525 --> 01:24:07,983
From thy sighs hushed.

764
01:24:08,195 --> 01:24:11,528
From thy forlorn heart

765
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:14,360
Some one shalt beckon

766
01:24:14,568 --> 01:24:18,060
This country, thy soil

767
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:21,705
It's thy motherland!

768
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:26,502
She calls thee

769
01:24:26,714 --> 01:24:32,710
This is a bond that can
never be severed

770
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:57,466
To thee hast thy life

771
01:24:57,678 --> 01:25:00,909
Words to proclaim:

772
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:04,912
Thou hast gained all

773
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:08,520
What dearth to name hath thou?

774
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:12,190
All the happiness hath
showered, though:

775
01:25:12,393 --> 01:25:15,590
Thou art far away from thy home

776
01:25:15,829 --> 01:25:19,162
Come, return O wanderer

777
01:25:19,233 --> 01:25:23,329
Where someone wouldst
name thou a kin

778
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:30,237
And summon thee to the native soil

779
01:25:30,444 --> 01:25:33,504
This country, thy soil

780
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:37,445
Is thy motherland!

781
01:25:37,918 --> 01:25:42,355
She calls thee

782
01:25:42,556 --> 01:25:47,892
This is a bond that can
never be severed

783
01:25:48,195 --> 01:25:54,327
Now that you're here...
I can... die in peace!

784
01:25:54,535 --> 01:25:59,438
It is like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to your neighbor's house.

785
01:25:59,807 --> 01:26:03,937
I've made up my mind, Vinod.
I must go back.

786
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:05,942
Not again!

787
01:26:06,447 --> 01:26:09,905
How can you go back for a girl?
Just persuade her to come here.

788
01:26:10,117 --> 01:26:11,641
Its not that Vinod!

789
01:26:11,919 --> 01:26:14,410
It's not only about
Gita and Kaveriamma.

790
01:26:17,357 --> 01:26:20,520
This is the moment decreed

791
01:26:20,861 --> 01:26:24,353
In which concealeth

792
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:27,964
Full eon

793
01:26:28,368 --> 01:26:31,235
entire existence

794
01:26:31,438 --> 01:26:38,810
Don't thou dare ask why roads two
Cross thy path through

795
01:26:39,012 --> 01:26:46,180
Thou art the one to resolve the road
Thou art the one to discern the code

796
01:26:46,386 --> 01:26:53,622
Which direction? Whither dost the
path leadeth to true abode?

797
01:26:53,827 --> 01:26:57,194
This country, thy soil

798
01:26:57,564 --> 01:27:01,694
It's thy motherland!

799
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:07,504
She calls thee

800
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:13,613
This is a bond that can never be severed

801
01:27:14,615 --> 01:27:15,775
I got it.

802
01:27:16,016 --> 01:27:17,745
Just because you lit a bulb

803
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:20,681
now you have delusions of sparking
a revolution in the whole country.

804
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,691
You're being foolishly romantic!

805
01:27:29,863 --> 01:27:31,057
Let's leave aside sentiments...

806
01:27:31,298 --> 01:27:33,357
Have you figured out what you are
going to do there?

807
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:37,068
I have a few ideas.
- Like?

808
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:43,303
I could be a Project Manager for
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.

809
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,944
I can... I can work in tandem
with NASA from there.

810
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,938
There's a lot to be done there.

811
01:27:48,315 --> 01:27:51,842
You're impossible.
I can't understand you!

812
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,146
If you can't understand
even after hearing all this...

813
01:27:57,157 --> 01:27:59,216
... then its pointless telling you anything.

814
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:02,722
You'll have to come there and see things.

815
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:06,462
Otherwise you'll never understand!

816
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:30,688
We're just a few minutes away from the
launch of the GPM Spacecraft

817
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:32,415
on an important scientific mission to

818
01:28:32,626 --> 01:28:36,187
better understand the global water
cycle here on earth.

819
01:28:37,898 --> 01:28:41,994
GPM will allow improvements in
predicting precipitation forecasts,

820
01:28:42,202 --> 01:28:44,193
and better predict flood hazards.

821
01:28:44,504 --> 01:28:48,031
We are not tracking any technical
problems at this time.

822
01:28:48,242 --> 01:28:51,177
All systems are GO on the launch vehicle.

823
01:28:51,612 --> 01:28:54,809
Weather forecast is very good for today.

824
01:28:55,816 --> 01:29:00,048
Just a few minutes away from
launching the GPM spacecraft.

825
01:29:00,254 --> 01:29:03,155
This spacecraft will give us information...

826
01:29:03,357 --> 01:29:06,758
... that will help us
better predict precipitation

827
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:14,324
In addition, we can
better predict flood hazards.

828
01:29:15,168 --> 01:29:17,830
T minus 20 secs.

829
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,112
T minus 15 secs.

830
01:29:35,555 --> 01:29:41,824
T minus 109876

831
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:45,123
We have a GO for main engine start

832
01:29:45,532 --> 01:29:49,696
32 booster ignition...

833
01:29:51,972 --> 01:29:54,065
.... and Lift-Off!!

834
01:30:42,456 --> 01:30:44,083
John I tried to knock some
sense into his head

835
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:47,021
and tried to convince him
not to leave but...

836
01:30:49,796 --> 01:30:52,765
Mohan, you do realize
what you are going to lose.

837
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,096
John, I know what
I'm going to gain.

838
01:30:57,437 --> 01:31:00,964
But you're aware, you could
have gone places.

839
01:31:02,843 --> 01:31:04,777
I am going places!

840
01:31:08,815 --> 01:31:13,752
All right Mohan. Go light your bulb!

841
01:32:09,209 --> 01:32:11,370
Nobody has ever thrown me like this.

842
01:32:11,745 --> 01:32:13,770
Where did you learn
these wrestling tricks, Mohanbabu?

843
01:32:14,147 --> 01:32:17,116
Where there is a will, there is a way.

844
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:21,346
Afterall, a marshmelon changes its colour
in company of another marshmelon!

845
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:22,954
Do you understand now?

846
01:32:28,095 --> 01:32:31,394
Excellent match, Mohanbabu.
