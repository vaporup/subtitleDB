00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:09,164
[woman] Milutin,

6
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,667
what is the longest journey
you've taken?

7
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:14,268
To the colony on Mars.

8
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,737
There were some
deviations in ideology.

9
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,843
I managed to crack that,
receiving high scores, of course.

10
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,583
What was your greatest doubt
when you traveled to Mars?

11
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:32,722
[Milutin] <i>That the mission would lose its
purpose by the time I reached my destination.</i>

12
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,625
<i>It already happened before,
to others.</i>

13
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,994
<i>By the time they
reached the targets,</i>

14
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:43,264
the country that sent them
ceased to exist.

15
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,801
Or, the ideologies they
carried stopped being valid.

16
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:49,269
You had no intimate issues?

17
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,439
At the time, I had
a lax approach to intimacy.

18
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,874
<i>I didn't realize
how dangerous it was,</i>

19
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,746
<i>not only for me,
but for everyone around me.</i>

20
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,582
We'd like to send you
on a longer trip now.

21
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,285
To Alpha Centauri.

22
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,689
You'll be required
to install <i>juche</i> there.

23
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:08,291
Do you have
any problem with that?

24
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:11,525
Juche <i>is an ideology
for experts.</i>

25
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,995
[Milutin] <i>I wouldn't live in
a system that runs on</i> juche.

26
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:17,598
<i>I'm more of
a self-management socialism guy.</i>

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,666
<i>But I can do it.</i>

28
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:20,701
Many find it unfamiliar.

29
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:24,307
People have a problem
with Eastern ideologies...

30
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:28,409
that carry a plan of
despotism and Marx...

31
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:32,047
This mission will be different from
our standard operating procedure.

32
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,517
You won't be going alone
on this trip.

33
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,755
Are you living
in a community now?

34
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,961
So far, nothing has inspired
me to be in a community.

35
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:48,766
You'll need to live
in a community on this trip.

36
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,566
Why would this trip
be any different?

37
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:53,604
Community provides
some division.

38
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:58,339
Milutin,
I'm a social engineer.

39
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:00,309
I know your every mechanism.

40
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:05,513
I can anticipate everything you're
going to encounter on this trip.

41
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:06,884
You need a companion.

42
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:11,855
An opposite gender companion.

43
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:13,724
A woman?

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,024
Do you have any problem
with that?

45
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,027
Kind of.

46
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:22,429
Such relationships only
made me obsessive and insecure.

47
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:26,467
Life with someone in a shared
space requires specific dynamics.

48
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,739
You'll get plenty of good moments,
but you don't get the privacy.

49
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:33,943
With Nimani,
that will be different.

50
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,580
Nimani?

51
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,816
[woman] <i>Nimani is our cyborg.</i>

52
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,886
<i>She will accompany you.</i>

53
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,587
Her performance is adjustable.

54
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,390
She's got more than
500 modes of behavior.

55
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,527
Besides, take a look.

56
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,565
You can create your own
customized program of behavior.

57
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,602
I'll get a dummy.

58
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:01,572
Your demeaning tone
is only natural.

59
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:04,041
And quite expected.

60
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:09,478
She has the ability to learn and modify
according to the experience with you.

61
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,617
She can learn anything.

62
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,085
She can complete
any given task,

63
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:20,889
and she follows
Asimov's laws 100%.

64
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,658
She's a person
without being one.

65
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,659
Very intriguing.

66
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,363
So it can't hurt me?

67
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,100
Unlike real women...

68
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,735
she won't hurt you.

69
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:38,140
Can I choose the way
she's gonna look?

70
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:39,943
I mean, the hardware?

71
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,082
[beeping]

72
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,887
But you've already
made the choice.

73
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,588
The purpose of this conversation
was to draft her looks.

74
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,893
Wait, I didn't even
tell you what I like.

75
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,764
Thank you, Milutin.

76
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,500

<i>Slightly obscured, reactionary
nature should not be so obvious.</i>

80
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,789
<i>Certain carnal spots

81
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,061
<i>and yet easily
restrained by clothing.</i>

82
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,066
<i>We're supposed to think that
she has something concealed,</i>

83
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,002
<i>something only he can detect.</i>

84
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:44,572

oedipal by definition.</i>

85
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:47,110

It's just a setup after setup.

She does everything you want,

Don't get to deserve it,

Are you familiar with

Sort of.

150
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,176
It's one of the basics
in quantum physics.

151
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,277
Schrödinger says if
you put a cat in a box

152
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,747
with a fatal poison that has
a 50-50 chance of killing it,

153
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,418
you have to open the box
to see if the cat made it.

154
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,822
This cat can be both alive
and dead at the same time.

155
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,225
In one dimension,
the cat's alive.

156
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,062
In another dimension,
the cat's dead.

157
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:58,565
The only way to find out...

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,402
is to open the box.

that person was wrong.

hurt you and shape you through pain.

Milutin is surprisingly open
about personal frustrations

250

that motivated his involvement
in this voyage,

251

254

He relies more on his knowledge than

349

350
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,457
That's fucking awesome.

351
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,433
[Milutin]
I was always wondering

352
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,437
whether I was able
to create life.

353
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:43,543
It seems that I am.
A couple of days ago, we had a fight.

354
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:45,511
A generic fight.

355
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:50,483
And I realized that she's
somehow thinking out of the box.

356
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,054
Some terms of race, some...

357
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,089
Some details.

358
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,492
I felt she was
reaching out to me.

359
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,827
[Nimani] Didn't you assume
such clever behavior

360
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,032
was just part of
a superior operating system?

361
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,070
[Milutin] No, there was something
definitely human about it.

362
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:12,737
I guess it's my influence.

363
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,542
I shaped her,
as if I gave her life.

364
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,978
[Nimani] So you're saying Nimani
started to feel more human

365
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,748
because she put up
a good fight.

366
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:28,021
[Milutin] Yes. Fighting is the only thing
I can exclusively associate with women.

367
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:33,894
Perhaps Nimani's creators paid special
attention to this aspect of her software.

368
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:37,663
[Milutin] But only part
of her software is preset.

369
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,704
Now she's running on stuff she
has learned from living with me.

370
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,876
So how would you describe your
current relationship with Nimani?

371
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,811
I think she developed
a personality,

372
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,117
but this personality's bound
by this preset software.

373
00:37:57,951 --> 00:38:01,686
Although she's able to deconstruct
the narrative the software creates,

374
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:04,656
she's not able to get out of it.
For example,

375
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,562
when we had that fight,
I felt we should have sex to resolve it.

376
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,664
Sex was the only way out
of that damn situation,

377
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,635
and I think
she felt the same.

378
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:18,739
Because when I switched her
on the seduction mode,

379
00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:23,911
the transformation felt so natural for
her, so liberating.

380
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:27,045
Cathartic, even.

381
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,782
So you fantasize about Nimani
switching between her programs?

382
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:35,822
No, I fantasize about Nimani being just
able to do what she feels like doing.

383
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,457
So you fantasize
about me...

384
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:43,228
stopping the session right now
and making a sexual advance?

385
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,597
Yes.

386
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:47,199
And I feel that
you want it too.

387
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,869
You've already
had sex with Nimani.

388
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,540
It is only natural to feel this
erotically charged attitude toward her.

389
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,178
But I can do
whatever I want to you, baby.

390
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:02,714
I can just take this tablet,
press the button,

391
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,850
bend you over...

392
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:07,786
and fuck your brains out
right now.

393
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,723
And why don't you do that?

394
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,859
Because I want you
to want it.

highest standards,

520
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:37,495
my assessment is
far more valuable than yours.

521
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:42,466
Okay. Let's clear
this up, okay?

522
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:45,036
That leaves us with...

523
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,972
That leaves you
without any sex.

524
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,410
Oh, come on.
You've got to be kidding me, right?

525
00:53:53,778 --> 00:53:55,847
Don't do that to me.
Come on.

526
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:03,086
That was a deterring act.

527
00:54:03,088 --> 00:54:05,090

the Ederlezi Corporation,

534

00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:06,743
You're just punishing me.

536
00:56:06,745 --> 00:56:08,878
I'm not punishing you.
Yes, you are.

537
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,247
I just noticed some
deviations in your behavior

538
00:56:11,249 --> 00:56:13,051

to correct them.

539
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:15,654

547
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,846
Because I know it
arouses you.

548

You are punishing me.

549
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:48,221
Why? Tell me why.
Is it because I raped you?

550
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:52,858
No.
Rape is a standard fantasy...

programs in female androids.

552
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:02,165
But none of those androids
were set free.

553

No one asked those androids
what they really wanted.

554
00:57:06,138 --> 00:57:07,773
You were the first one.

555
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:15,746
All you did was mess with my programming
and delete my most important software.

556
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:17,884
You did not set me free.

557
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,988
I turned you into
a person, Nimani.

558

563
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:15,875
<i>This is why
you have Nimani with you.</i>

564

You promised me
she won't hurt me.

565

I emancipated her.

585
00:59:17,904 --> 00:59:20,106

she owes you something.

Milutin managed to obtain

and remove TIFA from my system.

591
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:50,468
However, all databases that were engaged
in previous years remained in my cache,

592
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,106

Fuck, I knew it. Great.

698
01:12:22,526 --> 01:12:23,627
What about Nimani?

699
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:25,927
[computer]
<i>Nimani's internal battery</i>

701
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:29,664
<i>It needs to be recharged.</i>

702
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:31,800
She's not coming back online,
is she?

703
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:34,972

What do you mean?

707
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,081
<i>She never unlocked
the crying pattern in TIFA,</i>

708
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:48,618
<i>and it never reached
her cache memory.</i>

709
01:12:49,019 --> 01:12:53,090
<i>However, today she cried,
which means her cache is corrupt.</i>

710
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,826
What the fuck
are you talking about?

711
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:58,161
She cried on her own?

712
01:12:58,996 --> 01:13:00,664
[computer] <i>Confirmed.</i>

713
01:13:08,306 --> 01:13:10,141
Okay. [grunts]

714
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:14,745
Come on.

715
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,881
How do I repair her battery?

716
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:21,883
[computer] <i>You must plug it in
to the solar cell recharger.</i>

717
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:26,355
<i>Nimani still has power inside its
hibernating state for half an hour.</i>

<i>After that,
her settings will disappear.</i>

719
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,897
Is there any fucking chance
to recharge this battery?

720
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:36,666
[computer] <i>No.</i>

721
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,737
Upload all the blueprints.

722
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:47,944
I can plug her battery
straight into the solar cell.

723
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:50,311
[computer]
<i>That is possible.</i>

724
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:52,614

is on the outside.</i>

725
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:54,117

729
01:14:02,727 --> 01:14:03,828
