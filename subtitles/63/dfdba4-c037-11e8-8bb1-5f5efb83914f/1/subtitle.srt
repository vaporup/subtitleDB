1
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,836
I’ll go and see what's up.

2
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,150
Your information was very valuable.

3
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,515
I don't want you taking
any more risks.

4
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,352
Don't worry, I’ll be fine.

5
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,153
Hurry up.

6
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,998
What are you doing?

7
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,196
I've just come off the boat.

8
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,271
Help me, please.

9
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,958
What are you doing?

10
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,439
Who is she?

11
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,795
She's a friend. She's just visiting.

12
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,836
You're supposed to be working.

13
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,195
Sorry, I'll send her away now.

14
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,957
Come on.

15
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,917
I only Live just up there.

16
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,559
You're the first girl
who's ever picked me up.

17
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,837
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. Just Looking for pity.

18
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,194
Is that all right?

19
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,633
Come up.

20
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,230
Make yourself at home. Have a drink.

21
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,792
That's my mum.
She lives in Hong Kong.

22
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,796
Here, take this.

23
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,039
What do you think I am?

24
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,553
I don't know who you are.

25
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,950
But I was an illegal immigrant
and I worked hard for seven years.

26
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,632
I just got my ID card today.

27
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,191
If you've just arrived, take
this money and find your relatives.

28
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,236
I don't need any problems.

29
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,870
I just need to rest a while.
Is that OK?

30
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,556
Sorry, I haven't got the time.
I have to go back to work.

31
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,630
Can I use your bathroom at Least?

32
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,076
You are troublesome -
it's downstairs out the back.

33
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,116
I can go myself.

34
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,878
Hurry. I've got money to earn.

35
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,235
White Cat calling Black Cat. Over.

36
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,995
The mice are in the warehouse.
I'm in pursuit. How are you? Over.

37
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,231
There's a suspicious-Looking mouse
watching me. Over.

38
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,515
Try and shake him. Over.

39
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,433
I know what to do.
I'll meet up with you soon. Over.

40
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,476
Game over, in actual fact.

41
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,073
You're not a very nice person,
using me Like that.

42
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,879
You'd better go now.
I don't need any trouble.

43
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,038
Move it!

44
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,198
Luk, help!

45
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
Luk, please save me
or they'll kill me.

46
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,276
What's up, guys? Let's talk,
there's no need for violence.

47
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,112
Are you going to pay his debt?

48
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,031
How much did you borrow?

49
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,189
$3,500!

50
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,078
With interest that's $20,000.

51
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,919
I've told you to stop gambling.
You never Listen!

52
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,151
I've worked hard for my money.
What am I to do?!

53
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,231
I have no money! Just kill him!

54
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,478
- Don't move!
- Put it down!

55
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,312
Put down that gun. Do it!

56
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,592
Do it.

57
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,429
Kill him!

58
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,071
Don't hit me!

59
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,878
Here, use this!

60
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,508
Thanks!

61
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,469
Pretty cool!

62
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,993
Not that cool.

63
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,598
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

64
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,154
You're too much for us. Let's go!

65
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,631
You'll need this
to pay the debt. I'm off.

66
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,109
Miss!

67
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,272
It's Miss Yeung.

68
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,356
Luk, who is that girl?

69
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,908
Forget about her,
you look after yourself.

70
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,468
OK, I won't gamble any more.

71
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,677
If you can't stop gambling,
there's no future for us.

72
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,108
We might as well give up.

73
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,792
Where are you going?

74
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,959
You can rest here a while.
I'll ask Uncle Lung for help.

75
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,549
You're no good at tailing people.

76
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,792
- Sir.
- Thank you.

77
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,073
Excuse me a moment,
my friend's arrived.

78
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,117
- Hi, Donny.
- Michael, how are you?

79
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,557
I'll go back to the station with you
once we've finished breakfast.

80
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,512
- Are you on duty?
- Yes, I'm following that guy.

81
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,955
OK, I'll leave you to it.
Got a Light?

82
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,470
Take care out there.

83
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,829
- Michael, help me out.
- No problem.

84
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,588
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

85
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,359
- Where's the guy with the beard?
- He's gone, I don't know where.

86
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,956
I'll take these guys back to the
station. You get on with your work.

87
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,360
Brown Cat calling White Cat.
Where are you?

88
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,558
Do you read me?
Brown Cat calling White Cat.

89
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,036
Let me introduce you.
Wilson, this is Wong from Hong Kong.

90
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,434
Police! Don't move! Hands up!

91
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,433
Don't move!

92
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,557
We're CIA. We're following
this drug trafficker

93
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,393
who's been threatening
national security.

94
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,517
We've been working on this
for two months.

95
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,309
Your interference is spoiling
our whole operation.

96
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,198
I know you're CIA, Mr Robinson,
but you’re making a drugs deal.

97
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,113
- Let's clear this up at the station.
- No problem.

98
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,832
Get me the negatives!

99
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,153
Boss, he's gone
and he's taken the negatives.

100
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,753
We must find him!

101
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,912
What's the matter?

102
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,670
Take this negative to the Police.

103
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,473
Drop the gun!

104
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,229
Don't move!

105
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,278
I just saw somebody being killed.
I didn't do it!

106
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,317
I didn't kill anyone.
I was just defending myself.

107
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,309
- Where are the others?
- What others?

108
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,439
Those drug dealers!

109
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,750
I don't do drugs,
I was just passing.

110
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,512
Stop acting dumb!

111
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,678
- Did you take the negative?
- No, he gave it to me.

112
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,149
I'll ask you again,
where is the negative?

113
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,912
I don't know. I lost it.

114
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,353
You're lying!

115
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,917
I'll get it out of you yet.

116
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,436
- Hand over the negative now!
- I don't know anything.

117
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,714
Oh, yeah?

118
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,631
I've told you a thousand times,
I was just passing.

119
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,959
Stop lying! You know everything!
Give me the negative now!

120
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,508
- I told you, I don't have it.
- Give it to me!

121
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,678
- Stop hitting me or I'll fight back!
- Give me the negative!

122
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,632
- You off, then?
- Yeah.

123
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,594
It's only me. Take it easy.

124
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,439
Here, eat.

125
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,837
When can I leave?

126
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,435
The next ship to Hong Kong
leaves at nine tonight.

127
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,637
I've booked a place for you.

128
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,720
Here, give them
this half dollar bill.

129
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,718
Plus three thousand dollars
and the cabin is yours.

130
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,870
- You borrowed money again?
- relax.

131
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,436
I just exchanged my ID card
for money. Take it.

132
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,354
Are you crazy? I worked hard
for years to get that card.

133
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,112
Get it back.

134
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,430
I'll get it when I have the money.

135
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,196
The money is here. Take it or die.

136
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,558
Ming...

137
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,235
OK. If I don't die,
I'll give it back to you.

138
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,074
Don't talk nonsense,
I'll die before you.

139
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,315
America is a hard place
to make money.

140
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,152
You'll be better off in Hong Kong.

141
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,392
Maybe you'll be rich!
Don't forget me then.

142
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,352
You're right.

143
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,158
America doesn't suit me.

144
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,871
Perhaps Hong Kong
is the place for me.

145
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,034
- The TV doesn't work.
- The antenna is broken.

146
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,271
You'll be bored. I'll fix it.

147
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,318
Can you manage?

148
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,710
I can fix a broken TV no problem.
My problem is fixing you.

149
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,758
It's working.

150
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,993
Freeze!

151
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,952
Don't shoot.

152
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,154
Where is Luk?

153
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,674
Luk? I don't know any Luk.

154
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,275
Who is that?

155
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,038
That's me.

156
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,274
Who is that, then?

157
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,919
Here, money.

158
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,758
- I'll kill you if you don't talk.
- Go ahead, I'm not talking.

159
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,468
Ming!

160
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,758
Come on, Ming, run! run! Hurry!

161
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,516
Hurry, get out of here! run!

162
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,749
Ming! Ming! Open the door!

163
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,478
Open up! Open the door!

164
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,869
Open the door, Ming!

165
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,914
Open the door!

166
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,988
Open the door!

167
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,196
Go! One death is better than two.

168
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,192
You can't die! Open the door!
Let me in! Hurry up!

169
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,599
Ming!

170
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,429
Miss Yeung...

171
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,152
You'd better stay here.

172
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,233
Don't come up because if anything
happens, I'll get the blame.

173
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,079
Don't move!

174
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,312
Damn you! You want to hit me?
Go on, then, and I'll blow you away!

175
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,913
Let's see you beat my gun.

176
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,552
Stop running!

177
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,509
Up yours!

178
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,548
What are you doing?
You care about him too much.

179
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,155
He's just a suspect. You could have
killed an innocent man.

180
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,279
You know you let a criminal go free?
Happy now?

181
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,430
Come in.

182
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,839
This is Inspector Yeung from Hong
Kong. This is Captain Wong's case.

183
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,876
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

184
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,429
I've handed this case over
to Captain Wong. Fill him in.

185
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,718
It's been my case from the start.
Why give it to him?

186
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,109
Because I have no faith in you.

187
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,954
I'm partly to blame for Black Cat's
death. I'll follow this case anyway.

188
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,439
Let me work with Michael.

189
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,310
I don't see a problem with that,
but I think he can handle it himself!

190
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,789
Sir, Donny knows this case
inside out.

191
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,110
I would really appreciate his help.

192
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,630
OK, solve it as soon as possible.

193
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,437
Thanks for helping.

194
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,999
No problem.

195
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,998
Good, you've brought the money.

196
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,591
It's not enough.

197
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,793
This is all I have. Can you help me?

198
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,834
This card is of no use to you.
It will cost you much more than this.

199
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,672
I'll do Ming a favour. We are good
friends, after all. That's settled.

200
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,434
Ming, you've caused me a lot of
trouble and I'm still alive.

201
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,992
This time, I caused your death.

202
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,993
Stop praying,
the boat's about to leave.

203
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,116
There's no refund if you miss it.

204
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,156
Ming... I'm sorry.

205
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,157
I'm Leaving now.

206
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,075
Michael, we received information

207
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,357
that Luk escaped to Hong Kong
on a ferry last night.

208
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,477
OK, I'll go to Hong Kong
to have him extradited.

209
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,272
The car's here.

210
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,032
Follow me! Hurry!

211
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,794
- Group One stays here...
- Stay here, our men can handle it.

212
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,356
- Mum.
- Luk?

213
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,317
Yes, I'm back in Hong Kong.

214
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,358
I'll come and see you very soon, Mum.

215
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,156
If you get the chance.
Do you think you can escape us here?

216
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,710
I've stayed away from you lot.
Why can’t you leave me alone?

217
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,797
run! Why don’t you run? run! run!

218
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,275
Come on.

219
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,234
run!

220
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,319
Stop!

221
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,359
Stop fighting.

222
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,029
Miss Yeung, he wants to
shut me up for good.

223
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,758
- What did you say?
- Again!

224
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,674
I'm doing my duty and you point
a gun at me. I'm a cop too, bitch!

225
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,833
Stop fighting!

226
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,195
- What's the matter, Donny?
- What happened?

227
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,874
He hit the suspect
and threw my gun in the sea.

228
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,235
He hit me.
Why did you point a gun at me?

229
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,275
Leave it, Donny.

230
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,272
Sir, there seems to be some mix-up.

231
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,313
OK. Take the suspect for a check-up.

232
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,834
We'll discuss this at the station.
Get the gun.

233
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,396
Miss Yeung, do you really suspect me?

234
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,119
Why did you run off to Hong Kong?

235
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,556
Why did you run away
from the Police station in Seattle?

236
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,838
Someone tried to kill me at the
station and my friend Ming is dead.

237
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,876
I didn't have a choice.

238
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,997
By running off, your innocence
has turned to guilt.

239
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,997
Don't make things worse for yourself.
We’ll help you.

240
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,789
We’ll take you back to America
to investigate further.

241
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,516
I believe the suspect and hostage
are in the south of the island.

242
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,513
I've divided the rest of the area
into four parts for searching.

243
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,229
The Special Squad are standing by.
The gang are heavily armed.

244
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,074
They are well trained. Everyone
must be especially alert. Got it?

245
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,072
Where is the negative?

246
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,797
Has the cold got your tongue?

247
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,474
Which negative? Fuji or Kodak?

248
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,350
If the cold doesn't kill him,
you will.

249
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,719
You’ll turn to ice
if you don't speak.

250
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,836
It's not that cold!
Just a little cool, really.

251
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,236
Is it cool enough for you now?
Where's the negative?

252
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,752
Hold on.

253
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,913
Here.

254
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,834
How's that? Feel better?

255
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,592
You are tough!

256
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,875
It's lucky you didn't tell them.
We would have both died.

257
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,718
The negative is as important to them
as to the Police.

258
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,552
Trust me, give it to me.

259
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,875
I'll help you prove your innocence.

260
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,873
The negative...

261
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,552
Block all the exits.
Don't let the fool escape.

262
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,993
Yes, sir.

263
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,710
Madam, we're picking up an SOS.

264
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,473
- Transfer it to me.
- Transferring now.

265
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,834
This is Luk.

266
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,310
- This is Madam Yeung. Where are you?
- I don't know.

267
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,674
How are you?

268
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,070
I'm fine now,
but I don't know about Michael.

269
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,196
We've got him! He's nearby.

270
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,071
Stay calm, I'm on my way.

271
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,037
Hurry!

272
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,076
I've given them the slip.

273
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,272
Thanks.

274
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,070
Time is running out.
Tell me where the negative is.

275
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,354
I...

276
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,476
I lost it.

277
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,152
Where did you lose it?

278
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,356
I don't know.

279
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,511
But... I saw the man
who murdered the American cop.

280
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,269
- would you still recognise him?
- Yes.

281
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,112
Even if he was disguised.

282
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,998
- will that help?
- Yes.

283
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,518
Inspector Yeung is on her way.

284
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,272
I've fixed the radio.

285
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,749
Hey! This is Luk. Can you hear me?

286
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,118
Inspector Yeung! Inspector Yeung!
Can you hear me? Hello! Hello!

287
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,389
Don't move!

288
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,876
- Captain Wong, are you all right?
- Yes, yes.

289
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,874
- Are you all right, Captain Wong?
- I'm fine, Madam Yeung.

290
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,794
I don't want any more trouble.
This case has gone on long enough.

291
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,996
I want him extradited tomorrow.

292
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,637
- OK.
- Thanks.

293
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,160
Don't move or you'll get it.

294
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,118
I can never come back
if I'm taken to America.

295
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,156
What do you mean come back?

296
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,675
Miss Yeung, have a heart,
Let me see my mother.

297
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,992
Just five minutes.

298
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,592
Four minutes!

299
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,873
Three minutes will do.

300
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,589
Sit down. This isn't a marketplace.
No bargaining.

301
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,874
None of your business.

302
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,474
- What?
- It'll get madam into trouble.

303
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,788
No, it won't.

304
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,235
Just drive past her house.

305
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,154
Let me just see her,
then I can die in peace.

306
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,592
I'm begging you, Miss Yeung.

307
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,875
You really want her to know
about this?

308
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,111
Why upset your mother
and make this awkward for me?

309
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,999
Shut up! Be a man. Stop crying.

310
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,556
I haven't done anything.
Why does everyone keep hitting me?

311
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,279
This is Inspector Yeung.

312
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,114
I'm taking the suspect to pick up
some important evidence. Over.

313
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,992
You two stay here.

314
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,394
I don't want my mother to see this.

315
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,109
Thank you very much. Thank you.

316
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,190
- Hey...
- Why did you bring him here?

317
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,555
- How is my partner?
- He's all right.

318
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,108
Luk fixed the radio
and saved Michael.

319
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,833
Is that true?

320
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,154
I'll go with you
as soon as I've seen my mother.

321
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,390
She's in the kitchen.

322
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,356
Hurry up and take these off.

323
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,919
What's all this noise?

324
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,993
Mum!

325
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,029
Luk!

326
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,430
Mum, how are you?

327
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,080
- Fine and you?
- Fine.

328
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,879
Fine. I missed you.

329
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,038
I missed you too.

330
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,712
I missed you too.

331
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,153
I know. I know.

332
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,472
You two are...
Who is this young lady?

333
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,556
- Miss Yeung is a friend of mine.
- That's right.

334
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,315
This son of mine - hiding
his girlfriend from me like that.

335
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,157
You worked so hard for the money
that you’ve sent me.

336
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,358
I haven't spent any of it.
I've saved it all for your wedding.

337
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,796
- Only $3,500!
- It's plenty.

338
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,077
For a small wedding
for poor people Like us, it's fine.

339
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,833
I've waited a long time for this day.

340
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,232
Oh, excuse me,
I haven't served your tea, Mr Yan.

341
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,034
Yan came back with Luk.

342
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,112
He took very good care of Luk.

343
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,830
- Thanks.
- Have some candy dumplings.

344
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,309
- Miss Yeung, have some.
- Thanks.

345
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,109
It's sweet and long lasting.
Go on, try one.

346
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,752
Don’t you like it, Miss Yeung?

347
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,118
It's quite good.

348
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,955
Here, let me serve you.

349
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,919
Mum's candy dumplings are the best.

350
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,992
So romantic and you're not even
married yet.

351
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,074
Here.

352
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,592
This ring is a gift for Miss Yeung.

353
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,229
Oh, so careless!

354
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,799
Are you OK?

355
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,632
I'm all right.

356
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,670
Give me your hand.
I'll put the ring on.

357
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,754
- I couldn't, really.
- You must.

358
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,195
It can be your engagement ring
from Luk.

359
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,191
Come on, give me your hand.

360
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,637
It must go on your left hand.

361
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,551
Come on, give me your left hand.

362
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,915
Come on.

363
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,350
What are you doing?

364
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,237
Doesn't Miss Yeung like it?

365
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,592
She is very shy. Let me help you.

366
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,275
There.

367
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,436
Luk, it's time to go.

368
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,751
Wait a minute.
Let me look at your hands.

369
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,357
- What's going on?
- Mum, I...

370
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,078
Why are you handcuffed?

371
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,993
I am a Policeman from America.

372
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,875
What has my son done wrong?

373
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,949
Your son hasn't done anything wrong.

374
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,759
Yeung is taking him
to see her parents,

375
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,308
but he is shy
so they are locked together.

376
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,595
It's not handcuffs, it's a love knot.

377
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,672
We American Police
enjoy playing these games.

378
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,231
Let's go, Luk.

379
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,871
Mum, I won't be back tonight.
Take care of yourself.

380
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,872
Don't worry about me.

381
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,794
Come back soon if everything is OK.

382
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,033
I will, Mum. Take care.

383
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,633
Please talk to my mother tomorrow and
tell her I'm going back to the US.

384
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,154
Move!

385
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,835
Take him to hospital,
I'll distract them.

386
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,673
- What will you do?
- Hurry up, he's had it.

387
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,953
Come on, then.

388
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,716
Have you contacted his mother?

389
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,153
- I didn't want her any more upset.
- But she has the right to know.

390
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,592
We can't be responsible
for her emotional state.

391
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,432
You know what, Yeung?
You are too sentimental.

392
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,193
Luk is lying there because of it.

393
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,317
I'm beginning to doubt your ability.

394
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,520
Well, you are a first-class cop,
but you are too impulsive.

395
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,832
He's a suspect. Why did you
have to treat him so badly?

396
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,110
Luk's life is in your hands
as well, you know.

397
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,637
I too am beginning to doubt you.

398
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,359
Guilty or not,
it's the judge who decides.

399
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,919
My job is to arrest people.

400
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,553
I have a different method to yours.
The law takes emotion into account.

401
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,473
A suspect is innocent
until proven guilty.

402
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,950
If they make a reasonable request,
I'll allow it.

403
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,439
Have you no compassion?

404
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,080
You have no right to criticise me.

405
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,630
I'm not criticising,
I just don't like you acting so cool.

406
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,309
First they kidnapped Luk,
now they want to kill him.

407
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,756
- What do you think?
- Have they already got the negative?

408
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,433
- Sir.
- Madam Yeung.

409
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,796
Why did you take the suspect home
without permission?

410
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,233
How did he get hurt?

411
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,437
You could be disciplined
for delaying the extradition.

412
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,674
Sir, she took the suspect home
because I requested it.

413
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,194
Why?

414
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,953
The suspect said
vital evidence was missing.

415
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,999
To save time, we decided
to investigate immediately.

416
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,073
Captain Wong,
did she not keep you informed?

417
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,277
She didn't,
but it seems time was short.

418
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,791
Then I don't think Captain Wong
has any more to say.

419
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,440
Madam Yeung, write me a report.

420
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,150
Both of you are responsible
for his life.

421
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,037
Don't worry, sir.

422
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,999
Luk is over the worst. When he awakes
we'll take a statement.

423
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,155
Things become complicated
when your subordinates are too smart.

424
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,999
Thanks for balling me out.

425
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,355
I'm cool. Don't mention it.

426
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,000
- Why don't we...
- I've got to run, bye!

427
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,556
Your goods and our money were all
destroyed by that Policewoman.

428
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,997
If you want revenge,
I'll get you the opportunity.

429
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,351
What does this tattoo stand for?

430
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,434
It's a US Navy Special Forces emblem.
It's the Black Fox symbol, troop 3.

431
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,116
According to the Pentagon,

432
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,637
on October 26, 1979, the whole troop
fought in the Nicaraguan Civil War.

433
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,676
They were all killed in action.

434
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,796
But... Last month in America,

435
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,838
there was another suspect
involved in this case

436
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,592
who also had the same tattoo.

437
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,958
You've come all the way
from the US to kill Luk. Why?

438
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,396
There must be a large organisation
behind you.

439
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,071
So what if there is?

440
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,198
Tell me the truth!

441
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,113
Donny! Calm down!
Do you really want to kill him?

442
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,316
I only asked you to take
his confession, not to kill him.

443
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,994
I didn't hit him that hard.
He won't die.

444
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,633
The Hong Kong Police filed
a complaint for excessive violence

445
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,711
so I'm sending you back to Seattle.

446
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,751
I think this case is becoming
more and more complicated.

447
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,719
It will be fine. Don't worry. We’ll
celebrate once this is all over.

448
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,995
- See you in Seattle.
- Forget the case.

449
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,389
Take this, you can read it
on the plane.

450
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,755
You've done your best.

451
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,676
Miss Yeung, I trust you...

452
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,556
but you don't trust me.

453
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,518
You didn't even tell me
you were sending Luk away.

454
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,596
I did that for Luk's own safety.

455
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,114
I transferred him to a safe house.

456
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,273
Don't misunderstand me, I'll inform
you of everything from now on.

457
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,828
OK, here's to our future
relationship!

458
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,471
Michael, do you need a ride?

459
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,199
- No, my car is over there, thanks.
- OK, then.

460
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,630
- The assassin escaped downstairs.
- After him!

461
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,396
- Is Luk all right?
- He's fine.

462
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,872
Madam, I need to freshen up.

463
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,153
What's going on?

464
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,594
It's me!

465
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,159
How are you doing?

466
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,310
I feel sleepy.

467
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,360
- Here, drink this.
- Thanks.

468
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,556
Why didn’t you go back to America?

469
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,115
I felt the suspect I interrogated...

470
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,592
died suspiciously.

471
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,236
Who do you suspect?

472
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,197
Captain Wong, your good partner.

473
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,236
I also suspect him.

474
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,832
I'm beginning to like you, Lady!

475
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,912
You don't suspect Michael
because you like him.

476
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,392
As you said, a cop shouldn’t
get emotionally involved.

477
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,152
You always act cool,

478
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,516
yet you allow relationships
to cloud your judgement.

479
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,636
Yes, I do have feelings

480
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,190
but I'll arrest anyone
who breaks the law.

481
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,236
Why would I come back otherwise?

482
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,437
You think I like you nagging me?
You stupid....

483
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,875
Stupid bitch. Stupid woman, right?

484
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,155
Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.

485
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,190
Hey, foul-mouth!

486
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,352
We're a fine pair.

487
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,999
I didn't know I was so sentimental.
I do hope it's not Michael.

488
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,433
I trust you.

489
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,236
It hurts.

490
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,557
Am I dead?

491
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,234
You can't be,
you're still feeling pain.

492
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,394
If I haven't died yet, the sight
of you will surely scare me to death.

493
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,950
You haven't done anything,
why would you be scared?

494
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,519
Of course I haven't,

495
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,751
but you’re still following me
like a crazed dog.

496
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,910
And I don't know what your game is.

497
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,518
We were attacked in the hospital.
He saved you.

498
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,717
Then I should thank you
for saving my life.

499
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,316
Luk, start from the beginning
and tell us the whole story.

500
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,036
Bring Luk in,
or you'll face charges.

501
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,839
I can't risk his death,
my hands are tied.

502
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,310
I understand,
but I can't protect you forever.

503
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,196
Madam Yeung, let Wong take Luk
back to America.

504
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,032
That's an order.

505
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,358
- Madam, we're all ready.
- Good, let's get started.

506
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,996
Madam Yeung, why are we all here?

507
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,470
Luk may resist arrest
so I brought backup.

508
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,509
Bing, tell them to work faster.
We must move the stuff tonight.

509
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,875
- The buyers need it.
- Don't worry.

510
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,475
Police! Freeze!

511
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,792
Police! Freeze!

512
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,712
You lied to me!

513
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,754
Don't struggle!

514
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,954
Save me. Save me.

515
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,999
Don't let go.

516
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,199
Madam Yeung didn't give the suspect
to Captain Wong.

517
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,874
She even had the drug dealers
try to kill him.

518
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,918
You covered up for your men
and disobeyed an order.

519
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,993
What kind of discipline is this?
You will arrest Yeung at once!

520
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,479
- Is this it?
- No.

521
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,518
Bigger nose, thicker eyebrows.

522
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,878
What about now?

523
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,231
That's him! That's him!

524
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,031
This is the drug dealer I saw!

525
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,791
- Him?
- I'd recognise his face anywhere.

526
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,630
You're afraid.
Can’t you beat him?

527
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,597
I can still fight!

528
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,439
Don't move!

529
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,434
Shoot me.

530
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,830
Shoot me! Go on, pull the trigger!

531
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,592
Where is he?

532
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,836
Tell me, or I'll kill you!

533
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,558
Madam, there's a warrant out
for your arrest.

534
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,432
OK, I'll go with you.

535
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,272
I'm sorry, madam.

536
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,956
I'm sorry too.

537
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:07,832
Luk recognised Black Cat's killer
from the magazine you gave me.

538
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,115
It's councillor Robinson.

539
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,952
He's also CIA.

540
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,039
Who'd have thought that you’d learn
so much from your snooping?

541
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,951
Brilliant.

542
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,957
One more thing.

543
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,589
I suspect someone from our department
is breaking the law.

544
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,312
So I came to you.

545
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,111
What do you want to do?

546
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,556
The CIA involvement means it concerns
national security.

547
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,916
- It's your call.
- Good. You're a real friend.

548
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,399
Yes, I'm also CIA.
I would like you to join us.

549
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,550
You want me to sell drugs?

550
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:52,159
We only sell drugs to raise money to
support Latin American rebel forces

551
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,312
so that our country's power
is strengthened.

552
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,154
- Those drugs will kill hundreds.
- That's a small sacrifice.

553
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,597
- Then Luk will definitely die.
- He's a victim of circumstance.

554
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,150
He's unlucky this time.
You can't blame me.

555
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,870
Michael, I don't like sacrificing
others for my own interests.

556
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,191
OK, you make your own choices.

557
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,233
I won't force you.

558
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,079
- This is how that CIA agent died.
- Correct!

559
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,911
Kill him and get the tape back!

560
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,110
Hey! Watch where you're going!

561
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,832
The suspect fell down there.

562
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,440
That's him! Arrest him!

563
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,478
What are you doing here? Let's go.

564
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,633
Stop right there!

565
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,239
- Hurry!
- right!

566
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,636
Sir, anything?

567
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,956
The driver forgot to lock up.
No wonder petty crime is so bad.

568
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,792
Search everywhere.

569
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,478
I'll help you once, but not twice.
Take care of yourselves.

570
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,752
all for nothing.

571
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,990
- Where are you going?
- To save her.

572
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,036
You'd only be risking your own life.

573
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,078
She's my mother,
I must try to save her even if I die.

574
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,679
Call Michael. We can trade this tape
for your mother.

575
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,355
Did you bring the tape?

576
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,472
I've got it!

577
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,589
- Where's my mother?
- Hand over the tape first.

578
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,358
Tapes aren't admissible as evidence.

579
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,149
Eyewitness accounts are what matter.

580
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,516
Now you're all going to die
so there's no more evidence.

581
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,158
That tape is a bomb.

582
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,398
Don't move! Let's see who's faster!

583
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,597
Unload your gun, then throw it away.

584
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,874
release my mother
or I'll blow you away!

585
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,952
Behave, don't break anything.

586
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,792
You bastard!

587
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,198
I told you to behave.

588
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,556
- Why don’t you just give up?
- Not until you're dead.

589
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,478
I'll get Luk's mother.

590
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,231
Come on, then. Come on.

591
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,953
Pretty good.

592
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,716
Mum! Don't be scared.

593
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,554
Mum!

594
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,077
Move and I'll shoot!

595
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,754
Mum!

596
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,790
Put it down or I'll push the button
and we'll all die!

597
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,071
I said put it down!

598
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,991
Do you hear me? Put down the gun!

599
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,072
Councillor Robinson was arrested

600
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,469
and convicted for drug-trafficking
and murder.

601
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,518
Officer Donny is still carrying out
his duties as a good cop.

602
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:27,790
