1
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,542
Well, it's not a matter of right and wrong.

2
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,711
it's a matter of righter and wronger.

3
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,842
Righter and wronger?

4
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,845
Those are not words, Carlo.

5
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,555
Hey, that's what the judge said.

6
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,100
The judge said that
in a court of law.

7
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,227
He said righter and wronger,
right there.

8
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,731
"Pledge of Allegiance,"
all that bullshit.

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,691
What else did the judge say?

10
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,946
He said that people will,

11
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,741
you know, protect their lives
no matter what.

12
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,034
l mean, he didn't say it like that.
You know, he said it like

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,413
the fancy legal shit, but-- but yeah.

14
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,540
He said people will protect
their lives no matter what,

15
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,333
something like that.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,920
You heard
about what happened, right?

17
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,090
On the Belt Parkway.
You heard that?

18
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,469
- No.
- Yeah, I was on the Belt Parkway,

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,721
- like 65th Street--
- You were on the Belt Parkway?

20
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,475
Yeah, down by the pier.
I’m driving like a bastard

21
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,937
and, you know,
fucking cops pull me over, right?

22
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,815
They give me the breath test.
You know, I’m drunk off my ass,

23
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,901
right, and they lock me up.

24
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,278
So before I go in front of the judge,

25
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,906
my lawyer, he says to me--

26
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,327
he says,
"You know, you were so drunk that--

27
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,079
that it's considered a felony."

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,457
- Which means I broke parole.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,584
That's seven years.

30
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,753
l mean, no lies, Sal--

31
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,464
l-- I felt like I was gonna
shit a bowling ball.

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,759
So I finally go in front of the judge.

33
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,595
He goes, "Can you please
explain what happened?"

34
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,347
And I said,
"Your Honor, look.

35
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:23,017
I’m in a bar,
I’m having a drink, right?

36
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,853
These two fucking guys come in,
they assaulted me.

37
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,439
The bashed me, you know,
smashed bottles over my head.

38
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,525
Yeah, there's bottles over my head

39
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,360
and kicked me in the face.

40
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,112
And to save myself,
l got in my car--

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,406
you know, I ran out of there,
l got in my car,

42
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,076
- and, you know, I drove off."
- Right. And he bought that?

43
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,745
Yeah, well, he bought nothing.
That's a true story.

44
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,955
- I got no--
- Oh, come on.

45
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,123
Hey, that's a true story.

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,667
Okay.

47
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,627
All right.

48
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,796
Okay.

49
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,548
Yeah, I owed all these bookies

50
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,967
and back then I didn't have
nothing to pay them, you know.

51
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,512
So somebody
in the bar called the cops.

52
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,099
But the judge,
he's listening to this

53
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,142
and he's--

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,271
you know, he looks like
he's gonna shit a bowling ball.

55
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,027
He says that this is not a simple case
of right and wrong,

56
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,030
but righter and wronger.

57
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,659
Because the defendant had
to break the law...

58
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,163
to protect his own life.

59
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,041
it’s un-fucking-believable.

60
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,794
What happened to the cops?

61
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,046
Nothing. They were right
even though they were wrong.

62
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,217
And I was wrong
only because that I was right.

63
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,887
You see? You get that now.

64
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,223
- You get that, right?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,392
- Righter and wronger.
- Righter and wronger.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,769
That's right.

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,315
- You're too much.
- You see what I’m--

68
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,304
Yo, Tango!

69
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,222
We got that shit on deck!

70
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,606
Hey, get your
motherfucking hands off me!

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,905
Still very active here at the BK projects.

72
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,741
Details are sketchy,
but here's what we know.

73
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,702
A young African-American man
named Allen Daniels

74
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,038
was allegedly shot
and killed by police.

75
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,373
We're hearing
it was one police officer

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,584
who was trying to rob him.

77
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,378
- He's a good boy.
- it’s gonna be okay, all right?

78
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,547
- He's a good boy!
- Residents here are

79
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,134
- obviously outraged...
- My boy! My boy!

80
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,194
- Let's just kick it, man.
- Let's go.

81
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,280
Y'all little niggas know
what to do. Hurry up.

82
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,866
it’s hot out this motherfucker.
There's police everywhere.

83
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,952
Yo, hurry up.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
Yo, it's crazy right now.

85
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,582
Tango. Come here, man.
Lemme holla at you real quick.

86
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,293
l thought you was
going back to school, B.

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,337
Come on, Tango.

88
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,256
in there I ain't
already learning out here?

89
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,966
But you're gonna make
that court date, right?

90
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,135
Come on, Tango.
You know I’m gonna make the court date.

91
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,636
- You know I’m gonna make the court date.
- All right. Cool.

92
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,222
- What's going on here?
- Yo, these fucking pigs, man.

93
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,100
They done clap a little homey, man.
Shit crazy right now, boy.

94
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,726
- Word?
- Yeah.

00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,489
Check it.
l don't wanna hear

96
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,659
y'all been spending y'all gwap
on these hookers either. You heard?

97
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,995
Wake up in the morning with
your dick looking like a trophy

98
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,830
with the mother.
Ask K Rock.

99
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,583
You know bitches be burning this shit.

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,626
Come on, man.
You better stop telling people.

101
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,171
We gonna go in the living room
and fuck with the PlayStation real quick.

102
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,339
Let me see you pop verse two, son.

103
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,675
- What up, Tang.
- What's up, man?

104
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,594
But yo, truthfully, man,

105
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,679
you know that was
you and your cousin that got shot.

106
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,181
- Word up.
- Stretched out.

107
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,726
- Three shots in the chest.
- Police are crazy. Wild.

108
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,903
Oh God!

109
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,927
Oh God!

110
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,888
l did a bad thing...

111
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,058
but to a bad guy.

112
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,644
A very very bad guy, all right?

113
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,520
And for a good reason.

114
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,274
You think that's
a rationalization, right?

115
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,193
That's what you're thinking.

116
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,570
You're here.

117
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,241
So you've prayed for guidance.

118
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,826
No, I couldn't do that.

119
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,662
Why not?

120
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,208
'Cause prayers were
not gonna give me what I needed.

121
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,587
Is that more important
than your relationship with God?

122
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,965
No matter what you may have done...

123
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,552
- He's ready to forgive you.
- He is, huh?

124
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,596
We're all imperfect creatures...

125
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,058
and we're led to sin.

126
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,228
That's why we have to
surrender our souls to God.

127
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,314
Well, to be honest with you,

128
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,942
I've been here before, all right,

129
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,069
asking for God's help

130
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,530
a lot of times, okay?

131
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,534
And my situation is not getting
any sunnier, you know?

132
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:22,955
So-- so why should it now?

133
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,500
Your pride is denying
the possibility of God's goodness.

134
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,544
Why does He get all the glory?

135
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,629
You know, why is that?

136
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,008
Huh? He gets all the glory
and I get all the blame.

137
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,969
l mean, is it not possible...

138
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,557
that maybe God
isn't carrying His end of the weight?

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,019
Look. This thing is
obviously weighing on you.

140
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,022
So release it.

141
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,316
Confess your sin.

142
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,942
Pray for forgiveness.

143
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,154
l don't want God's forgiveness.

144
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,949
l want His fucking help.

145
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,663
What? Is that so hard?

146
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,874
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

147
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,627
Let's just-- let's do a few
"Hail Mary's and go, okay?

148
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,255
Let's-- thank you.
Thank you.

149
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,550
This has been really good.
Thank you.

150
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,679
"Hail Mary, full of grace,

151
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,681
the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou amongst women,

152
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,391
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

153
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,060
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

154
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,812
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen."

155
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,523
Thank you.

156
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,650
Sal.

157
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,916
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.

158
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,835
The BK projects,
you all know it.

159
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,880
1 8 buildings, 1 5,000 residents.

160
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,467
The highest crime area
in the highest crime precinct.

161
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,470
Good morning, Sal.
Thanks for joining us.

162
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,764
Larceny, rape, prostitution--

163
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,724
it even takes the crown for kidnapping.

164
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,893
- it’s estimated that over...
- Yo.

165
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,853
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- Not too much.

166
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,231
Oh, fuck.

167
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,983
Hey, what do you know about--

168
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,736
what's his name? --Bobby Powers
with CI? You hear about that?

169
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,154
- Carlo?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,906
Found him with his face blown off

171
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,741
in a Town Car over by the cemetery.

172
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,911
Oh. They got any leads on that?

173
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,040
Carlo was a grade A asshole.
Everyone's a lead. Why?

174
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,835
No, nothing.
it’s just-- you know.

175
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,630
And now, the media
shoveling shit on our badges

176
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,298
over the shooting
that took place there.

177
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,552
We have to remind the public
that one man from this unit

178
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,096
cannot stain
the sum total of our efforts;

179
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:48,100
That we are not in the business
of harming the public but of helping it.

180
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,353
We've been entrusted
with the responsibility to protect

181
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,314
those who cannot protect themselves.

182
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,693
This is where
we accomplish that, gentlemen.

183
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,197
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing here?
The bars close early?

184
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,116
l heard you let
another cuffed prep escape.

185
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,742
What's that, about six now?

186
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,412
Is he fucking laughing at you?

187
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,832
- Laughing? Are you laughing at me?
- I'll just slap your fucking mouth.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,209
- Whoa whoa!
- I just wanna talk to him.

189
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,420
- No, just-- don't--
- Are you laughing at me, man?

190
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,089
Forget about him. Come on.
Forget about him. Come on.

191
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,300
Fucking burn out, man.

192
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,969
Nobody want you here, man.

193
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,679
Let's go.
Hey, you got my fucking "Playboy"?

194
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,723
- That's my "Playboy."
- That's mine.

195
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,767
- You boys starting trouble?
- No, Captain. No, sir.

196
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,482
Dugan.
See me in my office.

197
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,150
Five minutes.

198
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,036
l forget to fill something out?

199
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,497
Everything went fine.
Retirement's gone through.

200
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
Great.

201
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,250
How are you doing, Eddie?

202
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,005
You know.

203
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,382
The wife?

204
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,344
You know.

205
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,679
Here's the deal.
Our commissioner,

206
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,264
he believes in this new program

207
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,184
that puts rookie cops
in the highest crime areas.

208
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,686
So they want
seasoned hairbags like you

209
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,563
breaking these recruits in.

210
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,857
Since you're the oldest here--

211
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,401
Hey, look,
if it's all the same to you,

212
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,237
I’ve got seven days.

213
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,740
I’m no one's teacher.

214
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,993
I’m not a role model.

215
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,203
God knows you're not, Eddie,

216
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,705
but your name came up
in the computer, pal.

217
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,124
This thing's been kicked up
by two months

218
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,668
and all eyes are on it.

219
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,712
Just do the best you can, okay?

220
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,675
Come on, Dugan.
Don't you want to do something useful

221
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,885
with your last two minutes on the job?

222
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,974
Not really.

223
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,713
What the fuck, Clarence?
I’ve been nursing this seat for 1 5 minutes.

224
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,257
Don't call me Clarence.

225
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,762
You order for me yet?

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,557
Yeah, pancakes, eggs and bacon.

227
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,226
- I told you--
- I know. I remembered turkey bacon.

228
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,103
l know that you don't eat the swine.

229
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,356
All right.
The drugs are in play.

230
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,941
All the principles are accounted for.

231
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,860
l haven't made contact
with the connect yet.

232
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,778
Again with Jersey, huh?

233
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,865
Fuck those racist crackers, man.

234
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,784
You know how they do, Bill.
Black man, black car,

235
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,037
profiling shit.

236
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,456
What am I supposed to do?
Just cave into them?

237
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,250
l played that shit perfectly.

238
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,629
In all fairness there was
20 bricks of raw in the trunk.

239
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,464
Yeah?
Well, they didn't know that.

240
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,134
it’s called tact.
You know what tact is, right?

241
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,136
l don't wanna play games
with you, Bill, all right?

242
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,264
Now you need to push harder
about me making grade.

243
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,099
- Talk to the chief.
- I know.

244
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,643
it’s not like you haven't earned it.
You've earned it.

245
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,645
But it's just, I’ve told you,
these things, they take--

246
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,563
Time.
You keep saying that shit,

247
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,482
but you know that
I’ve put in more than e-fucking-enough.

248
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,442
What's happening?

249
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,446
What's going on? Why is this
all of a sudden so urgent, huh?

250
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,497
When that trooper
pulled us over last night...

251
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,041
...he gets me out of the car

252
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,669
and he's doing
his whole Gestapo bit, right?

253
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
My man and themes
in the car are ready.

254
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,881
Shotgun, he's on high alert.

255
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,133
Kid in the back, he's locked,
cocked and ready to rock.

256
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,760
- I ain't going back to jail.
- No, man, hold it. Hold it.

257
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,680
- No no.
- I’m dying to bust my guns, man.

258
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,306
You know I can't stand
these motherfuckers.

259
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,017
This guy has no fucking idea
what's about to go down.

260
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,186
You know what I’m thinking?

261
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,273
"Fuck it."

262
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,026
"Let it be."

263
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,238
And then we get back to the Ps,

264
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,200
and I see the young brother
laid out on the concrete

265
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,035
and I find out how...

266
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,163
Next time you're on my road,

267
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,582
knock the speeding off.

268
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,001
l don't give a damn who you are.

269
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,796
...l start thinking, "We should've just
deaded them motherfuckers on the road.

270
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,631
It'd have been two to one,
but so what?

271
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,383
I’m good with those odds.
Fuck it."

272
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,137
You see what I’m saying?

273
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,223
I’m fucked up in the game, man.
You've got to get me out of here.

274
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,602
I’m gonna keep greasing the wheel
for you, see what we can do, okay?

275
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,230
Desk, suit, tie.

276
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,774
it’s just something I need, okay?

277
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,068
l need that shit like water.

278
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,740
Can you look at something for me?

279
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,205
The kid you saw killed in the projects--

280
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,082
it gets worse.
He was an honor student,

281
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,418
a grad student.

282
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,963
The cop who shot him
was trying to rob him.

283
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,758
So of course when
the major newspapers get ahold of this,

284
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,968
the shit's really gonna hit the fan,
if you know what I mean.

285
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,928
Please tell me they caught
the son of a bitch.

286
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,432
Yeah, we caught him,
but the bosses are gonna wanna find

287
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,809
some kind of thing
that's gonna clean this up pronto.

288
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,686
So there's gonna be
some kind of play that goes down.

289
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,147
Some kind of play is gonna happen.
l don't know what it's gonna be,

290
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,442
but I need to know-- I need to know
you're my boy out there.

291
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,195
- Oh, I’m your boy, huh?
- You know that's not what I meant.

292
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,035
You get in touch with Allisa?

293
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,794
l-- she sent these.

294
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,129
They're divorce papers.

295
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,007
You know, I’ve got some lawyers'
names in there for you, a list of them.

296
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,136
I’ve got the department taking care
of everything for you, okay?

297
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,317
l want my life back, Bill.

298
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,028
l can see that,
and I’m working on it.

299
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,989
Please. Work harder.

300
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,039
The captain says you're retiring.

301
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,177
What did you say your name was?

302
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,013
Melvin Panton--
Lance Corporal, US Marines.

303
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,977
Marines.

304
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,357
Well, Lance Corporal Melvin Panton...

305
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,444
seven days from today

306
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,864
is 22 years for me.

307
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,658
Pension doesn't get
any better after that.

308
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,743
Seven days from today?

309
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,453
That's-- that's my birthday.

310
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,914
You've been a cop
longer than I’ve been alive.

311
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,584
Ain't that something?

312
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:18,717
l can see you're married-- the ring.

313
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,385
Separated.

314
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,974
You know, I’ve always wanted
to be on the force my whole life.

315
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,976
Yeah, it's true.

316
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,063
l had plastic handcuffs
when I was three.

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,026
Yeah, every Halloween

318
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,736
l always dressed as a cop.

319
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,407
l bet you find that
pretty corny, right?

320
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,411
But hey, I’m here now.

321
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,050
- Wait here.
- You know what? Fuck you.

322
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,968
Don't touch or do anything.
You got it?

323
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,435
Stop it with the fingers
to the fucking face, all right?

324
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,313
Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

325
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,566
I’m gonna cut 'em right off.
Stop it with the fucking fingers.

326
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,443
- Every fucking--
- You'd better back down.

327
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,111
- Every fucking time you do that.
- You'd better fucking back down.

328
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,696
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.

329
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,365
- Ah!
- All right, how about that?

330
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,784
- You're always talking to these guys.
- I ain't doing nothing.

331
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,494
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I’m not doing-- I was shopping!

332
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,246
You know what? You're fucking pissing-- don't you
fucking start with me.

333
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,998
- Get your finger out of my face.
- Don't start with me!

334
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,043
- All right? Get your finger--
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey, enough!

335
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,836
- Take a step back.
- Get the fuck outta here.

336
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,797
- I’m gonna ask you one more time--
- Who the fuck are you?

337
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,633
- All right, that's it. You're under arrest.
- That's good. That's okay.

338
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,470
Walk-- walk-- walk away. Walk away.
Walk away. What did I tell you?

339
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,847
- I said don't do anything, just sit there.
- He just hit her, man.

340
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey, this is 64th Precinct.

341
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,352
We are what?
What are we?

342
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,812
- 65.
- 65th, right.

343
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,439
Was it Halloween that day
at the academy?

344
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,149
What the fuck is wrong with you?

345
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,944
You do not make
an arrest out of zone.

346
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,696
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

347
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,323
- Eddie. Eddie, it is--
- We'll talk about it in the car.

348
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,492
- You--
- Get in the car.

349
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,705
Uh-huh.

350
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,417
Happy days are here again.

351
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,429
You've reached Allisa.
l can't come to the phone right--

352
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,854
Hey! Yo.

353
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,357
- Hey, calm down.
- Get the fuck away from my car.

354
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,153
Get a real fucking job, man.

355
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,124
Well, what if you turn on
the news tonight and she's dead?

356
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,044
- Hmm?
- I don't watch the news.

357
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,255
- it’s depressing.
- You just--

358
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,968
You're just gonna act
like this never happened?

359
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,724
This is your first day, kid.

360
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,185
Today a woman gets hit.
Tomorrow it's a rape.

361
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,187
The day after that it's a murder.

362
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,397
- Dad! Dad!
- What's up, Dad?

363
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,983
You've got 20 years of days.

364
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,570
This job takes enough out of you.
Don't take it home.

365
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,748
In my book, that's called a coward.

366
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:41,086
Yeah, well,
I’m not much of a reader either.

367
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,095
- I’ll eat in the car.
- Yeah, good.

368
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,263
Good idea.

369
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,526
Seven days, Eddie.
Seven days.

370
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,493
- You're the one that always--
- Shut up.

371
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,495
- You're asking him.
- You ask him.

372
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,997
You ask him.
You do it. Okay.

373
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,457
- Hey, Dad.
- Dad. Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.

374
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,292
- Dad, turtle turtle--
- What did I tell you?

375
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,879
- What did I tell him about the turtle?
- You can't get a turtle until you get a room.

376
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,923
That's right. So now you go to
the pet store

377
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,467
and pick out two turtles, 'cause you boys
are gonna have your own room.

378
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,927
- Really?!
- Yes.

379
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,638
Yeah!

380
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,932
Dad here looking for a princess.

381
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,518
There she is.
There she is.

382
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,478
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

383
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,523
- Look what I made.
- Oh, yeah? What is it? Is that me?

384
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,150
- Yeah.
- Is my head that big?

385
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,943
- Yeah.
- You better say no. You better say no.

386
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,778
Where's your mother, huh?
Where is she?

387
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,280
- No, where is she in real life?
- Sal.

388
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,825
- Go get her.
- Mom ! Dad's home!

389
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,225
This is not enough, man.
What's this--

390
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,853
this is not enough.
This is not enough.

391
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,355
- This is-- fuck!
- Watch your language!

392
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,733
What are you doing down there?
Come on, we're waiting for you.

393
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,568
No, l-- fuck.

394
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,542
Sal, what are you doing?

395
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,221
Sal.

396
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,098
Mom !

397
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,434

- Vicky dropped a glass.

398
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,269
- Coming.
- I didn't do it, Vinny did.

399
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,439
Come on, Sal.
Don't touch the glass.

400
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,637
Hello.

00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,979

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,494
- Who the fuck is you talking to?
- I’m talking to you, motherfucker.

00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,912
Just watch where

00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,962
"Watch your mouth"?
You'd better watch your grill.

425
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,997
The one you see standing in front
of you right now on his own two.

426
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,916
True true true.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

427
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,461
Yeah, but you wouldn't have
air in your lungs if it wasn't for me.

428
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,172
- Now that's real talk.
- You feel that?

429
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,507

Ooh.

486
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,403
My man Tango.

487
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,491
You always were smarter

488
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,877
But on the strength, though,

00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,005

00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,641
l wouldn't have won
that appeal if it wasn't for him.

494
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,685
- Oh, man, that was nothing.
- Nothing?

495
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,563
Bullshit.

00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,007

Yeah. I just don't want you to build it up

674
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,885
What the fuck are you doing
by the window? What the fuck?

675
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,553
Where's the money?
Are you hiding money?

676
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,889
Did you throw it out the window?
You're fucking lying to me.

677
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,641
- Are you lying to me?
- No, I’m not.

678
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,227
- Where is the fucking money?
- Ain't no money.

679
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,188
Somebody out there? Huh?
Who's that? Who's that?

680
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,899
Hey! Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

681
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,068
Do not even fucking
look at me, asshole.

682
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,946
- The money's left the building.
- Sal, what are you doing, man?

683
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,074
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- The money's left the building.

684
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,675
Stop!

685
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,391
- Hey!
- Aah!

686
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,393
Get off me!

687
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,897
- Do not fucking move.
- Get off me.

688
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,775
You hear me?
Do not fucking move.

689
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,782
Suspect got away.
Suspect got away.

690
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,534
- Please.
- Where's the money? Huh?

691
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:43,036
Where's the money?

692
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,164
What the fuck are you talking about?
l ain't got no money.

693
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,296
Don't got any money?

694
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,173
What are you running for
if you don't have any money?

695
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,925
l could have shot you
in the fucking back.

696
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,636
Get out of here. Get your shit and get
out of here before you get me in trouble.

697
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:03,265
What the fuck? Diapers?
What the fuck?

698
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,434
- Fuck! Holy shit!
- Shit.

699
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,980
Oh fuck.

700
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,593
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?

701
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,306
- That the botulism special?
- Hey, vamos, Tango.

702
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,024
Who's that at the table with Bill?

703
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,485
l don't even know, man.

704
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,747
Clarence-- I mean Tango.
I'd like you to mean Special Agent--

705
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,333
Smith. Sit down, chief.

706
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,044
Smith comes in on all our big cases.

707
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,881
You've done some
very impressive work.

708
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,716
Got me promoted.

709
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,677
l thank you.

710
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,765
And my realtor really thanks you.

711
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,060
You want to tell me what I’m doing here?

712
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,813
You know,
when Washington got wind

713
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,316
of this dirty cop
shooting that grad student,

714
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,276
we had to step in.

715
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,071
A thing like that,
it messes people up.

716
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,907
They forget what side they're on.

717
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,660
They forget who the real enemy is.

718
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:50,122
Every now and then we've got
to come in and remind 'em.

719
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,585
Casanova Phillips.

720
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,591
Judge gave this scumbag
a get out of jail free card.

721
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,594
We want you to take that card away,

722
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,930
but we need evidence.

723
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:11,226
You put him on a deal
with our UCs and push it through.

724
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,770
Provide a location narco can hit.

725
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,899
Raid supplies the evidence
and I get myself a high profile arrest.

726
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,902
Yeah, well...

727
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,614
l respectfully decline your offer.

728
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:29,494
What the fuck is this?
You fucking kidding me?

729
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,917
How's Allisa your wife?

730
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,753
Oh, I’m sorry, that's soon
to be ex-wife, right?

731
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,922
Get out. Get out.

732
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,675
it’s all right. Thank you.
Just give us a minute, please.

733
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,052
l heard she's remodeling your house.

734
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,055
On a cop's salary, huh?

735
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,267
You know, a whole lot of cash

736
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,978
has passed through your hands
over the last two years.

737
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,813
l ain't stole so much as a nickel

738
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,940
since I’ve been on the job.
You ain't got shit.

739
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,818
Oh, you do not want me to put
a microscope up your ass,

740
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,321
'cause if I do, I will keep looking
until I find something.

741
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,115
- Or you plant something?
- Watch that.

742
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,661
Now you listen to me.

743
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,831
You think you're a tough guy

744
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,043
'cause you did undercover
at Clinton Correctional?

745
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,504
You even survived a little incident.

746
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,631
If you know so much about me,

747
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,967
then maybe you should
stop fucking with me.

748
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,178
If you got a case, bring it.

749
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:32,891
But until that time, step off, dude.

750
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,396
Hey! Hey!
Wait.

751
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,190
Was this shit
supposed to be serious?

752
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,567
You expect me to stand there and listen?
Get the fuck out of here.

753
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,653
Don't let her get to you.

754
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,404
Don't let her get to you, okay?

755
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,823
She's about to become the head
of the New York division too.

756
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,367
- Can you believe that?
- What'd you get out of this, Bill?

757
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,035
- What'd I get out of it?
- Yeah, you got an upgrade?

758
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,870
You gonna be sergeant?
Captain? What?

759
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,539
Take it easy.
I’m on your side.

760
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,541
Now I understand you got
a history with this Phillips.

761
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,043
He saved my fucking life, man.

762
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,213
Hey, know why I’m here?

763
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,590
You do this,
you've got detective first grade.

764
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,888
it’s real this time. Huh?

765
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,891
Approved yesterday.

766
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,728
Office of your choice.
Shift of your choice.

767
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,232
All you got to do is just get
through this one lousy thing.

768
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,069
You know, it's always
one more thing with you, Bill.

769
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,947
Hey, don't throw this away.

770
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,908
Hey, Tango.

771
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,743
Don't throw this away.
This is your life.

772
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:46,631
All right, let's up the ante.
Five buck ante.

773
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,925
Let's do it.
Let's play like men.

774
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,011
- Put your five bucks in.
- I already anted.

775
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,306
So you guys hear
the latest

776
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,641
on Bobby Powers?

777
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,144
I’m gonna slap you.
Come on.

778
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:02,272
Word is he was in on this
insurance scam with the mob.

779
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,566
He is so fucked.
Wait a minute.

780
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,611
If his old lady moves out on him
because of this, I call first dibs.

781
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,280
Come on, no wives,
no girlfriends, man.

782
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,575
So one of these wiseguys gets pinched
for some drug thing in Jersey

783
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,162
and to save his own ass he rats
on Bobby for guess what?

784
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,790
- Robbing dealers in Brooklyn.
- Prick.

785
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,877
I’ll never get that. If you're gonna do
something wrong there's a risk.

786
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,421
If you can't handle the risk,
you shouldn't do it in the first place.

787
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,965
Yeah, one bad cop
makes us all look bad.

788
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,675
Ronny, are you retarded?

789
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,302
I’m talking about the mob guy
who ratted him out.

790
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,511
Boy Scouts of America over here.

791
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,805
Girl Scout. Yo, throw me
a couple cookies, huh?

792
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,391
Come on, Ronny. These wiseguys,
they break the law to become wiseguys.

793
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,686
And then soon as shit goes bad
they break their bullshit mafia codes

794
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,606
to get witness protection under the same
laws they were breaking in the first place.

795
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,067
Wait wait wait wait.
l wasn't talking about the fucking mafia.

796
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,319
l was talking about us.
Cops.

797
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,321
l don't know about you, Pat,

798
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,491
but I think we're too good
to take drug money, right?

799
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,910
l say get off your high horse.
There's no civilians in the room.

800
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,454
- You gonna call?
- I’m in, baby.

801
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,831
- Okay.
- Read 'em and weep.

802
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,042
- You too, Brutus?
- Read 'em and weep.

803
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,045
Cheddar coming, kid.
That's it, baby.

804
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,465
Give me that money, kid.
l love the smell.

805
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,802
Would you do it? Tell 'em.
Sal, come on.

806
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,804
We all know where that money goes.

807
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,555
Better still, we know
where it doesn't go.

808
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,684
it’s not going to rehab clinics.
That money is not going to junkies

809
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,061
to help with their families.
It sure as shit is not going to us,

810
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,105
'cause I haven't had a raise
in four years, all right?

811
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,816
They got millions
of dollars sitting in an office

812
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,151
waiting to get shoveled
to the city's excess fund,

813
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,653
and you know what that is.

814
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:35,365
it’s city big shots decorating
their offices with mahogany desks

815
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,243
and Persian rugs, right?
All with drug money.

816
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,161
We risk life and limb

817
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,248
taking and giving money
to scumbags who don't deserve it.

818
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,625
So far be it for me to wag my finger

819
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,502
at somebody
who's looking out for himself.

820
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,213
You guys want to take
the soapbox away here?

821
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,048
You brought a tear
to my eye right there.

822
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,342
Hey, fuck you guys.

823
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,802
Don't act like you don't know
what I’m talking about.

824
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,722
I’m on your side.
The city's got no respect for cops.

825
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,557
l mean, what's the starting pay?

826
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,225
$20,000.

827
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,436
All right, 20 fucking grand.
Come on.

828
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,104
Who's gonna raise a family on that?

829
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,940
All right, that's it.
That's the worst part of it.

830
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,861
All right, the $1 00,000 they pay your family
if you get killed in the line of duty.

831
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,237
Fat lot of good that does anybody.

832
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,072
You're worth more to them
dead than alive, man

833
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,574
1 00K.
You know what?

834
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,243
Shoot me in the fucking face.
My girl needs a new car.

835
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,579
Hey, don't you touch that gun.

836
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,623
Again, the point that you've got to be
a fatality to provide for your kids--

837
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,001
- Daddy.
- Shit, I told you don't come down here.

838
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,462
Shit.
Nobody touch the cards or the--

839
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,715
shit, I told you
not to come down here, all right?

840
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:36,092
Nobody touch the money.
Nobody touch the cards.

841
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,428
What are you doing down here?
What, Vinny? Vinny, what?

842
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,972
Daddy, Vinny keeps coming in my room.
We're trying to get dressed.

843
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,807
What is that skirt?
What are you doing?

844
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,434
Um, what is this smoke?

845
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,352
- All right, see what I told you?
- Touché.

846
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,772
All right, don't worry about the smoke.
Don't tell your mother.

847
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,024
Here, you and Myeisha take this.

848
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,776
Go out and have
a good time, all right?

849
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,444
l love you.
Give me a kiss.

850
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,279
- Bye, Myeisha.
- Good bye.

851
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,823
- Bye, have fun.
- Change that skirt.

852
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,992
People will start to think
we're Catholic only on Sundays.

853
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,870
Yo yo, Sally Sal, I didn't realize
you were living in Harlem.

854
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,413
Watch your mouth.

855
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,290
Don't fuck around, Patrick.

856
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,876
We don't talk like that in this house.
Not in front of my kid.

857
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,128
l dig it over here
on Malcolm X Boulevard.

858
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,964
- Oh no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, my nigga.

859
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,300
- See you later, Dad.
- Hey, Pat.

860
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,052
You want me to come over there
and kick your ass?

861
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,637
- Is that what you want?
- Ooh.

862
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,306
- You know my wife is black.
- Of course I know your wife is black.

863
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,142
My shorty is black. Don't we go
shopping for cocoa butter together?

864
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,685
Now that's it!

865
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,482
- You racist prick!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

866
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,818
What the fuck, Sal?

867
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,321
Fuck you, I’m a fucking racist.
l would take a bullet for you, Sal.

868
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,491
Not in front of my kids.
l listen to your shit all day long.

869
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,785
Come on, George, get off of me.

870
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,370
What the fuck, Sal?

871
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,080
Take it outside.
Take it outside.

872
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:48,706
- You're dead, man.
- Just take him upstairs.

873
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,751
Take him upstairs for five minutes.
Just give us five minutes.

874
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,420
That's all I need is
someone fucking with my game.

875
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,925
What's going on?

876
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,469
Ronny, I’m in trouble.

877
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,596
Okay.

878
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,393
Angie's expecting twins.

879
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,486
Twins?

880
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:22,282
You lucky bastard.
Congratulations. That's a problem?

881
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,534
Ronny, I ain't got room for twins.

882
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,996
Sure you do.
You've got room here.

883
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,206
Ronny, if I don't get a new house
or get some more bread,

884
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:34,210
l got to tell one of these kids
that they got to move in with my sister.

885
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:35,378
How am I gonna do that?

886
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,881
How am I gonna tell one of 'em
that you're the one

887
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,592
that's got to go?
l can't do that.

888
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,722
You don't have to do
that right away, all right?

889
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,558
l mean, how big are twins?

890
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,059
They're like this size.

891
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,520
Keep 'em in a drawer
for the first year.

892
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,731
Don't worry about it.

893
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,025
You know what I’d give for one?

894
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,693
You're a lucky guy.

895
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,404
- You know something? You're right.
- This ain't a problem.

896
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,743
Mrs. Vincent, it's Sal.

897
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:09,245
l have the money
for the down payment.

898
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,872
You've got the whole thing?

899
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,583
No, actually I don't
have all the money.

900
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,251
Is there a problem?

901
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,753
No no, there's not a problem.

902
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,589
The situation is just complicated,
that's all, Mrs. Vincent.

903
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,930
No, I know the deadline is Tuesday.
There's no problem about the deadline.

904
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,598
I’m gonna have it well
before the deadline.

905
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,767
That's not a problem.
All right? Hand to God.

906
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,438
Oh fuck.

907
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,191
No, you don't got to keep thanking
me about the violations thing.

908
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,193
- it’s not a problem.
- I appreciate it.

909
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,779
Well, I appreciate you keeping
the house off the market for me.

910
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,573
- Otherwise I couldn't afford it.
- How can you?

911
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,825
How can I afford it?
Um...

912
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,203
You know what, Mrs. Vincent?
You hear that train?

913
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,789
l got another train coming by in
a second so why don't I just do this--

914
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,458
I’m gonna call you back
when I have all the money

915
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,085
and then we can figure out
a time to meet.

916
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,338
- Okay, God bless you.
- Okay, God bless you too, okay?

917
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,760
Shot him down! Shot him down!

918
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,349
NYPD shot him down.

919
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,017
Fuck the police.

920
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,561
Back up, please. Back up.

921
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,941
- NYPD shot him down.
- We ain't scared of you no more.

922
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,987
Officer Dugan.

923
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,615
Some guy,
l think he's the captain,

924
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,201
he said that the guy I was with
yesterday is going with your guy

925
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,078
and I’m with you.

926
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,664
l don't know why
they keep switching us.

927
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,710
Stay behind the barricade.

928
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,513
Get inside.

929
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,473
No, the other side.

930
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,519
Back up, people. Back up.

931
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,031
- Eddie Quinlan.
- Windows up.

932
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,339
Listen, kid, I’m not sure
what you did yesterday

933
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,217
or how you did it, but today we're gonna
do things a little different, all right?

934
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,304
Yeah.

935
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,223
Central Aviation 1 , be advised.

936
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,934
Verify arson explosion.
Respond with Central.

937
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,896
Copy that. All medical units respond.

938
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,149
Central Aviation 1 , be
advised I’m in the vicinity of BK housing.

939
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,817
We have an RMP on fire.

940
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,570
Part of a 904. Part of a 904.

941
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,573
Can you get
an eye on that second building?

942
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,175
Come on, cop.
l was an eyewitness.

943
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,096
So I could get--
l could get posted here?

944
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,849
This is 1 -Central. This is 1 -Central.

945
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:21,395
Any units in the vicinity
of 742 Rockaway Avenue,

946
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,648
a reported 1 0-1 0 in progress.
The owner--

947
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,868
I’m allergic to fire

948
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,579
and this gun is a lot lighter
than a mailbag.

949
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,665
You sure got everything figured out.

950
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,416
How could I not, right?

951
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,461
Just live long enough to get
a retirement good enough

952
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,131
to have a nice pension
and what else is there?

953
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,425
What are you gonna do between
now and that pension?

954
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,719
I’m gonna do the job.

955
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,721
And what's the job?

956
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,224
The job.

957
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,977
Yeah, right.
it’s not what you expect.

958
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,604
it’s never going to be.
It couldn't be.

959
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,651
Just keep your eyes open
and keep walking.

960
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,320
Whoa, you all right?

961
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,823
- I’m cool.
- Okay.

962
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,868
But I have won my appeal.

963
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,290
Oh, they can do that shit?
Appeal the appeal, huh?

964
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,418
Whatever.

965
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,920
What's up?

966
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,840
These motherfuckers is rabid, man.

967
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,509
They're thirsty.
They want to eat up all the food, man.

968
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,927
What you mean?

969
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,721
Fucking lawyer's telling me
they're talking about charging me

970
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,306
with some shit from 1 0 years ago.

971
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,933
That's just gonna get thrown out.
Don't worry about that.

972
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,394
That shit ain't gonna stick.

973
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,022
Fucking freedom ain't free, boy.
I’m telling you.

974
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,025
I’m putting these motherfucker's
grandchildren through college.

975
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,526
Hey hey hey.

976
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,362
Uniform got popped in
Bed-Stuy, didn't make it.

977
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,698
New guy, Melvin Panton.

978
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,036
Jesus fucking Christ.

979
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,377
it’s a fucking shame,

980
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,922
a young guy like that.

981
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,383
Probably just starting a family.

982
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,179
Yeah yeah, probably.
Probably did.

983
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,391
Hey, Sal.
it’s Angela.

984
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,810
- Tell her I’ll call her back.
- She says it's important.

985
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,938
All right.

986
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,233
Get up.

987
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,485
- Oh, thanks.
- Any news?

988
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,196
No, nothing. Nothing.

989
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,081
Angie's as tough as they come.
She'll pull through.

990
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,960
She'll be back to calling you
an asshole in next to no time.

991
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,091
Thanks.

992
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,551
Anytime.

993
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,680
Oh shit.

994
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,686
Yeah, hi.
How are you?

995
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,440
Yeah, I’m aware that
the deadline is tomorrow.

996
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,150
I’m well aware of that.

997
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,319
But the good news is it's all settled.

998
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,071
Uh-huh, all good. Yup.

999
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,075
No, l-- well, I can't really
talk right now.

1000
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,495
But if you call me in the AM
I’ll do it first thing.

1001
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,372
Yeah yeah yeah.
Okay.

1002
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,291
You too. Bye bye.

1003
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,048
Everything okay?

1004
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,008
Mr. Rosario.

1005
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,010
Yeah, hey. So the asthma?

1006
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,472
Well, your wife has significant traces
of wood mold in her lungs.

1007
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,224
- Wood mold.
- When you have wood inside your house

1008
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,810
- the particles travel in the air--
- I know all about the mold.

1009
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,645
Well, if your wife's case,
because of her asthma

1010
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,148
her lungs are working three times
as hard as they should,

1011
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,942
which is jeopardizing her and the twins.

1012
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,197
One of the babies is significantly
smaller than the other.

1013
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,657
- But they're okay though?
- For now.

1014
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,619
Mr. Rosario, have you
considered moving?

1015
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,791
Yeah, I have.

1016
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,994
- Fuck you, man. Fuck you.
- Whoa whoa.

1017
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,414
Whoa whoa whoa!

1018
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,583
He accused me
of stealing fucking candy.

1019
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,752
Stop. Whoa! Whoa!

1020
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,921
Hey hey! Stop!

1021
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,257
Calm down, everybody.

1022
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,760
Just...

1023
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,263
You hear me now?
Huh?

1024
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,932
We got this shit working like clockwork.

1025
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,059
You want to go and fuck up our money?

1026
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,562
Get your little bitch ass up, man.

1027
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,189
- Don't kill me.
- What'd you tell them niggas, huh?

1028
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,984
- Don't kill me, man.
- I can send your ass.

1029
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,945
Uh-huh, I hope your ass
can fly, nigga.

1030
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,572
Do your little ass dirty.

1031
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,951
Go go go.

1032
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,329
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get the fuck down.

1033
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,707
Stay the fuck down
and keep your mouth shut.

1034
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,959
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me.

1035
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,428
Get that shit in the bag.
Get it in the bag. Hurry up.

1036
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:29,180
Here they come.
Come on.

1037
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,447
Freeze!

1038
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,324
Go, move move move!

1039
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,118
Let's go.

1040
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,496
Fuck.

1041
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,247
See, I need you to think about it.

1042
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,791
Think about it real good
and hard, man,

1043
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,335
before you fuck with my money.

1044
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,920
Look at me.
Look at me, motherfucker.

1045
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,338
Look at me.
I’m not playing with you, nigga.

1046
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:04,632
l will burn you
in your motherfucking eye.

1047
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,342
What did you say
to the fucking police?

1048
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,053
- You first, what happened?
- He put candy in his pocket--

1049
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,971
Yo, man, why you
asking him first, man?

1050
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,516
- Just relax.
- This is bullshit.

1051
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,518
- What happened?
- He came in and put candy in his pocket.

1052
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,144
That's a damn lie.
l didn't take shit from you.

1053
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,105
- You take candy.
- Hey, I said shut up.

1054
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,149
It was candy?

1055
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,861
Put the gun down.
Motherfucker, get on the ground.

1056
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,863
Get on the ground.
Put that gun down.

1057
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,950
Get the fuck off me! Get off me!

1058
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,036
Drop it. Drop your gun.
Let's see your hands.

1059
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,539
Let's see your fucking hands.
Do not even think about it.

1060
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,752
C-Rayz, get over here.
Give me some cuffs.

1061
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,797
Put the fucking guns down.
Don't you fucking resist.

1062
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,632
Up against the wall.

1063
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,652
Let's just shoot this nigga, man.

1064
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,946
He's bleeding all over my shirt.

1065
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,281
Red.

1066
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,245
- What's up?
- Man, this motherfucker ain't--

1067
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,750
What, y'all switch your names now?

1068
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,961
l thought your name was, uh,

1069
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,380
K-Pebbles or something.

1070
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,009
Your name's now Red?

1071
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,927
No.

1072
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,180
Oh.

1073
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,267
Oh, you're Red.

1074
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,815
Caz man, this is
the snitch nigger right here.

1075
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:48,402
This is the motherfucking reason why
police are running up on us and shit.

1076
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,446
This motherfucker right here.

1077
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,615
Fucking-- the whips,
the stash, everything, man.

1078
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,074
We've got to switch up
the whole operation.

1079
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,747
You fucking want to shoot a cop,
motherfucker?

1080
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,457
Show me your
fucking hands, asshole.

1081
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,209
Give me your fucking hands.
Call me a pig?

1082
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,128
l hope he's gonna pay
for the strap on my book bag.

1083
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,464
- Hey, I don't want to say this again--
- Fuck you, man!

1084
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,092
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Look me in the eyes.

1085
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,928
Do you want a friend?
l could be your friend.

1086
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,306
Okay? We'll work this out.

1087
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,310
Yeah, everything's fine.
We're gonna work this out.

1088
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,896
I’m gonna go check his ID.

1089
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,690
Just keep everybody calm.

1090
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,692
Yeah, all right.

1091
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,655
No no, you go check, I’m staying.

1092
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,406
- Eddie, come on.
- I want you to go.

1093
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,158
Eddie, don't embarrass me.
I’ve got it.

1094
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,083
Hey, man, that's a good kid.

1095
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,334
He ain't do nothing.

1096
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,087
Fuck you, pig.
Get the fuck out of here.

1097
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,733
Come in, Central.

1098
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,320
it’s been three years
since we got raided.

1099
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,406
About that.

1100
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,783
But look, man, you let them
kill this little kid,

1101
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,452
that ain't gonna do shit
but bring heat to the neighborhood.

1102
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,204
You know that, B.

1103
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,293
How come this dude is always
trying to avoid shit, man?

1104
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,546
Answer me that.
Y'all don't catch that shit?

1105
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,549
Come on, Caz. Every time it's time
to put some work in, Tango,

1106
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,801
you're always trying to preach
some turn-the-other-cheek shit.

1107
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,011
What up with that, bro?
Yo, Caz, this your man and all.

1108
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,638
l don't give a fuck how many
guns I’ve seen him hold.

1109
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,141
l ain't seen you bust
a motherfucking thing, bro.

1110
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,560
For all we know,
you could be the bitch ass--

1111
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,103
Motherfucker!

1112
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,355
Now you want
to see me bust, motherfucker?

1113
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,233
You want me to make that shit official?
Say some shit.

1114
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,694
I’ll put a fucking hole in you, bitch.

1115
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,571
- Say something.
- Kick back.

1116
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,197
l want to kill you so bad right now.

1117
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,825
l said kick the fuck back.

1118
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,348
Please, man, I didn't take shit.

1119
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,477
l got enough money right here
to buy you, your family and a Slurpee.

1120
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,978
He threatened my family.

1121
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,605
- He threatened my family.
- Fuck your family, man.

1122
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,274
- Wait a second here.
- You put candy in your bag.

1123
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,152
Get off the bag.
Get off the bag right now!

1124
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,326
Fuck it, Caz.
What you want to do, man?

1125
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,625
Pick this motherfucker up.

1126
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:53,378
- Your legs work, stand up.
- No, man. No, man.

1127
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,631
- Think this is a fucking game?
- You think we're playing?

1128
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,217
- You been talking, man?
- Yeah, he's been talking.

1129
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,261
Answer the question, man.
Answer the question.

1130
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:05,057
They were gonna shoot me.
They were gonna shoot me.

1131
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,687
- No, man.
- Gonna ask you one more time.

1132
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,148
You been talking?
You been talking?

1133
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,442
No, man. No, man.

1134
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,488
Get your grill fixed, man.

1135
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,823
- What?
- You believe this shit?

1136
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,909
- Come on, man.
- Red, you see this?

1137
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,661
Go kiss your mama.

1138
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,496
Snitch ass.

1139
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,665
Can't believe
we ain't murdered this nigger.

1140
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,462
How many times I got to tell you?
Get out of here.

1141
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,049
All right, I asked you to put it down.
Why you got to go and get the bag?

1142
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,010
- I ain't do nothing, man.
- Give me your arms.

1143
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,263
l tried to be nice to you, all right?
l gave you a chance.

1144
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,849
- I gave you a chance.
- Oh fuck.

1145
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,854
Sal, what are you doing?

1146
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,649
- Ah!
- What the fuck?

1147
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:59,027
- C-Rayz, make sure he's down.
- Yeah yeah, he's down.

1148
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,697
l didn't even fucking see that guy.
Is he down?

1149
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,699
Holy fuck.

1150
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,343
No one's holding you responsible.

1151
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,597
Why are you so adamant
on taking blame?

1152
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,474
Because I knew I should have stayed.

1153
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,853
You knew your fellow officer

1154
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,731
would pull his gun
on a crowd of unarmed kids?

1155
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,400
And then let off two shots

1156
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,569
within inches of this kid's head?

1157
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,239
l knew I should have stayed
and I didn't.

1158
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,159
l just...

1159
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,621
l let it go--
just let it go.

1160
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,962
Ahem.

1161
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,881
This student,

1162
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:02,966
he had $400

1163
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,219
and an ounce of marijuana
in his possession.

1164
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,183
Is it possible that Officer Quinlan

1165
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:15,103
was overzealous in apprehending
a known drug suspect?

1166
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,942
And said drug suspect's fear

1167
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,194
of a felony charge

1168
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,279
led him to resist arrest.

1169
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,119
Officer Quinlan
shouldn't have been there.

1170
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,312
You've been
an officer long enough to know

1171
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,315
that Quinlan was the casualty
of a bad shooting.

1172
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:06,655
A casualty needed to preserve
the trust of the public.

1173
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,243
We need this to be drug related.

1174
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:15,831
We need a decorated officer's
testimony to back that up.

1175
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,959
Now while your service record is not

1176
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,670
commendable or extraordinary,

1177
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,839
it will satisfy.

1178
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:27,175
So would you please,

1179
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,844
for the record,

1180
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:31,847
recount the events
of that day in question?

1181
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,319
Fuck you.

1182
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,780
He shouldn't have been there.

1183
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,870
Could you inform Officer Dugan

1184
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,165
that this board can bring him up
on departmental charges?

1185
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,668
Let me remind you
he retires in a few days.

1186
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,107
- Hey, kid.
- Quinlan.

1187
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,402
- You'll do fine.
- Let's go.

1188
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,988
- Sorry.
- You'll do fine.

1189
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,576
Come on.

1190
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,048
Hi, it's me again.

1191
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,759
Today's the day
when everything goes down.

1192
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,970
Please let me know. My son has to
go ahead with the sale of the house.

1193
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,811
- Hey.
- Great thinking out there today.

1194
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,897
Listen. Let me know if you want
to get out of this raid tonight.

1195
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:07,400
- I’ll make sure you get paid.
- Nah, that's-- I’m good. I’m good.

1196
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,444
Good one.

1197
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,781
- Gentlemen, nice job there today.
- Captain.

1198
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,116
You made me proud.

1199
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,701
- Sal, you look like shit.
- Take some vitamins, G.

1200
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,124
Here you are, man.

1201
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,127
Thanks for watching my back, Sal.

1202
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,963
l heard they're gonna pin
a medal on you, bro.

1203
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,881
If I had given it
a second thought,

1204
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,092
l wouldn't have lifted a finger for you.

1205
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,511
l would've done
what I came there to do, all right?

1206
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,390
So don't go patting me
on the back, all right?

1207
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,100
l don't deserve it.

1208
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:55,115
You know what
them fucking Mexicans do?

1209
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:58,535
The Mexicans-- them motherfuckers
will wrap you up in plastic,

1210
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,204
throw some taco sauce
and gasoline on the motherfucker

1211
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,039
and burn your ass up.

1212
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,542
The fucking Dominicans--

1213
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,794
they take pliers,
put 'em on your nuts,

1214
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,005
squeeze your nuts like a walnut.

1215
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,508
And then they throw fucking
taco sauce and gasoline on the plastic

1216
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,594
and burn your ass up.

1217
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,430
The Columbians--

1218
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,516
the Columbians?
And I’m just a connect.

1219
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:23,185
What you think
they gonna do to me?

1220
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,563
- Yeah, I know, man.
- I’ve gotta deal with this shit, man.

1221
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,692
Fuck. And then
fucking Red pulling his bullshit?

1222
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,319
This nigga Red, man--

1223
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,196
tired of playing the two-gun.

1224
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,865
Motherfucker want to be
Kobe Bryant up in this bitch.

1225
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,201
What, you think I didn't see that?

1226
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,954
So what you saying?
Hmm?

1227
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,456
Since I’ve been eight down-- what?

1228
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,291
l don't know
what the fuck is going on?

1229
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,543
l just hit the block
with my eyes wide shut, right?

1230
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,962
Nah nah, Caz.
l know you know what it is.

1231
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,051
You know what it is.

1232
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,223
l did think he was gonna toss
youngblood over though.

1233
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,934
Why? He ain't the one snitching.

1234
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,436
Somebody is, though.

1235
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,397
You'd better believe that.
But it ain't him.

1236
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,652
I’m tired of this shit, man.

1237
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,571
I’m trying to do some other shit.

1238
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,866
What the fuck?
And these motherfuckers are trying

1239
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:23,370
to make it their business
to lock me the fuck up.

1240
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,914
Caz, look here, man.

1241
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:31,795
l know a way you can shut
this whole thing down

1242
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,630
and still make your paper.

1243
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,257
How's that?

1244
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,217
These cats I know uptown--

1245
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:39,636
they want
to buy from us, wholesale.

1246
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:43,098
They're at the table asking 1 0 bricks, hard.
You just gotta meet 'em.

1247
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,642
Are we on the same fucking planet?

1248
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,269
Buddy, I just got the fuck out.

1249
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,396
Caz. Listen, man.

1250
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,398
What the fuck?
Why not now?

1251
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,778
How much longer you gonna be dodging
bullets out here in these streets, man?

1252
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,073
How long before one
of these motherfucking knuckleheads

1253
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,533
catches us slipping,

1254
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,119
put one in the back
of our fucking heads?

1255
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,329
l ain't got to tell you.

1256
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:07,789
You already know.

1257
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,125
These streets got
an expiration date on them.

1258
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,296
Tango, you trust
these motherfuckers?

1259
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,589
- Yeah. Hell yeah.
- "Hell yeah"?

1260
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,259
- That ain't sound real confident.
- Yeah, I trust 'em, man.

1261
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,511
l wouldn't even come to you
with this unless I did.

1262
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:26,016
You take this shit,
the whole cut for yourself

1263
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,976
and you vanish.

1264
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,812
Fuck these streets.

1265
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,480
Get ghost, right?

1266
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,774
You're goddamn right, get ghost.

1267
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,819
Be a ghost and be a legend
at the same time.

1268
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,450
You already know.

1269
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,913
Set it up.

1270
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,795
Record activate.

1271
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:22,549
Record activate.

1272
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,593
Four.

1273
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,208
Hey, Caz. Hey.

1274
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,378
- Welcome back.
- What up, Tango?

1275
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,465
Hey, baby.

1276
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,925
- What's up, man?
- Yes yes.

1277
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,011
- it’s all great.
- I’ll tell you, man--

1278
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:09,512
when y'all whipping pass go on the low--

1279
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,973
whoo-- y'all motherfuckers
go on the low.

1280
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:15,518
This is Gutta and Slim.

1281
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,648
Lemme tell you one thing, man.

1282
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,735
Giuliani didn't clean up the city.

1283
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:27,405
Video games and television did it.

1284
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,324
That's what cleaned up the streets.

1285
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:32,660
Come on, man. 'Cause y'all remember
when everybody was outside.

1286
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,412
If you was two years old,

1287
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,998
if you was 1 02,
you was outside.

1288
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,460
- Shit.
- So like me,

1289
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,840
l like the time when everybody
was face to face, you know?

1290
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,551
That's how I like to do my business--

1291
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,262
face to face.

1292
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,182
See, Caz,
the way we like to do things is

1293
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:58,186
- we like to come together--
- How long y'all be knowing Tango, man?

1294
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,816
You know how he got his name?

1295
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,361
- Don't tell that fucking story, man.
- No no, it's all good.

1296
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,656
- No no. Yeah.
- In my man's hood,

1297
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:14,160
the boy had the nicest pair of hands
in the whole neighborhood.

1298
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,538
He would--
he had this little standoff shit

1299
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,540
where he would square off on a cat

1300
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,875
and he had this little slow rock.
You know what I’m saying?

1301
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,961
Cats would be mouthing off to him,
he'd just, you know,

1302
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,129
keep his head down a little bit
under the eye of the motherfucker

1303
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,714
like this. All of a sudden--
bong bong!

1304
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,591
--two right to the mouth,
you know what I mean?

1305
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,843
He's about to fucking tango
or rock the boy--

1306
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,220
l don't know what the fuck
he gonna do. it’s his style.

1307
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:36,015
This shit right here-- like he about
to start tangoing or something, yo.

1308
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:39,269
It was nice though. It was nice.

1309
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:41,854
Yeah yeah.

1310
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:46,609
Gutta, what kind
of whip you pushing, man?

1311
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,528
Oh, man.

1312
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,698
l drive an Audi A8.

1313
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:58,621
- I want it.
- Cool.

1314
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,418
No, I mean,
l want you to let me borrow it.

1315
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,588
You borrow mine
and we give it back the next day.

1316
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,590
See, that way

1317
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,552
we can make sure you get
everything you asking for.

1318
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,762
And we get the same.

1319
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,766
Feel me? And I get
the chance to test-drive your shit.

1320
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,063
What about price?

1321
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,482
We already talked
to Tango about that.

1322
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,027
Since you his people,
why don't we just keep it steady?

1323
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,407
Well...

1324
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,660
you name the place
and you name the time.

1325
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,292
Let's bring it in.

1326
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,464
There it is.

1327
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,352
Let me get-- let me get
by you real quick, man.

1328
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,813
- Oh, Tango, you had enough?
- I’m good, B.

1329
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,982
I’ll be back in a minute.

1330
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,151
Fucking lightweight, right?

1331
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,272
- Yo, I’m in here, man.
- Man, I gotta take a piss.

1332
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,318
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!

1333
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,707
Got everything here--

1334
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,585
the riot helmet, the mace,

1335
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,714
patrol guide,

1336
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,007
shield.

1337
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,216
You're done.

1338
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,929
That's it?

1339
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,766
Yeah, that's it.

1340
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,935
Yeah. Gotta take a leak.

1341
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,800
- Hello.
- Bill.

1342
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,427
- it’s Clarence.
- What's going on?

1343
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:43,054
Listen.

1344
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,349
I’m out, man.

1345
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,643
Uh-huh. Meet me at Joey's.
Let's get a coffee.

1346
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,187
Nah, I don't want to meet you.
There ain't nothing to talk about, okay?

1347
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,480
it’s over. I’m off the case.

1348
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,816
Now if the feds wanna charge me,
they can do that.

1349
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,567
Whatever else comes down,
I’ll deal with it, okay?

1350
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,486
But I’m done, man.
I’m off the case.

1351
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,780
You know, I told 'em
that you'd see this through to the end,

1352
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,157
but they knew better.
They prepared for this. She expected this.

1353
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,992
They got their evidence.
They don't need you anymore.

1354
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,537
- This is gonna happen.
- When?

1355
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,497
l don't want you anywhere
near this anymore, okay?

1356
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,624
Bill!
When are you moving on Caz?

1357
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,209
You listen to me.
Stay away from it, Clarence.

1358
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,511
- Gonna do you, son.
- There you go. There you go.

1359
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,514
- Ah!
- In your face, bitch.

1360
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,184
Yo, you seen Caz?

1361
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,103
l don't know, son.
it’s hot out here right now.

1362
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,146
- I don't know what to tell you, son.
- You ain't seen him?

1363
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,357
l thought you wasn't coming
around out here today, Tango.

1364
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:39,527
Hey, ain't gotta talk to me like that.

1365
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:53,541
Yo, we out of here.

1366
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,855
- All right.
- Yeah, you know.

1367
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,189
- Yeah.
- I knew that man.

1368
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,734
- What's up?
- I’ve been looking for you, calling you.

1369
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:21,569
- That phone card shit don't work.
- We gotta get some paper together.

1370
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,696
You gotta get the fuck up
outta Dodge right now, B.

1371
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:26,073
- Why?
- 'Cause there's a problem with the deal.

1372
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,909
No no, there ain't no problem, man.

1373
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,827
Ain't no problem I can't fix.

1374
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,662
- Caz.
- Look, we getting this money.

1375
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,373
No, listen to me.
You cannot take this fucking deal.

1376
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,959
Caz, listen to me.
You cannot take this deal.

1377
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,129
Why, Tango?

1378
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,590
Can we just take a ride, please?

1379
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:50,264
Caz, please. Let's just--
let's just take a ride, man.

1380
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,436
Yeah, let's take a ride.
Come on, man. I’m hungry.

1381
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,780
Caz.

1382
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,119
Fuck!

1383
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,463
Aw, shit!

1384
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,757
What the fuck?
What happened, man?

1385
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:27,760
- Go get fucking help, man!
- Call 91 1 !

1386
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,762
- Go get the car!
- Fucking go get the car, man!

1387
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,640
Don't just stand the fuck around!
Go get some help, man!

1388
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:36,310
Go get some fucking help!
Go get some help, man! Get the car!

1389
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,270
You've got to go.
Come on. You've got to go.

1390
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,314
I’ve got this.
You've got to go. Come on.

1391
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:44,360
Come on!
Go ahead! Call 91 1 .

1392
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,858
Everybody give us some room.
Johnny, can you clear the room?

1393
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:26,485
- I saw y'all out there. Y'all were out there.
- I tried to reach you.

1394
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,321
The whole block gets shot up, y'all just
sit there, don't do nothing about it?

1395
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:30,865
- Are you all right?
- No, I’m not all right.

1396
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,950
- I almost got my damn head blown off.
- Calm down.

1397
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,703
We didn't know anything about it
till after it happened, okay?

1398
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,288
- He's probably gonna--
- Your man Red tried to steal the deal

1399
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:40,166
for himself, plain and simple.
He contacted our UC.

1400
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,709
We didn't know he was
gonna shoot up Phillips.

1401
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,544
- Now did you get hit?
- The fuck you care?

1402
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,422
All right, let's stay with the ball here.
Now you know this Red.

1403
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,549
He's got a few priors,
so he's in our system.

1404
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:51,302
What the fuck are you talking about Red? That's
some petty project bullshit.

1405
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,346
Now my case was with Phillips.
He's either dead or a vegetable.

1406
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,766
- I’m done here.
- So Red gets a pass?

1407
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:01,228
- That it? Red gets a fucking pass?!
- Okay okay! Calm--

1408
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,314
- just calm down.
- Congratulations.

1409
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,567
You managed to come all the way up here
and not do one damn bit of police work!

1410
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,277
I’m doing police work,

1411
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,697
but that doesn't mean I go back
in the jungle and clean up monkey shit.

1412
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:13,657
Hey! No!

1413
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,576
- Hey!
- Motherfucker.

1414
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:18,579
Get your fucking hands off of me.

1415
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,915
- Easy!
- That's enough! That's enough!

1416
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,459
Stop. I got it.
Hey! All right!

1417
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:27,046
Hey, you are--
you are off undercover immediately!

1418
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:29,757
Now you go see
the psych doctor for two weeks.

1419
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:34,261
And you might've-- you might've
fucked yourself out of detective.

1420
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,347
No he didn't.

1421
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:38,599
l should've made
this motherfucker sergeant.

1422
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,231
Jesus Christ.

1423
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,734
Are you finished
with your self-righteous bullshit, man?

1424
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,779
You're nobody's victim.

1425
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,532
You wanted undercover,
you pushed to make grade

1426
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,451
and you got it!
Do you understand?

1427
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,245
You made it. You got it.

1428
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:00,955
You got it.

1429
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:04,333
You got what you asked for.

1430
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,712
Take your life back.
Take your life back.

1431
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,175
Take my fucking life back?

1432
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:16,637
Huh? Take my fucking life back?

1433
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:17,364
Yeah.
Don't stop. Yeah.

1434
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,618
- You like that shit, baby?
- Yeah.

1435
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,828
- Feels good, baby?
- Yeah, it feels so good.

1436
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:24,914
- Yeah, you like it deep.
- Yeah.

1437
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:27,374
- You like it deep?
- Yeah. Oh.

1438
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,211
Oh, that's my papa.

1439
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,171
Oh, yeah.
Make it feel good.

1440
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:32,356
Eddie, I’m in here.

1441
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:34,358
Hey.

1442
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,611
Hey, Papa.
Sorry you had to see that.

1443
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,405
it’s all right.

1444
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:42,116
No judgments here.

1445
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:48,998
it’s your fault.
You know you came kind of early.

1446
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,791
You're right.

1447
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,313
Hi.

1448
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,705
Are you all right?

1449
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,023
What you doing?

1450
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:05,032
l got you something.

1451
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,620
Wow.
Expensive, huh?

1452
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,580
You see how much money
you pay me?

1453
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,668
What's that say?

1454
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:19,338
"We've got nothing but time,

1455
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:21,215
but time won't give us time."

1456
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,509
You know,
that's an old Boy George song.

1457
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:26,261
You probably don't know it, right?

1458
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,348
it reminds me of you.

1459
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,392
Come with me.

1460
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:36,814
Come on.
To Connecticut?

1461
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:41,110
Connecticut, anywhere.
It doesn't matter to me.

1462
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:43,445
l don't care.
l just want to be with you.

1463
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,785
Eddie, I-- I, uh...

1464
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:54,581
you don't know what you want.

1465
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,836
l don't know how to be,

1466
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,213
you know,
what you want me to be.

1467
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,757
What you are is fine with me.

1468
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:08,720
Better than fine.

1469
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,465
Eddie, leave.

1470
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,759
Go.

1471
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,645
- Look at me.
- No, get the fuck out.

1472
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:10,407
Okay.

1473
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,577
Thanks for the watch.

1474
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,343
All right, listen up.

1475
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:19,429
l just got the call.
The operation's scrubbed.

1476
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,516
- Oh!
- Since you're on the clock anyway,

1477
01:40:22,684 --> 01:40:26,353
why don't you get some buy money,
do some B&Bs on Pittman?

1478
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,438
- Svaldi?
- Yes, sir.

1479
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:30,190
- My office first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

1480
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:33,402
- C-Rayz, you down?
- Hey, Ronny, gonna hit the titty bar.

1481
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,986
- You wanna go?
- No, later.

1482
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:38,281
C-Rayz, let's go, babe.

1483
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:40,701
No, sir.
I’m going home to see my lady.

1484
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,536
Peace, man.

1485
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,548
Sal.

1486
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:57,843
Sal, your phone.

1487
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,389
Hello.

1488
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:04,224
Hey, Angie,
it's Ronny.

1489
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,685
l don't know.
He just stepped out.

1490
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,437
He left his cell behind.

1491
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,896
Uh-huh.

1492
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:13,108
To tell you the truth, Angie, I don't know
what's been going on with him lately.

1493
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,493
Angie, let me call you back
later on, all right?

1494
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,621
Yeah, don't worry.
I’ve got it covered. All right, bye.

1495
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,647
Huh? What the fuck?
Are you following me? Huh?

1496
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,482
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Are you following me?

1497
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,234
- Yeah, I’m following you.
- You lnternal Affairs now?

1498
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:38,610
- Are you IA?
- IA?

1499
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,987
Are you IA?!
What, are you wired?

1500
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,447
- Let's see this.
- Check. Go ahead.

1501
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:45,492
- You wanna have a look, have a look.
- Don't fuck with me right now.

1502
