1
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:15,724
- Let me put your jacket on, Sam.
- No, no.

2
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:20,079
- Come on, sweetie. Come on.
- I don't want to.

3
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,800
- You taking off, Karen?
- Trying to.

4
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,042
- Need a hand?
- Would you mind?

5
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,647
Are you giving your mommy
a hard time?

6
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,803
- No.
- You'll let Carter do it?

7
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,442
There you go.
Amy, did you say hi to Sam?

8
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,284
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Amy.

9
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,966
- Darn.
- Something wrong?

10
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,717
No, no. Jenny was supposed
to pick us up half an hour ago.

11
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,565
She probably got delayed
at the hospital.

12
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,883
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- That would be great!

13
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,080
He is such an amazing kid.
You've done a great job with him.

14
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:55,719
Please.

15
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,804
Do you realise how important
these early years are?

16
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,361
Are you kidding?
I've read all the books

17
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:05,764
and I get all the expert advice
I can handle from my mother-in-law.

18
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:09,163
I know what you mean.
I've seen her in action. Oh, boy.

19
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,721
Don't you have
any know-it-all relatives?

20
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,600
My father wrote the book
on child development.

21
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,922
Fortunately, it's in Norwegian.

22
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,356
What does he say on the subject?
In English.

23
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,001
- What does he not have to say?
- That bad?

24
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:25,437
Actually, he's one of
the most visionary men in his field.

25
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,718
He heads a child-development clinic
outside of Oslo.

26
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,803
We're taking Amy there next week.

27
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:34,840
Jenny never said anything about
Amy going to a clinic in Norway.

28
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:38,641
It would be a great
opportunity for you and Sam.

29
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:43,920
- I think Sam's a little young.
- I don't know. A big boy like Sam?

30
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:47,642
What's so visionary
about your dad's clinic, anyway?

31
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:52,044
First of all, it's in a beautiful,
natural country setting.

32
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,443
Amy will be supervised
by a team of child psychologists

33
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,682
who record her progress hourly.

34
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:00,366
But you can't study child development

35
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,160
and think anyone
is gonna take it seriously

36
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,641
if you only have one subject.

37
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,996
It's just another case history.

38
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,881
So, what we're setting up is
a control group of gifted children.

39
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:16,159
We'll need at least five, none
of them older than three years old.

40
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,438
- That's why I want Sam...
- To be your guinea pig?

41
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:23,082
- Carter, you got to be kidding.
- No.

42
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:26,437
Nobody will send their kid
to some snake pit in Norway

43
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:30,446
- for some developmental study.
- It's not a snake pit.

44
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:34,718
Do you think I'd let Amy go
unless it was completely safe?

45
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,759
No! But I can't believe
Jenny agrees with it.

46
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,116
- Just forget it.
- Don't get mad.

47
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,121
- Bless you.
- I'm not mad. 

48
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,482
We're friends, remember?

49
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:52,520
And as a friend, I'm telling you
the whole idea is crazy.

50
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:57,402
Why would any sane parent
allow their kid to be part of that?

51
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:01,963
Do you realise no one knows anything
about personality development?

52
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:04,646
Everything has been pure conjecture.

53
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:09,715
All we psychiatrists do is chase cows
after the barn door has been opened.

54
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:15,042
For the first time,
we'll be able to observe what happens

55
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:19,000
and precisely monitor
the psychological consequences.

56
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,878
Not with my kid, you don't.

57
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,519
- Oh!

58
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,364
- Sorry.
- It's in my eyes!

59
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,602
I got the wheel.

60
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,438
I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:36,639
- Karen...are you all right?
- I've got something in my eye.

62
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:39,155
- It hurts.
- Let me have a look.

63
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:43,837
Look up. Now look down.
It's just the tiniest bit of dirt.

64
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:47,721
- It hurts!
- Just keep your eyes closed.

65
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,679
I'll get a...a tissue.

66
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,639
- Are the kids OK?
- Don't move! They're fine.

67
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:59,043
They're fine!So sorry. I'm so sorry.

68
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,360
What's that smell?.

69
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,883
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

70
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,365
- Kiss her.
- What?

71
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,796
In five seconds those guys
will be in your face

72
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:08,157
and what do you look like, killer?
Go on, kiss her!

73
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:17,006
Ooh!Well done.

74
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,245
- When did you get out?
- Move over.

75
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:38,205
Isn't this pleasant?
We just gonna sit here all day?

76
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:42,240
- What are you doing here?
- I'm saving your ass, that's what.

77
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:47,441
I was supposed to be an observer.
What I'm observing is very odd.

78
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:51,719
Twins chatting in the front,
the driver slumped over the wheel.

79
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,361
- What is wrong with this?
- I don't need you!

80
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,240
"I don't need you!"

81
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:02,205
Let's get out of here, Carter,
before we're seen...

82
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,478
because, believe me,
we'll be remembered.

83
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,527
Drop me at the corner.
I could use a drink.

84
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,206
- Don't follow me.
- "Don't follow me."

85
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:14,999
- Stop that!
- "Stop that."

86
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,845
All right, all right.

87
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,316
- Jesus.
- Oh, Carter...

88
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,358
you're a thankless dope.

89
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,838
I was only trying to help,
which, of course, I did.

90
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,879
This thing you're doing
means everything to the old man

91
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,997
and you can't fuck it up.

92
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,720
- I'm not fucking anything up.
- Oh, really?

93
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,998
What were you planning on doing
with the little missus?

94
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,242
I'm gonna...

95
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,085
take her back to the park
and leave her there.

96
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:48,278
Very good. I see you've got this
all thought out!

97
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,876
"Take her back to the park
and leave her there." Then what?

98
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,395
When the chloroform wears off,
she'll be fine.

99
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:58,406
- And the cops will come for you.
- I won't hurt her!

100
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,245
You won't hurt her, she'll hurt you!

101
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:07,958
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

102
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:11,397
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
- What?

103
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:16,121
First, stop at your place.
I need to get out of these clothes.

104
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:20,479
- And then you need to get lost.
- And then what?

105
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,562
The cat's in the bag...

106
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,996
and the bag is in the river.

107
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:37,363
I've been up all night
with Mrs Bellor.

108
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:39,841
The radiation seems to be working.

109
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,879
I'm gonna lie down
before I take her for her checkup.

110
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,122
Isn't she beautiful?.

111
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,795
Oh, Dr Nix. Oh, how horny we are.

112
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,845
Ow!You're hurting me.

113
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,641
That's all right. I'll get her.

114
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,715
You just wait here.

115
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,564
OK.

116
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:36,199
'Mommy! Mommy!'

117
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:51,246
Mommy!

118
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:56,407
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!

119
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,438
Shut up!

120
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,398
Stop that.

121
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:44,158
I was afraid of this.

122
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:48,359
I wanted him to do this himself.
I didn't want you to help him.

123
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:52,002
Gee, Daddy,
I was only trying to help out.

124
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,925
If I hadn't been there,
we'd all be fucked.

125
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,084
Carter's an amateur.
He panicked.

126
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,197
Oh, stop it!

127
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,238
I know you, Cain.

128
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,041
Carter weakened and you stepped in.

129
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,200
We all know your tough-guy act.

130
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,846
But we don't need
a loose cannon here.

131
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,718
Carter can finish this himself.

132
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:25,476
Let me tell you something, Doctor.
I know Carter wants to help

133
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:29,645
but we're talking about stealing kids
and experimenting on them.

134
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,996
You may need this "loose cannon".

135
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:37,167
You should never have gotten out.
You're nothing but a cheap hoodlum.

136
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,118
I am what you made me, Dad.

137
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,159
- Shut up and finish your drink.
- I already have.

138
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,835
Then let me get you another.

139
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:55,196
You know...

140
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:58,239
you could get us all
put away for good.

141
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,081
There's no jail that can hold me.

142
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,766
I'm the escape artist, remember?

143
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:09,322
I learned it breaking out of
all those cages you locked me in.

144
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,722
They were not cages!

145
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,043
They were a specially designed
infant environment.

146
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:18,796
- They were cages!
- Hush. You'll wake the child.

147
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:23,083
But hey,
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

148
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:27,166
After all, where would I be
without you, Baumse?

149
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,158
You wouldn't exist.

150
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,641
That's right
but I do exist, don't I?

151
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:38,396
I'm that fucked-up experiment
of yours that won't go away.

152
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:44,044
Hickory dickory dock. Cain
has picked his lock. I'm out of here.

153
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:47,159
The cat's in the bag
and the bag is going in the river.

154
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,198
So don't fuck with me, Dad!

155
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,683
You may lose more than
your licence this time.

156
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,438
Have you talked to the others?

157
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,641
- About what?
- About what we are doing.

158
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:15,884
(Laughs ) Are you kidding?
If Margo finds out...

159
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:24,481
- What did you put in this?
- Just something to relax you.

160
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,882
You fucking...

161
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,241
I want you to sleep now, Cain.

162
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:52,443
You've done a good job
but we don't need you any more.

163
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,600
I want you to relax and sleep.

164
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,921
Carter can handle everything now.

165
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:04,555
Daddy, I want to pick the flowers.

166
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,997
We don't pick 'em, sweetie.
We just look at them.

167
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,038
I'm going to take her outside.

168
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,317
- I'll take her.
- No, you finish up.

169
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,916
We'll be fine. We're going to
go look at the flowers.

170
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,001
- Would you like that gift-wrapped?
- Yes. Thank you.

171
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,356
I'll be right back.

172
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,877
That's what I would buy
for the man in my life.

173
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:55,560
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

174
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,518
After the funeral...

175
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,837
I was a block of ice.

176
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:16,563
I couldn't bear to feel,
so I felt nothing.

177
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,286
I'm sorry I made such a mess of it.

178
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:28,955
I'm staying at the Garden Court.
If you wanted to just talk...

179
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,805
I'll be there tonight. We could...

180
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:39,686
I saw you come in with Carter
and your little girl.

181
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,878
I guess I just didn't thaw out
fast enough.

182
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,521
- Here's a flower for you, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

183
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:17,286
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

184
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:20,000
- I mean, no.
- Are you all right? You look upset.

185
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,039
No, I'm fine.
I'm just not finished.

186
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,442
Take Amy to the park
and I'll catch up.

187
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,206
No, it's going to rain.
We're going to go home.

188
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:31,238
But don't be too long.

189
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,324
Amy needs to spend more time
with her mommy.

190
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,165
- More quality time.
- I'll be home soon.

191
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,801
We'll have plenty of time
for quality time.

192
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,486
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mommy.

193
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:56,763
- Miss?
- Yes?

194
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,684
I'd like this one also, please.

195
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,205
'Mr Dante isn't answering.'

196
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:30,446
Tell him that Jenny O'Keefe called
and that I have his keys.

197
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:36,278
And I can meet him at O'Keefe Park...
Camino Park at one.

198
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,761
If he can meet me by the playground.

199
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,958
Maxine, be careful.

200
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,202
You went too high.

201
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,802
- Jenny.
- Hi.

202
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:37,318
- Hi. Where's Amy?
- Home, with Carter.

203
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,086
I missed them.
What a great guy you've got.

204
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,643
Taking a day off to spend with Maxine
hasn't occurred to my husband.

205
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,959
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

206
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:56,123
- No.
- What's the matter?

207
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:59,523
- Sarah, I saw Jack today.
- Jesus.

208
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,523
Uh...

209
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,845
I think he still loves me.

210
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,675
Oh, come on.
Isn't it a little late for that?

211
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,287
He was so flustered
he forgot his keys,

212
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,444
so I'm meeting him here
to return them.

213
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,480
I hate to bring this up but
you are married to the perfect man.

214
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,643
The perfect man?

215
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:27,521
Yesterday, out of the blue,
he started to make love to me

216
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,639
and then stopped
when Amy started to cry.

217
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:34,316
- He was worried about Amy...
- He didn't even go to her room.

218
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:37,245
He got into his car
and then drove off.

219
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:40,006
That doesn't make any sense.

220
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,242
Carter isn't making any sense

221
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:46,485
and he's becoming
awfully compulsive with Amy.

222
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,679
He doesn't just take care of her.
He studies her.

223
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:56,920
I have this horrible feeling it has
something to do with his father.

224
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:01,643
You're not just finding excuses
to start up with Jack again?

225
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,918
I don't know.

226
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,683
- Boy, he looks great.
- Yeah.

227
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,804
Definitely don't do what I wanna do.

228
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:21,680
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

229
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:34,924
Thank you.

230
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,879
Nothing's as stupid
as making a dramatic exit

231
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,395
and having to go back
for your car keys.

232
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:43,917
Fortunately, it was a rental.
They sent over another set.

233
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,800
You're very good at dramatic exits.

234
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:52,876
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- It's OK. I got over it.

235
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:56,203
- And I learned something.
- What?

236
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,715
To be the dispassionate doctor.

237
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,762
Let's walk.

238
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:14,598
Oh...

239
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:16,842
Three o'clock?

240
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:33,800
'It's OK, sweetie.
It's all right, baby.'

241
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:40,557
'Why couldn't we just have
an intercom instead of this thing?'

242
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:48,116
'I don't know why I agreed to it.

243
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:55,679
'Taking two years off from
his practice to raise Amy personally.

244
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:00,482
'Testing out a few new approaches
to child raising in his own home.

245
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:03,485
'Maybe even write a book about it.

246
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:05,324
'So I go to work

247
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:09,440
'and the child psychologist
stays at home, playing house dad.'

248
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:08,844
Oh...

249
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:27,444
'Oh, God. I can't let Jack open
Carter's present.'

250
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:46,240
'Jack's wife, Emma, was my patient,
dying of lung cancer.

251
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:51,280
'It was agonising for him but
he came every night to sit with her.

252
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,636
'My heart went out to him.

253
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:56,804
'I wanted so much
to take away some of his pain.

254
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,646
'Then I realised
it was more than that.

255
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,996
'I was falling in love with him.'

256
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,719
What?

257
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:15,396
- What's going on?
- Leave the room.

258
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:18,405
- You must leave the room!
- What the hell?.

259
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,322
Code blue!

260
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:27,519
- Get out of the way, sir.
- Coming through.

261
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,445
- What have we got?
- We have cardiac arrest.

262
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,320
- Here's a bag.
- One milligram epinephrine.

263
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,924
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?!

264
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,606
Happy Valentine's Day.

265
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,605
This for me? You came back.

266
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:13,639
- I just came because...
- Why did you run away?

267
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,678
I thought I saw someone.

268
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,719
- Where?
- In the woods.

269
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:21,156
Well, he's not here now, is he?

270
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,084
Huh?

271
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,118
Is he?

272
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,956
But there was someone.

273
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,324
Oh...

274
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,756
Oh, my God.

275
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,478
- Sarah, it's Jenny.
- 'My God, are you all right?'

276
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:24,203
- Yes, I'm fine.
- 'Carter's been calling all night.'

277
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:27,842
- Oh, no.
- 'What happened to you?'

278
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:31,357
- I was with Jack.
- 'At his hotel?. All night?'

279
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:34,080
I can't explain now.
What did Carter say?

280
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:37,961
'Since you didn't come home
he figured you had an accident.

281
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:41,204
'He called all the hospitals
and the police.

282
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,522
'What are you going to tell him?'

283
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,681
Honey. Honey, it's OK.
I'm right here.

284
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:02,126
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

285
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,362
I had the worst dream.

286
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:08,525
I'll say. You were moaning
and waving your hands around.

287
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,324
I dreamt I was in
the weirdest car accident.

288
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,358
Well, you're OK now.

289
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,921
Why don't I get you a glass of water?

290
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,720
OK. Thanks, sweetie.

291
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28,720
I get so worried about you, honey.

292
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:32,441
I think you've been
working too hard.

293
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,524
You shouldn't have to carry
the whole load.

294
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,246
It's beginning to take a toll on you.

295
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:43,723
I don't know.

296
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,521
Maybe we should be rethinking
this parenting arrangement.

297
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,320
I just don't think
it's been fair to you.

298
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:56,203
One of these days I'm going to have
to get back to my own practice.

299
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:04,643
Maybe we could get a sitter in,
during the day.

300
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,719
I should go back to work.
What do you think?

301
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,558
I think...

302
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,602
- Dr Nix.
- Oh, hi, Nan.

303
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:04,320
- Can you do me a big favour?
- Of course.

304
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:08,121
My boyfriend forgot me.
Can you drop me at Mrs Roberts'?

305
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,283
- Sure, I...

306
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:14,559
I just have
to pick something up first.

307
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,882
Can you keep an eye on Amy for me?

308
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:20,522
- Yeah. No problem.
- I'll be right back.

309
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:42,485
Jesus!

310
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:50,597
Be a Peeping Tom on your own time.
We're going to lose that kid.

311
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:54,242
- That's my wife.
- No shit?

312
00:37:55,687 --> 00:38:00,556
I married her too soon.
She never got over him.

313
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,916
No question of that.

314
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:09,725
Look, Carter,
why don't you just go home?

315
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:13,726
- I'll handle the baby-sitter.

316
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:15,758
I guess you're right.

317
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:18,803
I don't feel very well.

318
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:23,362
I'd better just go home and sleep.

319
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:28,719
That's right. You go sleep.
I'll take care of everything.

320
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:32,679
I'll just be you for a while, huh?

321
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,321
Until this whole mess is cleaned up.

322
00:38:57,327 --> 00:38:59,318
Poor schmuck.

323
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,559
Ooh...

324
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:37,716
Oooh...yes!

325
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:49,759
Where did you get
that neat trench coat?

326
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,646
I copped it.

327
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,886
You know, Dr Nix, I should
be going out with older guys.

328
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:02,758
I'll tell you something.

329
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:06,686
For a man your age, you're...
you're still pretty cute.

330
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:13,126
It's not the mileage, honey.
It's the make.

331
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,642
Keep an eye on the monster.
I gotta go pee.

332
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:22,678
I'll be right back.

333
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,166
I know what you're going to do.

334
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,916
It's a bad thing
and I'm going to tell.

335
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,602
Get out of here!

336
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,444
Shit.

337
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:20,285
What's the matter? Jenny?

338
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:45,076
Help! Somebody help!

339
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:51,517
Carter!

340
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,320
Carter! Carter!

341
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:22,681
Jenny.

342
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:29,558
Oh, Jenny.

343
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:56,599
We were all going
to the beach today to have a...

344
00:45:57,647 --> 00:46:00,207
a Valentine's Day picnic.

345
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:03,683
Jenny took Amy to the park
while I packed up the Jeep.

346
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,560
I guess that was at about eight.

347
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:09,246
They were supposed to be back at ten.

348
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:13,883
My wife is never late.
I was immediately concerned.

349
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:19,445
So I went to the park to search
for them at about ten thirty

350
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:21,717
but they weren't there.

351
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:25,555
So I called up you fellas
and came right over here.

352
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:28,404
Dr Nix, I'm sorry to say

353
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:31,644
we've had a few other
disappearances from this park.

354
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:35,680
From your description, your wife
and daughter were likely candidates.

355
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:39,003
You mean...
they might have been kidnapped?

356
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,756
We don't know. All we know now
is that they've disappeared.

357
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:46,925
You told us you went there regularly
with your little girl.

358
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:50,084
- That's right.
- Ever notice anybody strange,

359
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:53,676
another man or a woman
that seemed to be hanging around?

360
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,797
No.

361
00:46:55,847 --> 00:47:00,921
Wait a minute.
There was somebody, a man.

362
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:06,802
I remember because...I noticed he
didn't seem to have a child with him.

363
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:10,283
Why would you come to a playground
without a child?

364
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,319
Why don't you sit down
with our sketch artist?

365
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,756
It would be helpful to get a picture.

366
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,923
Of course.

367
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,720
Peters, it's Cally.
I want you to do a sketch.

368
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,839
Yeah, right away. I'll send him over?

369
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,199
See that guy?
That's Jay Peters, our sketch man.

370
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:31,478
Why don't you go see what you guys
can come up with?

371
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:34,166
- All right.
- Come on.

372
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,876
And, er, thanks for all your help.

373
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:46,837
Dr Nix, Jay Peters.

374
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:49,242
How you doing? Have a seat.

375
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:51,926
- Just do the best you can.
- You got it.

376
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:59,517
Poor guy.

377
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:03,487
- This is getting out of hand, Sean.
- Yup.

378
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:05,757
It seems like a serial to me.

379
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,367
A detective's dream -
the motiveless murder.

380
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:10,477
What have we got now?

381
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:13,325
Two moms, a baby-sitter
and their kids are gone.

382
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,562
From the same playground.

383
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,802
And there's Dr Nix.

384
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:21,718
What do you mean?

385
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:24,327
It's the kind of name
that sticks in your head.

386
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,484
- From where?
- From ancient history.

387
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:29,563
Oh, your specialty.

388
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,963
- Let's go home, Mack.
- Sean, come on...

389
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,475
- Go home.
- I wouldn't waste your time.

390
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:40,440
When you retire, you don't
come to the office any more.

391
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:44,162
Sit in your chair, watch
the shopping channel, wash your car.

392
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:47,882
Take your grandkids to the zoo.
Maybe go see a ball game.

393
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:53,001
What you don't do is hang around here
looking over our shoulders.

394
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:56,198
- I'm just trying to help you.
- You're in the way.

395
00:48:56,247 --> 00:49:00,957
Yeah? Well, maybe you can tell me
who this Dr Nix is.

396
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:03,396
That guy there working with Peters.

397
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:05,802
Yeah. Any dope can see that.

398
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:08,964
But I worked another Nix case
20 years ago.

399
00:49:09,007 --> 00:49:12,477
20 years ago.
What are you talking about?

400
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:15,519
I'm talking about that guy's old man.

401
00:49:16,607 --> 00:49:19,599
- Are you sure?
- Same name, same face.

402
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:22,115
So, what did your Dr Nix do?

403
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,477
We got an anonymous tip
he was buying babies.

404
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,677
I remember we caught him with five.

405
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:30,878
Five?
Was he starting a basketball team?

406
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,725
- Who knows?
- So what happened to him?

407
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,837
He jumped bail and left the country.

408
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:38,845
He was Swedish or something,
we couldn't extradite him.

409
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:41,082
- Great. Thanks for sharing.
- Wait.

410
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:45,564
At his trial, an associate testified
against him, a Dr Lynn Waldheim.

411
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,679
Still works around here.
I called Waldheim's office.

412
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:51,844
They tell me the doctor
checked into the hospital.

413
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:54,765
- What's the matter with him?
- Her. Cancer.

414
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:58,402
I told her the father of
one of the missing kids was a Dr Nix.

415
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:00,438
She says she'll be right over.

416
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:04,918
So this is retirement?

417
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:08,198
I think I'll just have
a heart attack right here.

418
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:12,116
I could never retire, so I don't.

419
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,635
- You don't mind, do you, guys?
- Mack...

420
00:50:14,687 --> 00:50:17,076
consider yourself
back on my task force.

421
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,118
Thanks, Terri.

422
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,600
Hey...

423
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:23,286
Hey, Sean. Thanks.

424
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:29,362
I know what you're thinking.
Like father, like son.

425
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:34,356
Too easy. Just because his father's
a nut doesn't mean Carter is.

426
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,398
I'm going with what we got.

427
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:40,042
Two mothers, a baby-sitter
and their kids disappear.

428
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:44,603
When Peters has finished that
sketch I want it shown to everybody.

429
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:47,036
- Yeah?

430
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:50,318
When?

431
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,801
We'll be right down.

432
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:55,122
Car popped up out of Half Moon Marsh.

433
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:59,160
Had a woman's body in it.
They just brought it in downstairs.

434
00:50:59,207 --> 00:51:02,165
- Oh, God.
- Do we bring him?

435
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:04,402
Let's see how bad she is.

436
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:10,042
- How's it going?
- Very well.

437
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:12,647
It's amazing. It looks just like him.

438
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,803
He was wearing a trench coat.

439
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:17,884
- My God.
- Ma'am?

440
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:20,999
Tell me when you're finished.
Let's go.

441
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:25,962
- Detective Terri, Dr Waldheim.
- Thanks for coming over.

442
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:29,317
It's uncanny.
He looks exactly like his father.

443
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:32,086
- That's Carter Nix.
- It couldn't be anyone else.

444
00:51:32,127 --> 00:51:35,164
And his wife and child
have disappeared?

445
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:38,165
- It gets worse.
- We got a dead woman downstairs

446
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,402
that could be his wife.

447
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:44,319
So much tragedy in one family.

448
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,245
- Could you walk with us?
- Certainly.

449
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,278
This way.

450
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,477
- Are you feeling up to this?
- I hate this wig.

451
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:57,325
I told them to get me a grey one.
My hair is grey.

452
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,244
They couldn't find one.

453
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:01,721
- I look like a transvestite.
- It looks fine.

454
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:04,520
You're very kind
but you don't lie very well.

455
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:09,320
- So, you were trained by Dr Nix?
- I took my residency with him.

456
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,722
- Why him?
- Because he was the best.

457
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:15,043
I was interested in his work
on multiple personalities.

458
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:18,477
We wrote a book together
based on one of his patients.

459
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:20,995
In the book, we called him Cain.

460
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:25,245
- Three Faces Of Cain or something?
- He had many more faces than that.

461
00:52:25,287 --> 00:52:28,006
Down here.
So, what was the book called?

462
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:30,959
Raising Cain:
The Creation And Evolution

463
00:52:31,007 --> 00:52:33,077
Of The Multiple Personality.

464
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:37,564
It was a bestseller.
They even made a TV movie out of it.

465
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:40,405
I heard he made quite a lot of money.

466
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:43,678
I wouldn't have it.
I had my name removed from the book.

467
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,322
- Why?
- I didn't want that kind of money.

468
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:49,358
What kind of money was that?

469
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:52,365
Money profited
off the misfortune of another.

470
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,398
You still wrote the book.

471
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:58,235
I didn't know all the circumstances
surrounding the case.

472
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:01,518
- What were they? This way.
- Yes. Let me explain.

473
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,083
All multiple personality patients,
regardless of their background,

474
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:08,846
seem to share
certain childhood traumas.

475
00:53:08,887 --> 00:53:12,721
Then the original personality
splinters into others.

476
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:15,804
For instance,
if a boy is molested by his mother

477
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:19,157
or abused by his father,
the original...

478
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,805
Ah.

479
00:53:22,847 --> 00:53:26,078
The original personality
forgets it ever happened.

480
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:29,517
How could his loving parent
do such a terrible thing?

481
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:32,559
And he creates
an alternate personality.

482
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:35,360
This becomes the person
it happened to.

483
00:53:35,407 --> 00:53:39,002
He is the one who suffers the pain
for all the rest.

484
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:43,325
Hm, you do something bad,
the other personality takes the rap.

485
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,164
Very convenient.

486
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:48,722
It is not a psychological state
one wishes to acquire.

487
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,839
With each trauma
there may be another personality.

488
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:55,323
Soon scores of them
are running around inside your head,

489
00:53:55,367 --> 00:54:00,122
squabbling amongst themselves as to
which one controls the consciousness.

490
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:04,524
Only one personality can control
the consciousness at one time.

491
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:09,004
- So they're talking to each other.
- Sounds like one messed-up guy.

492
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:13,359
Yes, but by carefully
observing and documenting

493
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:16,763
the formation and development
of Cain's multiples,

494
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:22,245
Dr Nix was creating a whole new
theory of personality evolvement.

495
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:24,676
Yeah. There was only one problem.

496
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,525
- Only one? What was it?

497
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:30,798
- The raw data.
- Elevator.

498
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:34,765
The raw data
was extraordinarily detailed.

499
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:37,446
It was as if he'd gotten
into a time machine

500
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:42,436
and seen each of Cain's personality
splitting traumas as it occurred.

501
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,126
I was never allowed to meet Cain.

502
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:49,046
His true identity
was known only to Dr Nix.

503
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,123
All the information I had

504
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:54,557
I transcribed from tapes recorded
during their sessions.

505
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:58,202
So, how do you think
he got the information?

506
00:54:58,247 --> 00:55:00,203
I never knew for sure

507
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:04,604
but years later, when he got arrested
for trying to buy babies,

508
00:55:04,647 --> 00:55:07,719
I suspected
there could only be one answer.

509
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,758
Yeah?

510
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:16,086
He had created Cain's multiple
personalities in order to study them.

511
00:55:16,127 --> 00:55:20,405
He had taken some innocent child
and split its personality.

512
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:23,598
He needed a control group
to test his theories,

513
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,276
- that's why he was buying babies.
- (Lift bell)

514
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:31,006
Uh-huh.

515
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:33,083
To the right.

516
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:36,119
And you testified against him
at his trial?.

517
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,681
A man like that should be in jail!

518
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:42,606
- What happened to Cain?
- Only Dr Nix knew that.

519
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:44,638
What's the story, Al?.

520
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:47,838
Looks like she was put
in the car alive and then drowned.

521
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,720
Look at her nails.
See how they're cut and torn?

522
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,759
Looks like she was trying
to claw her way out.

523
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:56,799
You should see the expression
on her face.

524
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,796
Lieutenant, we got lucky.

525
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:11,238
A lady's picked out the guy
on the bench there. He's real close.

526
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,158
All right.

527
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:27,160
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me?

528
00:56:27,727 --> 00:56:32,437
Lieutenant Terri, Bay View police.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

529
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,324
It's just a short ride.
You'll help us out a lot.

530
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:39,597
Short ride?
I could help you out here.

531
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:43,401
- Do you have a car here in the lot?
- This is my car right here.

532
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,438
- This is your car?
- It's a rental car.

533
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:47,682
Give the keys to Detective Carleton.

534
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:51,402
- You ride with us.
- I don't understand...

535
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:55,326
You can have the keys.
I just rented it yesterday.

536
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,517
I'm visiting.

537
00:56:57,567 --> 00:56:59,080
Here. These are...

538
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:02,199
- What is this?
- I must have rubbed...

539
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:05,045
- Huh? This looks like blood.
- I've never seen that.

540
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:09,603
- Would you open this?
- Sure. It's probably the round key.

541
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:14,322
I don't know what you expect to find,
I'm not hiding anything.

542
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,835
Weapons or something.

543
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:19,082
Oh, my God.

544
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,842
- Hello?
- 'Carter?'

545
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,765
- Yes, sir?
- 'Turn on channel six.'

546
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:39,196
'That's going to mean light rain...'

547
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,238
'A Bayland Park man was indicted

548
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:45,518
'on charges he killed
an 18-year-old baby-sitter.'

549
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,400
- 'You're a good boy, Carter.'
- Thank you, sir.

550
00:57:48,447 --> 00:57:52,645
'Now, meet me at the hotel at 4am,
downstairs.'

551
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:56,316
- I'll be there.
- 'The children must be moved.'

552
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:59,040
Bye-bye, Baumse.

553
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:01,555
'The charges against Jack Dante, 35,

554
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,440
'include first-degree murder
and kidnapping.

555
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:10,039
'He is also being questioned about

00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,964
'Karen Bowman's body

557
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:16,963
'was recovered by police from the
trunk of her car in Half Moon Marsh.'

558
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:38,364
Wake up!

559
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,717
- Don't move or I'll cut it.
- Jenny, what are you doing?

560
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:45,043
- I'm bleeding. Oh, my God!
- And I can help you.

561
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:48,284
- Don't let me die!
- What have you done with Amy?

562
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:51,285
- What are you saying?
- I want answers!

563
00:59:51,327 --> 00:59:54,558
- How could you let me drown?
- What's happened?

564
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:58,236
Was it because of Jack?
You saw us in the park together.

565
00:59:58,287 --> 01:00:00,278
You got him arrested
for what you did.

566
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:02,636
- Help me.
- Tell me where Amy is!

567
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,838
But I don't know where she is!
What are you saying?

568
01:00:05,887 --> 01:00:08,720
Tell her before
you get your throat cut.

569
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:11,281
- But I don't know.
- "I don't know."

570
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:13,318
- I don't!
- Who are you talking to?

571
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:16,882
- I do. I took her to dear old Dad.
- Where is he?

572
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:18,883
Who are you talking to?

573
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,118
Where have you taken her?

574
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,920
Taken her? Taken her where?

575
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:30,279
She's...she's...
She's...with my father.

576
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:34,525
Your father? What are you saying?
Your father is dead!

577
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:37,604
No, no. He's not dead. He's here.

578
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:40,241
Amy's with him. She's fine.

579
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:43,677
- Tell her, Cain. She's fine.

580
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:46,525
- Why won't you tell her?
- Bay View Police!

581
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:48,956
Carter, get up. Carter, get up.

582
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,567
- Tell her, Cain!
-  Doctor?!

583
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:54,997
- Amy's fine. Why won't you tell her?
- Dr O'Keefe?

584
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:57,845
- You've got to tell her.
- Get up.

585
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,082
According to Norwegian authorities,

586
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:07,086
Dr Nix took a swan dive
into a fjord 18 years ago.

587
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:10,961
There was a suicide note
but they never recovered the body.

588
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:14,999
Great.
Carter says they're with his father.

589
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:19,359
His father's been dead for 18 years.
This gets better all the time.

590
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:23,320
Let's hope Waldheim
can get something out of this psycho.

591
01:01:29,607 --> 01:01:31,996
When I got myself out of the car,

592
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:35,636
I could only think of one thing.

593
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:42,840
If he was crazy enough to kill me
what was he going to do to Amy?

594
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:46,363
So then I went home...

595
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:50,887
but she wasn't there.

596
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,202
That's when I called you.

597
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:58,162
And then Carter came home.

598
01:02:03,047 --> 01:02:05,880
I just wanted him
to tell me where Amy was.

599
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,121
Oh...

600
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:20,445
Well, let's hope he's not too nuts.

601
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,717
What do you mean?

602
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,361
Too nuts to go to jail.

603
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:27,967
You mean he might not go to jail?.

604
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:31,602
First we've got to find out
if he's competent to stand trial.

605
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:35,879
Any smart lawyer will plead him
not guilty by reason of insanity.

606
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:38,725
And depending on what
Waldheim finds out,

607
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:43,363
Carter could wind up a celebrity
mental case in a cushy institution.

608
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:47,480
- He might be out someday?
- All he's got to do is get better.

609
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,764
Fascinating.

610
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:58,243
It's quite something,
after writing about him for years,

611
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:01,438
- to finally meet him.
- Carter is Cain.

612
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:04,718
And Josh and Margo
and God knows who else.

613
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:10,636
Now it is clear to me
how Dr Nix got all his precise data.

614
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,757
He traumatised his own son.

615
01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:18,005
Then, over the years,
he observed the effects.

616
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:22,844
- Does Carter know what he did?
- Carter didn't do anything.

617
01:03:22,887 --> 01:03:25,003
Cain did all the killing.

618
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:29,084
- Who is Cain?
- One of Carter's multiples,

619
01:03:29,127 --> 01:03:33,325
one of the ones Dr Nix created
when he abused him as a child.

620
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:36,564
When something bad
is about to happen to Carter

621
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:39,041
or when something bad has to be done,

622
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:41,885
Carter blacks out
and Cain takes over.

623
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:46,720
After the unpleasantness,
Cain exits and Carter wakes up.

624
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:51,204
He has lost some time. He doesn't
remember how he got where he is

625
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:53,807
or what happened while he was asleep.

626
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:57,635
He may be confused
but his conscience is clean.

627
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:03,683
So how do we find the children?

628
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:06,958
Carter doesn't know where they are

629
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:10,079
but one of the other multiples may.

630
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:12,800
And how do we talk to them?

631
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:17,682
Hypnotism is the fastest though
not always the most prudent method.

632
01:04:17,727 --> 01:04:20,116
We've got to find these babies now.

633
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,041
Then I will need
an absolutely quiet space

634
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,237
where I can be alone with Carter.

635
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:29,881
Whatever you need, and do it fast.

636
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:33,919
I don't wanna be walking behind
any little coffins.

637
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:36,924
It's all right.

638
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:38,958
We'll find them.

639
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:49,724
She doesn't care who she fucks
or where she does it.

640
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:52,918
But don't worry, buddy.

641
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:57,358
I'm not gonna let that loving wife
of yours sell you down the river.

642
01:04:57,407 --> 01:05:02,117
I'll put that two-timing bitch
in a box she'll never swim out of.

643
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,800
Hey...

644
01:05:05,847 --> 01:05:10,523
You remember that lady cop
that brought Waldheim her coffee?

645
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:15,198
Take a look down at your feet.

646
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:19,638
Don't be so obvious! Jesus.

647
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,955
Keep your head up. Now reach down.

648
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:34,916
Down...

649
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,798
Down...

650
01:05:39,847 --> 01:05:42,361
and pick it up.

651
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:46,238
Good boy.

652
01:05:48,647 --> 01:05:50,717
Carter, you're awake now.

653
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:56,124
I am a doctor and I am here
to help you. Do you understand?

654
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:59,798
Carter?

655
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:06,723
Are you talking to me?

656
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:08,564
Yes, I'm talking to you.

657
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:12,361
Carter, pay attention.
You have to answer my questions

658
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:15,683
so I will be able to understand
what is going on.

659
01:06:15,727 --> 01:06:18,036
Is that perfectly clear?

660
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,482
- No.
- Why?

661
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:25,317
Because I'm not Carter.

662
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:27,961
- You're not Carter?
- No.

663
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:32,956
Wait a minute. If you're not Carter,
then who are you?

664
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:34,838
I'm Josh.

665
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:36,639
Josh.

666
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:41,715
- And where is Carter?
- Carter's inside.

667
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,520
Inside where?

668
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,956
Can you wake him up
so I can talk to him?

669
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:49,840
- No.
- Why?

670
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,878
Baumse would hurt me.

671
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:56,521
- Who is Baumse?
- Baumse is my dad.

672
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:59,559
But your father isn't here any more.
He's dead.

673
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:04,920
No, no! He's here. I gotta go.

674
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:08,562
Your father isn't here now
so you don't have to be afraid.

675
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,598
He'll hurt me.

676
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:14,037
No, he can't hurt you now,
I won't let him.

677
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:17,997
- You won't?
- No.

678
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:22,086
- You promise?
- Yes, I promise.

679
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:25,040
OK.

680
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:28,481
- How old are you?
- Seven and a half.

681
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:32,486
Why are you the one
who came to talk to me?

682
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:34,722
I don't know.

683
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:38,476
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

684
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:40,518
Try to think.

685
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:44,162
What is the last thing
that you remember, hm?

686
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:50,358
- I was in a playground.
- A playground.

687
01:07:50,407 --> 01:07:52,398
And what happened?

688
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:56,364
Get out of here!

689
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,727
I saw Cain.

690
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,361
He was going to do something bad,

691
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:06,716
something I'd be blamed for.

692
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:09,759
I told him it was bad!
Then I told Margo.

693
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:13,163
She got real mad!
She told me to go to sleep!

694
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,596
Then I woke up here.

695
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,961
My... My arm hurts.

696
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:29,325
- That's why I'm here.
- Could you explain that?

697
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:32,484
- That's what Margo says.
- Margo.

698
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:33,960
That's what she says.

699
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,556
Hickory dickory dock.
Cain has picked his lock.

700
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:40,440
He did a bad deed
and Josh comes to bleed.

701
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:42,045
Hickory dickory dock.

702
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:44,446
Josh...

703
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:49,436
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right.

704
01:08:52,047 --> 01:08:54,356
Do you know where the babies are?

705
01:08:59,647 --> 01:09:03,481
- What babies?
- Someone hid the babies.

706
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:06,678
- No, no, no...
- Nobody is going to get punished.

707
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:08,922
I just want to know where they are.

708
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:14,564
He did it again!
It was Baumse! He did it again!

709
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:18,519
Oh, no.

710
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,762
- What's the matter?
- Shh!

711
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:24,921
- She heard me.
- Who heard you?

712
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:26,958
Margo.

713
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:29,999
She's right behind you. Don't look!

714
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,358
I shouldn't be talking to you.

715
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:35,716
How do you know she heard you?

716
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:38,042
She's staring right at me,

717
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:40,647
like I did something bad.

718
01:09:40,687 --> 01:09:45,124
- Who is Margo?
- She protects the children.

719
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,557
She won't let Baumse hurt them
like he hurt me.

720
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:52,361
When he took the children before
she called up the police.

721
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:54,682
- She called the police?
- Yes.

722
01:09:54,727 --> 01:09:57,446
But you said that he did it again.

723
01:09:57,487 --> 01:09:58,966
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

724
01:09:59,007 --> 01:10:01,805
She won't just call the police
this time.

725
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:04,202
- What is she going to do?
- I don't know.

726
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:07,876
I gotta get out of here.
Where is she?

727
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:17,359
Carter? Carter? Josh?

728
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:19,557
Josh, I want to talk to you.

729
01:10:19,607 --> 01:10:22,326
When I snap my fingers,
you are going to wake up.

730
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,317
Josh?

731
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,919
Is this Margo?

732
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:56,881
Do you know where the children are?

733
01:11:01,607 --> 01:11:03,598
Where?

734
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:19,443
Dr Waldheim?

735
01:13:20,207 --> 01:13:22,004
Dr Waldheim?!

736
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:24,478
Dr Waldheim!

737
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,916
Did he tell you where Amy is?

738
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,801
Where's Amy, Dr Waldheim?

739
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:37,005
My God, my God.

740
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:39,003
Help! Help!

741
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:58,122
What's the matter with you?
You almost took those people out!

742
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,476
Are you blitzed again?

743
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:11,639
I'll take it out of your pay!

744
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:16,397
Guys, guys. Cool it.

745
01:15:16,447 --> 01:15:19,723
Manuel, you almost took
the taxicab with you.

746
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:31,282
Move the truck.
Put it over there out of the way.

747
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:45,841
Carter escaped. Let's go. Yeah?

748
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:48,082
- It's Jenny O'Keefe.
- Where are you?

749
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,802
I'm at the Riviera Motel,
I followed Waldheim here.

750
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,839
That's not Waldheim. Just stay put.

751
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:58,482
- Stay put, we'll be right over!
- I gotta go.

752
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:05,005
Jesus! Stop! You're gonna kill
somebody with that sundial!

753
01:16:05,047 --> 01:16:07,163
Calm down.

754
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:12,959
OK, stop. OK, now back it up.

755
01:17:10,887 --> 01:17:13,845
- Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

756
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:17,084
- Mommy!
- So, this is my daughter-in-law.

757
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:21,963
God! What kind of a mother are you?
Put that knife down and come out.

758
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:26,523
- Give me my child!
- I want my mommy!

759
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:30,085
I have a gun.
It's pointed at your heart.

760
01:17:30,127 --> 01:17:33,085
If you have anything to say,
say it gently,

761
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:35,766
I don't want you upsetting the child.

762
01:17:35,807 --> 01:17:39,482
You're her mother.
You're scared and angry.

763
01:17:39,527 --> 01:17:41,802
And if looks could kill, my dear,

764
01:17:41,847 --> 01:17:44,236
I would be dead.

765
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,316
I want my mommy!

766
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:54,166
It's OK, honey. I'm here now
and we're going to go home.

767
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:58,164
Now, drop the knife
and come out of there.

768
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:13,480
- Why are you doing this?
- I can't explain.

769
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:17,122
- Carter is waiting downstairs.
- Carter is in there.

770
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:20,159
I want my mommy!

771
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:22,198
You're a poor liar, my dear.

772
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:25,765
Carter always does as he's told.
He's a good boy.

773
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:29,765
Once we're safely away,
he'll be yours again.

774
01:18:29,807 --> 01:18:32,321
You might have to share him
with the law.

775
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:35,484
Someone will have to pay
for these terrible crimes.

776
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:38,519
- You did this.
- I did nothing.

777
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:40,558
I don't even exist.

778
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:46,642
Now say goodbye to Amy
and don't upset her.

779
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:50,883
- Can I kiss her?
- No. Don't force me to kill you.

780
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:54,078
It would be very harmful
to the child.

781
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:59,120
Damn you! Look what you've done!

782
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:17,118
Mommy!

783
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,761
- Back up!
- Mommy!

784
01:19:21,207 --> 01:19:23,038
Back up!

785
01:19:24,087 --> 01:19:25,918
Now!

786
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:29,118
Back up!

787
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:31,964
Do it!

788
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:55,115
She's not there. Let's go
around front. Stay in the car!

789
01:22:24,047 --> 01:22:27,926
We thought Carter
was imagining his dead father.

790
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:31,676
Dr Nix faked his suicide
so that he could kidnap the children

791
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:34,446
without the police tracking him down.

792
01:22:34,487 --> 01:22:37,320
What about tracking down his son?

793
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:41,201
Once Carter helped him get the kids
he was disposable.

794
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:45,035
Dr Nix planned to disappear
and leave Carter for the police.

795
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:47,282
Did they find him yet?

796
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:49,286
Mm-mm.

797
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:51,363
Do you think he'll come back?

798
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:55,922
I don't know.
I hope so. He needs help.

799
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:59,755
- He needs to be locked up.
- He needs to be in a hospital.

800
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:02,446
Are you running for sainthood?

801
01:23:02,487 --> 01:23:06,321
- He tried to kill you.
- I know.

802
01:23:06,367 --> 01:23:09,518
In case he shows up,
I'd be packing a .45.

803
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,400
Jack's staying with me now, so...

804
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:15,996
Better than a .45. How's it going?

805
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:19,403
Good. He's been very supportive.

806
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:21,438
And Amy likes him.

807
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:24,843
Did you see the new bunny
he brought her? Amy!

808
01:23:27,247 --> 01:23:30,205
Amy?!I'll be right back.

809
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:32,238
Amy!

810
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,758
Amy?

811
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:58,478
Amy?!

812
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:06,918
Amy?

813
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:16,044
Where's Daddy?

814
01:24:16,087 --> 01:24:18,920
Daddy's not here, sweetie,
he's gone away.

815
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:22,277
- Daddy's here.
- No, he's not.

816
01:24:23,087 --> 01:24:26,204
Come on, we've got to get back.
Come to Mommy.
