00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:33,836
Hello, my name
is Dr. Mercurio Arboria,

2
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:38,917
and I am the founder
of the Arboria Institute.

3
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,879
It has long been my dream
to find the perfect way

4
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,305
for people to achieve simply...

5
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,723
happiness,

6
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:48,675
contentment,

7
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,104
inner peace.

8
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:57,106
These seem to be things
that strangely elude us all,

9
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,687
but it doesn't have
to be that way.

10
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,822
We at Arboria have found a path
to achieve them.

11
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,291
Here at the Institute,

12
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,591
we are in the forefront worldwide

13
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,589
in neuro-psychology

14
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:26,172
and new therapeutic technologies.

15
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,804
Dr. Barry Nyle,
our head of research,

16
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,134
myself,

17
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,514
and our dedicated team

18
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:35,097
of herbalists, naturopaths, and healers

19
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,027
have found a way
to make that dream a reality.

20
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:54,875
Through our unique blend
of benign pharmacology,

21
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,171
sensory therapy,
and energy sculpting,

22
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,967
we can guide you
gently along the path

23
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:08,548
to a new, better, happier you,

24
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,473
all in the comfortable surroundings

25
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,177
of our state-of-the-art facility

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,730
and our award-winning gardens.

27
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:34,411
We invite you to join us...

28
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,461
and find out for your...
self.

29
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,309
Warm her up.

30
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,302
Special 1-1-8-3.

31
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,614
Hello, Elena.

32
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,782
How are you today, hmm?

33
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,241
How are you feeling?

34
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,060
Have you had...

35
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,518
any headaches?

36
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,940
You can tell me.

37
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:11,539
Your readings are relatively stable.

38
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,466
Very good.

39
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,596
That's very, very good.

40
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,145
You know, this is always
the highlight of my day.

41
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,768
Rosemary.

42
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,984
Rosemary.

43
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,452
Oh.

44
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,710
Barry!

45
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:44,835
I didn't hear you come in.

46
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,588
Been sleeping long?

47
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,424
No...

48
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,345
Um...

49
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,470
- I wasn't sleeping.
- Hmm.

50
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,678
I was... meditating.

51
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,933
Oh, you were meditating, yeah.

52
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,266
Mm-hmm.

53
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,692
ls everything okay?

54
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,404
Everything's fine.

55
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:18,577
If you're hungry,

56
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:22,001
there's some brown rice
and steamed asparagus

57
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,248
in the refrigerator.

58
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,251
Wow, that sounds really good.

59
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,003
No, I'm not hungry...

60
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,177
thank you.

61
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,215
Okay.

62
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:43,059
It's been a long day.

63
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,523
So, um,

64
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:52,073
I'm just going to hit the hay early.

65
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,401
Okay.

66
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:58,704
Good night, Barry.

67
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,541
Good night, Rosemary.

68
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,520
Night Mode.

69
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:12,229
Rest peacefully and reflect.

70
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,172
Aah-ah-ah!

71
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,658
I am so sorry

72
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,703
that you were never able
to meet your mother.

73
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,976
She was a very beautiful woman.

74
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:49,363
She was a very desirable woman.

75
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,582
Oh...

76
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,093
Hey, would you, uh...

77
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,671
would you like to have a photo of her?

78
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,965
Would you like that?

79
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:21,653
Because you may just find one
in your room, hmm.

80
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,044
You know, you are looking more

81
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,998
and more like your mother every day.

82
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,286
You look tired today.

83
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:54,710
It's easy to become disillusioned

84
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:59,801
when you don't know who you are...

85
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,183
or what you are.

86
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,558
I know who I am.

87
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:17,532
That's what gives me my confidence...

88
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,489
and my power.

89
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:33,088
And I know who you are, too, Elena.

90
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:47,433
I can guide you towards that achievement...

91
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,521
to find your inner strength

92
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,487
and your inner power.

93
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:08,040
We all have other forms...

94
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,589
and your inner self...

95
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,838
needs another to complete it.

96
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,428
I."

97
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:34,191
can help you do that.

98
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,076
Oh...

99
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:49,949
You just...

100
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:54,624
Have to let me...

101
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:57,706
in.

102
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:15,103
I...

103
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:18,898
want...

104
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:23,444
to see...

105
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:25,985
my-"

106
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,245
father.

107
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:41,839
Oh.

108
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:47,840
Please.

109
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:59,110
Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena.

110
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,405
Elena, you know you can't.

111
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:08,448
You're a very sick girl, Elena.

112
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,529
You're not well.

113
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,041
This...

114
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:16,084
world...

115
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,709
is in chaos, Elena.

116
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,629
These are...

117
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,881
times of, uh, great uncertainty

118
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:30,091
and terrible danger.

119
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:37,307
And you are not ready.

120
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,901
You're just not well.

121
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,283
Don't worry, Elena,

122
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:53,581
you'll see him again one day.

123
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,458
I promise.

124
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,298
Piece of shit.

125
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,523
What?

126
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
Rosemary.

127
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:42,384
Yeah.

128
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,859
We do have a system in place.

129
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:08,665
Yes, a comprehensive list
has been compiled.

130
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,130
Mm-hmm. I see.

131
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,438
That's fine.

132
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,173
Rosemary,

133
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,094
why don't you answer
the fucking phone?

134
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,851
Margo.

135
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,903
Yes, Dr. Nyle?

136
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,065
It's come to my...

137
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:13,034
attention, Margo...

138
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,578
Yes, Dr. Nyle?

139
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,711
It's come to my attention that...

140
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:27,758
Elena may be hiding an illicit object

141
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,304
from us.

142
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,846
Oh, really?

143
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,141
Mm-hmm.

144
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,513
So...

145
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:38,476
Keep your eyes peeled.

146
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,020
Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will.

147
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,191
Good.

148
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,607
Very good.

149
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,188
Oh, Dr. Nyle?

150
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:53,028
Yeah.

151
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,117
Uh, how do you think

152
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:58,996
she would have come
into possession of the object?

153
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:01,294
I don't know, Margo.

154
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,122
I don't know.

155
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,508
But I'm looking into it.

156
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:22,519
Day Mode.

157
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,899
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow.

158
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,282
Good morning.

159
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:39,123
Hope you're hungry.
Looks better than usual today.

160
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,089
What have you got there,
a special picture?

161
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,928
Let me see.

162
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,261
Oh, come on, I'm just curious.

163
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,188
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

164
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:10,113
Who is this?

165
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:21,620
Is it your mother?

166
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:26,250
Where is she?

167
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,636
Did she die?

168
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,679
Good.

169
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:56,569
Enjoy your dinner.

170
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:41,037
Stop.

171
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,535
Please stop.

172
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,113
Mercurio.

173
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,825
Are you awake?

174
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:56,299
Dr. Arboria.

175
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,299
Barry?

176
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:11,316
B-Barry, is that you, my friend?

177
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:18,322
Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me.

178
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:22,610
Ah, oh...

179
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,778
Wonderful.

180
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:33,747
Come closer so I can see you.

181
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:53,316
It's wonderful to see you again.

182
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:01,028
You're looking well, my friend.

183
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:05,827
Thank you, Dr. Arboria.

184
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,452
So are you.

185
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:14,662
Oh, Barry,

186
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,292
there's...

187
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:24,631
no need to flatter an old man.

188
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:30,973
I know I-I've...

189
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:35,395
seen better days.

190
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,187
Besides...

191
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:50,365
the trappings of the mortal world are...

192
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:56,249
but a distraction,

193
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:57,830
wouldn't you say?

194
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:01,963
Of course, Dr. Arboria.

195
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,168
Yes.

196
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:09,804
What really matters...

197
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:16,941
the part of ourselves

198
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:21,486
we must nurture the most...

199
00:51:26,274 --> 00:51:28,493
is here.

200
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:31,704
I couldn't agree more.

201
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,166
Would you mind...

202
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:48,634
assisting me?

203
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,095
Of course, Dr. Arboria.

204
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:08,854
Aren't these videos of the nature,
ha, beautiful, Barry?

205
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:20,837
They make me remember a simpler time.

206
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,674
Yes, Dr. Arboria.

207
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,888
Me too.

208
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,751
You are about to embark

209
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,332
on a great journey.

210
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,097
Are you ready, my friend?

211
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:19,225
I am ready.

212
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:49,338
Good luck.

213
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:56,391
Thank you.

214
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:12,214
Bring home the mother lode, Barry,

215
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:15,136
Barry, Barry, Barry!

216
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:38,720
Your mother's reabsorption
into the cycle of life

217
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:41,397
won't be for nothing,
my darling Elena.

218
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:48,488
You will be the dawning of a new era

219
01:01:48,563 --> 01:01:51,442
for the human race

220
01:01:51,524 --> 01:01:53,276
and the human soul.

221
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:59,662
Let the new age
of enlightenment begin.

222
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,684
No, Barry.

223
01:03:41,759 --> 01:03:45,184
I don't like to see the...

224
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:46,765
on my arm.

225
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,187
Of course.

226
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:11,673
How is my darling Elena?

227
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:17,378
Well, Dr. Arboria.

228
01:04:19,547 --> 01:04:21,220
She's very well.

229
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:26,141
That's wonderful.

230
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:30,183
Thank you.

231
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,448
Are you ready?

232
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:41,824
Yes, yes.

233
01:05:10,932 --> 01:05:16,234
Oh, that's wonderful, Barry.

234
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,690
Yes.

235
01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:20,025
That's so...

236
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,121
wonderful.

237
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:34,330
Isn't it...

238
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,336
beautiful?

239
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:39,506
Yes.

240
01:05:41,712 --> 01:05:43,259
It is.

241
01:06:16,622 --> 01:06:18,795
The dormant volcano,

242
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:22,845
Haleakala Crater.

243
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,719
Mark Twain described sunrise here

244
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:29,723
as "the sublimest spectacle
I have ever witnessed."

245
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,893
To the west of Maui lies Molokai.

246
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:42,115
Except for a few beautiful resort hotels,

247
01:06:42,189 --> 01:06:44,817
the modern world
has touched Molokai less

248
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,450
than any of the other
vacation islands.

249
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,761
Aloha means welcome.

250
01:07:13,137 --> 01:07:16,562
It also means love...

251
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:21,779
and all too soon...

252
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,447
Farewell.

253
01:08:02,103 --> 01:08:03,275
...rocket launchers,

254
01:08:03,354 --> 01:08:06,403
while the Soviets have produced
more than 13,000,

255
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,531
a staggering 14-to-1 ratio.

256
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,738
They didn't stop
when their forces exceeded

257
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,791
all requirements of a legitimate
defensive capability,

258
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:16,492
and they haven't stopped now.

259
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:19,454
But today they're building weapons

260
01:08:19,537 --> 01:08:23,007
as sophisticated
and modern as our own.

261
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:27,258
As the Soviets have increased
their military power,

262
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,089
they've been emboldened
to extend that power.

263
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,300
They're spreading
their military influence

264
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,307
in ways that can directly
challenge our vital interests

265
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,263
and those of our allies.

266
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,973
The following aerial photographs,

267
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:41,479
most of them secret until now,

268
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:43,687
illustrate this point in a crucial area

269
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:45,612
very close to home...

270
01:11:32,396 --> 01:11:35,240
The Devil's Teardrop.

271
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:40,780
Barry?

272
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:43,408
Barry!

273
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:10,397
Oh.

274
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:13,480
Barry, you startled me.

275
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:17,692
I thought you were an intruder.

276
01:12:23,697 --> 01:12:25,495
What are you doing?

277
01:12:31,538 --> 01:12:34,087
Barry,

278
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,466
you're not wearing your appliances.

279
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,264
I don't want to wear them anymore.

280
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:50,808
But...

281
01:12:52,518 --> 01:12:57,069
It's just you haven't let me see you...

282
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:01,490
without them in a long time.

283
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,500
Where did you get that outfit?

284
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:24,513
Has something happened?

285
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:43,403
Sometimes...

286
01:13:45,696 --> 01:13:49,371
Sometimes I--I forget...

287
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:53,329
how hard it is for you.

288
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:00,841
I'm sorry.

289
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:05,307
I...

290
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:08,181
I...I should have

291
01:14:09,136 --> 01:14:13,733
been there for you more.

292
01:14:22,983 --> 01:14:25,236
Barry?

293
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:31,159
Are--Are you okay?

294
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:59,611
I...I'm not...

295
01:15:02,773 --> 01:15:06,528
I'm...I'm not...
I'm not okay.

296
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:16,837
I went to another world, Rosemary.

297
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,388
I see what others cannot see.

298
01:15:32,386 --> 01:15:33,478
Please.

299
01:15:34,346 --> 01:15:38,897
I looked into the eye of the god.

300
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:43,067
It looked right back through me.

301
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:45,275
It looked through everything.

302
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,077
Rosemary,

303
01:15:50,654 --> 01:15:54,875
it was so, so, so beautiful.

304
01:15:58,328 --> 01:16:00,956
Like a black rainbow...

305
01:16:05,586 --> 01:16:07,554
and it chose me.

306
01:16:08,839 --> 01:16:10,967
It chose

307
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:16,180
to reveal itself to me.

308
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:30,239
You're nothing.

309
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:35,206
You're less than nothing.

310
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:39,708
Just...spit in the wind.

311
01:16:41,038 --> 01:16:43,666
Let go of me.

312
01:16:43,749 --> 01:16:46,127
I'm not going to let you go.

313
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:01,525
I'm going to set you free.

314
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:02,041
Elena...

315
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:04,372
Elena?

316
01:34:06,165 --> 01:34:07,633
Elena?

317
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:13,591
Elena?!

318
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:19,427
You are doing so good.

319
01:39:13,472 --> 01:39:15,600
Julie comes walking up, and, um...

320
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:17,105
like, I can tell just by looking at her

321
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:18,310
she totally, fuckin',

322
01:39:18,394 --> 01:39:19,737
she totally wants to pork me.

323
01:39:19,812 --> 01:39:21,940
Oh, you're so full of shit.

324
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:26,402
What would she want
with that two-inch little blood bat?

325
01:39:30,155 --> 01:39:31,657
Fuck, my left ball hurts a little.

326
01:39:35,244 --> 01:39:36,621
I gotta take a leak.

327
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,877
Thanks for telling me.

328
01:39:38,956 --> 01:39:40,708
Get bent, you fat fuck!

329
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:09,361
Ohh...

330
01:40:24,168 --> 01:40:25,886
What the fuck?

331
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:47,324
Yo!

332
01:40:52,571 --> 01:40:54,118
Yo!

333
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:00,879
Yo?

334
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:11,382
Yo?

335
01:41:38,701 --> 01:41:40,374
Where is she?

336
01:41:40,452 --> 01:41:41,669
I don't know.

337
01:41:44,748 --> 01:41:46,091
I don't know.

338
01:41:47,084 --> 01:41:48,085
I don't...

339
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:51,756
I don't know.

340
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:55,263
I don't know.

341
01:41:59,263 --> 01:42:00,981
You fucked her.

342
01:42:01,056 --> 01:42:03,354
No, I...

343
01:42:07,062 --> 01:42:08,655
No...

344
01:42:09,773 --> 01:42:11,616
No, I didn't.

345
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,786
No, I didn't fuck...

346
01:42:15,863 --> 01:42:17,285
You fucked her.

347
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:19,583
No, I didn't! I didn't.

348
