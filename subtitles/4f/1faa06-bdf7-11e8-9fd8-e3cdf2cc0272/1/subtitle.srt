1
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,458
Very pretty

2
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,874
Everybody!

3
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,249
I'm sorry to you. It'll OK soon

4
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,666
Sorry... sorry

5
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,624
Granny, you can't light it up in this way

6
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,958
You've just got the oil,
but you haven't got a lampwick

7
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:53,458
I know that

8
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,124
But I've lost the lampwick.
I can do nothing about it

9
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,249
Buy a new one

10
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,374
It's reasonable...

11
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,624
Miss, excuse me

12
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:10,291
if it is the lamp of Buddha

13
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,374
where to buy a new lampwick for it?

14
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,999
Show your real image!

15
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,999
The Four Kings from the Nantian Gate
and Erland God

16
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,624
Zixia. Your sister Zixia and you

17
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,249
is the lampwick

18
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,541
inside the lamp of Buddha

19
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,999
You left Heaven without permission

20
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,249
You told the public that

21
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,041
the one who can pull your Magic Sword
out

22
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,624
is your best love

23
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,791
You're an immortal.
You can't love any ordinary man

24
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,833
If a devil pulls your sword out

25
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,833
we'll become the laughing-stocks

26
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,374
No matter who he is,
an immortal or a devil

27
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,541
the sword can only be pulled out
by me and my lover

28
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,374
I will stand by him forever

29
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,791
If I can't be with the one who I love

30
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,666
I won't be happy
even if I were Heaven Emperor

31
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,041
How dare you are

32
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,499
You're this stubborn

33
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,249
I'm gonna kill you

34
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:01,958
You're gonna vanish

35
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,666
That's fine.
I don't wanna be a lonely immortal

36
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:05,666
Look out!

37
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,333
No need to say anything

38
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
I'll kill whoever speaks it out

39
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,499
I've said it's not permitted to speak it out

40
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:26,374
I wanna tell you

41
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,958
Your beloved dog is doing that
with a bitch

42
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,374
How dare it is!

43
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,499
Ok, I'll kill it. Let's eat it

44
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:33,416
Ok...

45
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,916
We've decided to do so for a long time

46
00:06:48,625 --> 00:07:13,958
Jing Jing

47
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,083
Jing Jing, where are they?

48
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,249
Immortals?

49
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,166
Devils

50
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,124
Thank you

51
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,624
Please go into the Spider Web Cave

52
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:01,874
Spider Web Cave?

53
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,541
Don't cheat me! It is the Waterfall Cave

54
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,999
Spider Web Cave, what a nice name

55
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,041
Just call it Spider Web Cave

56
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,249
I live at here

57
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,499
Hold it

58
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,249
Listen to me

59
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,374
all things here belong to me!

60
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:41,333
Including you!

61
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,374
Me?

62
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:43,791
Yes

63
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
just like a donkey,
let me make a mark on you

64
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,541
You're my guy now

65
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,916
Don't scare of anyone.
Just tell them you know me

66
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,291
I'm called Spider Web Immortal now

67
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,583
Spider Web Immortal?

68
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,083
500 years ago?

69
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,999
You havenâ€™t turned back into
the Monkey King because

70
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,708
you haven't met the guy who'll give you
the 3 birthmarks

71
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,166
Open the door

72
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,333
Close the door

73
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,791
I can't believe it...

74
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:54,833
I don't wanna be the Monkey King

75
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,166
I have to save Jing Jing

76
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,833
Give me back the Box

77
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,874
Open the door

78
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,708
I have heard that she said "open the door"

79
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,416
Open the door

80
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:40,916
How dare you are?

81
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,624
Let's go there through another way

82
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:50,916
Be careful

83
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:57,249
That way

84
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,874
Open the door

85
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,083
Who?

86
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,249
Is it necessary?

87
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,708
It's great!

88
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,291
We needn't scare of Qingxia

89
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,791
since we've got the box

90
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,666
Come out! Are you really this shy?

91
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,166
this Box is... It's me!

92
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,458
I've said that all things here are mine

93
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,291
What do you want?

94
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,833
Nothing...

95
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,958
I've heard that you wanna go

96
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,374
Can you bring me with you?

97
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:55,208
Are you also chased after by someone?

98
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,791
I'm going to save someone

99
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,666
Save whom?

100
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,958
Save my wife

101
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,583
It's Pak Jing Jing. You know her

102
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:02,333
I don't know her

103
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,541
I know that. But you'll know her soon

104
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,958
Because she'll be your disciple.

105
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,458
And this Box...

106
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,124
It's mine!

107
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:08,958
I know that

108
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,708
But in fact, I gave you this

109
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,083
Then, you gave me back at that time

110
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:14,708
So I come back and

111
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:16,583
give it back to you again now

112
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:17,624
Do you understand?

113
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,708
Yes, you're crazy Yes

114
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,416
And you have to bring me with you

115
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,708
Why need I do so good to you?

116
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,916
This is because you're my master

117
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,083
It's meaningless if you leave me here

118
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,374
Really?

119
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,041
Sit down

120
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:34,708
Ground

121
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,208
Give me your hand

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,999
I'll buy new clothes

123
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,791
for you later

124
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,291
Bark!

125
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,041
Wow!

126
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:47,791
Louder!

127
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,083
Wow...

128
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,958
Immortal...

129
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,499
Be quick, the moon has come out

130
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,833
Go!

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,708
Where to go?

132
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:06,583
Are you leaving?

133
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,666
If you aren't, give me the Box.
I'm leaving

134
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,041
What Box?

135
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,541
Listen to me

136
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,624
I won't wait until tomorrow

137
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,208
Be quick, shut up

138
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,624
Then your bitch sister will come here

139
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:20,916
Shit, how dare you tell the others that
I do bad to her

140
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,374
What?

141
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
I'm that bitch's sister

142
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:25,874
Don't listen to her nonsense words

143
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:31,124
Joker

144
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,708
Why didn't tell me to wake up last night?

145
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,208
What?

146
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,583
Where have you been? Stand still

147
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,333
Sit down

148
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,333
Chair

149
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,458
What about you?

150
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,708
Why are you looking at me in this way?

151
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:05,999
What did you see?

152
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,666
Did you see her?

153
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:10,916
Did you see my sister?

154
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,124
She's come

155
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,249
What did she tell you?

156
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,541
don't trust her, she's crazy!

157
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,374
Maybe she had a fierce fight with me
in our past lives

158
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,458
So Buddha

159
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,041
turned us into a lampwick

160
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,541
told us to practice more

161
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,249
Solve our disputes

162
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,583
But we couldn't do that

163
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,499
We are still fighting with each other

164
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,999
don't say that anymore

165
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,166
Let's go

166
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,166
Do you think that I'm crazy?

167
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:47,541
No. That's really my sister

168
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,541
Don't you believe me?

169
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,374
Come on, come on

170
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,041
Let's tie our hand up

171
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,333
You will know that tonight

172
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,708
I don't think the moon will come out
tonight

173
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,124
Really?

174
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:15,874
Bitch

175
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,791
You can't escape from me

176
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,041
What's your name?

177
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:28,999
My surname is Lin?

178
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,291
You're Lin Qingxia.
My brother talks about you usually

179
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,458
Your brother?

180
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,791
The guy who you beat up is called Joker

181
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,708
How about you?

182
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,874
I'm his twin brother Broker

183
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,708
Joker? Broker? You tell lies

184
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,291
You're so smart

185
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,333
My brother is called Qin Han.

186
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,541
I'm called Qin Xiang Lin

187
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:52,666
What are you doing?

188
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,208
I admire you

189
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,624
You admire me?

190
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,499
Not only admire, I don't want to lose you

191
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,499
So I tie myself with you.

192
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,083
Please accept my love

193
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,499
Let's go together

194
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,708
You have to pay something for my love

195
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,916
You hate your sister so much

196
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,541
I've lied to her that
I would kill you tonight

197
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:14,708
Then you have nothing to worry

198
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,624
So I have to take a thing as a sign

199
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:18,999
Do you have valuable thing such as...

200
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,166
jewels or Pandora's Box...

201
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,333
ok, but they are useless

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,041
Give her my Magic Sword tonight

203
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,583
She'll believe it

204
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,499
Fine

205
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,041
It's him

206
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,541
Bring me to the market
since it's not dark yet

207
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,041
What?

208
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:03,791
What's up?

209
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,541
My heart is pounding

210
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:06,833
What to do?

211
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:07,874
Follow me

212
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,374
Now Big Brother has turned back into
human face

213
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,124
and he's with Zixia Immortal

214
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,708
Did Zixia has a part in

215
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,458
the capture of Master?

216
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,499
We should keep it secret

217
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,166
My martial arts skills and IQ

218
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,958
is better than him

219
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,708
But there is Zixia Immortal now

220
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,541
She's better than me, I think

221
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,708
I'm here

222
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,916
She's better than me because

223
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,583
I've got a burden, it's you

224
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,833
Give me half of this pig head, thanks

225
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,583
I don't sell pig head.
Do you like pig penis?

226
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,416
What?

227
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,708
My lover is nearby

228
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,041
Did you see him?

229
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:45,791
No

230
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,874
because my Magic Sword is beeping

231
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,499
Where does the beeping sound
come from?

232
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,916
Do... do... do... right?

233
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,291
you made this, not the sword

234
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,666
I know you didn't hear that.
So I made it for you

235
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,999
I'm scared!

236
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,708
I'm really scared!

237
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,999
What?

238
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,874
It's fate. So don't be afraid

239
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:09,916
Come again?

240
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:12,666
My heart is pounding

241
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,041
My heart is beeping

242
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,291
What?

243
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,958
How should I tell him?

244
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:18,291
Just tell him

245
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,708
it is fate

246
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,708
If he doesn't like me, what to do?

247
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,124
If he has wife, what should I do?

248
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,291
It's fate. It's God's order.
He has to accept this

249
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:30,624
Really?

250
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,708
It's fate! He has to accept this

251
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:37,208
Yes! Yes...

252
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,291
He's come

253
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,708
It's me?

254
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,333
It's you. How do you know? It's you

255
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:50,874
I didn't know

256
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,333
how to tell you

257
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,708
You're so smart

258
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:55,666
But I have a wife

259
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,041
I know, but I can do nothing about it

260
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,499
This is fate. You have to accept this

261
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,624
You just need to leave your wife

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,208
And then follow me

263
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:09,708
That's great!

264
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,541
Fine?

265
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,291
That's fine

266
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,291
Let's start our affair

267
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,583
Ok, let's start

268
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,208
Kiss me first

269
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,041
Fine, come to me

270
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,291
Come!

271
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,499
Give me!

272
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,708
You deceive me

273
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,333
You don't wanna kiss me

274
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,124
You deceived me! You lied to me!

275
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:44,249
I'm serious. Give me the Box first

276
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,833
Should I show you my heart?

277
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,583
No, I do this

278
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,249
Wow! Your heart looks like a coconut

279
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,874
Miss, I'm ugly

280
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,958
But I'm a gentleman

281
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,458
Tell me honestly

282
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,499
does she love his wife?

283
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,874
I'll kill the one who're gonna block
my way

284
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,333
Granpa Buddha, look

285
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,999
Look!

286
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:24,291
He doesn't move

287
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:29,624
I know that

288
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,499
Let's go

289
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:42,124
Brother, what is this mean?

290
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,499
I know you've got good figure,
so I touch you

291
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,708
Yes, please go on

292
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,333
That's fine. Touch me again

293
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,041
Whose hand is it?

294
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,208
What are you talking about?

295
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,124
Take away

296
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,708
Devil

297
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:00,583
Have you finished?

298
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,416
Don't get angry, I just do that for fun

299
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,958
Take care of sister

300
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,124
She will give you back

301
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,208
Sister, I won't angry at you

302
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,791
We should regard you as Goddess and
worship you

303
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,666
It's dark. I will go to find sister

304
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,916
Good luck

305
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,833
It's really lucky

306
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,666
Qingxia

307
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,958
Where are you?

308
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,541
Come out

309
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,208
I've killed your sister

310
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,166
Monkey King

311
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,374
You bastard

312
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,666
You wanted to marry
the King Bull's sister

313
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,374
But you regarded the Longevity Monk
as a wedding gift

314
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,791
And you invited all devils to eat his flesh

315
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:21,833
Do you admit your guilt?

316
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,541
Bitch!

317
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,041
She's chased me for 3 whole days

318
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,291
I didn't beat you up
because you're a woman

319
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,124
Don't think I'm scared of you

320
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,374
Monkey King

321
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:37,249
Don't say that to Goddess

322
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:39,874
Shut up!

323
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,083
You scare me again!

324
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,708
Monkey King, Longevity Monk?

325
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,333
Do you know you've committed offences

326
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,291
You've grabbed Zixia Immortal's
Pandora's Box

327
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,166
You don't want to see me

328
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,083
Now, I can't escape

329
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,291
I'm gonna fight against you!

330
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,708
What's up?

331
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,083
Monkey King, you're so naughty

332
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,374
I've told you don't throw things

333
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,249
It's wrong to throw things

334
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,416
I haven't finished yet.
You've thrown away the stick

335
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:24,833
The Box is a treasure

336
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,708
You'll pollute the environment!

337
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,874
What to do if kids are hurt?

338
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:30,083
It's still bad

339
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:33,416
if you hurt plants

340
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,291
What are you doing?

341
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,666
Let go!

342
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:38,999
What do you want?

343
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,249
Tell me if you like it

344
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,958
I will give you that if you like it

345
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,041
Of course, I will give you if you like it

346
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,333
I won't give you if you don't like it

347
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,041
I'm pretty sure that I won't give you
if you don't like it

348
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,124
We're reasonable

349
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,083
I'll count to 3

350
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,583
Tell me if you want it!

351
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:55,624
Monkey King

352
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:01,874
You know him now

353
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,249
This guy is very annoying

354
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:05,249
Very disturbing

355
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,124
Just like a fly

356
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,333
Sorry, not a fly

357
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,916
but a swarm of flies

358
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,958
Fly into your ears

359
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:24,791
Help...

360
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:28,333
Help!

361
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,916
So I tear the fly's belly open.

362
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:38,916
Tear out its intestines

363
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,916
Put them around its neck, and then pull them

364
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:46,416
Then its tongue comes out
and I use my blade to cut!

365
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:52,166
The world's silent then

366
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,208
We all know this now

367
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,666
why I kill it

368
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,874
Really?

369
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,624
So many excuses

370
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,583
You don't want to get scriptures

371
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,791
I won't forgive you

372
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,041
because you're so cruel to your master

373
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,124
Sister

374
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,124
you're wrong

375
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,041
The Monkey King wanted to eat me

376
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,624
It's just a thought

377
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,374
Not a fact

378
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,458
You haven't got any evidence

379
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,499
He's not guilty!

380
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,916
Just wait, when he's eaten me up

381
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,541
you can prove him guilty

382
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,124
Longevity Monk, I know you're annoying

383
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,958
But I don't know you're this annoying

384
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,208
I gave you the Gold Ring to control
this monkey

385
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,499
But you don't use the ring

386
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,083
The size of that ring doesn't suit him

387
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,041
He can't wear it

388
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,333
It makes him very uneasy

389
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,333
He can't sleep at night. It disturbed me, too

390
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,083
Although it is just a monkey

391
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,916
you cannot do that do it

392
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:56,374
I'll be indicted animal abused
if the government knows it

393
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,874
That Gold Ring...

394
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,374
I met iron-smith last year
at the Chan's village

395
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,874
His skill is wonderful and the price is low

396
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,291
Really fair price

397
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,499
I think

398
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,499
you should buy a new one from him

399
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,083
Shut up!

400
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,166
It's a sin...

401
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,499
Now, I think you know my pain!

402
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,916
Answer me!

403
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,499
It's Ok!

404
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,333
I've told you not to throw things

405
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:37,708
Look!

406
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,666
Monkey devil, go to hell

407
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,583
You can't defeat me!

408
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,041
You're not Buddha

409
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,208
No more fighting...

410
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,083
Goddess

411
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,083
Please let the Monkey King go,
don't hurt him

412
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,208
No more fighting

413
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,708
I'm gonna kill him!

414
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,499
Goddess, stop!

415
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,083
It's normal to make mistakes

416
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:29,624
He's my disciple

417
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,208
I have to take the responsibility

418
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,958
Goddess, please let him go

419
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:35,958
If I won't kill him

420
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,916
I can't report to Heaven Emperor

421
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,374
I know that

422
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:42,624
Please tell Heaven Emperor that

423
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,249
I'm gonna sacrifice my life to him

424
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,541
What?

425
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,083
It is a master's responsibility

426
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,083
Goddess, please listen to me

427
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:57,999
I just wanna teach him...

428
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,624
in order to show my spirit

429
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,624
That's great...

430
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,208
Monkey King, I hope you'll learn

431
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:15,208
your master's spirit!

432
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:27,166
Namonitabhaya

433
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,958
Dreaming again?

434
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,208
It's big trouble.

435
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,166
I always have nightmares

436
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:56,708
Where is Qingxia?

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,958
Not here

438
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:58,916
Qingxia...

439
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,041
Everybody, how are you?

440
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:05,583
It's cold!

441
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,083
Have you worn more clothes

442
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,624
I've lost my way

443
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,708
I wanna find a place to stay at night

444
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,791
Go there to sleep

445
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,166
Thank you very much.

446
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,458
Wish you all long live

447
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,291
I saw him come here

448
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:23,583
Where is he now?

449
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,999
Why did you go to pee?
You have to take the blame

450
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,124
It won't hurt you

451
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,166
Is it illegal?

452
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,208
Old Black Mountain Devil?

453
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,458
Monkey King

454
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,916
You turn into human face again

455
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,708
Do you still recognize me?

456
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,374
You are the fly

457
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,083
Monkey King...

458
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,791
Impossible, I must be dreaming

459
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,541
It is still early to make dreams, but...

460
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,874
I dream of you

461
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:32,708
when I was travel through time and space

462
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,833
Do you miss me?

463
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,958
The Box is at your side?

464
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,374
Yes, it is. Do you want it?

465
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,333
Who?

466
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,666
What's up?

467
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,708
Soldier

468
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,166
My dad also wanna stay here

469
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:51,249
No problem

470
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:52,791
It's your dad!

471
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:57,499
Yes, dad, come out to say hello to all bros

472
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,416
Where does he come from?

473
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,333
From India

474
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,916
India? Where is it?

475
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:05,874
I need to carry on tomorrow. Sleep there

476
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,208
Thanks

477
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:09,291
It's really noisy

478
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,833
Annoying

479
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:12,833
Sleep inside

480
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,708
It is the problem of time difference

481
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,041
I have just slept in India.
Now you tell me to sleep again

482
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,374
You go to sleep

483
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:19,624
Where is the Pandora's Box?

484
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,583
Monkey King, can you behave yourself?

485
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:26,291
Look, just keep calm

486
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,708
What is he doing?

487
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,874
He's breathing in life

488
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:58,791
Pretend to sleep.

489
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,624
I hope that he won't breath in ours

490
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,458
Go to sleep!

491
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:24,666
Do you know me?

492
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,541
That Indian...

493
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:30,041
You like it, take it

494
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,249
My disciple is calling me, bye bye

495
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,708
Don't play with fire again

496
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,583
bye

497
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:46,583
Please don't follow us. I don't know you

498
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,708
It's great to see you

499
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:50,874
Where is the Box? The Box?

500
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,208
The King Bull?

501
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,416
Bro. catch the Longevity Monk
and give him to me

502
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,999
Miss, handkerchief

503
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,708
It's wedding day, why are you weeping?

504
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:29,041
I'm not weeping. My mouth is watering

505
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,583
It's a very happy day

506
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,249
What?

507
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,708
It's not only the wedding day of my sister

508
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,374
but also the day of my marriage
with my concubine

509
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:49,874
Concubine?

510
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,708
What does sister-in-law say about this?

511
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,958
That bitch

512
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,458
She's now at the Flame Mountain

513
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,458
She can do nothing about this even if
she knows it

514
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,499
Bull, how did you know

515
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,666
this new wife?

516
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,541
I passed the desert yesterday

517
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:10,499
I saw a pretty girl

518
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,874
She's dying

519
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,291
Master, what to do now?

520
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:15,374
Fine! No problem...

521
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:18,916
Really? We succeed now!

522
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:22,833
Zixia, what a nice name you've got

523
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,833
Let me introduce my sister and
my brother-in-law to you

524
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,458
Xiang Xiang, Bro

525
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,083
Come here, follow me

526
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,666
This my brother-in-law

527
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,124
This is my sister Xiang Xiang

528
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,208
Zixia!

529
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,333
How can you get marry here?

530
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,458
I can!

531
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,583
How about your wife?

532
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,833
My wife? Do you know her?

533
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,208
You've got a wife?

534
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,541
We're divorced

535
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,124
I haven't heard you say that before

536
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,624
Sister...

537
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,249
It's normal that a man has many wives.

538
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,291
Take it easy

539
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,833
Bro, do you think so?

540
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:20,124
Yes...

541
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,249
Zixia, be honest

542
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,166
I think I've fallen for you

543
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,499
after these two days

544
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,374
I wanna show my sincerity

545
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,916
Thus I'm gonna request you to marry me
in front of my bros

546
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,208
This Pandora's Box

547
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,208
is my gift to you

548
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,833
I hope you'll marry me

549
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,499
I object this marriage!

550
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:40,416
Why?

551
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,166
Let me speak...

552
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,916
What a good couple they are!

553
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,583
You're a devil,
you're not qualified to object

554
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,249
You have to pass Zixia's test first

555
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,083
If you can pass it

556
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,458
I won't object it anymore

557
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:53,958
What test?

558
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,208
She has sworn that

559
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,374
she would marry the guy

560
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,958
who could pull out

561
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:07,708
her Magic Sword

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,874
Listen to me

563
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:11,791
It's untrue

564
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,791
It's just a joke

565
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:16,666
What joke?

566
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:19,166
It's not important

567
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,708
who can pull out the sword

568
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,874
Stop nagging in my place!

569
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,708
I'm gonna kill the ones
who block my way

570
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:38,333
I'm gonna kill the ones
who block my way

571
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,416
King, Iron Fan Princess has come

572
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,124
Why are you here?

573
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,708
At this time, the sword is close to me

574
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,333
0.01cm I think

575
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:57,166
But after 0.01 seconds

576
00:37:57,334 --> 00:38:00,041
the owner of the sword will fall for me

577
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,166
This is because I've decided to tell lies

578
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,541
Although I have told many lies before

579
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:07,833
this is the best, I think

580
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,791
You're gonna kill me
if you step forward again

581
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,249
You should do that

582
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,958
I deserve to die

583
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,249
I have had my best love before

584
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,374
but I didn't treasure her

585
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,624
When I lose her

586
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,083
I fell regretful

587
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:32,291
It is the most painful matter in this world

588
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:36,583
Just cut my throat!

589
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,541
No hesitation

590
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,291
If God can give me

591
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,166
another chance

592
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,458
I will say 3 words to her

593
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,999
I love you

594
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,874
If you have to give a time limit to
this love

595
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,416
I hope it is 10 thousand year

596
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:17,333
But how will you tell your wife?

597
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,958
I have to tell her

598
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,583
So I must get the Box back

599
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,083
Tell her clearly and go back with you

600
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,708
I won't listen to the others opinions

601
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,083
I won't listen to the others

602
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:32,791
objections

603
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,416
I will take all those on my own

604
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,041
Don't lie to me!

605
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:43,208
But I hate myself

606
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,083
because I can't get back the Box

607
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:46,124
I

608
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,249
I'll help you

609
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,333
No! it's dangerous

610
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:50,666
You don't want

611
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,208
I want

612
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,291
I won't hide a woman

613
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,416
It's just rumor

614
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,708
I won't trust you anymore...

615
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,458
What are you doing here?

616
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,458
Who's he?

617
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,999
I'm asking you, who's he?

618
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,208
He

619
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,999
Bro, who's he? Tell me

620
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,291
He's my wife

621
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,958
Bro, it's too much of you

622
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:22,958
Bros

623
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,166
You marry your sister to him!

624
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:27,791
So his wife pointed a sword at him

625
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,166
You follow me,
I have something to ask you

626
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,666
You've got a wife

627
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:34,708
I've lost my feeling to her

628
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,624
Tell me what's going on

629
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,499
I've told you... Sister-in-law

630
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,458
Sister-in-law?

631
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,333
Sorry, Madam Bull

632
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:49,166
When you watched the moon with me
in the past

633
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,499
you called me Sweetie

634
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,541
Now you yet your new lover!
Call me Madam Bull?

635
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,416
Sweetie?

636
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,791
Do you think that I come here for

637
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,624
that ugly Bull?

638
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:07,124
I come here for you, heartless monkey

639
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:10,958
Bro, thank you

640
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:13,666
It's none of business

641
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:15,041
Sorry

642
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,666
wait for me here at midnight

643
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,041
I have something to tell you

644
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,583
If I were you

645
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:28,499
I'll die when my husband decides to get
a concubine

646
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,333
Really?

647
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,166
Yes! But I'll castrate you first

648
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,458
Follow me

649
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,541
Zixia, I...

650
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:38,624
I trust you

651
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:41,083
I'll get the Box today

652
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,666
Wait for me here at midnight

653
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,374
Bro...

654
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,624
Let me go to see my bros first

655
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:47,916
See you tonight

656
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:11,499
Damn monkey, it's midnight now.
Where is he?

657
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:16,874
Big Brother!

658
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,708
I've told you that

659
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,916
Big Brother won't do so to us

660
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,124
He'll come to save Master

661
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,333
Gout at night, wanna pee?

662
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:26,874
No need to praise me

663
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:29,208
I'm just better than you a little bit

664
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,874
Stop nagging, go to save Master

665
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:39,208
I can't take this anymore

666
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:41,124
I'm sure that Master is inside

667
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:41,916
Right...

668
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,124
He's very annoying.
I can't take this anymore

669
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:45,624
You go in, I stay back...

670
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:46,791
Go! You at the middle

671
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,541
This way... Master is here, go in

672
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:52,708
Master

673
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,999
Master, master

674
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:56,458
We come to bring you out

675
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,124
I won't go

676
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,166
Really? Why? No

677
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,708
There're full of obstacles in the way of

678
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,041
getting scriptures

679
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:10,166
This is because we're not united enough

680
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,666
so the devils can do bad to us

681
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,374
Ok, now it is the case

682
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:18,666
Staying in this prison or not is
just the same

683
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,333
The outside world

684
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,958
is just a larger prison to me

685
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,583
You go out first,
I have something to talk to Big Brother

686
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:29,499
Master

687
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,541
Piggy, you're naughty again

688
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:33,458
No, Master

689
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,333
I go out and protect you

690
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,208
Sandy, follow me. Yes

691
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,458
You stand aside

692
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,999
Blow up and blow up the ball

693
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:50,958
You've dropped your thing

694
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,374
Bro, keep it

695
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,291
Why should I keep it?

696
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,166
Because I'm stronger than you

697
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,458
Stronger than your shit!

698
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,874
Come in and have a sit

699
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,916
Honestly, I'm not your bro

700
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:12,374
I don't want to be your disciple

701
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,374
Master, be kind to me

702
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,499
Please let go of me, alright?

703
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:20,541
Do you know what "Dong, Dong..."is?

704
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:25,791
What "Dong, Dong, Dong"?

705
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:39,541
Only you...
can take me to get scriptures in the west

706
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:50,999
Only you... can kill the devils

707
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:57,791
Only you... can protect me

708
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,958
No need to eat by the monster

709
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:13,208
Only you are that strong

710
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:29,499
Only you...
don't blame the master so talkative

711
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:34,791
Wear the ring back

712
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:41,124
Don't scare the death

713
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:48,541
Don't scare the shit

714
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:58,791
Do your best, if you scare,
I'll be with you...

715
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:04,041
Namonitabhaya

716
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,541
I can't take this anymore!

717
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,458
Oh your shit! Stop it!

718
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:13,833
I've said I can't take this anymore

719
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:15,208
But you still sing

720
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,708
You disregard my feelings

721
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:20,374
I'll kill you if you sing again

722
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:26,041
Monkey King, you kill you again

723
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,583
Life and death are minor

724
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,208
You'll sing this song with me

725
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:39,208
when you know making sacrifices is
so meaningful

726
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:46,291
Namonitabhaya....

727
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,333
Zixia

728
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,916
Bro, why are you taking a woman
with you?

729
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:57,708
Master has gone

730
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,416
He said we had to wait for him
at the forest 300 miles away

731
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:00,874
Go there quickly, please

732
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:01,708
Hold it!

733
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:02,708
What?

734
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:05,083
Ambush at the front

735
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,374
I can see it, no need to listen

736
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:09,833
Stupid

737
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:10,874
Hold you

738
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:13,333
Xiang Xiang!

739
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:14,791
Why are you here?

740
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,624
Wow! Why is there so much blood
on your hand?

741
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,208
This is the blood

742
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,833
of the woman you're holding

743
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:22,874
Her blood?

744
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:24,416
Yes! It's hers

745
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,291
I stabbed her

746
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:29,541
when she's sleeping

747
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:32,666
If this woman is still alive

748
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,624
you won't come back to me

749
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,083
You have to let it be

750
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:41,874
It is fate

751
00:47:43,334 --> 00:47:44,333
Bullshit!

752
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,791
If it is fate that you love Piggy

753
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:48,624
will you love him?

754
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:51,624
If this is God's order

755
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:53,166
I have to accept it

756
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,416
Great!

757
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,791
You don't have to wait for God's order

758
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,791
Wow! What are you going to do?

759
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:11,708
Go, go...

760
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,541
Changing Image Magic!

761
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:23,249
I will turn you into a rock

762
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:24,916
Let go of me!

763
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,083
Grab your breasts!

764
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:03,249
Zixia...!

765
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:04,833
Wake up

766
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,624
Big Bro, why are you embracing me?

767
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:12,333
Piggy?

768
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:13,916
Yes!

769
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,374
Where is Zixia?

770
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:16,999
Qin Xianglin...

771
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:21,666
Qingxia?

772
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:25,499
Wow! Please don't play joke!

773
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:29,541
I'm also hurt!

774
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,791
My chest muscles nearly touch
my stomach

775
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:35,499
Do you hate me?

776
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,666
No!

777
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:42,708
You hate me!

778
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:44,541
Fine! End now!

779
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,374
Stop! Give me some time

780
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,499
I just vomit. I'll vomit all things out soon

781
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,708
Fine! I trust you

782
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,083
Give you some time

783
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,833
Try to get used to it now

784
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:57,583
I'm used to it already

785
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:00,958
Fine, I'm OK

786
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,416
I wanna vomit!

787
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,249
You're so disgusting!

788
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,249
If you're not, he won't vomit

789
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:17,583
Please be good to me

790
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:18,874
I will marry him

791
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:20,333
I'll give him a warm family

792
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,458
Give birth to many kids

793
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,208
Xianglin

794
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,416
I will kill you!

795
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,249
Kill you

796
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:36,708
Bro, you're also hurt?

797
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,124
Turn me back!

798
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:41,208
Shut up!

799
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,833
Listen to me!

800
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,874
Change me back!

801
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,708
I also want to do so!

802
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:47,916
I've used my power once.

803
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:49,124
I need 49 days to recover

804
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,416
49 days! I...

805
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:54,708
Xianglin, face the reality!

806
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,708
Use your energy!

807
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,041
Use your energy! Stop playing!

808
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,208
Be quick!

809
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:04,374
Who is inside you?

810
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:07,374
I don't know where I am

811
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:08,708
Two voices?

812
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:09,916
Who are you?

813
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,541
I'm Piggy. Who are you?

814
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:12,916
I'm Zixia

815
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,333
Xianglin

816
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:16,999
Joker

817
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:18,124
Bro

818
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,541
Zixia

819
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,499
Ziaxia, you're still here

820
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,249
You bitch!

821
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:29,916
I find you at last

822
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,083
What are you doing?

823
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,249
Long time no see, and you become this

824
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:34,666
Where's the Pandora's Box?

825
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:36,541
I didn't take it

826
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:39,999
Kidding

827
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,124
Give me

828
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,999
Wait

829
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:44,291
What will you do to the Box?

830
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,708
Go with me!

831
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:46,999
Fat woman! Don't hang around with me

832
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:51,833
Xianglin will go away with you...
The King Bull

833
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,124
Don't dream

834
00:51:57,709 --> 00:51:59,208
you ask him if you don't believe it

835
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,041
You said you love me

836
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,458
because you wanna take this and

837
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:04,041
go away with her?

838
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,124
Wait...

839
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:06,791
It's not true

840
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,541
Don't want you to throw it away

841
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:11,624
Great!

842
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,833
You should not do that

843
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:16,124
Look at you

844
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:17,416
Don't deny it!

845
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:18,833
I'll throw that away!

846
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:29,916
Bro...

847
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,083
What a man!

848
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,041
Shut up!

849
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,124
I love that!

850
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:39,416
You can't leave anymore

851
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:43,791
Bull, you're seriously hurt

852
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,666
Do you think that bitch hurt lesser?

853
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:47,958
Have a look!

854
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:50,416
You've deceived me so long

855
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,708
In fact, I'm not

856
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:54,083
Xianglin, who's that woman?

857
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:56,208
I won't listen to you!

858
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,124
Bastard! I'll leave you

859
00:52:58,417 --> 00:52:59,249
You affairs are none of my business

860
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,124
You get yours! And I get mine!

861
00:53:04,042 --> 00:53:05,791
Help Zixia, you have a part in the body

862
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:27,083
Beat it up, make it hurt! Then you can
do nothing about it even if you

863
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:28,083
Yes!

864
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:31,916
Wanna go?

865
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,249
Explain it clearly or you can't leave!

866
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:36,916
Don't hit him!

867
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:38,916
Bitch

868
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,666
Bitch, stand aside,
it's none of your business

869
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,166
Stop it!

870
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,583
I'm afraid that she'll hurt my body

871
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,291
I won't help you

872
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:49,249
Shut up!

873
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:50,874
I'll help her and beat you up

874
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:52,916
Have a try!

875
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,708
I'm a woman. Please don't hit her strongly.
I'll kill you

876
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:06,666
I won't give help.
I just wanna see your fight!

877
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:07,374
Go!

878
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:08,249
No

879
00:54:08,584 --> 00:54:09,791
I'll take the Box for you

880
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,499
And you can explain to your wife

881
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:13,666
Wow, you're great! Perfect!

882
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:14,458
Really?

883
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,083
You're as perfect as possible

884
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:24,208
Wait!

885
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:36,249
You!

886
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,666
Bitch, don't hit my girl

887
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,041
I like to do it

888
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:43,583
Your man has gone

889
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,499
How cool he is!

890
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:48,666
I'm a lucky woman!

891
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,291
Ok, I can play jumping down
from the cliff

892
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:04,999
Go nearer

893
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:09,708
Monkey King

894
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,374
Don't jump!

895
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,499
I don't want to do so

896
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:16,958
You prefer jumping down to seeing me

897
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,666
Ok,
I'd better go back to the Flam Mountain

898
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:26,249
I won't do this case

899
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:28,416
if I know this before

900
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,791
I don't know stealing grapes will
make me suffer such punishment

901
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,708
If I know that, I won't be a robber

902
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:37,083
Yes, sure

903
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,458
Like me, being a soldier

904
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:39,833
you have no chance yet

905
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:41,583
unless immortal comes to save you

906
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:54,416
I won't be a soldier

907
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,124
Immortal has come

908
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,624
Immortal!

909
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:08,916
Jing Jing

910
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:21,583
Granpa Buddha

911
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,249
He steams buns

912
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:24,541
None of your business!

913
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,249
Jing Jing!

914
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,374
Don't flirt with me!

915
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,541
I flirt with you because I love you

916
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,958
Listen, if you want to be my wife

917
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:44,166
don't do bad anymore in the future

918
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,666
Sure!

919
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:46,708
Let's go

920
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:48,416
Drink tea

921
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:49,916
Thank you!

922
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,291
You're welcome

923
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,291
Why bring me back to this cave?

924
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:58,708
I didn't bring you back

925
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:01,291
It's you who brought us back

926
00:57:04,459 --> 00:57:05,999
It may be because I miss Jing Jing
very much

927
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,833
Yes! When you fainted

928
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:10,708
you spoke out the name Jing Jing
98 times!

929
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:15,541
Jing Jing is my wife

930
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:17,374
and a name Zixia

931
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,124
You repeated 784 times

932
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,833
784 times

933
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,833
She must have owed you lots of money

934
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,249
I want Spider Web Cave Immortal to be
my master

935
00:57:27,584 --> 00:57:29,166
She's changed Waterfall Cave into
Spider Web Cave

936
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,333
You tell me there's no such person!

937
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:31,333
We don't know

938
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:37,083
Son of a bitch, you're still here!

939
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,458
Why did you do that to me?

940
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:41,041
Jing Jing

941
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:49,041
Jing Jing, it's nice to see you

942
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,041
What?

943
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,791
You've got thinner

944
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:56,083
I'm not the Monkey King

945
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:57,958
But I don't how to tell you

946
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,333
because you won't believe in it

947
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:00,624
I will

948
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:03,499
Because that damn monkey won't be
so gentle to me

949
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,333
Who are you?

950
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:08,624
I'll be your husband 500 years later

951
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:09,416
500 years later

952
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:10,999
you will give up this affair because of me

953
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:12,874
What I did is totally

954
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:13,916
just for you

955
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:14,833
Jing Jing, I miss you

956
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:15,916
I miss you much and much

957
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,999
I miss you much and much and much

958
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:19,499
Don't you trust me?

959
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,458
No!

960
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,041
I can't blame you

961
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:22,791
Let me see what's going on

962
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,166
But I think I know you

963
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,333
Absolutely

964
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:28,083
Very and absolutely

965
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:29,999
Very and absolutely and extremely!

966
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,708
How will we meet 500 years later?

967
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,833
At a pitch-dark night

968
00:58:38,084 --> 00:58:39,291
I'm Joker, you're Pak Jing Jing

969
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:40,291
Fantastic love

970
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:42,541
starts from a fire at the bridge

971
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:45,124
When I turn back,
you point at me with your finger

972
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:46,541
then my hand gets burning

973
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:47,708
you rush to me and hit me!

974
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,416
Hit and hit and hit!

975
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:50,374
No...

976
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:51,249
look at me...

977
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,499
yes, can you see it!

978
00:58:54,292 --> 00:58:55,666
there are many

979
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,041
twists and turns

980
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,249
Suddenly, the King Bull comes to us

981
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:02,916
I fight with him with a bone

982
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:04,666
He grabbed me to the Spider Web Cave

983
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,708
It's right that time flies

984
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,624
The following is the main content

985
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:13,416
On the cliff, we reach the climax

986
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:14,916
At that time, I touch you

987
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:16,333
You touch me too

988
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,499
We make promise that we won't separate

989
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:24,666
But happiness is always a flash of time

990
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:27,708
We only have endless pain!

991
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,249
Why will you die?

992
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,041
So I use the Box to travel back

993
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:33,291
to the past

994
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,874
I discover that you kill yourself

995
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,333
At the last moment

996
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:41,083
I save your life!

997
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:44,083
But at the last time of time travel

998
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:44,999
the Box doesn't work properly.

999
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,208
I go back to 500 years ago

1000
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:50,583
That is the story

1001
00:59:54,584 --> 00:59:55,874
What are you gonna do now?

1002
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:58,333
I've found you, I needn't go back now

1003
00:59:58,667 --> 00:59:59,708
Let's get married!

1004
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:04,416
I ... I just wake up

1005
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:06,416
I have nothing to do

1006
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:08,958
So I come here. I wanna be a disciple

1007
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:11,708
You request marriage suddenly

1008
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:14,291
I... haven't brushed my teeth!

1009
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:17,416
I know you're suspecting...

1010
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,124
If I can give you my heart

1011
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:21,333
you'll know I'm not cheating you

1012
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:23,083
it's very simple!

1013
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:27,708
You look like a thing

1014
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:28,583
Coconut?

1015
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,458
A girl said that to me

1016
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:31,624
Oh, coconut

1017
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:33,333
are his words all true?

1018
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:35,416
No need to think!

1019
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:36,583
You search the bottom!

1020
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,708
Coconut, thank you very much

1021
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:45,499
Please tell you, am I his best love?

1022
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,916
You've come back for a long time

1023
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,999
You just wanna get the Pandora's Box

1024
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,208
What do you mean?

1025
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:54,958
I'm asking you when we will get marry

1026
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,958
But you keep saying no

1027
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,208
Will you marry me?

1028
01:00:58,417 --> 01:00:59,458
I do!

1029
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,916
Is your sister crazy?

1030
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:08,208
She keeps speaking nonsense all day long

1031
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:11,083
She's not crazy.
She's something wrong with the brain

1032
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,666
If she promises...

1033
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:14,833
she has promised to marry him
7 days later

1034
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,083
you have made up your mind?

1035
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:18,458
I cheated him

1036
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,583
I'm waiting for my man to pick me up!

1037
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,999
You think that bastard will come to
pick you up?

1038
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:26,458
Congratulations!

1039
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,333
But even if he comes back

1040
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:29,624
he can't get you back

1041
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:32,124
from the King Bull

1042
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:35,708
It is fate that he can pull out
my Magic Sword

1043
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,458
He must be an unordinary man

1044
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,041
I'm sure

1045
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:41,874
I know he'll come back one day

1046
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:44,624
appear in public

1047
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,333
wearing golden armor

1048
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,583
and stepping on colorful cloud,
come to marry me

1049
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:51,916
You are crazy!

1050
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,083
I'm not crazy! This is just my hope

1051
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:58,708
Promise me! Little psycho

1052
01:01:58,917 --> 01:01:59,791
No!

1053
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,624
Bro, things are always unpredictable

1054
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,791
I can't think you'll get marry with
Miss Pak so soon

1055
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:24,416
Yes, me too

1056
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:25,874
We're happy for you!

1057
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:27,833
Thank you!

1058
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,458
You made dreams last night

1059
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:34,083
You repeated the name Zixia 785 times

1060
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,833
One time more than last night

1061
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:02,708
6 days have passed.
You'll get marry tomorrow

1062
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,458
He will come? I don't think so

1063
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,416
Yesterday, I told a spider to tell you

1064
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,624
Told you I missed you much

1065
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:34,708
Do you know?

1066
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,666
You don't know again

1067
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:40,791
I am cheating you

1068
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,624
That's fine!

1069
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:44,999
Just like a moth

1070
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:47,458
it flies to fire even it knows it'll get hurt

1071
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:51,708
Moth is so silly!

1072
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:00,708
Come out, grapes

1073
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,166
I don't want to watch you

1074
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:05,708
I just want to study

1075
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,083
the interesting relationship among humans

1076
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,708
Bro, you're a robber

1077
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,041
Don't pretend to be a scholar

1078
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,624
Even a robber has its own knowledge

1079
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,833
Stop it, go to sleep

1080
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:19,458
In your mind,
is Zixia an exclamation mark?

1081
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:20,833
Or she's a full stop?

1082
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,333
Is your mind full of question marks?

1083
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:26,874
Zixia is just a girl who I know

1084
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:28,458
I lied to her in the past

1085
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,708
I'm just feeling a little bit regretful

1086
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:32,333
I hate him

1087
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,874
I'll get marry today. What do you want?

1088
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:36,124
When you discover that

1089
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,124
you've fallen in love with a man you hate

1090
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,374
this affair is really hurting you

1091
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:43,999
But how can I fall in love
with a person I hate?

1092
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:47,166
Please give me a reason. Please!

1093
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:48,791
We don't need any reason to love a person

1094
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:49,708
Don't we?

1095
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:50,583
Do we?

1096
01:04:50,709 --> 01:04:51,208
Don't we?

1097
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,083
Do we?

1098
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,041
Don't we?

1099
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,874
Let me study it for you

1100
01:04:55,209 --> 01:04:57,708
Why are you so serious? Need we?

1101
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,124
Who?

1102
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:55,624
Time's up

1103
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,333
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

1104
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:17,708
Are you parents alive?

1105
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:19,374
Speak up!

1106
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,999
I just wanna make a new friend

1107
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,249
when I'm going to die

1108
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:27,041
How to save Master?

1109
01:06:27,459 --> 01:06:30,249
Being a devil is the same as
being a human

1110
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,374
We should be kind

1111
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,166
If we are kind

1112
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:37,249
we are not devils, we are a hybrid

1113
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,916
He understands?

1114
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,499
do you understand?

1115
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,708
No one will come to pick you up

1116
01:06:58,834 --> 01:06:59,624
Your letter

1117
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:00,791
Thank you

1118
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,041
Your conscience told me that

1119
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,666
I'm not your best love

1120
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,541
Your best love is another woman

1121
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:15,499
When I saw the thing left by her
in your heart

1122
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:19,083
I know that you came back not for me

1123
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,916
but for her

1124
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:26,583
This is God's order

1125
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,999
It is also called fate

1126
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,583
Jing Jing's gone

1127
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:36,541
I know

1128
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:38,124
I've read the letter

1129
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,416
Granpa Buddha

1130
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:40,958
What's going on with her?

1131
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,499
Have you read this letter?

1132
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:45,374
No

1133
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:46,333
You read it

1134
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:47,333
Good

1135
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:48,708
Wanna go?

1136
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,583
I know my sister Pak Jing Jing
has been here

1137
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,374
Where is she now?

1138
01:08:02,709 --> 01:08:03,541
Speak up!

1139
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,583
Does she owe you this much?

1140
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:08,333
You don't let your sister go

1141
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:12,708
Just tell me

1142
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,499
I don't know

1143
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,999
it is heard that you're kind

1144
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,208
They are your friends?

1145
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:23,333
No!

1146
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,499
Do you know?

1147
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,541
Kill me if you must kill someone

1148
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:41,499
They don't know your sister

1149
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:43,166
All of them are innocent

1150
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:44,458
I agree!

1151
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,624
I admire bold people very much

1152
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,499
If you're one of them

1153
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:56,791
I can fulfill your desire!

1154
01:08:59,125 --> 01:08:59,916
Wait!

1155
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,708
I really think that
you aren't scared of death!

1156
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:06,999
I'm gonna die. Please do me a favor

1157
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,624
I've heard that if you cut fast and
accurately

1158
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,124
the man got hurt won't die at once
when he's cut open

1159
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:13,416
He can still see

1160
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:15,458
Help me, do it as fast as you can

1161
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:16,374
Tear out my heart

1162
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:17,999
Let you see it clearly

1163
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:19,666
What are you talking about?

1164
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,874
A friend of mind

1165
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,499
left something in my heart

1166
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,583
I want to know what that is

1167
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:59,124
It's strange

1168
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,624
Humans and devils are born
by their mothers

1169
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,999
Different person acts as a different mom

1170
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:13,291
A devil's mom is a devil's mom

1171
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,374
I can take this

1172
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:28,999
What's your name of your mom?

1173
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,708
Kowtow to Heaven and Earth

1174
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,416
Let's marry

1175
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:38,374
Wait!

1176
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,499
Look!

1177
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:43,458
Now, she is the younger sister and
she'll save her elder sister

1178
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:48,416
The elder sister
will save the younger sister

1179
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:49,999
What do you want?

1180
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:53,791
We're married today. Let my sister go

1181
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:55,374
I won't break my promise

1182
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,333
I don't want to fight anymore

1183
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,416
You go!

1184
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:18,249
I just have one sister in my life

1185
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:27,583
Sister

1186
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:29,541
King Bull!

1187
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:30,999
I won't let my sister marry you

1188
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:31,916
Sister

1189
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:33,958
What are you talking about?

1190
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:36,541
I just have one sister in my whole life

1191
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,541
Come on!

1192
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,791
I'm right

1193
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:45,166
Faster than me

1194
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:46,624
you're so great

1195
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:00,708
It's time

1196
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:05,708
Changing image

1197
01:12:21,084 --> 01:12:21,791
Xiang Xiang?

1198
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,124
I'm not your sister

1199
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:24,541
Xiang Xiang, what are you doing?

1200
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,583
Brother

1201
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,833
Brother, my Changing Image Magic...

1202
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,791
Xiang Xiang

1203
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:30,124
Turn me into a dog

1204
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:31,833
Who are you?

1205
01:12:32,084 --> 01:12:33,208
I'm Qingxia!

1206
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,291
Sister...

1207
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:35,833
I will kill you

1208
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:37,874
Go to save Master!

1209
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,583
Don't hit my sister!

1210
01:12:57,084 --> 01:12:58,249
Come to save us

1211
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:09,166
Kill that girl!

1212
01:13:09,334 --> 01:13:09,916
No!

1213
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:11,166
It's you!... Go away!

1214
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,249
I'll kill the one who block my way

1215
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:17,291
Goddess

1216
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:19,291
I'm about to understand your words

1217
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,791
I use my eyes to see

1218
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,958
When I'm dying

1219
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,499
I use my heart to see this world

1220
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:27,958
and all things

1221
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:30,916
I see it clearly

1222
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,541
That girl...

1223
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,541
left a drop of tear in my heart

1224
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,249
I felt

1225
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,416
her sorrow

1226
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,124
Have you given up

1227
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,708
all things in human world?

1228
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:47,916
Yes

1229
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:49,499
Life and death

1230
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:50,666
is minor

1231
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:52,583
Great, great

1232
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:55,416
Congratulations

1233
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:57,166
Bro, what's up?

1234
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:58,041
Come on, have a sit

1235
01:13:58,334 --> 01:13:59,166
Have a sit

1236
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:01,624
It's unlucky that 3 friends of mine were
get involved

1237
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,416
It's none of their business!

1238
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:07,124
But I don't understand

1239
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,916
How can human hatred last 10 years,
50 years

1240
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:11,666
and even 500 years?

1241
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:14,041
What hatred is it?

1242
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:16,291
So the Longevity Monk went to the west

1243
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:18,208
and got scriptures

1244
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:20,499
which clean our heart

1245
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:21,833
Understand

1246
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:22,874
I wanna stay. There are

1247
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,374
many things waiting for me to do

1248
01:14:24,584 --> 01:14:25,958
You go to have your next lives
as soon as possible!

1249
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:26,958
Good!

1250
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,541
You're slashed because of me

1251
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,583
I hope I can pay you back in my next life

1252
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:33,041
Pay back more

1253
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:35,166
I can do what I can do, grapes

1254
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:37,208
Goodbye

1255
01:14:37,459 --> 01:14:39,166
We're leaving

1256
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:45,208
I wanna warn you again

1257
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:46,333
After wearing the Gold Ring

1258
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,166
you're no longer a normal human

1259
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,958
You can't touch human desires anymore

1260
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:51,833
If you do so

1261
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,583
the Gold Ring will get smaller and smaller

1262
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:55,666
It's very uncomfortable

1263
01:14:56,084 --> 01:14:57,041
Ok!

1264
01:14:58,584 --> 01:15:00,458
Before wearing this Ring

1265
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,374
what do you wanna say?

1266
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:10,291
I had my best love

1267
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:11,916
But I don't treasure her

1268
01:15:12,334 --> 01:15:15,083
When I lost her, I felt regretful

1269
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:19,041
It is the most painful thing in this world

1270
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:21,374
If God can give me

1271
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:22,791
another chance

1272
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,583
I will say "I love you" to her!

1273
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,916
If there is a time limit

1274
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,083
I hope... it is 10 thousand years

1275
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:45,791
Kowtow

1276
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,708
Kowtow to the forefather,
drink wedding wine

1277
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:01,458
Now you're a member of the Bull Family

1278
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:28,916
Colorful clouds...

1279
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,083
Look like marshmallow

1280
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,333
Really?

1281
01:16:39,334 --> 01:16:41,333
Be careful!

1282
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:43,583
Thundering

1283
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:46,291
It's raining, get the clothes

1284
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,708
Damn monkey, you flirt with my life

1285
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,208
Although we are friends

1286
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:24,208
I'll indict you slander if you repeat again

1287
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:25,708
Kill him

1288
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:43,874
Sorry!

1289
01:17:44,334 --> 01:17:46,374
This sneeze may make you disappointed

1290
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,624
Joker

1291
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:01,458
Are you satisfied this time?

1292
01:18:04,334 --> 01:18:05,583
Master

1293
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,708
It's the Monkey King

1294
01:18:08,959 --> 01:18:10,499
I just thought it's a piece of cloud

1295
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,999
Master, I committed many offences
in the past

1296
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:16,541
It's lucky that Goddess show a right road
to me

1297
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,916
Now I'm gonna worship Buddha
whole-heartedly

1298
01:18:19,084 --> 01:18:21,833
I won't feel reluctant to give up
human desires

1299
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,249
Master

1300
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:26,208
I will take the responsibility

1301
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,958
Great

1302
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,958
You're now on the right road

1303
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,041
Joker

1304
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,166
Joker, you're here eventually

1305
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:37,291
Miss!

1306
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:41,541
I... know a friend called Joker

1307
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:45,666
He ask me to tell Zixia Immortal
something

1308
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:46,708
Is it you?

1309
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,833
Joker

1310
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:48,958
Stop!

1311
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:50,916
I'm asking you, is it you?

1312
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:53,666
Is it you?

1313
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:55,624
Speak up

1314
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,499
Yes

1315
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:02,416
He said he had went back to the
starting point

1316
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,291
And he hoped that

1317
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:07,999
she would find her best love
as soon as possible

1318
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,249
Don't kid me, Joker

1319
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:14,999
Let me tell you again

1320
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:22,458
I'm the Monkey... King

1321
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:23,874
Don't make any mistake

1322
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,541
I'm gonna kill you today

1323
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:30,999
Change!

1324
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,874
Beat you to death, damn monkey

1325
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,374
Look out my fork

1326
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:47,916
I like barbecued chicken wing!

1327
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:50,041
Use my fork to make
barbecued chicken wing?

1328
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:52,416
I nearly forget it

1329
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:54,541
I'm a vegetarian

1330
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:56,958
Give me back!

1331
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:14,291
Is it funny! Tell me!

1332
01:20:14,584 --> 01:20:20,583
Tell me...

1333
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:24,541
Why are you so quiet?

1334
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:26,874
Help me

1335
01:20:28,459 --> 01:20:29,374
Sorry

1336
01:20:29,584 --> 01:20:32,374
I don't want you lose face in front of
your bros

1337
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:33,791
Let me help you

1338
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,124
Give back to you

1339
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,791
Great! Look out

1340
01:20:58,167 --> 01:20:59,333
Super bugs

1341
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:07,624
I'm scared, so many bugs

1342
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,541
It's lucky that I have many little monkeys

1343
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:33,958
Kill all the monkeys

1344
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,208
Let him kill

1345
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,624
Are you the Monkey King?

1346
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,708
Will you go to the west to get scriptures?

1347
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:01,124
bring me with you

1348
01:22:04,584 --> 01:22:05,708
Yes!

1349
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:08,166
She can act as a whore

1350
01:22:08,334 --> 01:22:10,624
if she goes with me

1351
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,708
That's great...

1352
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:16,208
I can't take this anymore

1353
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:17,708
Come here, hold me tight!

1354
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:22,958
You can't take me anymore

1355
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:24,083
I can

1356
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:25,499
I can't take you anymore

1357
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:28,541
You're so ugly, we're immortals

1358
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:30,624
please no more sexual harassment

1359
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,583
Why did you do that to me?

1360
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,416
Are you angry?

1361
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:36,708
I would get angry!

1362
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:40,041
Cry if you want

1363
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:03,583
I'll kill you all bastards

1364
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:09,958
Magic Fan

1365
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:21,083
Help me

1366
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,041
So troublesome!

1367
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:26,708
Master!

1368
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,999
Monkey King, help me!

1369
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,624
I can't believe that you do that to me

1370
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:43,958
You two protect Master

1371
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:46,041
I know

1372
01:23:49,709 --> 01:23:50,791
Zixia, no

1373
01:23:55,834 --> 01:23:56,791
What are you doing?

1374
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,833
Will you come?

1375
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:59,833
Why are you so concerned about me?
Let me die

1376
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:02,708
I'm not concerned about out.

1377
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:04,666
We'll treasure our lives

1378
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:06,999
You are no immortals

1379
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,166
Monkey King, you can't defeat me

1380
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,208
What a wide ditch

1381
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:34,208
It's coming!

1382
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,416
Stop kidding

1383
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:39,791
Put the whole city to the side of the sun

1384
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,249
Whom can you save now?

1385
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:57,166
Don't bother me, you go to hell

1386
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:58,541
Wait!

1387
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:05,666
Lie to me again?

1388
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:26,166
Damn monkey,
how dare you stop my attack!

1389
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,874
Go!

1390
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:32,708
Go back!

1391
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:46,708
Shit, burning

1392
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:50,499
Stupid!

1393
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:52,791
Bitch! What do you want?

1394
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:53,583
Stupid!

1395
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:54,666
you're stupid!

1396
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,124
You're not human

1397
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:58,666
Don't get mad

1398
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,416
Do you understand what I've told you?

1399
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:02,541
Do you know I'm not an immortal now?

1400
01:26:03,209 --> 01:26:04,458
I only understand one thing

1401
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:06,166
Love means pain

1402
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,874
Don't bullshit with me

1403
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,958
You've mistaken me!

1404
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,208
Where did you buy these gold rings?

1405
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:19,499
Be careful!

1406
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:24,708
Zixia

1407
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:36,624
Master, look out!

1408
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:49,041
Zixia

1409
01:26:55,334 --> 01:26:58,833
My lover is a hero

1410
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:04,458
One day he'll come with a cloud,
come to me and marry me

1411
01:27:04,834 --> 01:27:06,708
I've guessed the start

1412
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:11,624
But I haven't guessed the ending

1413
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,124
Master...

1414
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:00,083
I want your life!

1415
01:28:38,959 --> 01:28:41,541
It's very hot! You'll be a roast pig

1416
01:28:41,959 --> 01:28:43,041
It'll explode

1417
01:28:43,209 --> 01:28:44,916
We have to get the help of Pandora's Box

1418
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:45,916
Go

1419
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,916
The sun is coming, hurry up

1420
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,291
Bring Master go

1421
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:53,708
Hurry up!

1422
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:57,458
Qingxia

1423
01:28:58,292 --> 01:28:59,708
My sister is not here

1424
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,624
I think I should go back
to be Buddha's lampwick again

1425
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:03,958
Goodbye

1426
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:40,666
Big Brother, you get up so early!

1427
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:41,624
What's happened?

1428
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,666
Big Brother, you've forgot it

1429
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:45,374
I met a storm last night

1430
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:47,124
You brought me here!

1431
01:29:47,709 --> 01:29:48,583
Go!

1432
01:29:49,709 --> 01:29:50,708
Master, where are we going now?

1433
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:51,833
India

1434
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,208
Why does Master speak in this way?

1435
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:55,874
Master is a clear cut guy. Let's go

1436
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,833
Master, walk slowly please

1437
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,333
Bro, be careful!

1438
01:30:03,542 --> 01:30:04,333
Thanks!

1439
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:10,166
It is said that this was the Waterfall Cave
500 years ago

1440
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,458
It's the living place of the Monkey King

1441
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:12,666
Since he's killed the King Bull

1442
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:13,708
and saved the Longevity Monk

1443
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,208
there are no devils in the world

1444
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:17,333
After that, many people came here,
fooling around

1445
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:18,208
That guy put on a pig head

1446
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,458
and say that he's Piggy

1447
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:21,999
Bro

1448
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,374
There is only make-upon your face

1449
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:26,291
Please be more professional

1450
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:28,499
Look at your hair

1451
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:30,708
There are two cakes on your head

1452
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:33,249
You should pay more money to make
yourself up

1453
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,166
What's up?

1454
01:30:34,459 --> 01:30:35,583
Your image is really disgusting

1455
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:37,041
Don't angry at me,
I'm always an honest guy

1456
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,416
I won't get angry

1457
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:39,791
Cut me if you like

1458
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,999
You son of bitch!
Do you think I daren't do so?

1459
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,374
Thanks

1460
01:30:46,584 --> 01:30:48,208
This is really sage

1461
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,333
Big Bro

1462
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,458
Bro, let's go

1463
01:30:58,209 --> 01:30:59,166
Buddha Cave

1464
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:01,583
Fine, thanks

1465
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:08,291
Thanks...

1466
01:31:11,042 --> 01:31:12,208
Big Bro, what are you looking at?

1467
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:14,374
Both girls who know Piggy

1468
01:31:14,584 --> 01:31:15,624
Who?

1469
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,124
Beancurd Beauty

1470
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,083
It is heard that

1471
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,416
they sell beancurds

1472
01:31:19,709 --> 01:31:20,333
They have earned much money

1473
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,708
for their husbands to attend
the civil service exam

1474
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,624
The Highest Graduate

1475
01:31:39,542 --> 01:31:40,708
Mei!

1476
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:43,166
Congratulations!

1477
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:44,874
You husband has become
the Highest Graduates of the exam

1478
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,708
Go to welcome him

1479
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:50,791
Honey

1480
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:54,333
Honey Honey

1481
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,999
Go away, no one of your business

1482
01:32:01,292 --> 01:32:04,416
Honey, Ah

1483
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,916
You work so hard making beancurds

1484
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:10,249
You work so hard making beancurd

1485
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,583
Honey

1486
01:32:13,834 --> 01:32:16,124
I know how to make beancurds, too

1487
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:20,499
Go!

1488
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,708
Blow the ball

1489
01:32:28,959 --> 01:32:30,291
I blow the ball up

1490
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,541
Blow the ball up and up

1491
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:34,624
Come here!

1492
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,708
It's crowded!

1493
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:36,583
Monkey King

1494
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:37,874
Master

1495
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:39,833
Have a look

1496
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:40,833
Ok!

1497
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,583
They've stood there for 3 days

1498
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:50,708
They didn't

1499
01:32:50,959 --> 01:32:52,583
Look, devil

1500
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:03,958
I think I shouldn't come

1501
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:06,166
It's too late

1502
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:08,916
Leave some memories, Ok?

1503
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:10,999
I don't need memory

1504
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:12,874
I want you

1505
01:33:14,459 --> 01:33:16,083
You can just get my body

1506
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:17,791
instead of my spirit

1507
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:19,124
I've got a lover already

1508
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:20,499
We won't have good result

1509
01:33:20,792 --> 01:33:21,666
Let go of me

1510
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:24,458
I'll let you go

1511
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:26,541
But you have to kiss me
before you've left

1512
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:28,708
Have a kiss...

1513
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,083
Kiss...

1514
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,499
I'm just a powerless warrior

1515
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:34,124
If kiss you

1516
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,874
my image will be ruined

1517
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:37,249
You're lying

1518
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:39,458
You daren't kiss me

1519
01:33:39,709 --> 01:33:40,874
Because you still love me

1520
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,166
I'm telling you

1521
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:43,958
If you reject me

1522
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:45,374
you'll regret for your whole life

1523
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:47,833
I won't kiss you even if I regret

1524
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:51,583
It's fate

1525
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:35,458
I will stay here for my whole life

1526
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:36,999
I love you

1527
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:24,041
What's up?

1528
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:26,166
That guy looks strange

1529
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:27,958
I know

1530
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,583
He looks like a dog!
