1
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,399
In Ming Dynasty,
22nd year of Emperor Sun.

2
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:05,029
There was a civil war in Japan
among the generals.

3
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,003
One of the clan Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

4
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,100
United Japan.

5
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,771
Some generals planned for a rebel

6
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:16,381
and departed from their hometown.

7
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:21,180
They gathered by
the seashore of South China.

8
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:23,046
To wait for restoration
to the throne.

9
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,486
They communicated with
the local power.

10
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:29,188
And fought against the government.

11
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:52,613
- Announce my order.
- Yes.

12
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,778
I'm the in-charge of government.

13
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,651
The arms they grabbed is bought...

14
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:59,055
from Holland by the government.

15
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,219
If you return.
I can ask the emperor for mercy.

16
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:05,855
Or, everyone should be killed.

17
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,331
- Behead all of them.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,239
I'm sent by his Honour to tell you.

19
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,601
The arms you robbed
belong to the government.

20
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:18,711
You'll be exempted from
capital punishment if you return it.

21
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,643
If not, all of you will be killed.

22
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,577
Have you finished?

23
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,273
How can you talk to me like that?
How dare you?

24
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:37,293
I'll teach you a lesson
with my Holland battleship!

25
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:48,869
Who made the signal?

26
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,278
My Holland battleship!

27
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,188
Hong!

28
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,160
Who is it?

29
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,957
Invincible Dawn.

30
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,568
Invincible Dawn!

31
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,603
The men from the government.

32
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:31,867
Send them signal.

33
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:36,346
Master,
we've got signal from Hattori.

34
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,181
Chimp! I'll send you
to negotiate with them.

35
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:42,954
Leave if any of you
want to stay with me.

36
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,086
- What else...
- Chief!

37
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,959
- Kill all of them!
- Yes, Chief.

38
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,825
Chimp, let's see who is the first.

39
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,639
Brother...

40
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:07,346
Ling, watch out

41
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:09,938
You drink while you ride.

42
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,142
I'm afraid
you'll crash to hill one day.

43
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,182
Bull shit! Mind yourself.

44
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,877
After this hill,
we'll reach our destination.

45
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,712
You've repeated this twice.

46
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:19,689
Would you repeat it twice again?

47
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,188
I can't help! there're so many hills!

48
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,524
We'd better keep on ridding.

49
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,027
Flying stance!

50
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,433
Don't block my way!

51
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,834
Sword energy?

52
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:39,874
Fly! Little brother.

53
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,982
Brother.

54
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,284
Don't be afraid, just stay claim.

55
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,959
Oh God, my wine!

56
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,501
Brother! Wait for me!

57
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,713
Pay my wine back.

58
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,044
Or at least, apologize.

59
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,951
Go down and negotiate with him.

60
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:23,920
Leave him to me.

61
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,414
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,352
I can fight very well.
Do you dare to provoke me?

63
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,155
I've almost dead.
I've to save this bottle.

64
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:32,764
Tell me, which one I want?
Wine or life?

65
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,063
Such a drunk, you are lucky.

66
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,172
Just a waste of my time.

67
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,604
I think there is hope!

68
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,315
You just care your bottle.

69
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,008
Isn't it valuable than my life?

70
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,016
You know how to fly, but it can't.

71
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:55,851
You'd be understanding.

72
00:06:56,524 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh my horse.

73
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,306
My poor little dead horse.

74
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:23,108
Never any complaint all your life.

75
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,550
Deserted and all alone in the end.

76
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:30,488
You call this justice?

77
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,956
It's not easy being a horse,
let alone a man.

78
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't be a horse again
in your next life.

79
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,031
But it's even harder to be a man.

80
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,394
I know that.

81
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:45,704
I may end up like you one day...

82
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,972
or even worse.

83
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,243
- My body may be left in the open...
- Stop...

84
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:53,869
Well, who knows?

85
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,740
Don't talk about
something impossible.

86
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,851
What, no more wine.

87
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,214
How can I sleep without wine?

88
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,754
You still want to sleep?

89
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,549
Stop! Big brother,
pull yourself together.

90
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,019
The horse is an old friend of ours...

91
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,093
and we don't feel anything for him.

92
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,694
When do you guys become friends?

93
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:11,592
Your horse threw you down
a few days ago...

94
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,823
and you wanted to get rid of him.

95
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,832
You almost put him on sale.

96
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:19,371
That's in the past.

97
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,430
You have no empathy.

98
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,236
I understand. Men drink wine,
horses eat grass.

99
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,913
Instead of incense, let's burn grass
to feed him in heaven.

100
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,172
You mean it?

101
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:33,843
Sure! Horses don't drink wine.

102
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:34,818
Who wants a drunken horse?

103
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,755
Let's take the drier grass,
they burn faster.

104
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,188
They will reach heaven sooner.

105
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,652
Dinner time, brother.

106
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:45,128
Brother, you are cheating me again.

107
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,631
- Little brother.
- I'm not talking to you.

108
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,404
Well, just listen.

109
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,508
Our brethren and us
have been separated for a year.

110
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,701
We looked everywhere
for a place to retreat.

111
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,369
We lost contact with them.

112
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,243
Finally, we found Ox Mountain.

113
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,247
We can go into seclusion there.

114
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:09,185
Wind and snow, why forcing us?

115
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,913
Heroes do not last forever.

116
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,183
The outside world is so ugly.

117
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,156
We won't come back anymore.

118
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:22,627
Ever-lasting heroes?

119
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,670
Well, some music for you.

120
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,806
Tomorrow we'll hurry to the inn.

121
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,381
To meet with our brethren.

122
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,741
I wonder if they are asleep now.

123
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,187
Can you play some something else?

124
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,026
"Hero of Heroes."

125
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,329
Your mind is still
on the Highlander girl?

126
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:51,794
How do you know?

127
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,329
All you can think of
is wine and girls.

128
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,267
How can you seclude like this?

129
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:01,840
You must have a hard life.

130
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,773
I am not going to be a monk.

131
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,434
I don't have to live a quiet life.

132
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:17,757
"The seas laugh,
lashing on both shores."

133
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:25,024
"Canned in the waves,
we have only here and now."

134
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:38,175
"The heavens laugh
at the troubled world."

135
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:45,213
"Only they know,
who is to win or lose."

136
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:52,950
"The earth laughs,
no more solitude."

137
00:10:53,394 --> 00:11:00,391
"The waves wash away
all the beauties in the world."

138
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:07,798
"The wind laughs, loneliness comes."

139
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:15,081
"Our aspiration overcomes the moon."

140
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,511
Chief!

141
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,298
Chief,

142
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,834
I can't hear anyone coming.

143
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,470
I think Ling won't come tonight.

144
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:42,502
Blue Phoenix.

145
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,473
I've got it, we'll keep on waiting.

146
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,135
That's good.

147
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,613
Wait!

148
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,750
One year over,
you play this song every day.

149
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,078
I'm dizzy!

150
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:59,253
When Ling reaches here,
I'll ask him to play too.

151
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,694
To make you all dizzy.

152
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,605
No matter how powerful you are.

153
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,108
You are always the weaker sex.

154
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:21,744
What?

155
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,946
Listen carefully, Chief...

156
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,552
A horse is coming our way.

157
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,945
Come up.

158
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:32,855
Good gracious!

159
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,424
Chief.

160
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:37,192
To make up,
shut up for the next three days.

161
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,860
If you speak...

162
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,963
You will lose your tongue.

163
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,269
Have some wine.

164
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,265
You like wine?

165
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:54,343
You'll speak up after a few drinks.

166
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,972
Then your tongue
will add body to my wine.

167
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,277
Why don't you drink up?

168
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,619
Show me your tongue.

169
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,915
Try out the good wine.

170
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,462
Your tongue should get used to
the wine before being cut off.

171
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:19,537
Put your tongue back into the wine.

172
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:22,932
I'm prepared to die, come on.

173
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,771
Chief, tell Ling that you like him.

174
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,847
Ask him to stay and drink with you.

175
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,313
I've finished my speech.

176
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,483
He wants to lead a secluded life.

177
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,289
But I'm still with the worldly mass.

178
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,585
He can give up, but not l.

179
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,389
A lot has happened
in the Sun Moon Sect lately.

180
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,727
My father has disappeared.

181
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,502
How can a Chief like me
just leave like that?

182
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,003
I smell danger.

183
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,266
Chief!

184
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,606
Alert everyone!

185
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,012
Sound the alarm.

186
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:09,418
Go up the roof.

187
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,524
- On guard, everybody.
- Right!

188
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:24,597
Come in at your own risk.

189
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:39,877
Attack!

190
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,724
Watch out!

191
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,226
- Disperse!
- Right!

192
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,062
Japanese ninjas!

193
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,347
Here they come, watch out!

194
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,988
They're coming our way.

195
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,324
Spread out,
we have to change our strategy.

196
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,135
You give me scorpions
and I give you snakes in return.

197
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:46,984
Come back.

198
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,957
Who are you?

199
00:15:58,765 --> 00:15:59,857
Stop hiding.

200
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,605
Come back.

201
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,833
Good work.

202
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:13,740
"The Whirlwind Blow".

203
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:15,139
Energy from the sword.

204
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,106
"The Slaying Sword."

205
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,447
Watch out!

206
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:26,390
Super!

207
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,823
"The Slaying Sword."

208
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,929
"The Recoiling Whip."

209
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,838
Who are you?
What do you have against us?

210
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:46,973
Spit it out.

211
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,239
"Twin Swords."

212
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,782
"The Flying Bomb."

213
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,085
Chief.

214
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,960
- Blue Phoenix.
- Come this way.

215
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,045
You better walk fast.

216
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,612
"The Flying Bomb."

217
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,336
Looks like Ying's Whip.

218
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,945
She must be in trouble,
let's look for her.

219
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,411
Right, I'll go the other way.

220
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,287
Who is it?

221
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:08,721
Oh, it's you.

222
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:12,930
Why are you still with me?
Let's spread out.

223
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,294
I nearly go nicked.

224
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:16,799
I am going to show you.

225
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,336
We have no contact here.

226
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,732
Fighting our own people.

227
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,897
We better use a secret code
from now on.

228
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,269
In case anything happens...

229
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,502
We can avoid any mishap.

230
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:25,442
What's the code?

231
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,910
When anything comes up,

232
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,345
- say your own name.
- Good, that's too easy!

233
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,877
You're always too quick to agree.

234
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,359
Get away.

235
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,433
Why didn't you say your name?

236
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:52,467
That was our agreed code.

237
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,970
I panicked and forgot my name.

238
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,006
What did you say?

239
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:58,336
A few dead bodies over there.

240
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:00,209
Dead bodies?

241
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,274
Where's your sword?

242
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,909
It stayed with the dead horse.

243
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:06,244
Follow me.

244
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:08,479
It's over there.

245
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,588
Touch wood!

246
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:13,852
Inside may just be the same.

247
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,495
Scorpion!

248
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,025
One of a kind.
Perfect to be add body to the wine.

249
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,169
That should make a strong tonic wine.

250
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,234
Go in.

251
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,221
Fighting's still going on down there.

252
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:56,663
Take this, don't come down
unless I say the code.

253
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:05,836
Where are you heading?

254
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,081
The Wah Mountain Swordplay.

255
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,454
Watch out.

256
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,095
- "The Dragon in the Ocean".
- "The Seven-Star Rotation".

257
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,232
- The Wah Mountain Swordplay?
- Right.

258
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,493
Who are you?

259
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:31,729
I'm Ling.

260
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,404
Ling? The secret code!

261
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:35,471
"The Flight of the Star".

262
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:37,441
Wait a minute.

263
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:38,440
Right on!

264
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,273
Let's continue.

265
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,108
We're on the same side.

266
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,391
Get up, they are our brethren.

267
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,857
Good thing your technique
is not good enough...

268
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,893
Would have been
a few more dead bodies.

269
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,227
Buck-tooth, Scum Bag and Luke,
you're here.

270
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,728
Our own people fighting each other?

271
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:06,599
We say hello to
each other in this way.

272
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:09,173
You are quite
a few inches taller now.

273
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:11,139
She can't fit into our pants now.

274
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,505
Stop growing taller!

275
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:14,111
Shrink a bit!

276
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,273
- Taller...
- Shorter...

277
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,410
My turn now!

278
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:21,578
I can see that, it's not your turn.

279
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,758
Luke, the place was in shambles...

280
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:30,692
when you arrived?

281
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,420
Yes, but the smoke
was still smoldering.

282
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:34,224
Looks like the assault
was just before dawn.

283
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,496
Where is Chief Ying?

284
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,103
She must have been kidnapped.

285
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,665
Big brother, look at this.

286
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,380
This doesn't
belong to the Mainlanders.

287
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,950
It's not a knife or a sword.

288
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:55,451
There is a horde of Japanese gypsies
in the vicinity.

289
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,644
Do these belong to them?

290
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,485
Brother,
this belongs to the Sun Moon Sect.

291
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:01,058
Chief Ying must have been
kept hostage.

292
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,684
It's feud between the Sun Moon Sect
and the gypsies.

293
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,659
We can't be the mediator
all the time.

294
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:05,762
Chief Ying is our friend.

295
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:06,897
We should help as much as possible.

296
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:07,929
It's a never ending story
of our times.

297
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:09,726
OK... let me get something
to eat first.

298
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,268
There must be food in there.

299
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:14,339
- Let's cook a meal.
- Fine.

300
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,369
Kiddo... have you seen her?

301
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:22,512
She seems to be in the toilet.

302
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,546
She must be upstairs.

303
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:30,355
Always calling me Kiddo.
Don't I look like a girl?

304
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,854
Is it hard to be a lady?

305
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,793
A girl usually has extra hairpieces.

306
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,432
Where is Kiddo?

307
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,894
Kiddo, where are you?

308
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:47,369
I'm here.

309
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:49,869
Such a nuisance!

310
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,973
Hold on, don't fall over.

311
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:56,605
Have you seen Kiddo?

312
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,277
Are you blind?

313
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,492
Help!

314
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,189
My foot hurts.

315
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:20,100
Why you become crazy?

316
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:21,872
What wrong with you?

317
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,472
How come Kiddo's hair
look so different?

318
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:30,047
Jesus, Kiddo becomes woman!

319
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,682
You'd be in trouble!

320
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,284
What's up?

321
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:36,720
Look at me, talk to me.

322
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,084
Forget it, nothing.

323
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:39,452
My God!

324
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:41,124
She isn't like a female nor male.

325
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:42,817
She's wore our trousers too much.

326
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:43,985
She is poor!

327
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:45,495
Chilli pepper!

328
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:46,430
She used to lend her trousers...

329
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,691
to you.

330
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,801
Stop mentioning the past.

331
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,328
Too spicy?

332
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:55,437
Smells good.

333
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,567
Flowers?

334
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,368
Highlander flowers?

335
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,238
That's rouge for cosmetics.

336
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,775
It belongs to Kiddo.

337
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,214
All gone.

338
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,009
Hide it, quick!

339
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,312
All gone?

340
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:12,116
Use spicy powder to replace it.

341
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,490
- What's up?
- Nothing.

342
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,668
- Good.
- What's the matter?

343
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,897
Are you sure?

344
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,267
Really sure?

345
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,810
Really, are you alright?

346
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,038
Fine.

347
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:35,971
They are weird!

348
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,914
Two of them have gone hunting
in the nearby village.

349
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,575
They're not back yet?

350
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,377
There are bunnies and pheasants.

351
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,884
- Someone's coming.
- Let me see.

352
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,220
The scouts!

353
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:58,262
Sir, there is an inn ahead of us.

354
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,335
Brother...

355
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,305
What's the matter?

356
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,775
A bunch of scouts
are out in the woods.

357
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:05,876
What should we do?

358
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,413
Don't be afraid,
we haven't done anything.

359
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,542
How do you explain the dead bodies?

360
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,317
What's the explanation?

361
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,749
What should we say?

362
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,117
The soup is hot.

363
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:20,221
The soup is hot, and we've hot.

364
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:28,860
What should we do?
They're coming our way.

365
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,768
The scouts want to make contribution.

366
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:32,529
They'll think that
we've slaughterers.

367
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,036
Let's put on our veil
before we fight our way out.

368
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:35,265
I'm not fighting.

369
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,775
Are you kidding?

370
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:40,468
Didn't we decided
not to get involved?

371
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,079
Pack up and slip away in the back.

372
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,982
I know, bring more wine.

373
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:46,116
Fetch it, quick.

374
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,479
What about the soup?

375
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,713
Take it with us.

376
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,451
- Where is Scum Bag?
- He is washing himself.

377
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:56,353
What to do?

378
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:58,157
Such a nuisance, I'll fetch him.

379
00:25:58,364 --> 00:25:59,262
Hurry up.

380
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:00,328
Master.

381
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,467
The smoke means
someone's still inside.

382
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:03,727
Please decide what to do.

383
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:06,401
We've been surrounded, Scum Bag.

384
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:08,129
Let's go.

385
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,865
- My pants!
- Forget them, run for your life.

386
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,013
They coming in,
should we wait for Scum Bag?

387
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,115
We can lie down
and pretend to be dead.

388
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:19,545
OK, hurry up.

389
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,533
Something's going on outside.

390
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,637
Maybe, there are enemies.

391
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,436
Let two men stay and check
if anyone's still alive.

392
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:46,067
- Yes sir, you guys follow me.
- Yes sir.

393
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,687
We've checked, they're all dead.

394
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,586
I double-checked.

395
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,624
Iet's go.

396
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,397
Catch him for the chief.

397
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,167
We found a horse.

398
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:18,969
I won't let them take him away.

399
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:21,112
My poor foot, delicious soup!

400
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,989
- Catch them...
- Yes.

401
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,353
Inform the troops to stop Ling.

402
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,102
Hurry up, he's ahead of us.

403
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:47,633
Catch them, hurry up.

404
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:56,170
Big brother.

405
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:58,774
The scouts are after him,
please help.

406
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,508
Get yourself armed.

407
00:28:02,255 --> 00:28:03,950
Lend me a sword, anyone?

408
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:07,687
- Where's my sword?
- Hurry up.

409
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,317
- Take this one.
- It's mine.

410
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:10,754
A sword does not save two masters.

411
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,296
We'll take turns to use it.

412
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,539
What happened?

413
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,905
Ling must have gone to save Ying.

414
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,672
- Let's go.
- He likes wine and women!

415
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:55,796
What's up?

416
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:26,030
Strange weather!

417
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,746
Here they come again.

418
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,255
Alright, I'm at your service.

419
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:52,954
With the Sacred Volume in hand.

420
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,996
I'm on the top of the world.

421
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,380
"The Wavering Sword".

422
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:26,925
Hey, my wine.

423
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,727
What does that mean?

424
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,926
You're feeding the fish with my wine?

425
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,403
Good.

426
00:30:45,518 --> 00:30:47,816
Excellent wine.

427
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,278
Perfect wine!

428
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,334
Good wine
deserve connoisseurs like us.

429
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:12,276
My name is Ling.

430
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,037
Would you mind telling me your name?

431
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,844
You have a problem with that?

432
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:18,177
Or else I'll give you a nickname.

433
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:20,512
Like...

434
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:23,277
Lady, are you trying to catch a fish?

435
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:27,083
Let's chat a bit more.

436
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,058
You babble too much, youngster.

437
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,196
You are trespassing my sphere.

438
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,993
I'll spare your life
you show your face and explain.

439
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,071
He can be heard without being seen.

440
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:44,375
It's too soon to tell
if he is friend or not.

441
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,570
He's after me, stay away from this.

442
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:54,182
When I come back
I'll give you a name.

443
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:00,953
I'm here at your disposal.

444
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:02,421
When I speak, I hope you are
on my same wavelength.

445
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:03,858
Can you hear me?

446
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,824
Can you?

447
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:12,128
1, 2, 3, looks it's not working.

448
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,931
Lady.

449
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,668
Must be one of her days at the beach.

450
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,182
How come you little thing...

451
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,551
Iook so plain all of a sudden.

452
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,623
Don't worry, I won't give you up.

453
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:38,121
Something pretty to keep you company.

454
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:41,489
You won't be alone from now on.

455
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,769
So many dead animals?
Let me roast one of them.

456
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,927
Who is it?

457
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,360
Brother!

458
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,757
We are here.

459
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,330
We meet in such place.

460
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:15,523
It's hard to find the way
if we get lost.

461
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,397
Take a seat, brother.

462
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:17,799
You should be waiting for us
in the inn.

463
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:18,926
Fortunately we are here.

464
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,003
I guess
there has just been a heavy shower.

465
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,969
The birds
have been washed down by the rain.

466
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:22,970
Big brother.

467
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,801
Close you eyes!
We have no clothes on.

468
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,336
No big deal!

469
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:27,935
I've seen nude bodies before.

470
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:32,073
Oh... your ass is no big deal!

471
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,279
Your ass is exposed
to the public now.

472
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:35,852
You bastard!

473
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:37,819
You are no woman, you are no man.

474
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,184
Are you a man or a woman?

475
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,586
Be asexual.

476
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,557
Why are you coming here?

477
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:47,693
Kiddo said
you'd save that Highlander.

478
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,697
She's always on your mind!

479
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:51,833
Since we're from the same school,
we are together.

480
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,268
But are we going into seclusion?

481
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,499
Then we don't have to fight
and kill all the time.

482
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,040
We may use violence to save people.

483
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,609
We can save people without violence.

484
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:00,904
How can we do that without violence?

485
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,479
If we are attacked, should we leave?

486
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:03,809
You'd counter attack if you can't go.

487
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,143
This is violence!

488
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:08,710
OK... You are forced to use violence.

489
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,013
Let's save Chief Ying.

490
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:11,054
But swear now,

491
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,986
this is your last mission.

492
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:13,020
Or, let's go back.

493
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,148
I swear!

494
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,453
No regrets!

495
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:17,560
Cross your heart and hope to die.

496
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:18,889
It's chilli pepper.

497
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,699
- It's hot!
- Let's see her make up.

498
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:41,116
I haven't eaten the food of my home
for long. I missed it.

499
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,687
We can't be defeated
by Chimp's troop.

500
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,099
Your general Kai was military genius.

501
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,101
But he wasn't appreciated
by that stupid emperor.

502
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:02,739
Instead, he was downgraded
and died of sickness.

503
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,500
There is no capable men
in the regime.

504
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,109
It's too stupid to
send small potatoes like you...

505
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:07,539
To fight against me!

506
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,773
I think, the reign of
the Mainlanders is over.

507
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,377
What a big mouth, bastard!

508
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:17,579
How dare you criticize
the government before his Honour?

509
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:22,652
How dare you call bastards?

510
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:27,521
Look up, bastards!
Can you see our flag?

511
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,165
It'll soon be hoisted in the capital.

512
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,191
You want to start a riot?

513
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,303
Yes, we do!

514
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,906
The six tribes of the Highlanders.

515
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:40,444
The Mainlanders
always bully us Highlanders.

516
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:44,105
Every regime
is result of a civil war.

517
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,179
Don't think that...

518
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,308
you befriend those Japanese Gypsies,

519
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,511
and you can rebel!

520
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:53,156
We've an agreement
with the Japanese General.

521
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:55,385
To suppress you.

522
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:57,323
The Japanese General?

523
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,722
He is busy fighting the Koreans.

524
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,766
He can't come on time to save you.

525
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:06,227
When he comes,
we'll be the new power.

526
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:09,306
Dawn is waiting for him all the time.

527
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,133
Shoot!

528
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:20,080
Help,
I don't want to be a Mainlander.

529
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,576
Even worse than a Highlander's dog.

530
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:24,052
You are still tough!

531
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,383
Say it follow me.
Long live the Highlanders.

532
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,355
Ridiculous.

533
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,382
Ridiculous?

534
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:34,821
It's useless!

535
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,026
Never mind! We have ample artillery.

536
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:48,679
- Fight for the right.
- Chief.

537
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:52,916
Sun Moon Sect.
Long live the Sun Moon Sect!

538
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,820
We are appointed by God!
Give us power.

539
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:59,550
Dawn from the East.
I'm the invincible.

540
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,615
- Master Hattori.
- Yes.

541
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:11,901
Eunuch Hong.

542
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,172
Gold?

543
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,370
Let's make it straight.

544
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,811
I would kill myself if you cheat me.

545
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:28,385
Hong's box was full of gold.

546
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:31,145
But he put his own head in it too.

547
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:34,649
Take half, come on.

548
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:38,325
Another half, take it to your Master.

549
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,823
Try to explain to the Central Court.

550
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,992
To take hold of arms.

551
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,701
Actually,

552
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:48,338
we've bribed most of your officials.

553
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,297
They help you secretly.

554
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:52,306
Go back and wait for my order.

555
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:53,872
If you don't.

556
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,139
Beware of the members
of the Sun Moon Sect.

557
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,715
Be prepared to be ambushed.

558
00:37:59,218 --> 00:38:00,617
You don't have much choice.

559
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,753
You can kill yourself if you wish.

560
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:16,693
In fact you are going to a dead end.

561
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:18,893
Someone dares his guts.

562
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:26,142
Right on.

563
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,414
Your pulses are under my control.

564
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:37,747
One move and you'll be crippled.

565
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,787
Chimp, we've an agreement!

566
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,958
You'll help me to power.

567
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:43,856
And I'll help you
against Japanese General.

568
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:45,724
So that you can go back to Japan
to restore your reign.

569
00:38:45,964 --> 00:38:48,159
I think you've been loyal.

570
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,631
Actually, this is a set up!

571
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,367
I know that you've got a book.

572
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,869
Called the Sacred Volume.

573
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,602
I want to learn about...

574
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,301
its secret.

575
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:05,816
Well, don't regret.

576
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:07,114
I won't.

577
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:25,531
Head Chief! Don't lose your temper.

578
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:31,068
No one knows
you have the Sacred Volume.

579
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:50,089
Who are you?

580
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,121
Who are you?

581
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:55,765
I come from the capital City.

582
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,529
Me too.

583
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:59,398
Really?

584
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,430
So we came from the same place.

585
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:18,553
What did he say.

586
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,884
Go and ask him.

587
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,286
Have you found Ying?

588
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,057
I can't understand them.
How can I find out more?

589
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:33,903
Watch out!

590
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,936
What have your discovered?

591
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,473
That's we've been discovered.

592
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,744
- What'll we do then?
- Let's go.

593
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,173
Where are my friends?

594
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,250
Anybody from the capital city?

595
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:52,649
Brother, he is tailing us.
What'll we do?

596
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:56,893
Take him somewhere and punish him of.

597
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:58,459
That fast?

598
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:00,358
Stop talking, let's go

599
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,374
The Japanese is gone.

600
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:17,309
Are we walking too fast?

601
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:18,677
Should I go back for him?

602
00:41:18,784 --> 00:41:19,682
Ok, you go.

603
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,918
Go! Hurry up.

604
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:25,085
Wait for me! Wait!

605
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:32,362
Where are you from?

606
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,598
What next?

607
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:37,426
I came from the capital city.

608
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,333
Me too.

609
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,198
We came from the same place,
go ahead.

610
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,168
We came from the same place.

611
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:51,941
The sword position!

612
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,083
Sword of the Mainlanders.

613
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:06,994
"Rotation of the Stars".

614
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,562
Fantasy Land! Super Sword!

615
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:23,277
Sword energy!

616
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:24,574
Separating Sword.

617
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:29,445
Wonderful!

618
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,363
Dragon in the sky?

619
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:54,068
- What's it?
- Swaying sword.

620
00:42:58,483 --> 00:42:59,575
Breaking sword.

621
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:02,046
Attacking sword!

622
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,652
Stop...

623
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:14,831
We're both using
the weapons of the Mainlanders.

624
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,490
You aren't Japanese Samarai.

625
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,966
Was that
the swordplay of Wah Mountain?

626
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:22,696
Don't tell him.

627
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:23,863
He is so evil looking.

628
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:26,567
Let's confuse him.

629
00:43:30,048 --> 00:43:32,744
"The seas laugh."

630
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,919
"Lashing on both shores."

631
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,145
Why you know this song?

632
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:40,254
I'm from the Sun Moon Sect.

633
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:43,121
Are you?

634
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,252
Have you come for Ying?

635
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,129
She hasn't left the Highland,
follow me.

636
00:43:51,203 --> 00:43:53,194
- Big brother, beware of lies.
- Let's play it by ear.

637
00:43:57,643 --> 00:43:58,735
We've found it.

638
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:03,370
Ling?

639
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:07,946
- Ling?
- Blue Phoenix?

640
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,787
You are heavy.

641
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:14,083
Go and see the Chief now.

642
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,782
If you go yourself, she'd be happy.

643
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:22,193
Ying.

644
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:24,799
Ling?

645
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:27,801
I...

646
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,496
Ying, we haven't seen each other
for a year.

647
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,231
We miss you.

648
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,310
You look thin!

649
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:36,811
Kiddo
why are you so enthusiastic today?

650
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:39,006
It's the custom
of the Highlanders to embrace.

651
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:41,113
- Me!
- I am not her.

652
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:42,513
Just the same.

653
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:44,384
No.

654
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,193
what happen between Sun Moon Sect.
and the Ninjas?

655
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:55,423
Why are you risk staying
in the Ninjas place?

656
00:44:57,169 --> 00:44:59,069
After my dad disappeared.

657
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:02,963
My uncle,
Dawn usurped to be the Head Chief.

658
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:06,342
Dawn is backed up by the Ninjas.
They robbed the artillery.

659
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,638
We're wanted by the government.

660
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:11,848
If my dad is caught by Dawn.

661
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,575
I think he'd be kept
with the gypsies.

662
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:16,650
The soldiers
discovered us in the lnn.

663
00:45:16,822 --> 00:45:19,017
The mistook that
we were from the Sun Moon Sect.

664
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:24,558
If Dawn planned to seize power.

665
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:27,993
I'm afraid that
your father's life is in danger.

666
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:31,434
Not now.
My dad has lots of faithful fellows.

667
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,164
He'd control the fellows
with dad's life.

668
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:36,067
And kill them next.

669
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:38,606
Many members have disappeared
and committed suicide.

670
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,473
We'd have to find the Head Chief
as soon as possible.

671
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:45,206
Or else after Dawn killed
all the opponents.

672
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,347
He'll kill the Head Chief.

673
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:50,151
Another story of power struggle.

674
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:51,987
Listen.

675
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,747
Someone is coming. Sing...

676
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,132
In order to find Chief...

677
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:12,766
I disfigured my face
and joined the gypsies for months.

678
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,713
I've checked so many places.

679
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:20,110
But I could find no clue.

680
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:21,977
Maybe he is not there.

681
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,718
But I've found a well guarded place.

682
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,380
I can't get in.

683
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:31,892
He is hinting to seek your help.
Don't promise him anything.

684
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,089
Big mouth.

685
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:35,789
We can't help.

686
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:37,228
We'd better leave.

687
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,825
We once made our oath.

688
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,629
This is our last mission.

689
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:41,898
We're still in.

690
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,735
We'd retreat when in Ox Mountain.

691
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,104
Should we stay away from this?

692
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,442
No outsider
can interfere with our Sect.

693
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:52,713
One year ago,
you planned to meet again in our lnn.

694
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:54,283
Now that you have.

695
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,715
You can leave happily now.

696
00:46:57,355 --> 00:46:58,845
No need to feel sorry for me.

697
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:00,246
Go.

698
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,256
Blue Phoenix. Get her back.

699
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:09,096
Brother, stay clam

700
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:10,132
Leave here first.

701
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:12,463
I'll go with Zen to look for Wu.

702
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,502
We can be easily discovered.

703
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,471
Big brother, you'll break your oath.

704
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:18,906
We swore, didn't we?

705
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:21,135
You did! I didn't!

706
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,375
- You fooled us!
- Brother.

707
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:24,876
I just go for investigation.

708
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,380
I must go to Ox Mountain tomorrow.

709
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:28,485
If I lie, I'll be punished.

710
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:31,153
Zen, let's go.

711
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,114
Sure you'll.

712
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:43,257
Dawn's men recognize you.

713
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:46,802
Zen and I will find out more.
We can disguise ourselves easier.

714
00:47:48,673 --> 00:47:50,368
Ling!

715
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:56,475
You leave it in the inn

716
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:00,276
I'd wait for you to play it for me.

717
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:03,016
I've been waiting.

718
00:48:13,531 --> 00:48:14,930
One can't prevent...

719
00:48:39,424 --> 00:48:40,618
Great!

720
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:49,559
Head Chief.
After practicing the Sacred Volume.

721
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:50,998
Although you are a man.

722
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:54,194
Your skin is getting smooth and soft.

723
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,508
Why do you look at me so fiercely?

724
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:01,635
Don't mention
my metamorphosis anymore.

725
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:07,283
Highlanders are looked down
by the Mainlanders.

726
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:10,084
What we have done...

727
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:14,655
Is for the good of our Highlanders.

728
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,556
Forgive me, I'm short-sighted.

729
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:20,892
You haven't slept with me
for 6 months.

730
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:23,364
I think that you dislike me.

731
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:26,726
I think you've forgotten me Cici.

732
00:49:28,106 --> 00:49:31,098
I worked very hard for our kingdom.

733
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:34,110
But how many people
will remember Dawn?

734
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:37,976
Who is heartless?
Everyone is heartless!

735
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:41,012
Why we'd keep on doing
for these heartless people?

736
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:44,647
The world is so beautiful,

737
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,621
many heroes are willing to sacrifice.

738
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:52,528
Do you think your Head Chief, Wu,

739
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:54,289
is locked inside or not?

740
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:58,902
The one inside may be Dawn.

741
00:49:59,004 --> 00:50:00,596
Many guards around.

742
00:50:00,772 --> 00:50:03,070
We'd act separately.

743
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,038
Let's risk our lives.

744
00:50:05,276 --> 00:50:07,767
Sword, hammer, shield. Go ahead.

745
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:09,207
- Sword.
- Hammer.

746
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:10,946
Hammer wins.

747
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,482
- Shield.
- Hammer!

748
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:16,051
Shield wins. I'll go inside,
you'll guard outside.

749
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,178
Chinese are so cunning.

750
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:20,051
This is your choice.

751
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,588
Watch out!

752
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,396
A rare guest!
Retreat to the hiding place.
