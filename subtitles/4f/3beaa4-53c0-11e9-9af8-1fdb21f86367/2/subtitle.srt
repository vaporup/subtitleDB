1
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,522
Lady, it's you?

2
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,653
I'm Ling.

3
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,663
I'm the one who gave you your name.

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,198
Do you remember me?

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,168
Did I scare you?

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,339
Lots of thread.

7
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,804
It's getting longer and longer.
What do you get?

8
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,880
This dragon is nicely sewn.
The Dragon matches the Phoenix.

9
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,781
Go on,
see what else can be pulled out!

10
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,146
I've made a mistakes.
I'll help you.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,957
There are 2 dragons now.

12
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,657
Dragon against dragon,
here comes a jealous phoenix.

13
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,832
But I do want to look for you.

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,401
Now, I've found you.

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,433
Is this your room?

16
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,404
Are you married?

17
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,308
Someone's coming.

18
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,845
We'll take a revenge for Chimp.

19
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,353
Maybe Dawn's discovered me.

20
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,014
So he sends somebody for me.

21
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,182
Now you are in danger too.

22
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,294
It's hard for me
to talk to you like this.

23
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,194
Why not take advantage of that.
Let me take you out.

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,139
Let's check in different direction.

25
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,591
Disguise yourself.

26
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,531
As they have not yet arrived.

27
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,667
Let's go with the hookers,
so they can't find us.

28
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,886
Just relax, I've looked around.

29
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,324
No one is coming, let's take a rest.

30
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,526
We can have a good look of this moon.

31
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,103
I'm bringing along with your bottle.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,204
Why don't you talk?

33
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,573
Are you Japanese?

34
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,615
Human's language has
too much meaning.

35
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,911
Someone likes flattering!

36
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,850
This is what trouble come from.

37
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,213
The men!

38
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,586
How you know what I'm talking?

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,007
We are grown in the troubled world.

40
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,513
When we join in the troubled world,
we grow older and older.

41
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,076
People love to seize their power.

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,852
But I prefer drinking!

43
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,805
I don't think you'd understand it,
now or in future.

44
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,841
So we'll never have hatred.

45
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,412
lf everybody is like us.

46
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,481
We don't have to leave for peace.

47
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,898
I'll fix it.

48
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,765
Chief, what's the matter?

49
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,766
I came from the capital city.

50
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,710
What are you trying to do?

51
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,383
There's a cliff over there.

52
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,602
Miss.

53
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,332
Where are we?

54
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,588
Fortunately,
it is not made with fine steel.

55
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,255
Oh no.

56
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,029
Time to eat.

57
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,676
Is that you?

58
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,013
Don't talk
or there won't be a meal for you.

59
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,557
Sun Moon Sect conquers the world.

60
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,789
Long live the Sect.

61
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,937
Long live the Sect.

62
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,780
l have my plans.

63
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:30,214
He came here to look for one person.

64
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,817
For her?

65
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,856
For her!

66
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,366
For me?

67
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,280
Not moving.

68
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,212
Here's some meat.

69
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,941
Wu!

70
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,385
Master Wu!

71
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,048
I've found you finally!

72
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,299
God blessed!

73
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,680
God really helps!

74
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,097
How dare you fool me! Go to hell!

75
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,030
You don't dare to kill me.

76
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,405
Make fun on me? Go to hell.

77
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,540
Wu?

78
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,494
Master Wu!

79
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,002
So terrible!

80
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,508
You are Master Wu?

81
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,143
Don't be scared!

82
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,871
Dawn locked my bone...

83
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,813
to forbid me using martial arts.

84
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,346
He only gives me water.

85
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,149
He just tortures me!

86
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,757
Stop! Let's go out and continue.

87
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,233
Wu!

88
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,844
You know him? That's great!

89
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,743
Kneel down! Betrayer.

90
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,679
Don't be scared!

91
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,648
He can do nothing to us.

92
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,649
Cause Damn locked his martial arts!

93
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,549
Take him to get our reward!

94
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,995
Lock him up!

95
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,692
Master Wu!

96
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,335
Ling, I'll kill Wu, if you come near.

97
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,607
Essence Absorbing stance?

98
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,319
We're forced by Dawn.

99
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,318
Please forgive us.

100
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,650
They are forced.

101
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,190
You can't call me Chief.

102
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,555
Just let them go!

103
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,001
I'm back!

104
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,137
- Brother.
- Ling?

105
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,447
Father.

106
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,408
Welcome back.

107
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,387
Father.

108
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:07,254
Long live to Chief!

109
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,365
Zen.

110
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,404
Tell all my fellows now,

111
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,268
I'm back.

112
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,808
Tell them the truth
and arrest the betrayers.

113
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:25,875
Chief!

114
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,411
I'm afraid it'd be useless.

115
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,037
What's justice then?

116
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,046
Justice depends on power!

117
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,084
Someone believes that,

118
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,190
like Cloud,
he didn't come for 10 days.

119
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,587
His legs were broken by Dawn,

120
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,161
and was thrown to Regret Cliff
to guard the graves.

121
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,198
Bao objected
the cooperation with Japanese,

122
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,597
he was forced to admit guilty
and was poisoned.

123
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,261
Tung disappeared over 20 days.

124
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:59,002
I think the copse towed
by the wolf was him.

125
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:03,638
Chiu was executed.

126
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,775
His crimes were written on tombstone
to be scolded by the fellows.

127
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:12,149
And Young, your loyal fellow...

128
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,717
Young?

129
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,521
What did they do to him?

130
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,861
He was the first one to follow Dawn.

131
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,662
He is in-charge
of the execution dept now.

132
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,169
He keeps on investing us.

133
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,140
The fellows are all scared.

134
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,203
These 2 hooks,

135
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,838
are designed by him...

136
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,644
to lock you up.

137
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,424
Chief, The Martial Arts of Dawn
improved a lot.

138
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,658
Compare with us, I think...

139
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,266
Stop!

140
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,794
Are you scared?

141
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,961
Chief. In order to find you.

142
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,868
Zen ruined his face and voice
to get into the gypsies camp.

143
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,943
Tried so hard to contact with Ying.

144
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,979
He just wanted to save you.

145
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,750
Wu is always a hero.

146
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,554
I'd never say surrender.

147
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:22,150
Dawn, l'd kill you one day.

148
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,957
l'll cut your body into pieces.

149
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,329
I won't let you die so easy.

150
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,397
I want you to become a cripple!

151
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,962
Ling!

152
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,268
What's the matter?

153
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,004
It's our holy job
to kill the bad eggs.

154
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:44,340
We'd co-operate together.

155
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,281
To kill the bastard!

156
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,947
If you promise me...

157
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,080
I can share reign with you.

158
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,757
Wu, I'll go to Ox Mountain.

159
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,329
With my brothers.

160
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,527
I think, I can't help you.

161
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,596
No justice at all!

162
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,678
But our blood lost would be revenged.

163
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,039
Dad!

164
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,912
l'd return these hooks to Dawn,
I swear!

165
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,792
- Someone's coming.
- Watch out.

166
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,471
Dig... I want your eyeballs!

167
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,900
Your heart, your lung.

168
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,671
I've got it.

169
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,808
Who's it?

170
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,172
Come here.

171
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,060
Sacred Volume!

172
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,423
Give it to me.

173
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,999
I'm in your side, Wu.

174
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,597
Same side? I was betrayed
by the one in my side.

175
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,504
Ling, you deserve it.

176
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,838
lt's you who make such trouble.

177
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,242
We break even.

178
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,744
I'm not the one who is going to lose.

179
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,911
We'll leave tomorrow.

180
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,846
I'm not involved
in any of your business.

181
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,715
I won't disclose your secret.

182
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,014
I swear.

183
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,520
Brother, what's the matter?

184
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,727
Dad!

185
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,901
Ling, come to me in midnight.

186
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,004
To ask Ying to marry him.

187
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,798
He decided to stay,

188
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,841
so he is on our side.

189
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,237
Kiddo, something's wrong.

190
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,510
You must be kidding!

191
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,376
Ying, won't go with me.

192
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,574
I won't get involved
into world business for Ying.

193
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,519
I won't tell this joke to anyone.

194
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,347
So you can relax.

195
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,413
Luckily, it's a joke.

196
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,690
You know we will
get out of the world business.

197
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,729
Martial art is meaningless to me.

198
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,696
If you don't trust me.
Destroy my martial arts.

199
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,890
Destroy your martial arts?

200
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,501
Wu, you heartless guy.

201
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,395
Don't get close to me!
He knows Essence of Absorb Stance.

202
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,468
Well! I'll destroy your martial arts.

203
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,740
Dad, don't think that
I'm fallen in love with Ling.

204
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,877
I use him to work for us only.

205
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,416
I'm the Chief.

206
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,213
lfl marry the stranger,
l'll suicide before you.

207
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,190
Brother!

208
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,664
Don't be scared, the joke is over.

209
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,506
Kiddo, since we can't sleep.

210
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,040
Pack up and sing.

211
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,406
We'll leave at dawn.

212
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,912
I've got it.

213
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,779
It's difficult to walk at night.

214
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,345
Ling, you'd go first.

215
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:14,188
I can't see you. I cannot your heart.

216
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,352
l'll accompany Wah's students
to go at dawn.

217
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,626
- What happened just...
- I know it!

218
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,599
l offended the Mainlanders.

219
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,562
Thank you for saving my dad.

220
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:30,973
I won't see you off.

221
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,473
I understand.

222
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,540
Take care.

223
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,909
Chief...

224
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,219
Why don't you ask him
where he is going?

225
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,551
He won't come back.

226
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,818
If you don't, I'll go and chase him.

227
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,653
So you won't be regret!

228
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,641
Wine! l've forgot to bring it along.

229
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,313
There'd be mine!

230
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,587
I've got it!
I'll go and search for good wine.

231
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,792
It's over!

232
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,851
Chief,
l'm instructed to draw the map.

233
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,618
To celebrate your attack
in 3 days later.

234
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,251
Wish you'd become our new emperor.

235
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,429
Your look?

236
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,463
Don't be scared!

237
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,801
Your voice changed!

238
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,238
Isn't it because of Sacred Volume?

239
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,076
No matter what I'd be changed to,

240
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,941
I won't forget you.

241
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,247
What a beautiful world.

242
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,256
Making heroes compete for the world.

243
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,360
You'd understand now.

244
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,730
Why I don't sleep with you.

245
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,076
Give me the Sacred Volume.

246
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,042
lwill burn it.

247
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,926
Take it to me.

248
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,169
I'll give you my treasure,
the Sacred Volume.

249
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,200
You want to burn it?

250
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,073
Murderer.

251
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,407
Volume!

252
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,015
You are just the same
as the common people.

253
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,224
You're heartless.

254
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,724
Chief, I'm wrong.

255
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,562
- I'll follow you forever.
- You won't.

256
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,498
Go now!

257
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,464
l'm puzzled now.

258
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,096
I prefer dying
to be abandoned by you.

259
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,134
Who is it?

260
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,549
Ling!

261
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,276
You can speak our language!

262
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,424
I'm bored
so I want to drink with you.

263
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,051
But I can't guess you're...

264
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,620
What a coincidence.

265
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,493
I'm bored
because of the unpredictable world.

266
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,032
Since it's unpredictable, let's stop.

267
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,763
Will leave here tomorrow.

268
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,902
Leave the business to somebody else.

269
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,403
You are willing to die for me?

270
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,845
No!
I want you to stay with Ling for me.

271
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,179
Life is like morning dew, it's hard
for me to find a true friend.

272
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,653
Come on.

273
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,123
Don't let him discover
that your take.

274
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,891
Remember me always.

275
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,100
lam coming.

276
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,160
Where are you?

277
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,033
I am here.

278
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,209
- Wine, please.
- Ling!

279
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,209
I didn't know your name.

280
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,405
Cici.

281
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,283
Cici?

282
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,683
You've crying.

283
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,415
Life is so short
and so hard to predict.

284
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,454
We're in the same boat.

285
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,220
All I want is only one night,
please stop asking.

286
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,994
Long live...

287
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,465
I'm so glad that the outsiders
and fellows are all loyal to me now.

288
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,762
Chief, your voice differs...

289
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,804
I've been successful
in practicing the supernatural power.

290
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,303
Our invasion to the North.

291
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,708
And our kingdom will come true soon.

292
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,382
Invincible Dawn?

293
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,680
Wu, that old fox is useless now.

294
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,685
He'll ruin my plan only.

295
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,120
I've to kill him
and his followers all.

296
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,749
Yes, sir.

297
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,261
Stab the needle into the artery.
Close his sinus.

298
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:08,638
"The seas laugh,
lashing on both shores."

299
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,480
"Carried in the waves,
we have only the here and now."

300
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,222
"The heaven laugh at
the troubled world."

301
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:26,523
"Only they know,
who is to win and lose."

302
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:32,593
"The mountains laugh,
the rain is affair."

303
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:38,938
"When the waves grew old,
the world still goes on."

304
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:44,806
"The clean winds laugh,
such a feeling of solitude."

305
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:50,783
"My sentiments remain
laughing still."

306
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:55,626
"The earth laughs, solitude no more."

307
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,695
Those swordsmen treasure
their swords more than their lives.

308
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,231
Why don't you treasure your swords?

309
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,092
We'll retreat tomorrow.

310
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,862
So there is no use for us to have it.

311
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,500
Why don't you take the garlic
and season the food?

312
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,905
Don't be that anxious!

313
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,521
Drink less!

314
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,461
Don't miss our trip tomorrow.

315
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,660
Anything else you don't think
its convenient to say?

316
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,432
No.

317
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,268
I just want to sing "Hero of Heroes"
with you till dawn.

318
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,335
Let's continue.

319
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:28,211
"The seas laugh,
lashing on both shores."

320
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,518
"Carried in the waves,
me have only the here and now."

321
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,750
May I ask, who is the hero of heroes?

322
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,036
Blue Phoenix!

323
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,944
Blue Phoenix,
aren't you chasing Ling?

324
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,016
Go!

325
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,094
It's the wind

326
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,501
Dad!

327
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,272
- I smell blood!
- Blood?

328
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:43,516
There is trouble with Blue Phoenix.

329
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,862
"The Slaying Sword".

330
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,970
"The Whirlwind Blow".

331
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,050
"The Flying Bomb".

332
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,223
Don't you want to escape?

333
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,002
- Go out and have a look.
- Where is Kiddo?

334
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,577
- He is outside.
- Where is my sword?

335
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,940
The sword's so hot.

336
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,228
I know you are here, Dawn.

337
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,328
Wu, we haven't seen for half years.

338
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,396
You must be upset for
being defeating by my trap.

339
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,898
When you discovered
I'd got the Sacred Volume.

340
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,565
You afraid that I'd be successful
in practicing supernatural power.

341
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,142
So you must kill me.

342
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,878
Therefore, I'd take this risk.

343
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,641
To take action before you,
seize your position.

344
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:16,216
And establish
my own kingdom of Highlanders.

345
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,787
I'd be a historical hero,

346
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,948
I'd thank you Wu.

347
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,993
Your voice told me you were not Dawn.

348
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,459
Who are you?

349
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,630
Supernatural power
from Sacred Volume.

350
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,612
Hot sword!

351
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,186
Your sword is stabbed into the hen.

352
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,653
It's edible now.

353
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,652
You've mistaken my sword.

354
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,191
- You said you don't want it anymore.
- Take it here.

355
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,262
How can you be so scared
when facing the enemies!

356
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,691
All rubbish!

357
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,634
Chief, come! We have company.

358
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,667
Blue Phoenix.

359
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,664
She is seriously hurt!
Take her in quickly!

360
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,306
Chief!

361
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:25,315
Chief!

362
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,785
Cici...

363
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,384
Ling?

364
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,598
Long live to Japan.

365
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,528
"The Flying Bomb".

366
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,868
"The Whirlwind Blow."

367
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,266
"Essence Absorbing stance!"

368
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,412
Zen.

369
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,482
Blue Phoenix is seriously hurt!

370
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,313
- Master Wu.
- Luke, don't go there.

371
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,052
Japanese Gypsies,
it's a mistake to follow Dawn.

372
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,157
You are defeated by the Chief.

373
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,317
You are not qualified
to challenge him.

374
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,894
Chief, I think Dawn has come.

375
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,291
He maybe nearby.

376
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,257
We can drag the Wah students down.

377
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,367
Don't stay with us, go quickly!

378
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,335
Let's go together.

379
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,730
Our feud is too deep.

380
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,498
We can't leave like you do.

381
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,902
Blue Phoenix is seriously injured.

382
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,804
Please take her away with you.

383
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,903
You had better go now,
find some herbs to cure her.

384
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,481
Or, it'd be too late.

385
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,708
Blue Phoenix, if you come back
and see our corpses.

386
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,648
You'd take a revenge for us.

387
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,414
Go! Hurry up!

388
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,490
Well, let's depend a fate.

389
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,524
Let's go!

390
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,656
Take care.

391
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,464
"The Slaying Sword".

392
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,272
Essence Absorbing stance!

393
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,956
"The Flying Bomb".

394
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,626
"Powerful Hand stance".

395
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,600
"Division"

396
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,040
"Essence Absorbing Stance".

397
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,677
Timber.

398
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,677
Tell us, where is Dawn?

399
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,250
I won't tell a word!

400
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,456
Dawn, come out!

401
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,398
Kill! I want to kill...

402
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,091
Dad! Stop! you've not yet recovered.

403
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,696
Chief! There's a long way ahead,
why not revenge later?

404
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,932
For Sun Moon Sect,
just swallow your pride now.

405
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,337
I beg you!

406
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,308
I've enough!

407
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,143
Hurry up!

408
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:17,085
Wu, I'm coming.

409
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,027
Did she hurt you?

410
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,295
I'll take a revenge for you.

411
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,232
Take Blue Phoenix away,
don't let brother come back.

412
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,597
Go! Kiddo!

413
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,602
Are you retreated?

414
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,477
Isn't it Invincible Dawn?

415
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,014
Dawn should be a man.

416
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,862
Scum bag.

417
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,978
You are trapped! Wu has gone.

418
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,250
Brother.

419
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,897
There is fire over the Inn.

420
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,164
Shit! Would Wu do anything
to our brothers?

421
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,163
I got to go back and check that out.

422
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,902
Cici, I'll come back for you at dawn.

423
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,612
I want to go with brother.

424
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,042
I don't go to Ox Mountain.

425
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,207
If you see Ling,
tell him not to wait for me.

426
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,124
I've broken through my sinus.

427
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,290
The poisoned blood is
running through my whole body.

428
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,400
I can't be cured.

429
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,333
I want to die together with Dawn.

430
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,001
Blue Phoenix...

431
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,474
Should we stop singing
"Hero of Heroes".

432
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,976
Blue Phoenix! We'd be hurry.

433
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,673
I'll find a doctor to cure you.

434
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,183
I'll take you to Ox Mountain.

435
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,453
Let's retreat.

436
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:41,460
Chief, I haven't left you.

437
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,333
I'm happy.
I've waited for your return.

438
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,418
Sing, let's sing!

439
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,227
"The seas laugh..."

440
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,515
Brother.

441
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,624
You are already secluded.

442
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,716
Good bye.

443
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,956
Ling, you can't even
understand the world.

444
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,790
Your enemies
are afraid of your revenge.

445
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,458
Even you hide yourself,
they won't let you go.

446
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,501
Dawn!

447
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:06,505
30 thousand of Dawn's fellows
has been sent to Blackwood Cliff.

448
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,167
They are waiting for
further instruction.

449
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,040
He wants to be emperor.

450
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,841
We'll go to Blackwood Cliff
may be we won't be back.

451
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,985
Dawn has the power
from Sacred Volume.

452
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,922
How deep is his Martial Arts?

453
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,616
You should understand other.

454
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,159
Ling, do you want to
look at the Sacred Volume?

455
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,989
What is it?

456
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,829
Would you let me have a look?

457
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,700
Take it.

458
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,893
We are in the same boat now.

459
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,936
Great!

460
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,342
I've got this Sacred Volume...

461
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,239
together with Dawn.

462
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,311
I knew he was aggressive.

463
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,946
He wanted to own it.

464
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,344
I copied one set.

465
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,647
"To practice the supernatural power,
one'd cut his penis off."

466
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,019
Cut his penis off...

467
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,225
Wu!

468
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:05,925
Dawn is so smart and clever.

469
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,829
He torture me.

470
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,438
But at last, he won't let himself go!

471
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,808
To practice the supernatural power,
he's willing to cut his penis.

472
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,944
He isn't a man now!

473
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,810
For this Sacred Volume.
Our Master betrayed us.

474
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,648
Thus we decided to leave for peace.

475
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,562
Leave for peace?

476
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,301
Ling!

477
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,573
If your next generation can't stand
the Martial Arts temptation.

478
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,645
And leave you
to be the sword man again.

479
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,439
Can you stop them?

480
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:55,174
Next generation?
I've never dreamt of it.

481
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,221
Swordsman! Once there is people,
once there is feud.

482
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,755
With feud,
there is another troubled world.

483
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,357
Eventually, man is troublesome.

484
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,018
How can you claim you want peace?

485
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:22,070
Sun Moon Sect conquers the world.

486
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,011
Long live the sect.

487
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,174
Long live the Sun Moon Sect.

488
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,946
Long live the Sect.

489
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,617
Blackwood Cliff.

490
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,316
The guards have been killed.

491
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,960
They'll soon be here.

492
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,397
They are just small potatoes.

493
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:43,965
They have arrived.

494
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,470
I'm going to destroy those betrayers!

495
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,436
Only those
who obey me can keep their lives!

496
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,113
Swaying sword!

497
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,721
Cool's sword!

498
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,492
Attacking sword!

499
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,435
Cici!

500
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,104
Ling!

501
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,842
Are you Dawn?

502
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,241
Sure.

503
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:32,378
Kidding!

504
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,505
Ying!

505
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,706
Why don't you greet your uncle?

506
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,785
No, you'd call her auntie.

507
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,223
The Mainlanders bully the Highlanders.

508
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,989
Now you bring Mainlanders
to Black Wood Cliff...

509
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,497
to interfere the internal business
of Sun Moon Sect.

510
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,794
How can you face your ancestors?

511
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,031
You allied with the Japanese Gypsies
to kill our fellows.

512
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,870
And you dare to
mention our ancestors!

513
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,275
If the Highlanders can
rule the Mainlanders.

514
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,473
Dawn will be famous forever.

515
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,845
Shut up.

516
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,786
But before the duel, I want to know.

517
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,392
Did you sleep with me that night?

518
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,886
Brother, you...

519
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:27,096
You slept together?

520
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,234
Smile!

521
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,115
We are grown in the troubled world.

522
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,481
But we are getting older and older.

523
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,386
The people want to compete for reign.

524
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,259
Why not drink instead of fight?

525
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,545
Sacred Volume is a big joke.

526
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,774
You are now famous.

527
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,747
What is the guy, man or woman?

528
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,477
How can you sleep with him?

529
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,149
Kiddo,
let's end up all the thing today.

530
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,082
You know it's our Sect's business.

531
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,090
Why you go against me with them?

532
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,996
I take the revenge for my brothers.

533
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,992
Take revenge?

534
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,564
I haven't killed
any of your brothers.

535
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,537
I saw you kill them.

536
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,196
Actually, the Wah students
are not linked with you.

537
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,966
They were killed of no reason.

538
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,909
You'd pay for your life.

539
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:44,975
Be careful!

540
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,550
Essence Absorbing Stance.

541
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,990
Your dog is killed by you.

542
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,389
Time to pay back.

543
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:12,764
Kiddo.

544
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,970
Chief!

545
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,386
Your honour.

546
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,814
Watch my hook!

547
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,294
Take it back.

548
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,009
I thought you learned
this because of the throne.

549
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,839
Indeed you do it because of a man!

550
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,812
You are jealous
because I can take both.

551
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,712
Do you think that
all people would listen to you?

552
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,584
It's a pity
that Ling's his Ying and Carol.

553
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,388
You'd be the third if he wants you.

554
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,306
Betrayer!

555
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,478
Father!

556
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,995
Ling, life is really unpredictable...

557
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,164
and so, we don't need to predict it.

558
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,173
Let's get out of here tomorrow.

559
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,389
Essence Absorbing Stance.

560
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,077
Father!

561
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:33,307
Danger.

562
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,481
Ling, I'm sincere,

563
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,653
so I'm not in full strength.

564
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,988
How dare you try your very best
to hurt me?

565
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,819
Answer your lover!

566
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,397
Stop attacking your allies.

567
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,497
Why didn't you attack
his weakest point?

568
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,294
You don't want to, do you?

569
00:47:56,139 --> 00:48:00,041
Don't talk about love between us.

570
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,437
We've hatred only.

571
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,839
Hatred?

572
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,646
For revenge, or for the girls?

573
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,443
You heartless guy!

574
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,350
I want you to see them die...

575
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,854
in front of you.

576
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,854
Supernatural power
from Sacred Volume.

577
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,930
The wall will fall soon.

578
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,137
Hurry up, to the roof!

579
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,804
It is not safe here!

580
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,250
Dawn!

581
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:48,222
The whirling sword!

582
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,315
Merciful hand!

583
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,857
Attacking sword!

584
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,226
The reverting sword!

585
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,801
Who can you save?

586
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,204
Combination on 4 stances.

587
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,748
Kiddo!

588
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,532
Why do you save me?

589
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,062
I want to ask you...

590
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,830
Did I stay with you that night?

591
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,007
I won't tell you,
I want you to remember me.

592
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,436
I want you to regret
for your whole life.

593
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,508
Cici!

594
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:47,941
- Cici!
- Ling...

595
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,587
Tell me, you are Cici.

596
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:34,122
Sun Moon Sect
will unite the whole world.

597
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,197
Long live...

598
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,923
Wu, our Chief!

599
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,763
Long live...

600
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,864
It's another Dawn.

601
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,939
- Hang Dawn up!
- Yes.

602
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,378
Please forgive us

603
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,411

Bring the betrayer of Dawn here.

607
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,116
- And kill!
- Yes!

608
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,415
Those betrays me should be killed!

609
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,134
- Zen!
- Chief Wu.

610
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,366
Anybody else in the list?

611
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,177
Fan, Ching, Lin,

612
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,406

616
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,061
Ling, go now!

617
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,091
What's the matter?

618
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,197
You are on the list.

619
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,799
Dad trusts no Mainlander.

620
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,365
Dad holds the power again.

621
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,904
He won't let you go.

622
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,076
I'll lead you to the exit.

623
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,410
Who else can be trust?

624
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,451
Ling, follow me, quick!

625
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:09,888
Run!

626
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,292
The boat is leaving.
Take the tea to the boat.

627
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,601
Ling, you can't go to Ox Mountain.

628
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,259
He won't let you go.

629
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,929
The gov't is going to arrest you.

630
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:29,239
You want to retreat.
The only way is to go to Japan.

631
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,710
What? Japan?

632
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,281
What are you going to do?

633
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,747
This is brought by you.

634
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,782
I cannot play your favorite song.

635
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,519
Take it back.

636
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,220
Ling!

637
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:47,623
Zen!

638
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,164
Ling, our Chief wants you back.

639
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,767
If not, leave me your head.

640
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,403
I'll do it!

641
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,774
- Ying!
- I'm fine.

642
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,178
Willow sword.

643
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,257
What do you mean?

644
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,528
Ifl lose, I won't blame anymore.

645
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,428
Come on!

646
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:27,968
I'll stop playing any competition.

647
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,010
Zen!

648
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,084
Ling, I can't arrest you.

649
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,648
I can't finish myjob,
I'd cut my arm.

650
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,313
But I envy you,
for you can leave here.

651
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,458
Go now! Someone's coming.

652
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,957
The ship is ready.

653
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,093
Go!

654
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,666
Ying, let's go together?

655
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,963
Your father won't let you go.

656
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,837
But I am his daughter,

657
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,569
I'd stay with Sun Moon Sect.

658
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,908
The ship'd leave, hands off.
