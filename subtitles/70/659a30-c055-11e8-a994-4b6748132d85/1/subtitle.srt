22
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,036
The US government needs your help.

23
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,509
You will undergo training
for one month.

24
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,068
Then you'll team up
with a special commando unit

25
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,196
to undertake a top-secret mission.

26
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,716
Until the mission is over,
you are still convicts.

27
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,792
But once the mission is accomplished,
you are free men.

28
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,839
You will be given US citizenship
and you will receive $200,000.

29
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,437
- Anyone here want to opt out?
- No.

30
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,072
Hey, do you think these are real
people or just dummies?

31
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,117
Why don't you find out?

32
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,674
They didn't move a muscle.
They must be real.

33
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,432
Hey, Grandpa...

34
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,114
how do you plan to spend
your $200 grand?

35
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,397
Half for my daughter,
and the other half for my girl.

36
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,913
Oh, so you're married?

37
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,991
A married man needs no girl, but only
a married man has a daughter.

38
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,757
That's too deep for me.
I don't get it.

39
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,718
Dai-Hoi, how do you plan to spend
the money then?

40
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,631
That's none of your business.

41
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,870
- Brother, don't be like that!
- Shut up!

42
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,393
Fine, I don't need to know.

43
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,948
Hey, how will you spend the money?

44
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,318
I... will... go...

45
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,118
OK, tell me next month.

46
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,668
Ming, I was thinking about
the past...

47
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,273
Don't think about the past.

48
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,036
Lieutenant, this is a cruel operation
for you and your men.

49
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,190
War is cruel.

50
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,311
The order from above is for you
to divert the enemy's attention,

51
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,914
so my commandos can accomplish
the mission.

52
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,230
Don't try to be a hero.

53
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,470
So you want me to do nothing?

54
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,595
I know you, Lieutenant,
but the Vietnam War is over.

55
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,673
We're risking our lives, thanks to
the mistake the Americans made then.

56
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,553
Lieutenant, I want you
to do a favour for me.

57
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,872
That's my brother, Yeung Lung.

58
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,793
The day we withdrew
from the ammunition dump,

59
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,156
he was wounded
and had to stay behind in Ngau.

60
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,630
Locate him if you can
and get him out of Vietnam.

61
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,995
I'll do what I can, Colonel.

62
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,997
Good luck.

63
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,029
- What's going on?
- Six of them. They are drinking.

64
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,238
The plane will arrive at any time.
Try to finish them off. And no guns.

65
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,557
Look at me! Up here! Look at me!

66
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,674
Let's go.

67
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,077
I can't take this!
Where the hell are we going?

68
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,310
Calm down, brother.
It doesn't matter.

69
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,029
We need to be prepared. If we're
going to Europe, I'll need a jacket -

70
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,031
If we're going to Africa, I'll strip!

71
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,156
In hell you just need a shroud.

72
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,232
Am I talking to you?
Do you want me to throw you out?

73
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,709
Don't be like that, brother.
Be quiet.

74
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,358
Ming, I'm really worried.
Do you think we will...

75
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,989
Don't think about it.
Anywhere is better than prison.

76
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,992
Being behind bars all that time
was enough.

77
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,277
You're lucky. At least you spent a
year in America before going to jail.

78
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,828
I was caught
after only three days on shore.

79
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,469
You got caught because you broke
the law. Ming's case was different.

80
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,199
- Like you were any better.
- Did I say anything?

81
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,032
In any case, once the job is done,

82
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,429
let's enjoy life
as law abiding citizens.

83
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,957
This plane has been heading east/
south-east at 420 miles per hour.

84
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,719
That means in three hours,
we will be flying over Vietnam.

85
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,758
Vietnam? Bullshit! Dumb ass!

86
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,037
What? Did you call my brother
a dumb ass? ls that what you said?

87
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,509
Brother, don't be like that!

88
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,113
He means Vietnam is a dumb ass.

89
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,636
That's right.
Can't he bad-mouth his own country?

90
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,110
Hey... just forget it.

91
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,998
You are a dumb ass! Of all the
countries you had to say Vietnam.

92
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,833
I just meant we'll be over Vietnam
in three hours.

93
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,394
Be seated.

94
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,276
No need to be nervous, relax.

95
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,590
We won't be there
for another three hours.

96
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,434
Listen up. To avoid being spotted by
the enemy, we can't fly any lower.

97
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,637
If you open your chutes too early,
you won't land in the right place.

98
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,190
Once you jump, you must count to 20
before you pull open your chutes.

99
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,635
We must pull the parachutes open
ourselves?

100
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,473
Lieutenant, we didn't learn this
in our training.

101
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,632
Don't embarrass yourself!
You just have to pull the rope.

102
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,076
- What if the chute doesn't open?
- Then you'll be the first to land.

103
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,310
If you do,
say hello to my late uncle.

104
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,960
Tell him I didn't burn any offerings
for him,

105
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,758
so he'll have to go on welfare.

106
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,829
Any more questions?

107
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,239
I have...

108
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,519
Have what?

109
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,673
I tried so hard to escape.
I never thought I'd be back.

110
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,474
Remember to count to 20
before pulling the rope.

111
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,075
- Count to 20.
- I... I...I... know...

112
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,155
Go!

113
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,515
Go!

114
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,119
Why did they all go into
the coconut plantation?

115
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,470
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.

116
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,593
We're Cambodian guerrillas.
We received orders to assist you.

117
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,671
- Where are my men?
- In the plantation.

118
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,912
Help me get them out.

119
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,717
Where is everybody?

120
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,518
Keep your voice down. Follow me.

121
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,671
Is everyone all right?
Are we all here?

122
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,273
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. All here.

123
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,713
Be serious, will you?

124
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,671
We're missing Stuttering Keung.

125
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,398
Split up and look for him.

126
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,759
Stuttering Keung!

127
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,555
Stuttering Keung!

128
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,154
Stuttering Keung!

129
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,835
Stuttering Keung!

130
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,870
Hey! He's here.

131
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,114
- Stuttering Keung!
- S-s-s-s... sixteen...

132
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,279
Stuttering Keung!

133
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,908
He's dead.

134
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,831
This mission was aborted
before I jumped.

135
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,717
I hope you'll still help me.

136
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,031
Looks like we don't have
much of a choice.

137
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,594
That's right.
Do you need to consult them?

138
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,752
No. They're already scared to death.

139
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,515
Consulting them
will only make matters worse.

140
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,194
I've already mapped out the route
you need to take.

141
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,349
Starting from here...

142
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,000
There's been a change of plan.
We need to go to Ngau.

143
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,311
Ngau village?
Those weren't our orders.

144
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,155
The orders were changed
at the last minute.

145
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,356
I can't stand the stench!

146
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,673
- Are you all right?
- Yes, please continue.

147
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,830
She's not your type. She's a girl.

148
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,913
You can't really call her a girl,
you can just about call her female.

149
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,275
Closing my eyes is not a problem,

150
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,557
but to hold my breath
for her... that's impossible!

151
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,959
I'm not going for her.

152
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,234
I need to go.

153
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,197
Hey, don't try the impossible.

154
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,350
I mean I need to go to the toilet!

155
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,870
There aren't many Vietcong in Ngau,
but there's an army camp nearby.

156
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,316
If alerted, the Vietcong
would be there in 20 minutes.

157
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,234
It would be easier if they'd ordered
the village blown up last week.

158
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,233
Vietcong!

159
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,948
What is it?

160
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,111
What's going on out there?

161
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,671
- What?
- Brother...

162
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,478
Don't question my intelligence.

163
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,192
Hey, an American cigarette packet.

164
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,955
That's strange.

165
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,233
Never mind.

166
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,674
Over there!

167
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,868
Fire!

168
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,916
- What's happening?
- Help, help.

169
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,953
No, please, no! I surrender! No!

170
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,716
Onion Head!

171
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,711
Onion Head...

172
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,030
Let's stop here.

173
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,633
Don't worry, Onion Head!
Everything will be all right.

174
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,877
It's just a flesh wound.
A bit of iodine and you'll be fine.

175
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,316
You won't die. Don't even think it,
because I won't let you.

176
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,515
Onion Head...

177
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,280
What's so bad
about spending your days in prison?

178
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,715
Why come here
and get yourself killed?

179
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,875
Brother...

180
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,873
Hell, brother, we're dying here
one by one, soon it will be our turn.

181
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,637
I quit, Lieutenant!
I'd rather go back to jail.

182
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,029
- Dai-Hoi!
- It's none of your business!

183
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,792
Brother, don't be like that!

184
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,509
Just leave like this?
What if he shoots us from behind?

185
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,717
If you want to leave,
I won't stop you.

186
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,994
Brother!

187
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,749
I'm just following the majority vote!

188
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,479
Think it over, brother.
This is Vietnam!

189
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,677
We don't even know our way!
What if the Vietcong find us?

190
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,151
If you're not careful, you could
fall into one of their traps.

191
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,037
Then you'll die horribly, right?

192
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,477
If we leave now the Vietnamese
will take all the credit.

193
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,790
That would disgrace the Chinese.

194
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,678
OK, I'll go back,
but only for that reason.

195
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,556
Changed his mind again? Wait for me!

196
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,358
That's it.

197
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,598
Three of us will go to the village.

198
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,592
No matter what happens,
don't risk your lives for us.

199
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,274
We'll meet on the hilltop
in two hours.

200
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,512
Be careful.

201
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,269
If something happens,
are we going down to help them?

202
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,389
All right, make way,
let me through, come on!

203
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,153
Make way, make way!
Roll up, come and get it.

204
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,518
I've got everything you need - all
the latest products from the West!

205
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,678
It's real. What's this for?

206
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,991
Uncle Kao from the next village
said if you can get a ship

207
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,358
and take his family to Hong Kong,
he'll give you a big case of gold.

208
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,953
But you must hurry.

209
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,473
Tell Kao to wait for me
at the Village Hall tomorrow.

210
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,788
OK.

211
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,075
- Here, this is for you.
- Thanks.

212
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,876
Look at the mess they've made.

213
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,192
Well, Buddy, did he hurt you?
I saved you this time.

214
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,156
How will you return the favour?

215
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,398
Ring a ring of roses,

216
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,632
a pocket full of posies...

217
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,188
Hey, stop acting like a loony,
will you?

218
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,589
Tell me where the treasure really is.

219
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,672
Once we get rich,
we'll fly out of here together!

220
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,712
Fly?

221
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,753
Fly, fly, I want to fly to the sky...

222
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,150
No problem! We can even go to
the moon! As long as we have money.

223
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,037
So tell me, where is it?

224
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,519
- It's...
- Tell me!

225
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,794
It's here.

226
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,118
What is it, pal?

227
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,679
- Drink this!
- What, is it my birthday?

228
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,513
No, not your birthday,
it's your ticket to hell.

229
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,718
Thanks to this fake wine of yours,
my men still have the runs!

230
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,835
You must be joking!

231
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,309
Drink it and you'll see
if I'm joking.

232
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,871
Drink! I'll count to three.
If you don't drink, I'll kill you!

233
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,075
I'll drink it. You just watch.

234
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,154
Just watch.

235
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,713
Brother!

236
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,156
You bastard! Think you can frame me
with your dirty tricks?!

237
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,118
Don't let me see you
until next month! Get lost!

238
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,078
Where's my God of Wealth?

239
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,633
Mr Yeung, don't be alarmed.
I was sent here by Colonel Yeung-Foo.

240
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,588
Yes, I recognise you all!
You're Fozzy Bear!

241
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,398
You're Kermit the Frog!

242
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,238
And you're Miss Piggy!

243
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,477
Come on,
let's play cops and robbers, OK?

244
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,313
You'll be the cop
and I'll be the robber. I'm off!

245
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,915
Yeung Lung, listen to me!
I'm really...

246
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,319
Someone's coming.

247
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,631
Are you taking a pee, sir?

248
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,280
What do you think -
I'm taking it out for fun?

249
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,558
Don't do it here, it's beneath you.
Go into the lunatic's house.

250
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,279
I need to borrow your toilet.

251
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,199
Sir.

252
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,273
There are Gi's here.

253
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,709
- Three American Gi's.
- Here?

254
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,234
In the wardrobe.

255
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,312
There's one in there.

256
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,231
The other two are over there.

257
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,791
Stop bullshitting me, you nut!

258
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,514
You don't believe me? I'll show you.

259
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,794
Sir, take a look!
They're really here!

260
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,878
They're here! They're really here!

261
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,349
Hey! Why don't you believe me?

262
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,711
Lieutenant, he's got a screw loose.

263
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,518
Take him away, then we'll talk.

264
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,877
Buddy! Buddy!

265
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,078
Don't do anything stupid. If you
fire, the Vietcong will hear you.

266
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,593
Let's talk this over.

267
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,274
Keep out of this
and we may spare your life.

268
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,112
We just want to take Yeung Lung.

269
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,953
Take Yeung Lung?
That's worse than killing me.

270
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,316
Besides, he's a nutcase.
He won't tell you anything.

271
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,870
- What do you think he'll tell us?
- Surely you know about the treas...

272
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,918
- Never mind.
- Put down your gun and come with us.

273
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,755
Otherwise, I'll have to kill you,
even if it means being discovered.

274
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,949
You win.

275
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,079
Let's go.

276
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,999
Hey, stop pointing that thing at me.

277
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,914
If it weren't for Buddy,
I'd have taken your knife long ago.

278
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,519
You see?

279
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,313
Move.

280
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,832
Chieh, why are you driving an ox-cart
and not your bike?

281
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,559
I'm going into town to get married.

282
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,437
This is my fiancée.

283
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,871
That's her father and her brother.

284
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,154
Hello.

285
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,599
Here! These are for you!

286
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,398
Thanks. On your way!

287
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,038
Thank you.

288
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,514
Help...!

289
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,678
Don't shoot! I surrender!
It's me, Rat Chieh!

290
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,799
Inside!

291
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,196
We'll be cut to ribbons this time.

292
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,989
It's not fair to let me die with you.
Let me surrender.

293
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,078
Well?

294
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,472
Don't shoot! I surrender!
It's me, Rat Chieh!

295
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,273
Those bastards!

296
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,830
Give me a gun! I'll shoot every last
one of them. Give it to me.

297
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,872
Why not?

298
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,035
Lieutenant, let me lure them away,
so you can get Yeung out.

299
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,951
And sacrifice yourself?

300
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,472
He's right, you don't
stand a chance by yourself!

301
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,233
You three go out that way
and I'll take Buddy away.

302
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,514
Shut up!

303
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,270
You're hurting my ears.
Bring the cannon.

304
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,639
Come on, hurry up!

305
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,109
Shit! How can so few of us
fight so many of them?

306
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,749
Lord, I want to have a long life.
I don't want to die!

307
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,389
Fire!

308
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,991
You sure have
a lot of reinforcements!

309
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,154
Shit! My motorbike!

310
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,395
Are you OK?

311
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,029
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come!

312
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,395
See? Now we get shit
for saving their asses.

313
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,550
Brother, don't be like that!

314
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,076
That's right! The troops are on
their way. Let's get out of here.

315
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,352
Right! Let's go!

316
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,718
Walk faster, you clumsy ass! Move!

317
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,950
- Brother, don't be like that!
- What?

318
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,952
If you're not going to help,
at least stop cursing him.

319
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,239
Put him down.

320
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,879
He's lost a lot of blood.

321
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,757
Get the bullet out now.

322
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,910
Hey! Don't you dare touch Buddy!

323
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,877
Buddy, are you all right?

324
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,712
Who the hell are you?

325
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,153
Who am l?

326
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,313
You're asking me who I am?

327
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,710
I helped you get this far,
I kept you away from the Vietcong,

328
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,870
and now you ask me who I am?

329
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,915
Come here.

330
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,153
Lieutenant.

331
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,149
Miss...

332
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,232
I don't know if it's your
personality, your looks,

333
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,914
or your figure,
you're simply amazing.

334
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,513
That's the truth.

335
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,915
I don't know if it's
your personality or your looks,

336
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,039
you're simply horrendous.
That's the truth.

337
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,312
Don't feel embarrassed.

338
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,234
I must try harder.

339
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,238
Are you kidding?
Each of us will get $200 grand US?

340
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,117
Tell me,
have I ever lied to you?

341
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,111
No, but I haven't known
you very long.

342
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,829
- Don't you trust me?
- Looks like I've no choice.

343
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,070
- But Buddy...
- Now he's everyone's buddy.

344
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,276
Just get us out of here quick.

345
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,955
You don't have to worry about that.
This is my turf. I...

346
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,479
- Hey! Our friends are approaching.
- I need knives!

347
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,309
Protect him.

348
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,913
Let's hide.

349
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,397
I don't need it. See you later.

350
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,273
You, that way.
The rest follow me.

351
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,157
Spread out!

352
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,319
It's me.

353
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,351
Brother, stop spying.

354
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,590
This is not spying, it's observing.

355
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,195
Whether it's spying or observing,
it's still not right.

356
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,590
When was I ever right in your eyes?

357
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,831
No matter what I say or do,
you always find something wrong.

358
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,478
Can't you just get off my case?

359
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,074
Brother, not so loud.

360
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,914
I have to be loud.
How else will you get the message!

361
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,913
Nag, nag, nag! You've been nagging me
since you were born!

362
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,072
Good! Big dog bites small dog,
small dog runs away.

363
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,038
One more word
and you'll be singing in the rain!

364
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,712
My fault I offended the dog.

365
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,994
Still trying it on?

366
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,071
Forget it, brother. Stop fighting.

367
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,038
- Keep observing.
- It's not observing, it's spying.

368
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,749
Hey, old dog, stop moving.
You're making the ground wet.

369
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,273
You go rest, I'll take over.

370
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,112
That's OK, big sister.

371
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,670
I just don't understand you three.
Why aren't you married?

372
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,910
All the way from Cambodia
to risk your lives?

373
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,309
- We're doing this for our freedom.
- Don't bother.

374
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,470
He doesn't know what a guerrilla is.

375
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,879
You think I don't know?

376
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,750
Guerrilla means a bunch of slackers
who are vulnerable and unreliable.

377
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,317
You're right to be mad.
I'm not kidding, I'm serious.

378
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,439
Come on! Can't you take a joke?

379
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,959
Well done!

380
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,833
I hope we'll see you
blow out a candle again next year!

381
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,592
Don't talk such rubbish!

382
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,318
Raining non-stop day and night!

383
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,392
When do you plan to stop?
It's unending!

384
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,514
Don't blame the heavens.
It's just bad luck. Here.

385
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,596
Actually I'm purposely hiding things
from you. Such as the time...

386
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,796
Don't say another word, Ming.

387
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,589
Even if we don't know, we understand.
You're doing this for all of us.

388
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,195
This relentless rain
is getting to us all.

389
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,959
Can't sleep?

390
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,150
I woke up suddenly from a dream.

391
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,755
As a gentleman, I am duty bound.

392
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,750
I can't bear to see you
stuck out in this wind and rain.

393
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,110
I have to give you some warmth
and support.

394
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,634
I don't need support,
but I am also duty bound.

395
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,075
You stand here,
I'll go over there.

396
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,798
Try and be a man.

397
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,519
Keep a sharp eye out
for anything unusual.

398
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,438
One day I swear
I'll melt the iceberg!

399
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,509
Who was that? Answer or I'll fire!

400
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,558
Take it easy. It's me.
I'm just taking a leak.

401
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,709
Not there!
Do you want people to see you?

402
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,917
Yes, that's why
I've come to pee here.

403
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,039
In this rain, you can't tell
whether it's rain or pee!

404
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,839
Hey, don't you dare aim at me
or I'll shoot!

405
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,478
Yeah, right! Shoot me then!

406
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,393
Vietcong!

407
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,040
There's Vietcong!

408
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,639
Vietcong!

409
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,677
Help! Help!

410
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,909
Help!

411
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,515
Move!

412
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,799
Keep it moving!

413
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,996
Get your bets in.

414
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,833
Come on, let's get on with it.

415
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,070
Place your bets.

416
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,279
- No more bets? Let's play.
- Fine with me.

417
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,554
Heads or tails?

418
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,278
- Heads.
- Tails.

419
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,195
Heads.

420
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,557
Take him to the water cage.

421
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,989
- Are you trying to kill him, idiot?
- I wanted to get a confession.

422
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,718
That man's made of steel.

423
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,598
Let me talk to my superior.

424
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,030
Boss, you can't die.

425
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,632
- Let's do it.
- I don't think I can.

426
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,790
We have no choice. Come on.

427
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,679
What are you doing?

428
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,273
Someone is coming...

429
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,755
Where are you taking me?

430
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,513
Go on! Go! Climb!

431
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,513
On your knees!

432
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,388
Come on, we're all counting on you.
This time we'll win for sure.

433
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,038
Lost again!

434
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,592
This time you'll lose for sure.

435
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,198
This time I'm gonna win, ready?

436
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,959
They've lost.

437
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,398
What's the matter, are you afraid?

438
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,277
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid.

439
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,079
Hey, enough games! Take him back!

440
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,390
Good luck, kid.

441
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,990
Stop fooling around you lot!

442
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,117
Take him back!
I need to interrogate him some more.

443
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,031
Why are you playing with them?

444
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,479
We won!

445
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,590
Yes... yes, yes.

446
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,516
All I know is
they're going to Pine Slope.

447
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,512
I'll let you know
as soon as we have anything new.

448
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,875
I understand.

449
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,678
Get down!

450
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,673
You nearly got me killed!

451
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,228
- What's going on down there?
- Nothing.

452
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,595
- Then why were you shouting?
- Come here.

453
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,072
- Come here, come here.
- What?

454
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,957
You lot come here!

455
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,513
What do you want?

456
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,352
Why all the shouting?

457
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,069
Did you hear that the US troops
are coming again?

458
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,793
I wonder what it's like
in Ho Chi Minh City?

459
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,958
The girls are great there.

460
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,554
Hey, you look like that fat guy
in the water cell.

461
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,790
Not like him, I am him!

462
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,309
- Get them out first!
- Go!

463
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,109
Get out of here!

464
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,117
- Brother!
- Big brother!

465
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,636
It... really... hurts!

466
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,712
Don't move! Don't move! Help! Help!

467
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,638
Big brother.

468
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,718
Big brother, wake up.
Don't die! Help!

469
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,992
If my brother were still alive,
he'd have been the same age.

470
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,988
Don't comfort me with that bullshit.

471
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,913
He was killed during the outbreak
of the Vietnam War.

472
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,949
I was only seventeen.

473
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,435
Was your brother as nagging as mine?

474
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,078
No.

475
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,470
Well, I'm not irritating
and impulsive like you.

476
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,672
I'll never be like that again.

477
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,231
No matter how irritating I am now,
there'll be no one here to remind me.

478
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,278
If you change, then your brother's
death was worthwhile.

479
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,758
Worthwhile! What do you mean by that?

480
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,274
Brother, don't be like that!

481
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,191
Brother, don't be like that!

482
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,600
You're all a bunch of animals!

483
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,910
Let's bury him and be on our way.

484
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,073
What did you say? On our way?

485
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,470
Fine! You tell us then!

486
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,516
What exactly is our mission?

487
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,435
What did my brother die for?

488
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,988
I still can't tell you that.

489
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,638
Then I'll tell you.

490
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,711
I'm quitting for real this time!

491
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,679
Lieutenant, I don't want to die
without knowing why.

492
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,276
I don't want to die either,
no matter what it's for.

493
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,958
If you don't tell us now,

494
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,591
I would rather die here and stay
with my brother than follow you.

495
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,278
Lieutenant, we've risked our lives
many times.

496
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,193
It's time you told us the truth.

497
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,950
All right. We're not too far from our
destination anyway. Our mission is...

498
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,234
Hold it!

499
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,789
You think I'm crazy.

500
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,590
I pretended to be crazy because
I didn't know who you people were.

501
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,638
But now I know
we have a spy amongst us.

502
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,153
A spy?

503
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,434
That's right.

504
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,794
The spy is...

505
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,995
Don't!

506
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,870
Use frequency 1246
to contact our leaders

507
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,951
and ask for a course of action.

508
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,839
We vowed to fight the VC,
none of us would do that.

509
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,319
Shit! I give up!

510
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,278
You said she'd pick up
the transmitter for sure.

511
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,873
So it's someone else?

512
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,351
I told you the Vietcong are sneaky.

513
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,590
You can't expose her so easily.

514
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,912
You said she deliberately left cloth
behind for the VC to follow us.

515
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,117
You saw her talking to the Vietcong
on the phone. So what?

516
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,317
Actually, no one would believe
you're Vietcong.

517
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,994
Even if you were,
I still wouldn't believe you.

518
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,911
- Tell me, are you Vietcong?
- No...

519
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,592
I know you'll say no.

520
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,194
But you really are Vietcong, right?

521
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,474
Say it! No need to say it? Yes...

522
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,038
Lau Shun-Ying, I've always treated
you as a sister, a life long friend.

523
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,075
How could you?

524
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,594
Spare me the lecture,
just pull the trigger.

525
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,358
Don't look at me.
I never want to see your face again!

526
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,319
General.

527
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,551
Whatever their mission is,
kill them all!

528
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,595
Yes, General!

529
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,752
I heard the guerrillas escaped.

530
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,150
We worked so hard to catch them!

531
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,391
It's over there.

532
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,992
Go round again.

533
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,155
If we can capture that helicopter,
we've hit the jackpot.

534
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,477
Lieutenant, it's not that difficult
to get to the bridge.

535
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,279
There are only two machine guns
at this end.

536
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,429
But getting to the other end
is not so easy.

537
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,159
There are two more guns
waiting for us there.

538
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,074
If we just charge ahead, the bridge
would become our entrance to Hell.

539
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,720
If we don't cross here,
how long will it take?

540
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,030
For a young man, about 2-3 days.

541
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,190
For an old fart like him,
at least a week.

542
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,831
Did you hear that? An elderly man
shouldn't get in a youngster's way.

543
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,595
I heard you.
Don't worry, you won't get old.

544
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,638
Can you two cut the crap for once!

545
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,996
Lieutenant, I think we have a better
chance crossing by night.

546
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,230
Hey! Come here!

547
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,595
Look.

548
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,109
They'll be here in about three hours.
We have no time to lose.

549
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,952
We're like cornered rats here.

550
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,555
I'd rather run
and live to fight another day.

551
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,792
The only way is to let me cross
the bridge and destroy the guns.

552
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,714
Once you two hear the explosion,
fix the two guns on this end.

553
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,519
The rest of you,
cross when you hear the explosion.

554
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,998
- Everybody got it?
- Yes.

555
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,116
- I don't.
- Just follow the others.

556
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,555
There's a truck coming.

557
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,712
Let me get on the truck first.

558
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,995
Is there really a $200,000 reward?

559
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,991
It's more than that now. Let's go!

560
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,872
Move and we all die.

561
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,276
Lay down your guns and sit down.

562
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,991
Don't try anything.

563
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,519
Stop!

564
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,272
- Is it safe on the road?
- So-so.

565
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,669
- Have you seen any guerrillas?
- No.

566
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,513
- Stay on the alert.
- Yes.

567
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,875
- What happened?
- Guerrillas.

568
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,273
No! Don't cross now!

569
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,113
All for one and one for all!

570
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,714
- Watch out!
- I've been doing that for 70 years.

571
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,915
You can't be that old!

572
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,711
Judy Hu, are you all right?

573
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,995
Grandpa, are you all right?

574
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,751
Don't cry, Grandpa.

575
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,558
I'm hurt too.

576
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,236
Let's fight!

577
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,434
Judy!

578
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,955
Judy!

579
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,519
- Grandpa!
- Judy!

580
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,638
Grandpa, hang in there!

581
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,518
I've been hanging in there
since I was born.

582
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,036
Don't you worry. Even if I get blown
to pieces, I'll still carry you home.

583
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,237
Then my guts
would be turned inside out.

584
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,471
No, it's better to wait for death.
You go.

585
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,996
If Dai-Hoi can't carry you alone,
I'll help him out.

586
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,197
Save it.
All my daughters are married.

587
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,430
You're still talking rubbish
at a time like this.

588
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,557
What should I say, something noble?

589
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,675
I wanted to leave, but I couldn't.

590
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,675
I don't want to die. I can't.

591
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,358
At least I will die in the East,
and not in the West.

592
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,956
You guys go and finish the mission.

593
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,996
We'll meet again soon.

594
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,392
Ming, you go first.

595
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,675
No, we're going first.

596
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,831
- No need to take care of us.
- I...

597
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:31,118
Ming, I've always liked you
because you talk straight.

598
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,272
Don't ruin it by stopping now.

599
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,030
I won't say much either, take care.
If you're still alive, look us up.

600
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,154
Promise me not to die too soon, OK?

601
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,349
We have to leave now,
the troops are arriving!

602
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,431
We've got to leave now!

603
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,673
Go on!

604
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,437
See you on the way back!

605
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,358
You corpses sure are heavy.

606
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,152
Judy... hurry up!

607
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,354
Here they come, Grandpa.

608
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,678
Do you think I'm deaf?

609
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,991
Grandpa, let me do it.

610
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,195
Do you think I'm blind?

611
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,512
I wouldn't dare mock you, you've gone
through so much more than me.

612
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,477
I can see you're an honest man,

613
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,394
because all this time you still
haven't lit that cigarette.

614
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,631
My friend gave me this
for safe-keeping before he died.

615
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,833
Well, soon you can return it
to him personally.

616
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,433
Here, let me.

617
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,036
- What did your friend die of?
- Lung cancer.

618
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,714
Here they come!

619
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,313
I know.

620
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,313
Closer and closer!

621
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,913
I know!

622
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,352
Right where we want them.

623
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,393
Ready...

624
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,117
Fire!

625
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,439
We got them!

626
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,829
Good, now we can die.

627
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,872
Grandpa, I'll see you down below.

628
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,875
Wrong, it will be up high. We've
been living in hell all our lives.

629
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,520
How can we be going to hell again?

630
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,636
Look up.
What's the colour of the sky?

631
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,229
It's blue. I guess we're going
to the right place after all.

632
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,709
Wrong...

633
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,834
it's black.

634
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,029
Fire!

635
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,432
The entrance is here.

636
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,509
Follow me.

637
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,557
- Who knows how to start a generator?
- I do.

638
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,073
Come with me.

639
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,394
It's here. Break it open.

640
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,918
Nothing's happening.

641
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,832
It's starting!

642
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:41,278
Wow! If the Vietcong get their hands
on this lot, lots of people will die.

643
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,039
We've already lost enough.

644
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,990
- Let's install the detonators.
- Detonators?

645
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,799
Hey! You're not going
to blow them up, are you?

646
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,713
That's right.
There are nine ammunition dumps here.

647
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,030
Each dump has its own security units.

648
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,759
We must install time bombs
in every dump.

649
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,671
- Set the timer to 30 minutes.
- Hold on.

650
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,593
Lieutenant, you can't blow up
the artillery.

651
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,319
This could be very useful
to our guerrillas.

652
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,437
My mission is to destroy them.
Let's help each other out.

653
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,070
- Lieutenant!
- Don't move! Drop your weapons!

654
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,230
Don't move! Drop it!

655
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,153
- Drop it!
- It wasn't me. I didn't move.

656
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,235
Lieutenant, don't push me.

657
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,709
Why did we endure so much
to stay in Vietnam

658
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,157
if not to wipe out the Vietcong and
stop them from ravaging our country

659
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,719
and killing our people.

660
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,951
Lieutenant, I admire your loyalty
in doing your duty,

661
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,918
but you're wounded now,
you're no longer responsible.

662
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,788
Let us keep the artillery
so we can fight the Vietcong.

663
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,314
Tung Ming-Sun,
install the detonators now!

664
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,394
You made me do it.

665
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,148
- Don't move!
- Big sister!

666
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,639
Don't move!

667
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,119
Buddy?

668
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,637
Tung Ming-Sun, the bombs!

669
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,392
Let's give him a hand.

670
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,559
Be careful!
Don't shoot the artillery!

671
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:21,035
I'm coming to see you, Grandpa.
But I'm bringing some friends.

672
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,838
Let me blow up these bastards.

673
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,268
It's useless! The artillery must
never get into the Vietcong's hands.

674
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,715
Help them install the detonators now.

675
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,511
- Kiddo!
- Big sister, don't worry about me.

676
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,109
- Lieutenant!
- That way! I'll help you.

677
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,360
Heroes don't need guns.

678
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,633
Are these people all dead?
Wait for me!

679
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,790
Let's go before this place blows.

680
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,754
Let's go! We're running out of time.

681
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,998
- What's happening?
- Run!

682
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,759
Run, fast before it blows!

683
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,753
Mum, why didn't you give me an extra
pair of legs so I could go faster?

684
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,478
No, not this way.

685
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,757
The gate is locked and there
are loads of Vietcong out there.

686
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,192
So we're sitting ducks then?

687
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,514
Escape by water!

688
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,473
Pull harder!

689
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,835
Hurry!

690
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:21,191
- We made it at last. Now what?
- We wait for the plane.

691
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,795
- Are you sure it will come?
- The Lieutenant said so.

692
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,996
But that was
before we changed the plan.

693
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,436
I don't know if it will come.
We have to try our luck anyway.

694
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,751
- Try our luck?
- It's the damned Americans' fault.

695
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,592
If it wasn't for them we'd be fine.

696
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,950
If that's how you feel,
where will you go?

697
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,837
America, of course!

698
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,913
