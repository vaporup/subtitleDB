<i>(gentle classical music)</i>

2
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:51,962
I remember those cheers
They still ring in my ears

3
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,965
And for years
They'll remain in my thoughts

4
00:02:55,087 --> 00:03:02,243
'Cause one night I took off my robe
And what did I do? I forgot to wear shorts

5
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:06,155
I recall every fall, every hook, every jab

6
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:12,476
The worse way a guy can get rid of his flab
As you know, my life wasn 't drab

7
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:16,919
Though I'd much... Though I'd rather
hear you cheer when you tell... No.

8
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,756
I'd rather hear you cheer
When I delve into Shakespeare

9
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:26,917
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
I haven 't had a winner in six months

10
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:32,797
And though I'm no Olivier
I would much rather...

11
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:39,525
If he fought Sugar Ray, he would say
That the thing ain 't the ring, it's the play

12
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,878
So give me a stage
Where this bull here can rage

13
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:46,920
And though I can fight
I'd much rather recite

14
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,959
That's entertainment.

15
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,359
<i>(Jake)</i> That's entertainment.

16
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,240
<i>(commentator)</i> Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves in Cleveland.

17
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:01,245
La Motta is undefeated
but well behind on points.

18
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,359
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment.

19
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,479
Jake is cut around the left eye...

20
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:11,998
Jack, why do we have to come to Cleveland
for you to get beat?

21
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,484
- Do the fucking right thing.
- He's got you by the balls, Jake.

22
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,723
You have to knock him out.

23
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:22,999
- Bite him, kick him, do anything you gotta do.
- <i>(Jake's trainer)</i> Listen to Joey.

24
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:27,518
Just like home. Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

25
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,763
You wanna go in there?

26
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,117

27
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:34,722
<i>(woman)</i> Help!

28
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,241
We need a knockout. That's where it's at.

29

- Tenth and final round.
- Good luck.

30
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,999
<i>(commentator)</i> La Motta fighting
out of a half crouch.

31
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:48,517
A tough fighter.
He doesn 't know how to back up.

32
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,162
La Motta continues to bore in.
A bob and weave.

33
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,006
And Reeves is down!

34
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,403
The crowd is urging Jake on.

35
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:01,917
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

36
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:05,960
La Motta comes at him again.
Reeves misses a right, takes a left.

37
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,762
A hard left
and Reeves is down for the second time.

38
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:15,996
A determined Jake La Motta is making
a great comeback in the tenth round.

39
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:22,839
Reeves is up again. La Motta coming at him.
A left hook to the jaw. Another left and a right.

40
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:27,085
A hook on the jaw. Two more lefts to the head.

41
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:31,280
Reeves goes down for the third time.
The referee pulls La Motta away.

42
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,956
Two, three, four, five...

43
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:39,399
The referee is counting over Reeves,
but time is running out.

44
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,518
And there is the bell.

45
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:48,364
And Reeves has been saved by the bell,
but did La Motta do it soon enough?

46
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:53,038
It's no good. This is Ohio, not New York!
You waited too long.

47
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:57,479
Joey, put my robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right.

48

- Ladies and gentlemen!

...Jimmy Reeves Junior!

53

Jake La Motta, the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

Don 't leave. Don 't get out of the fucking ring.

That shit woulda never happened

66
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:37,247
He's gotta be with Tommy to get a title shot.
He'll wind up punch drunk, your brother.

67
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,042
- I know.
- Make him understand it's the best thing.

- But you gotta make him know.

69

- Jesus Christ, when the fuck you gonna stop?

I told you, I understand.
He just wants to do things for himself.

You got a head like concrete.

You think it's easy? Why don 't you talk to him?

73

- I can 't talk to him.
- Why?

74
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,682
- He don 't like me.
- Nobody likes you.

75
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,004
They knew. They knew who's the boss.

76
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:19,087
The judges didn 't know.
What happened with them? The people knew.

You don 't believe me.
You thought I was fooling around.

You thought I was fooling around, didn 't you?

- I ain 't fooling around. That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

Don 't overcook it.
If you overcook it, it's no good.

83
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,959
It defeats its own purpose.

I just said don 't overcook it. Bring it over.

92

We should be with Tommy.
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.

Tommy tells me every day to talk to you.
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

94

You just can 't keep doing this.

- Your hands? What about 'em?

129
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,636
I got these small hands,

No matter how big I get, no matter who I fight,
I ain 't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

He's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight. We know that.

I ain 't never gonna get a chance.

You asked me what was wrong.

137
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:25,837
You're crazy to even think about that.
He's a heavyweight, you're a middleweight.

It'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin ' about it?

Hey, Joey, did I not tell you just to do it?

- What?

155
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:39,038
Use that. Wrap it around your hand.
How many times I gotta tell you?

156
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,840
Not many more. Want me to hit you?

157
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,925
Hit me with everything you got.
Lay me out.

158
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,402

- Yeah.

159

Harder.

How are they gonna help me? By taking
my money? Is that what you're talking about?

I'm here breaking my ass, not them.

Don 't do it around me.
Do it around your friends. That's all.

She's not the kind of girl

- No.

- I just told you the truth. Don 't ask me again.

I always tell you the truth.
If I didn 't, you would know.

- I try to fuck anything.
- She didn 't go with you?

- She didn 't go for it.
- Naturally. She knew better.

You missed him.

00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:02,087
That's me and my brother,
fooling around.

324
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,767
I know.

325
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:07,276
You look good, though.

326
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:15,638
- What are you smiling about?
- I don 't know.

327
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:25,396
Do you know how beautiful you are?

328
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:30,521
Anybody ever tell you you're beautiful?
Yeah, they tell you all the time.

329
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:08,920
<i>(commentator)</i> Sugar Ray Robinson and
Jake La Motta in Detroit for their second fight.

330
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,922
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake at Madison Square Garden.

331
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:19,405
You can see the contrast in their styles.
The speedy Ray Robinson up on his toes.

332
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:24,555
La Motta moves in flat-footed most of the time.
Now he's hurt Robinson.

333
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:29,043
La Motta coming at Robinson again.
A left and a right.

334
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,603
- A left hand to the body thrown by La Motta.
- <i>(bell rings)</i>

335

336
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:41,679
La Motta drives both hands to the head.
Left hand to the jaw, right to the body.

337
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:46,437
Robinson with a right on the nose.
La Motta drives him across the ring.

338
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:52,358
A hard left and Robinson is driven out of
the ring, for the first knockdown of his career.

339
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:56,275
This is the nearest Robinson has been to a loss.

340
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:07,839
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge.

341
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:11,004
The undefeated Sugar Ray,
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

342
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:14,722
La Motta coming at him again,
feigning a left hand.

343
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:16,838
<i>(bell rings)</i>

344
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:28,321

348
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,607
A unanimous decision for the Bronx Bull,

349
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:43,276
handing Sugar Ray Robinson
his first loss as a professional,

350
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:45,398
and Robinson doesn 't like it.

351
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:48,997
With this victory, La Motta broke
what was considered the impossible,

352
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,118
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

353
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:55,798
La Motta has proved he shouldn 't be denied
a shot at the middleweight crown.

354
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:04,601
- Are you sure we should be doing this?
- <i>(Jake)</i> Come here.

355
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:08,515
You said never to touch you before a fight.

356
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:14,157
- Come here, before I give you a beating.
- You've been good for two weeks.

357
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,278
Come here.

358
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,398
Come here.

359
00:32:34,607 --> 00:32:36,598
Touch my boo-boos.

360
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:39,478
Ah!

361
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,202
The boo-baas. That's it.

362
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,605
- Boo-baas?
- Boo-boo. Give the boo-boo a kiss.

363
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,718
Make it better.

364
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:59,678
Mm.

365
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,125
- Take off my pants.
- Jake.

366
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:09,636
Go ahead. Take off my pants.

<i>(unzips flies)</i>

369

Now take off the rest.

370
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:33,324
- You made me promise not to get you excited.
- Go ahead. Do it.

371
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:52,127
Take off your panties.

372
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:39,275
I like the gym smell.

373
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:41,398
Huh?

374
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,601
I like the smell of the gym.

375
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:12,638
All right, enough.

376
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:17,437
I can 't do any more. I can 't do any more.

377
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,399
I gotta fight Robinson. I can 't fool around.

378
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:41,038
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

379
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:56,603
What are you doin '? What are you doin '?
What are you doin ' to me?

380
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,525
<i>(commentator)</i> La Motta and Robinson
meet for the third time.

381
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:36,878
These men are unique, becoming classic rivals.

382
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:39,646
These two men, fierce, powerful fighters,

383
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:42,964
so dangerous that no other fighter
will go near them.

384
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:45,726
So they fight each other, three weeks apart.

385
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:51,046
They've each won one, and they'll probably
fight again, the way it looks now.

386
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,762
<i>- (bell rings)</i>
- They go to close quarters at the bell.

387
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,476
Round seven, with Sugar Ray ahead on points.

388
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:03,121
La Motta may need a knockout.

389
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:08,076
And Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

390
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:10,596
He was down in the last fight too.

391
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:14,117
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

392
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:17,557
- Robinson trying to get up.
- <i>(referee)...</i> six, seven, eight...

393
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:22,522
He's up on his feet and the referee
is wiping off his gloves. He is stunned.

394
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:28,040
La Motta comes at him. Despite being knocked
down, Robinson is well ahead on points.

395
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,965
- He hooks a left to the jaw.
- <i>(bell rings)</i>

I don 't know what else I gotta do.

You won! They robbed you. They're miserable
because their mothers take it up the ass.

Forget about all that shit.
This was your shot. They robbed us!

- No, I don 't wanna talk to nobody.

- Look at that. 168Ibs.

No, you didn 't. You told me
you could get down to 155Ibs.

425
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:34,953
- Did I pull it out of the fuckin ' air?
- I'm lucky I make it to 160.

426
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:41,470
On top of that, you sign me for a fight at 155.
If I don 't make it, I lose 15,000 dollars.

There's nobody left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

432

Along comes this kid Janiro.
He's young, up-and-coming, he'll fight anybody.

433
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,550
Good. You fight him.
Bust his hole. Tear him apart. Right?

434
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:12,668
- What are you worried about?
- The weight.

435
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:15,594
- The weight?
- I just said the weight!

436
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:21,905
Let's say you lose because of your weight.
Will they think you're not as tough as you were?

437
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:25,824
Good. They'll match you with guys
they were afraid to before.

438
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:29,346
- You'll kill 'em. They'll give you a title shot.
- Coffee, please.

439
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:32,832
Why? There's nobody else.
Who they gonna give it to?

- How long I gotta wait?
- <i>(Joey)</i> Are you listenin '?

443
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:45,428
Let's say you win, you beat Janiro.
You definitely should beat him.

444
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,705
- Right?
- Yeah.

445
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:48,428

- They still gotta give you a shot at the title.
- Why?

There's nobody left.
They gotta give you the shot. You understand?

448
00:43:57,036 --> 00:44:01,666
If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win.
There's no way you can lose.

449
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:06,472
And you'll do it on your own,
without any help from anybody.

450
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:11,386
Just get down to 155Ibs, you fat bastard.
Stop eating. What's the problem?

- You can do it. You understand that?
- Joey's right.

Janiro's up-and-coming, good-Iooking, popular.

- You beat him now...
- What do you mean, good-Iooking?

454
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:25,150
- I'm saying popular. If you win...
- Who are you to say good-Iooking?

- I'm just telling you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority or what?

Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

457

Everybody all of a sudden 's an authority.
Where did she find out he's good-Iooking?

458
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:42,950
<i>(Joey's wife)</i> She didn 't mean nothin '.

- Who asked you?
- You gonna start with me now?

460
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:51,390
When people are talking, you don 't interrupt.
It's none of your business.

461
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:54,508
Especially if it's my brother and his wife.

462
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:57,070
Get outta here. Take the baby inside.

463

Come on. Let's leave the grouches here, OK?

464
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:02,911

- You make her cry.

466

- I'm gonna make you cry.

- I got a reason.

You and I both know any woman,
given the right time, place, circumstance,

00:45:52,676 --> 00:45:56,066
they'll do anything. Anything's possible, right?

478
00:45:56,196 --> 00:46:00,508
You're right, you're not wrong,
but you're picking on this girl.

479
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:06,074
You're worried about your weight
and you tell her, "Go inside. Who asked you?"

00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,029
You're gonna give her an excuse to go out.

481
00:46:09,156 --> 00:46:13,593
- She was talking about a guy.
- So what? She was talking on your behalf.

482
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:17,629
She was talking about a pretty kid,
saying he's good-Iooking.

483
00:46:17,756 --> 00:46:21,749
- So you make him ugly.
- Never mind. Just do it.

484
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:28,225
You know what you should do?
Go inside and make up with her.

485
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:31,507
And we'll go out before you go away.

486
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:37,825
You'll go away with a clear head. You took
her out and had a good time. All right?

487
00:46:37,956 --> 00:46:40,789
All right. Where do you wanna go?

488
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:43,032
- Out out, you know.
- All right.

489
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:49,789
Listen, though, if you tell her now, don 't say
nothin ' in front of Lenore. I'm not taking her.

490
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:52,555
What do you think, I'm gonna tell her?

491
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,315
- Do what you're gonna do.
- I am.

492
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:59,789
Hey, hey, hey.

493
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,907
Come here.

494
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:29,153
Good evening.
It's great to be back in the Copa Lounge.

495
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:34,993
What a great audience! Lady, lap it up.
I laugh when you come in.

496
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:38,472
But, seriously speaking,
we have a special guest tonight.

497
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:42,475
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

498
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:44,951
the Bronx Bull, the Raging Bull,

499
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:50,070
let's hear it for the great Jake La Motta,
ladies and gentlemen!

500
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:55,906
- What's your name again?
- Janet.

501
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:58,425
Janet, sorry. Just couldn 't...

502
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:00,547
It's toast time.

503
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:07,514
He hits me with a left hook.
No hand, just a hook he had.

504
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:11,629
- Where are you goin '?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

505
00:48:13,876 --> 00:48:16,265
- Hey, Vickie.
- Hi.

506
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,832
- You're looking great. Joey here?
- Over there. Jake's here too.

507
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:23,312
I'm over here with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

508
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:27,429
If you get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

509
00:48:28,356 --> 00:48:31,507
- Hello, Jake. How are you?
- How you doin '?

510
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:34,787
You're not drinking, are you?
Joey, how are you?

511
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:38,591
- How you doin ', Salvy?
- Look like you're having a ball.

512
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:43,551
- I'm with Tommy Como. Come over.
- Tommy's here? I didn 't see him come in.

513
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:53,307
I'll see you later, Joey.

514
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:56,155
That's some suit. He looks good, huh, Jack?

515
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:58,551
<i>(laughter)</i>

516
00:48:58,676 --> 00:49:01,031
I thought that was my best joke.

517
00:49:05,436 --> 00:49:07,745
- Look who's here.
- <i>(man)</i> Hi, Vickie.

518
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:11,266
- <i>(women)</i> Hi, Vickie.
- Hey, Vickie.

519
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:17,073
How are you, honey? Good to see you.
Say hello to Charlie. Sit down, have a drink.

520
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:21,633
- I can 't. I have to get back to Jake.
- Thanks for coming by.

521
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:25,146
- Not a bad kid, Vickie.
- She's with that fuckin ' gorilla.

522
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:29,269
She must have caught
a hundred beatings off that guy.

523
00:49:30,396 --> 00:49:33,388
- What took you so long?
- I went by Tommy's table.

524
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:37,748
I saw you say hello to them.
What took you so long?

525
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:43,075
- Nothing. I said hello and then I came back.
- What else did you say?

526
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:47,109
He asked if I wanted a drink,
I said no and left.

527
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:52,026
- What were you talking to Salvy for?
- He asked me if Joey was here.

528
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:56,035
Then he said Tommy's over there,
say hello, and I did.

529
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:59,990
- Are you interested in him?
- No. Why would I be?

530
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:03,108
- You sure you're not interested in him?
- Yeah.

531
00:50:04,516 --> 00:50:07,713
You're not interested,
but you could be interested in somebody?

532
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:09,827
Jake, don 't start, huh?

533
00:50:09,956 --> 00:50:14,154
<i>(Jake)</i> Shut up or I'm gonna
smack you in the face.

534
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:17,313
These are... These are from... Mr Como.

535
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,470
- Shall I take the...
- What?

536
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:26,747
- Shall I take this?
- I'm not through with it.

537
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:30,186
These are the jokes, folks.
I'll tell you the truth...

538
00:50:30,316 --> 00:50:34,514
- Hi, how are you? Bald-headed fag.
<i>- (laughter)</i>

539
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:39,789
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy. Thanks for the drinks.

540
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:42,191
- How are you?
- How's everything?

541
00:50:42,316 --> 00:50:47,151
- <i>(Tommy)</i> Where's Jake?
- <i>(Joey)</i> He's over there. He don 't wanna come.

542
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:50,306
<i>(Joey)</i> If you call him, he'll come.

543
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,672
I'll be right back.

544
00:50:54,796 --> 00:51:00,314
You don 't call anybody any more.
We never see you any more.

545
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:03,348
You can 't even make a call? What is it?

546
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:06,752
- I'm busy. I'm out of town a lot.
- Busy.

547
00:51:06,876 --> 00:51:10,232
Look at him taking me seriously.
I'm only kidding you.

548
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:14,554
What a fuckin ' kid!
That's the best fuckin ' fighter around.

549
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:19,750
Them <i>mulenyams.</i> Forget about it.
They're all afraid to fight you. How you feelin '?

550
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,026
- I'm all right.
- Strong?

551
00:51:22,156 --> 00:51:26,354
- Strong, yeah.
- Janiro's gotta watch his ass, right?

552
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:30,355
- I think he should.
- I won nothing but money with the guy.

553
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:34,264
- He's no piece of cake.
- Attractive. All the girls like him.

554
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:36,864
No marks. Clean.

555
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:41,510
Jake, did you gain a few pounds?

556
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:44,912
- Yeah, I'll knock it off right away.
- Right off.

557
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:46,913
Right off.

558
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:51,075
Let me ask you something.
I'm just talking.

559
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:57,271
I'm telling you that I'm gonna bet
a lot of money on you, this fight with Janiro.

560
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,545
Yeah.

561
00:51:58,676 --> 00:52:02,510
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

562
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:05,309
- I would say bet everything you got.
- Everything?

563
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:11,671
Everything. 'Cause I'm gonna open his hole
like this. Excuse my French, girls.

564
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,549
- I'll make him suffer.
- What's the matter with him?

565
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:18,669
I'm gonna make his mother
wish she never had him.

566
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:21,356
Didn 't he say something in the papers?

567
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:24,593
No, he's a nice kid, a pretty kid, too.

568
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:29,267
I got a problem,
whether I should fuck him or fight him.

569
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:35,951
- Fuck him or fight him!
- You're liable to get fucked. Watch out.

570
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:37,714
- By who?
- Janiro.

571
00:52:37,836 --> 00:52:42,114
- You want me to get him to fuck you?
- Me? No.

572
00:52:42,236 --> 00:52:48,072
I could do that easily. I'll give you both
a beating and you both can fuck each other.

573
00:52:49,396 --> 00:52:53,912
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

574
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:56,914
<i>(Tommy)</i> Come on. Drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

575
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:58,628
<i>Salute</i>

576
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:01,793
- Jake, good luck.
- Good luck, Jake.

577
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,787
Hey, Vickie.

578
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:42,669
- Vickie.
- What?

579
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,946
You awake?

580
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:47,067
No.

581
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,825
- Can you hear me?
- What?

582
00:53:56,756 --> 00:54:01,307
You ever think of anybody else...
when we're in bed?

583
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,430
- What do you mean?
- You know, like when we make love.

584
00:54:06,556 --> 00:54:08,945
No, nobody, I love you.

585
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:13,627
How come you said that thing about Janiro?

586
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:17,795
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

587
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,749
I never noticed his face.

588
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:24,346
Well, how come you said that, then?

589
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:30,472
I don 't know what I said. I don 't even know
what he looks like. Go to sleep.

590
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:42,992
<i>(cheering)</i>

591
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:33,152
<i>(bell rings cheering)</i>

592
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:40,712
<i>(crowd chanting)</i> Jake! Jake! Jake!

593
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:47,347
- He ain 't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

594
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:52,706
(announcer) And the winner,
by unanimous decision,

595
00:55:52,836 --> 00:55:55,987
in ten rounds, Jake La Motta!

596
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:22,985
Give me a little piece of ice,
just for my tongue.

597
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:26,950
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dying.

598
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:29,067
Fuckin ' hard-on.

599
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:34,635
Four pounds. Keep workin '. Come on, move.

600
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:46,434
I saw the fight with Janiro.
Destroyed this guy. Incredible.

601
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:51,789
He knocked his nose from one side of his face
to the other. It was hanging off.

602
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:56,387
- Who are you fighting next?
- I don 't know. He's away in training camp.

603
00:56:56,516 --> 00:57:00,555
- They gotta give him that title shot.
- Jackie Curtie, Joey.

604
00:57:00,676 --> 00:57:05,909
- I heard a lot of nice things about you.
- We're gonna get the title shot.

605
00:57:06,036 --> 00:57:09,949
- I like your brother. Made money on him.
- Probably more than he did.

606
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:13,193
- <i>(Curtie)</i> On the Oscar Jackson fight.
- Whatever happened to Oscar?

607
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:17,355
- You see him any more?
- He's punchy. Probably died. Who cares?

608
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:21,230
- It's a beautiful table.
- It's the worst table in the house.

609
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:25,315
<i>(Curtie)</i> He's working downtown. Big building.
Working an elevator. Happened to be there.

610
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:27,745
I'm not Italian. I don 't care.

611
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:31,551
- Took me right up.
- Oscar did you a lot of good.

612
00:57:31,676 --> 00:57:34,713
- He was tough.
- <i>(Curtie)</i> Gave a hell of a fight.

613
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:37,873
- Cutty Sark and water.
- Excuse me one minute, fellas.

614
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,794
Come back, Joey. Come on back. OK.

615
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:47,349
<i>(Salvy)</i> Hey, Joe. Hey, Joey.

616
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:50,354
Look how he's looking. Something's up.

617
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:53,036
- They're having a problem.
- You're worried about it?

618
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:56,273
<i>- (Vickie)</i> I was just having a drink.
- Shut up!

619
00:57:56,396 --> 00:58:01,311
I feel like a prisoner. I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

620
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,825
- You think you're right?
- I am right.

621
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:08,108
- No, you're wrong.
- I'm tired of having both of you up my ass.

622
00:58:09,836 --> 00:58:12,396
- Shut up.
- I'm tired of listening to you.

623
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:15,349
Don 't make me get nuts in this place.

624
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:19,674
- I gotta sleep by myself every night?
- What did you marry him for?

625
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,435
- I love him.
- You do?

626
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:27,869
- This guy don 't even wanna fuck me.
- He's just been a contender too long.

627
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:33,628
It'll be all right as soon as he gets his shot,
and then everything'll be OK.

628
00:58:33,756 --> 00:58:36,475
Too many people hate him.

629
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,145
- You're drinking with them.
- I'm gonna have a good time.

630
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:42,267
Get your stuff.

631
00:58:46,116 --> 00:58:49,950
You ain 't stayin ' here.
You're makin ' an asshole out of my brother.

632
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:53,432
- Joey, relax.
- Shut up! Mind your fuckin ' business!

633
00:58:53,556 --> 00:58:57,026
- You're takin ' this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn 't I?

634
00:58:57,156 --> 00:59:01,115
There's nothing goin ' on here.

- We've been friends a long time.

656
01:00:39,276 --> 01:00:44,225
but you don 't create a scene like that
in a place like that.

657
01:00:44,356 --> 01:00:48,713
We've heard everybody's point of view here,
and we're gonna forget about it.

01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:53,387
I shouldn 't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it, huh?

659
01:00:53,516 --> 01:01:00,228
I want you two guys to shake hands,
forget this whole thing, and no grudges.

660
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,746
That's the most important thing. No grudges.

Now come on. S hake hands

- I only wish this thing never happened.
- We all wish it never happened.

- We'll get over it.
- Salvy, let me talk with him alone a minute.

- All right? I'll see you Monday, Tuesday.
- Ooh!

666
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,791
I'm sorry. I forgot all about it.

Are you fuckin ' nuts? You're killin ' me.

668

Aside from everything else, the family all right?

669
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:46,432
Yeah, they're fine. Everybody's fine.

- What do you mean?

Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can 't figure you out.

672
01:01:56,716 --> 01:02:01,392
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right."

673
01:02:01,516 --> 01:02:04,667
- You wanna get outta here?
- It's not like that.

674
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:09,824
Just, you know, all the aggravation
and everything, and all the fights.

675
01:02:11,116 --> 01:02:17,305
Listen to me. Now, Jake,
the guy's become an embarrassment.

676
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:23,352
He's embarrassing me with certain people
and I'm looking very bad.

677
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:27,151
I can 't deliver a kid
from my own goddamn neighbourhood.

678
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:31,110
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

679
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:34,831
He comes to me, I make it easier for him.

680
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:39,428
The man 's got a head of rock.

681
01:02:43,036 --> 01:02:46,233
It's hard to explain, Tommy.

682
01:02:46,356 --> 01:02:50,315
Jack respects you.
He don 't even say hello to anybody.

683
01:02:50,436 --> 01:02:53,746
You, he talks to, he likes you.

684
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:59,508
But when he gets something on his mind,
he likes to do things his own way.

685
01:02:59,636 --> 01:03:01,991
Jesus Christ could come off the cross,

686
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:06,871
he don 't give a fuck,
he wants to make it on his own.

687
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:13,231
Make it on his own. He thinks he's gonna walk
in there and become champion on his own.

688
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,905
- Yeah, he's crazy. He's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

689
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:20,233
He's got no respect.
He doesn 't listen to nobody.

690
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:22,426
- That's not crazy.
- He respects you.

691
01:03:22,556 --> 01:03:26,947
He doesn 't respect anybody.
Now, you do this for me.

692
01:03:27,076 --> 01:03:32,025
You tell him I don 't care how colourful he is,
how great he is.

693
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:35,671
He could beat
all the Sugar Ray Robinsons in the world,

694
01:03:35,796 --> 01:03:39,914
but he ain 't gonna get a shot
at that title without us.

695
01:03:40,036 --> 01:03:42,106

You go to him and you tell him.

Jack, wanna do yourself a favour?

01:04:35,116 --> 01:04:37,789
Bust her fuckin ' hole, throw her out.

708
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:42,910
Either that or live with her and let her
ruin your life, 'cause that's what's happening.

So what did that guy say?

711
01:04:59,356 --> 01:05:02,348
He gave me the "good news, bad news" routine.

712
01:05:02,476 --> 01:05:06,389
The good news is
you're gonna get the shot at the title.

713
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:10,907
The bad news is
they want you to do the old flip-flop for them.

714
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:14,187
- What else is new?
- You didn 't see that coming?

715

Now you're a 12 to 5 underdog.

01:11:12,516 --> 01:11:17,715
- Pains in the asses. I don 't believe them.
- Why don 't you just hang up on 'em?

794
01:11:17,836 --> 01:11:22,307
- What do you want to eat?
- I don 't want nothin '.

795
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:25,428
Eat somethin '. You gotta eat somethin '.

796
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:29,309
You can 't go without eating.
Eat a steak.

797
01:11:29,436 --> 01:11:35,830
Chew it, spit it out, you'll still make the weight
tomorrow. You worried about that, huh?

798
01:11:35,956 --> 01:11:40,188
All right, I'll order a steak.
If you want it, it's here.

799
01:11:40,316 --> 01:11:42,307
- OK.
- Vickie, what do you want?

800
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:47,385
- Order me a piece of cake.
- All you want is a piece of cake?

801
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:51,350
Why don 't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

802
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:55,788
- That's good. Order me one of those.
- <i>(Jake)</i> What do you want to eat?

803
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,669
Since when did you order one of those?

804
01:11:58,796 --> 01:12:01,390
- That's what I want.
- Order what you want.

805
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:04,713
- Don 't let nobody influence you.
- <i>(Joey)</i> I was just suggesting.

806
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:10,035
- Why are you telling her what to ask for?
- I don 't give a fuck what she eats.

807
01:12:10,156 --> 01:12:15,867
- What are you telling her for?
- Order me a cheeseburger.

808
01:12:17,396 --> 01:12:20,706
Just order her a cheeseburger, that's all.

809
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,474
What the f?

810
01:12:22,596 --> 01:12:26,384
- How long does this thing take to do?
- 40 seconds.

811
01:12:26,516 --> 01:12:33,035
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.
If we gotta stitch him up, that's how much time.

812
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:36,592
<i>- (knocking)</i>
- Jack? You up? Ho!

813
01:12:36,716 --> 01:12:40,106

- Somebody's here to see you.

814
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:43,228

- How are you?

815

- As good as I'm gonna feel.

819
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:04,987
- I gotta get in there and fight.
- All right.

820
01:13:05,116 --> 01:13:09,428
- We came by to wish you luck. Need anything?
- No.

821
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,626
- Sure?
- No. Thank you, though.

822
01:13:11,756 --> 01:13:14,554
Take care. Good luck. God bless you.

823
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:17,827
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

824
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:22,666
- Say hello to everybody. Vickie, goodbye.

- <i>(Tommy)</i> Any time.

826
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:31,468

- I just wanna say goodbye.

827
01:13:31,596 --> 01:13:34,349
- Take care of him.
- I'll take care of him.

828
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:38,355
Joey, any little thing, call me.
He's very nervous.

829
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:40,706
Goodbye, honey.

830
01:13:40,836 --> 01:13:44,590
Look at that face.
Can you believe that girl?

831
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:47,594
Just as beautiful as ever.

832
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:50,389
- Bye-bye, Tommy.
- <i>(Tommy)</i> So long, everybody.

So long, Tommy.

834
01:13:57,876 --> 01:13:59,628
Vickie.

835
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:04,111
Vickie. Hey! Come here.

836
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:06,227
Come here a minute.

837
01:14:12,756 --> 01:14:15,793
- What was all that about?
- All what?

838
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:21,468
You know what I'm talking about.
What was that all about... with him?

839
01:14:21,596 --> 01:14:25,509
- I just said goodbye.
- All of a sudden you're so friendly?

840
01:14:25,636 --> 01:14:28,628
You say hello, you say goodbye. You hear?

841
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,475
- I hear.
- Hey! You hear what I said?

842
01:14:31,596 --> 01:14:36,306
You don 't ever have any disrespect for me.
You hear what I said?

01:14:36,436 --> 01:14:40,952
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there. Come here.

844
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,113
- Why don 't you stop that?
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:47,546
I'll fuckin ' take care of you later! Shut up!

846
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:58,148
I'm disgusted with the two of you.

I'll get to you later.

- Went out. What's the matter?
- Television won 't work.

880

Where did you go?

881
01:19:10,977 --> 01:19:15,175
I went out, went shopping,
went to my sister's, you know.

882

<i>(man talking on TV)</i>

883
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:28,934
What's with this kissing on the mouth?

884
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:33,573
- Can 't I kiss my sister-in -law?
- Ain 't a cheek good enough for you?

885
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:38,725
- I don 't even kiss Mom on the mouth.
- You're not supposed to.

886
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,849
That's what I'm talking about.

887
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:48,609
- How's that?
- That looks like something.

888
01:19:51,257 --> 01:19:55,648
Get back. I can 't see nothin '
with your stomach in the way now.

889
01:19:55,777 --> 01:19:59,452
What are you giving me dirty looks for?

890

You're supposed to be a champion.
You eat like there's no tomorrow.

891

Forget how long it took you to get to the title.

892
01:20:07,497 --> 01:20:10,375
You're gonna defend it next month.
Keep eating.

893
01:20:10,497 --> 01:20:14,695
Giving me dirty looks
like I don 't know what I'm talkin ' about.

894
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:19,931
What happened with you and Salvy
at the Copa that time,

895
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:22,525
when you gave him a beating?

896
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:26,616
You mean when I caught his head
in the taxi-cab door?

897
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:29,854
- Yeah.
- I told you about that. Didn 't I?

898
01:20:29,977 --> 01:20:32,047
- No.
- I never told you?

899
01:20:32,177 --> 01:20:34,930
- You never told me.
- It was no big thing.

900
01:20:35,057 --> 01:20:37,252
I smacked him in the mouth.

901
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:41,848
Had to go downtown and straighten it out
with Tommy. It's all forgotten about.

902
01:20:41,977 --> 01:20:47,370
- How come you never told me about it?
- It didn 't have anything to do with you.

903
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:53,367
Had nothin ' to do with me?
Who did it have somethin ' to do with? Vickie?

904
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:58,093
I just explained the whole thing.
It was between me and Salvy.

905
01:20:58,217 --> 01:21:02,972
If it had anything to do with you and Vickie,
I would have told you.

906
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:07,934
- That's not what I heard, Joe.
- What do you mean?

907
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:11,254
That's not what I heard. I heard some things.

908
01:21:11,377 --> 01:21:14,847
- You heard about me and Salvy.
- I heard things, Joey.

909
01:21:14,977 --> 01:21:20,005
- You heard that I cracked Salvy all around.
- I heard some things.

910
01:21:20,137 --> 01:21:22,856
You heard things! Don 't start that worrying shit.

911
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:27,846
Worry about this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

912
01:21:27,977 --> 01:21:29,968
Do that.

913
01:21:32,657 --> 01:21:35,410
Christ.

914
01:21:38,537 --> 01:21:40,767
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

915
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:43,616
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

916
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:47,693
Jack, don 't start your shit. No, really, don 't start.

917
01:21:47,817 --> 01:21:51,526
- I asked you to keep an eye on her.
- I did.

918
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:57,015
- So how come you gave him a beating?
- That didn 't have nothin ' to do with you.

919
01:21:57,137 --> 01:21:59,890
- He thinks he's a wise guy.
- Don 't lie.

920
01:22:00,017 --> 01:22:02,531
- I'm not lying.
- What do I look like?

921
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:05,649
I'm your brother. Don 't you trust me?

922
01:22:05,777 --> 01:22:11,295
No, I don 't trust you when it comes to her.
I don 't trust nobody.

923
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:15,092
- Now, tell me, what happened?
- I told you exactly what happened.

924
01:22:15,217 --> 01:22:22,293
He got out of line, I slapped him around,
Tommy straightened it out and it's all over.

925
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:29,169
You're giving me that look, Joey.

926
01:22:30,777 --> 01:22:33,166
I gotta accept your answer, you know,

927
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:38,815
but if I hear anything, I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

928
01:22:38,937 --> 01:22:43,488
- I'm gonna kill somebody, Joey.
- You're the tough guy. Go kill people!

929
01:22:43,617 --> 01:22:47,895
Kill Vickie, Salvy, Tommy Como.
Kill me while you're at it.

930
01:22:48,017 --> 01:22:51,930
You're killin ' yourself the way you eat,
you fat fuck.

931
01:22:52,057 --> 01:22:54,366
What do you mean, kill you?

932
01:22:54,497 --> 01:23:00,447
Me, kill me. Start here. Do me a fuckin ' favour,
'cause you're drivin ' me crazy.

933
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:05,571
- You're a big shot. Just kill. You're a killer.
- What do you mean by you?

934
01:23:05,697 --> 01:23:10,725
- So? What does that mean?
- Even you don 't know what you meant.

935
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:13,417
- Don 't mean nothin '.
- Joey, that meant somethin '.

936
01:23:13,537 --> 01:23:18,133
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy, you.
You included you with them.

937
01:23:18,257 --> 01:23:22,091
You could have said anybody,
but you said you and them.

938
01:23:22,217 --> 01:23:28,087
You let this girl ruin your life. Know how
fuckin ' nuts you are? Look what she did to you.

939
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:29,969
- You fuck my wife?
- What?

940
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:33,055
You fuck my wife?

941
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:41,371
How could you ask me a question like that?
I'm your brother. You ask me that?

942
01:23:41,497 --> 01:23:45,410
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

943
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:50,490
Just tell me.

944
01:23:53,857 --> 01:23:57,896
I'm not answerin ' you.
I'm not gonna answer that. It's stupid.

945
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,926
You're very smart, Joey.

946
01:24:05,497 --> 01:24:11,094
You've given me all these answers,
but you ain 't given me the right answer.

947
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:13,606
I'm gonna ask you again.

948
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:19,808
- Did you or did you not?

949
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:24,965
It's a sick question,
and I'm not that sick that I'm gonna answer it.

950

- I was at my sister's.

- To the movies.

- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

How come you didn 't tell me about it?
Why didn 't you tell me about it, huh?

962

- I don 't know what you're talking about.
- Why didn 't you tell me?

- All of them. Tommy, Salvy, your brother.

- Yeah, and everybody else on the street.

Vickie, don 't leave, honey. Please.

995
01:29:19,217 --> 01:29:23,813
Honey, look, I'm a bum
without you and the kids. Don 't go.

<i>(murmurs)</i>

997
01:29:43,377 --> 01:29:45,368
Mm?

998
01:30:01,177 --> 01:30:06,809
Less than a minute to go and La Motta
is losing the title he won from Cerdan.

999
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:09,286
After the plane crash that took Cerdan 's life,

1000
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:12,329
Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1001
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:18,134
Tonight he only has to last this 15th round
to be crowned the new middleweight champion.

1002
01:30:18,257 --> 01:30:20,691
La Motta is taking terrible punishment,

1003
01:30:20,817 --> 01:30:25,447
as Dauthuille bangs him
with lefts and rights to the head.

1004
01:30:25,577 --> 01:30:28,933
And La Motta's been playing possum.
He's got Dauthuille hurt.

1005
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:32,845
A right hand to the body,
two left hooks to the jaw.

1006
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:35,127
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring.

1007
01:30:35,257 --> 01:30:38,488
The tide has turned, no question about it.

1008
01:30:40,897 --> 01:30:44,572
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down.

1009
01:30:44,697 --> 01:30:49,168
Dauthuille is down, and the referee
comes over and starts the count.

1010
01:30:49,297 --> 01:30:51,970
He's trying to get up. Six, seven.

1011
01:30:52,097 --> 01:30:55,407
He'll never make it. Nine, ten.

1012
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:59,166
- You're out!
- It is all over. He is knocked out.

1013
01:30:59,297 --> 01:31:02,892
Jake La Motta,
with 13 seconds left in the final round,

1014
01:31:03,017 --> 01:31:06,851
has made one of the most remarkable
comebacks in boxing history.

1015
01:31:13,177 --> 01:31:16,965
Come on.
Just tell him you're sorry, you miss him.

1016
01:31:22,057 --> 01:31:26,448
He's your brother.
You have to talk to him sooner or later.

1017
01:31:32,097 --> 01:31:38,809
I'll dial him for you. Then you talk to him.
Tell him you're sorry, then say what you want.

1018
01:31:38,937 --> 01:31:40,928
Hm?

1019
01:31:49,777 --> 01:31:51,768
- OK.
- OK.

1020
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:06,015
- Champ, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Not now.

1021
01:32:06,137 --> 01:32:09,049
- Excuse me.
- A great angle here...

1022
01:32:09,177 --> 01:32:11,975
- Don 't bother me, please. Get outta here.
- Come on.

1023
01:32:12,097 --> 01:32:15,487

The fight of the year. The next time
that bartender says, "What'll you have?",

1035
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:42,250
give that answer the world gives:
Pabst Blue Ribbon.

1036
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,210
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1037
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:51,568
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1038
01:33:51,697 --> 01:33:57,090
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the middleweight championship.

1039
01:33:57,217 --> 01:34:00,175
La Motta couldn 't score the big one.

1040
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:03,369
That's it. That was the last shot.

1041
01:34:04,577 --> 01:34:07,614
- Round number 13, the hard-luck number.
<i>- (buzzer)</i>

1042
01:34:07,737 --> 01:34:10,854
There's the buzzer,
and you know both the boys.

1043
01:34:21,057 --> 01:34:24,732
Robinson hurting La Motta.
He's hurting him now.

1044
01:34:26,857 --> 01:34:30,008
He has La Motta on Queer Street, holding on.

1045
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:35,416
That was one of the most damaging evidences
of punching you have seen in recent years.

1046
01:34:35,537 --> 01:34:38,449
Come on! Come on, come on!

1047
01:34:38,577 --> 01:34:41,455
Come on! Come on!

1048
01:34:41,577 --> 01:34:44,296
Come on! What are you standing there for?

1049
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:47,090
Robinson, apparently tired,
punched with a fare-thee-well

1050
01:34:47,217 --> 01:34:49,606
and rocked La Motta to his heels.

1051
01:34:49,737 --> 01:34:51,728
Come on, Ray.

1052
01:35:54,377 --> 01:35:58,814
These are clean, whistling shots.
How he can survive them, nobody knows.

1053
01:35:58,937 --> 01:36:01,405
No man can endure this punishment.

1054
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:06,611
The fight is stopped
on a signal from Frankie Sikora.

1055
01:36:06,737 --> 01:36:11,288
Row after row after row from the ring,
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1056
01:36:11,417 --> 01:36:15,968
as he just cannonaded Jake La Motta
into a certain defeat.

1057
01:36:17,017 --> 01:36:21,408
When I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn 't wanna quit. He wanted to go.

1058
01:36:21,537 --> 01:36:25,291
Hey, Ray. I never went down, Ray.

1059
01:36:26,577 --> 01:36:29,045

You realise there are other things in life.

I'm grateful. Boxing's been good to me.

Vickie, Mrs La Motta,
how do you feel about Jake's retirement?

1085

01:40:09,697 --> 01:40:12,006
Vickie? No, she's not here.

1108
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:17,131
By the way, me and my wife Vickie's
gonna celebrate our 11 th wedding anniversary.

- Thank you, thank you.

1110
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:24,090
That reminds me about two friends.
One was married, one was single.

1111
01:40:24,217 --> 01:40:28,005
The married guy tells the single guy,
"What's the matter with you?"

1112
01:40:28,137 --> 01:40:32,289
"Look at me, look at you
and look at me and look at you."

1113

<i>(laughter)</i>

1114
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,688
Let me get out of it.

1115
01:40:37,817 --> 01:40:41,492
"When I come home,
my wife's at the door with a drink,

1116
01:40:41,617 --> 01:40:45,576
then she gives me a nice hot bath,
a nice rub down,

1117
01:40:45,697 --> 01:40:49,246
she makes passionate love to me,
makes me a nice dinner."

1118
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,845
"You ought to try that."

1119
01:40:51,977 --> 01:40:56,653
The other friend says, "That sounds great.
What time's your wife get home?"

1120
01:40:56,777 --> 01:40:58,256
<i>(laughter)</i>

01:41:05,337 --> 01:41:11,128
That the thing ain 't the ring, it's the play

1123
01:41:11,257 --> 01:41:15,296
So give me a stage
Where this bull here can rage

1124
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:20,935
And though I can fight
I'd much rather hear myself recite

Hey, hey. You were just great.
Good thing Sugar Ray wasn 't here tonight.

1128
01:41:59,257 --> 01:42:02,169

- <i>(laughing)</i> Come on.

and his wife.

1131

You shouldn 't be here this week. It's next week
we've got the shakedown payments, right?

1132
01:42:16,097 --> 01:42:19,487
- You got a sense of humour.
- That is a joke, right?

1133
01:42:19,617 --> 01:42:23,769
- Only you know if it's a joke.
- Just kidding, right?

1134
01:42:23,897 --> 01:42:27,810
- We'll talk about it later. This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs Bronson.

1135
01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:30,292
Very pretty lady. Charmed to meet you.

1136
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:34,376
He's really a nice guy.
You can take a joke, can 't you?

1137
01:42:34,497 --> 01:42:39,013
- Oh! Sorry.
- That's all right.

1138
01:42:39,137 --> 01:42:42,607
Hey, Carlo. Carlo.

1139
01:42:42,737 --> 01:42:46,446
Carlo, give them another drink.
Something happened over here.

1140
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,932
- Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1141
01:42:49,057 --> 01:42:51,048
My wife? What's it to you?

1142
01:42:51,177 --> 01:42:54,931
You think I'm gonna let you bums
get involved with her?

1143
01:42:55,057 --> 01:42:59,448
Especially the State's Attorney over here.
He comes here a lot, darling. Watch him.

1144
01:42:59,577 --> 01:43:03,365
He knows I'm only kidding.
Keep an eye on him.

1145
01:43:03,497 --> 01:43:09,015
- What's the problem?
- She doesn 't look 21, so I had to ask for ID.

1146
01:43:09,137 --> 01:43:10,934
- How old are you?
- 21.

1147
01:43:11,057 --> 01:43:14,288
21? Can you prove that you're 21?

1148
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:16,806
- Mm-hm.
- Prove it to me.

1149
01:43:21,697 --> 01:43:26,407
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink in my joint. How old are you?

1150
01:43:26,537 --> 01:43:28,812
- 21.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1151
01:43:28,937 --> 01:43:30,928
- Yeah.
- Prove it to me.

Come here.

She's 21 too?

1154
01:43:46,017 --> 01:43:48,656
She has convinced me that she's 21 too.

Now the whole neighbourhood'll know."

1265
01:52:17,377 --> 01:52:19,095
<i>(some laughter)</i>

1266
01:52:19,217 --> 01:52:23,096
Thanks for laughing.
Spread it around a little bit.

1267
01:52:23,217 --> 01:52:28,416
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner, "Where's the toilet?"

1268
01:52:28,537 --> 01:52:31,005
He said, "You're in it."

1269
01:52:31,137 --> 01:52:35,096
- <i>(man)</i> Let's go.
- Leave me alone. I'm trying to do my routine.

1270
01:52:35,217 --> 01:52:39,574
- Up yours.
- You're gonna force me to make a comeback.

1271
01:52:39,697 --> 01:52:42,894
- Funny.
- Fuck you.

1272
01:52:43,017 --> 01:52:46,487
- And the horse you rode in on.
<i>- (woman laughs)</i>

1273
01:52:46,617 --> 01:52:49,415
- And the whole cavalry behind you.
<i>- (some laughter)</i>

1274
01:52:49,537 --> 01:52:52,415
- <i>(man)</i> Funny man.
- That's why I'm here.

1275
01:52:52,537 --> 01:52:55,290
<i>(some laughter)</i>

1276
01:52:55,417 --> 01:52:58,807
Give him another drink. Piss in it for me.

1277
01:53:00,457 --> 01:53:03,449
I'm gonna introduce
a woman who's made a world tour,

1278
01:53:03,577 --> 01:53:07,206
with top billing and all that bullshit
when they all hated her.

1279
01:53:07,337 --> 01:53:10,966
Give a warm welcome...
I know you're capable of it.

1280
01:53:11,097 --> 01:53:13,770
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1281
01:53:13,897 --> 01:53:17,287
Her name is Emma 48's.

1282
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:20,215
<i>(some applause whooping whistling)</i>

1283
01:53:36,217 --> 01:53:37,616
Taxi!

1284
01:53:38,257 --> 01:53:40,248
Taxi!

1285
01:53:48,817 --> 01:53:55,211
Honey... I'm gonna take a little walk.
I got a couple of things to take care of.

1286
01:53:55,337 --> 01:53:57,726
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah.

1287
01:53:58,697 --> 01:54:01,814
- I'll be home later. All right.
- Thank you.

1288
01:54:01,937 --> 01:54:03,609
Be careful.

1289
01:54:15,337 --> 01:54:17,009
Ho.

1290
01:54:17,137 --> 01:54:19,731
Hey, what are you doin '? Joey.

1291
01:54:23,177 --> 01:54:26,169
Come on, Joey. Why don 't you turn around?

1292
01:54:27,617 --> 01:54:29,608
Huh?

1293
01:54:37,217 --> 01:54:40,414
Come on, Joey. Turn around.
Hey, Joey. Come on.

1294
01:54:44,257 --> 01:54:46,248
Joey.

1295
01:54:48,017 --> 01:54:50,008
Joe.

1296
01:54:53,057 --> 01:54:55,173
- Come on, Joey, wait.
- Huh?

1297
01:54:55,297 --> 01:55:00,371
Come on. What are you gettin ' so angry about?
Come on. Be friends.

1298
01:55:00,497 --> 01:55:03,295
- You're my brother. Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1299
01:55:03,417 --> 01:55:08,411
Yeah, you fuckin ' bum.
Give me a break. Kiss me. Give me a kiss.

1300
01:55:08,537 --> 01:55:11,574
Let me call my wife and kids, let them see.

1301
01:55:11,697 --> 01:55:17,533
Are you gonna forgive and forget?
It was a long time ago. Just give me a kiss.

1302
01:55:17,657 --> 01:55:19,249
Come on.

1303
01:55:19,857 --> 01:55:22,496
Come on. Come on.

1304
01:55:25,337 --> 01:55:27,851
Come on.

1305
01:55:27,977 --> 01:55:30,491
Come on, give me a kiss.

1306
01:55:30,617 --> 01:55:32,926
Huh?

1307
01:55:33,057 --> 01:55:34,934
Come on.

1308
01:55:35,057 --> 01:55:37,093
- How's everything? All right?
- Good.

1309
01:55:37,217 --> 01:55:39,731
Everything all right? Huh?

1310
01:55:39,857 --> 01:55:41,848
Family? Come here.

1311
01:55:45,697 --> 01:55:49,087
- Come on.
- You don 't wanna do this here. Come on.

1312
01:55:49,817 --> 01:55:52,934
- Let me call you. We'll get together.
- You'll call me?

1313
01:55:53,057 --> 01:55:57,369
- I will.
- You won 't forget? Huh?

1314
01:55:57,497 --> 01:55:59,692
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1315
01:56:11,137 --> 01:56:16,450
<i>(Jake)...</i> legitimately, and nobody can
take that away from me, nobody.

1316
01:56:17,697 --> 01:56:20,769
Some people aren 't that lucky,

1317
01:56:20,897 --> 01:56:24,572
like the one that Marlon Brando played
in <i>On The Waterfront</i>

1318
01:56:24,697 --> 01:56:27,575
an up-and-comer
who's now a down -and-outer.

1319
01:56:27,697 --> 01:56:33,613
You remember that scene with his brother,
a small-time racket guy? It went like this.

1320
01:56:36,937 --> 01:56:39,815
"It wasn 't him, Charlie, it was you."

1321
01:56:39,937 --> 01:56:44,374
"You remember that night you said,
'Kid, this ain 't your night."'

1322
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,931
"We're goin ' for the price on Wilson?"'

1323
01:56:47,057 --> 01:56:49,617
"Remember that? This ain 't your night?"

1324
01:56:49,737 --> 01:56:53,855
"My night. I could have
taken Wilson apart that night."

1325
01:56:53,977 --> 01:56:58,607
"What happens? He gets a title shot
in the ballpark. What do I get?"

1326
01:56:58,737 --> 01:57:03,970
"A one-way ticket to Palookaville.
I was never no good after that night, Charlie."

1327
01:57:04,097 --> 01:57:09,376
"It was like a peak you reach
and then it's downhill."

1328
01:57:09,497 --> 01:57:13,775
"It was you, Charlie. You was my brother."

1329
01:57:13,897 --> 01:57:19,255
"You shoulda looked out for me a little bit,
just a little bit."

1330
01:57:19,377 --> 01:57:22,494
"You shoulda taken care of me,

1331
01:57:22,617 --> 01:57:26,610
instead of making me take them dives
for the short-end money."

1332
01:57:26,737 --> 01:57:29,012
"You don 't understand."

1333
01:57:29,137 --> 01:57:32,686
"I could have had class,
I could have been a contender,

1334
01:57:32,817 --> 01:57:37,368
I could have been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am."

1335
01:57:37,497 --> 01:57:42,127
- "Let's face it. It was you, Charlie."
<i>- (door opens)</i>

1336
01:57:42,257 --> 01:57:45,055
- "It was you, Charlie."
- How you doin ', Jake?

1337
01:57:45,177 --> 01:57:47,645
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1338
01:57:47,777 --> 01:57:50,735
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes. Need anything?

1339
01:57:50,857 --> 01:57:53,690
- No.
- You sure?

1340
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:56,012
I'm sure.

1341
01:57:59,057 --> 01:58:02,447
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1342

<i>(door closes)</i>

1343
01:58:21,937 --> 01:58:23,928
Go get 'em, champ.

1344
01:58:32,937 --> 01:58:37,931
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

1345
01:58:42,017 --> 01:58:47,250
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.
