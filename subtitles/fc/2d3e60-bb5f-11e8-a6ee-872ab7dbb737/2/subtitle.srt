1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:06,300
During the war, I captured 10
North Koreans with my bare hands.

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:09,911
Whatever.

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,741
You're the biggest coward
in the world!

4
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:20,049
What? How dare you to talk like
that to your mighty husband!

5
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:26,458
- Mighty husband? That's funny!
- What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:30,760
- Are you gonna hit me? Hit me!
- Shut up!

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,832
C'mon, hit me!

8
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:37,531
I'm really gonna hit you!

9
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:43,136
Are you thinking
about Soon-duk, again?

10
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,576
Why do you always
bring her up?

11
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:51,685
Why do you get so sensitive
whenever I talk about her?

12
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,787
- Stop talking about her!
- Soon-duk!

13
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:54,945
- Shut up!
- Soon-duk!

14
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,217
- I said shut up!
- Soon-duk!

15
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:58,690
- Shut up!
- Soon-duk!

16
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:00,762
- Shut up!!
- Soon-duk!

17
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:13,072
Cops are searching for their car.
We should hear something back soon.

18
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,177
- Please find the car
- we'll try

19
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:26,182
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

20
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:29,990
You don't have to.. Thank you.

21
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:34,219
The sky is like a garden of stars.

22
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,832
Oh, dear.

23
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,693
It's beautiful.

24
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:49,141
Mr. ROH, what do your children do?

25
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,536
My children?

26
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:56,842
This is kinda embarassing but...

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,319
I'm...

28
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,614
still a bachelor.

29
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,658
An innocent bachelor..

30
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:08,163
- Shut up!
- Soon-duk!

31
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,592
- Shut up!!
- Soon-duk!

32
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:11,096
- Shut up!!
- Soon-duk!

33
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,032
- I said shut up!
- Soon-duk!

34
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:17,364
Tell me. How far did
you go with her?

35
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,473
All the way!

36
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:23,078
And we did it anywhere
at anytime!

37
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:26,706
Some days, we did 3 times a day!

38
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,306
I can't sleep.

39
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,852
- You should be embrassed
- Shut up!

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,150
Mr. GOH, have you
ever been to a zoo?

41
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,959
- A zoo?
- Yes.

42
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:43,724
I can't forget that one time when
my mom took me to a zoo.

43
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:50,030
I begged her to take me there

44
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,373
I was so excited.

45
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,401
It was my first
visit to a zoo.

46
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:01,073
I saw tigers, elephants,

47
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:04,409
deer, monkeys, seal and..

48
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,755
What's that bird

49
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:14,793
with big eyes that
stares like this?

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,759
An eagle?

51
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:21,334
No. The one that sits
like this on a tree.

52
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,333
An owl.

53
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,139
No, it's..

54
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:30,371
- Korean wood owl.
- No, that that one

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,843
No, it's 'something-op' owl..

56
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:39,818
Something-op? 'Top?' 'Cop?’

57
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:43,714
No, not 'cop..' 'Hop.. Sop..'

58
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:47,792
Oh! Sop owl!

59
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,961
- Scops owl.
- No, sop owl.

60
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:54,729
It's scops owl. The one with sullen
face that sits on a tree like this.

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,600
It's scops owl?

62
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:03,144
Anyway, it was really cool
seeing a scops owl.

63
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:08,314
Among all the animals,
I liked leopards the best.

64
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,015
There was
a motherless baby leopard..

65
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,586
and he looked so sad.

66
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,491
After looking around for a while,

67
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,685
I told my mom

68
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,230
I wanted some ice cream.

69
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:28,066
She told me to stay where I was
and went to get some ice cream.

70
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:37,937
I waited..

71
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:41,347
for hours and hours..

72
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:45,145
But, even when it started to
get dark, she didn't come back.

73
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:49,852
I looked for her everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

74
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,785
I was so scared, I wanted to cry.

75
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:56,397
But I didn't.

76
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:02,227
Finally, I realized
she wasn't coming back.

77
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,830
You don't know
how much I regretted

78
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:09,443
asking her to
buy me some ice cream.

79
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,382
I didn't really have to eat it.

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,512
I was 7 then.

81
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:29,496
Since that day, I've
forgotten what she looks like.

82
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,535
Maybe it's because I'm dumb.

83
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:36,565
I can't remember at all.

84
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:42,537
I wish I had a picture of her.

85
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:46,610
That's all we talked
about in orphanage.

86
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,986
We had some weird kids there.

87
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:54,584
There was one called Booger.

88
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,421
He picked his nose everyday and he
stuck his boogers everywhere.

89
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,325
Sometimes his nose bled, too.

90
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:03,522
One day, he started to collect
his boogers in a small jar.

91
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:07,463
And after 7 years, the jar filled.

92
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,265
He proudly carried it in his arms
as he walked out of the orphanage.

93
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:14,900
All his boogers in thatjar..
That's why we called him Booger.

94
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:57,648
Thank you for your hospitality.
Thank you, again.

95
00:06:57,753 --> 00:07:01,689
- Were we too loud last night?
- Yes.

96
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,317
No. We slept very well.

97
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:09,324
Stay on that road and
it'll lead you to the village.

98
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:13,965
There, you can catch a bus to
Seoul or make a phone call.

99
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:17,202
And take this.

100
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:22,473
No, we can't accept..
Thank you so much.

101
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:27,242
Thank you.
Thank you.

102
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,350
Bye.

103
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,841
From the back seat,

104
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,501
he took his bandage and..

105
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:03,746
- I'm worried.
- About what?

106
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:08,883
About Hwa-jung?
Don't worry about her.

107
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:13,223
- She doesn't like you anymore.
- Really? That's nice.

108
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,561
- But I'm not talking about her.
- Then, the beauty salon girl?

109
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,124
No. A new one

110
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:24,205
She's a bartender
and she's incredible.

111
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,998
she's...

112
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:30,802
I think you're incredible.

113
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:38,511
She lives like a nameless fish
at the bottom of the ocean

114
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:41,782
Then one day,
she receives a phone call.

115
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,586
No. I think 'a letter' works
better than 'a phone call.'

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,692
- 'A letter' is better!
- Right.

117
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,662
and it zooms in like this..

118
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:44,278
As she takes her last breath
in the midst of snowy mountain,

119
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,445
the dying woman

120
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:51,221
dreams a fading dream.

121
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,223
One fine summer day

122
00:09:55,964 --> 00:10:00,162
a man is watering
his garden with a hose.

123
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,467
Children play gaily underneath

124
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,571
the cool water stream.

125
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,269
From the porch, she watches him
playing with the children,

126
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:16,816
with a gentle smile on her lips.

127
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:23,948
As her spirit prepares herself to
leave her cold body..

128
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,924
she smiles for the last time.

129
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,762
The smile of..

130
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,969
sweet dreams.

131
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,256
- How is it?
- Hot

132
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,294
- How does it taste
- Good

133
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:05,932
This is the only thing
I can cook really well.

134
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:13,769
You hold your chopsticks funny.

135
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:19,413
- I'm fine like this.
- But it looks too weird.

136
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:22,950
You gotta hold it like this..

137
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:26,543
Like this. You try it.

138
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:32,184
No. Don't cross them.
They gotta be parallel.

139
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,090
Forget it. I like my way better

140
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:38,724
I think it's weird if a writer
can't even hold his chopsticks right.

141
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:42,502
Don't worry about it. Just eat.

142
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:46,301
You wanna eat pizza tomorrow?
Do you like pizza?

143
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:49,104
No. Let's eat noodles.

144
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:51,111
Ok

145
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,312
Are you surprised to
see a card on your wall?

146
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,949
Today is my birthday.

147
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:37,992
I'm super excited since
it's my first birthday here.

148
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:40,357
Tonight, I'm throwing a birthday
party at the coffee shop

149
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,089
I hope you'll come.

150
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,396
Birthday party?

151
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,335
Good day, sir?

152
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,231
Nothing special.

153
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:56,944
You're gonna propose to
your girlfriend tonight?

154
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,841
Me? No.

155
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,108
It's obvious!

156
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,476
Look, you even got
champagne and flowers!

157
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,551
It's not what you think.

158
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:13,490
- C'mon. Don't lie.
- Are you embarrassed?

159
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:16,056
We can tell.

160
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:19,861
- It's ok.
- Shut up!

161
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:31,444
Pull up over there.

162
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:33,874
There?

163
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,790
7,900 won, please.

164
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:44,017
What?

165
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,453
7,900 won, please.

166
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:50,198
You picked up 2 other customers
along the way and took a detour.

167
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:54,324
I'm gonna report you in.
What's your cab number?

168
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:56,868
Have some conscience!

169
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,998
How can you charge me
for the full price?

170
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,139
Take 6,000 won

171
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,676
I didn't take a long detour.

172
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,418
Wait!

173
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,451
The bouquet!

174
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:35,275
- I hope you like it.
- Thank you so much.

175
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,144
What is it?

176
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:43,573
- So pretty!
- It's so cute!

177
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:51,023
Mr. GOH, you didn't
bring a gift?

178
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:58,964
Gift?
I got something and..

179
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:05,165
Let me guess. A poem!

180
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:11,870
When I retired from teaching,
he recited a poem for me.

181
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,441
How romantic!

182
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:22,380
That's so cool!

183
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:29,296
gas 23,000 won
groceries 11,000 won

184
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:43,611
Title.. 'Zoo'.. by GOH Seon-guk.

185
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:49,406
Going to a zoo
on a warm spring day

186
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:53,521
The lion,
king of all animals..

187
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,718
and tigers..

188
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,994
and elephants..

189
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:07,395
and giraffes..

190
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,965
and donkeys..

191
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,366
and..

192
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,545
orangutans..

193
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:20,143
chimpanzees...

194
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,282
and panda bears..

195
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,443
and deer are..

196
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:28,914
locked up..

197
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:33,654
in a small cage..

198
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:36,857
with countless scratches.

199
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:45,797
In front of a leopard's cage,
a little girl waits for her mother

200
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,772
eating her ice cream.

201
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:56,811
A motherless leopard
steadily gazes at her.

202
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,653
Soon a leopard and
the girl become friends.

203
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,226
A leopard, who lost his mother

204
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:11,154
in a vast prairie of Africa,

205
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,402
consoles the little girl.

206
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,135
In the darkness of the night,

207
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:21,307
in an empty cage,

208
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:24,776
the two motherless souls

209
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:29,413
welcome the long sleep

210
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,879
of their mothers' wombs,

211
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:39,252
Then, her mother's
voice awakens them.

212
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,228
As the girl bids farewell

213
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:48,431
to her dear leopard, with her
hand in her mother's hand,

214
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:54,264
an escaped scops owl flies
over her head

215
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:58,537
towards a distance sky.

216
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:07,150
Thank you.

217
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,749
That was beautiful.

218
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:33,478
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me much,ﬁ

219
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:39,717
E in the stillness of the night,
when the lilacs fade and fallﬁ

220
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,954
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me muchﬁ

221
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:55,400
ﬂ Please bring me the sweet
smell of lilacﬁ

222
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:04,341
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me much,
my sweet little girlﬁ

223
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:11,845
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me much,
you're my lonely St. Mariaﬁ

224
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:20,253
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me much,ﬁ

225
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:27,359
E in the stillness of the night,
when the lilacs fade and fallﬁ

226
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,502
ﬂ Kiss me, kiss me muchﬁ

227
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:42,816
ﬂ Please bring me the sweet
smell of lilacﬁ

228
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,927
Hwa-jung, it's me.

229
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:39,629
What are you two
doing in my house?

230
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:48,172
Mr. GOH, I was just giving Hee-gu
some advices on his troubles.

231
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:53,144
I thought you a decent boy, but..

232
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:57,077
- Teacher, it's not what you think.
- No. I understand.

233
00:21:57,385 --> 00:22:03,290
It's natural for young kids like
you to like each other. But! why here?

234
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:06,952
Mr. GOH, it's not what you think.

235
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:10,397
Hee-gu likes someone else.

236
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:13,261
Not you?

237
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:17,904
How many girls?
You must be pretty good, huh?

238
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:21,931
Tell me. Who else?

239
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:31,684
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

240
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,354
Hee-gu likes..

241
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:38,356
you.

242
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,578
Done!

243
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,717
- It's finished!
- What's finished?

244
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,812
What? What?

245
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,281
- Where d'you come from?
- Sorry

246
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:47,327
- You scared me
- But, what's finished?

247
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,988
- Nothing. What do you want?
- Me?

248
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:56,331
I need you to come with me.

249
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,741
Hee-gu, you have to stay still.

250
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:05,813
Why do you think
they put this on you?

251
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:12,085
- You have to rest.
- Where is my teacher?

252
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,781
He said he'll come.
Give him a few minutes.

253
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,322
He's really angry, right?

254
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:25,922
No. He worried about you so much.
Don't worry.

255
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,236
Is this ok?

256
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:36,208
Teacher..

257
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,846
How are you?

258
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:46,286
I have to stay here for about 2
months, but I'll be fine.

259
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:52,058
You said you have
something to tell him.

260
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:03,126
Don't worry about me.
I'll be back at work in no time.

261
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:10,240
You know what?

262
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,978
I don't want to
coming back to work.

263
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:16,682
You love me?

264
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:20,114
You make me wanna puke!
You dirty bastard!

265
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:22,588
Mr. GOH..

266
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:25,591
- I'm going.
- But..

267
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,724
- What's wrong with you?
- Hee-gu...

268
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:33,128
You should feel grateful for
being loved. No matter what.

269
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:38,129
- You...
- Mr. GOH, say something.

270
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:48,108
Mr. GOH..

271
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,447
Mr. GOH..

272
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,244
Wait! Can I talk to you?

273
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,787
I have nothing to say about him.
I feel gross.

274
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,723
- Please don't do this.
- Do what?

275
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,453
You're his teacher.

276
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:04,190
Can't you just embrace

277
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:07,400
your student as a teacher?

278
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:09,093
Just this once...

279
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:13,867
I'm not his teacher anymore.
Finished?

280
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:18,007
Mr. GOH!

281
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,646
Why do you have to be so cruel?
Go back and tell him you're sorry.

282
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,181
Why should I?

283
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,319
And stop telling me what to do.

284
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,446
Giving me a story doesn't give
you any right to butt into my life!

285
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,754
Besides, I don't need that crappy
story, anyway. I don't need..

286
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:43,203
You're writing that into a novel?

287
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,563
No.. I mean..

288
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:47,732
Did you lie about
Mr. SHIM's illness?

289
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:50,811
- No.. It's..
- Was it all lie?

290
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:57,111
How can you do this to me?

291
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,748
I really believed you

292
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:04,023
but you lied about everything!

293
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,656
Why?

294
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:08,559
Fine, I lied! I lived my whole
life lying to everyone!

295
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:10,721
But, you're no better than I am.

296
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:15,359
All you do is pour coffee and
seduce men. Dumb and vulgar..

297
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:25,777
Is that what you think of me?

298
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:30,049
Is that really
what you think of me?

299
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,881
I'm not as terrible

300
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,692
as you think I am.

301
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,339
Did you know next week is the
49th Day of your father's death?

302
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:03,676
No. And I don't
really care to know.

303
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,872
You should forgive you father.

304
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,109
He wasn't as a good father

305
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,651
or a good husband

306
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,221
as your portrayal of him
in your book.

307
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:21,591
But I still like him
as who he was.

308
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,823
After how he hurt you?

309
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,901
I lied to you

310
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:33,137
about something.
Do you want to know what?

311
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:35,836
What?

312
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,034
I told you

313
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,510
your grandpa was a pimp, right?

314
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:48,647
And I told you your father slept with
a girl who worked for grandpa.

315
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:52,620
I know. I don't wanna hear it again

316
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:59,059
Well, that girl was...

317
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,060
me.

318
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:19,012
When I was 13,
I was sold by my father

319
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,723
for his gambling debt.

320
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,021
When I first got there,
no one was nice to me.

321
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:36,236
Even the ornamental hairpin

322
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:41,671
which my mom gave me
was taken away from me.

323
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,374
I worked all day long.

324
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,979
It was hard living but
I was grateful for not starving.

325
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,514
When everyone went to bed, I would
sit by the kitchen fireplace and

326
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,021
think about my mom and cry.

327
00:31:02,263 --> 00:31:05,596
That's when I met your father.

328
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:11,363
He was very compassionate
and kind.

329
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,132
He was the only one

330
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,473
who was nice to me.

331
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:44,595
After a year, I was sold
to another household.

332
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:48,939
Whenever life got too difficult,

333
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,870
I thought of your father.

334
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,980
Then in Masan,
I met your father again.

335
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:03,045
It was he
who finally freed me

336
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:06,251
from all the debt.

337
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:11,531
So, how can I ever forget him?

338
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,765
Oh, I have something for you

339
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:26,441
Before he passed away,
he gave that to me.

340
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,741
So I could live rest
of my life comfortably.

341
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,719
But, I don't need it.

342
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:41,985
I'm old and I have no use for
all that money. It's yours.

343
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,898
Think of it as your
father's last gift.

344
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,530
There's one more...

345
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,468
This..

346
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:07,448
Lately I've been seeing
your father in my dreams

347
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:12,983
and I think it's time
for me to go join him.

348
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:17,959
When you meet
a girl you love,

349
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:22,034
give this
ornamental hairpin to her

350
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,696
It's a present from me.

351
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,596
Mom,

352
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,641
stop talking non-sense.

353
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:34,542
You're not gonna die.

354
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,583
You know..

355
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:43,387
when I see your father again,

356
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:48,323
even if he has...

357
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:51,693
another new wife,

358
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:58,837
I'd very much like to
live with him again.

359
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,487
You want some pizza?

360
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:25,557
No, I gotta act more natural..

361
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,830
You like pizza, right?

362
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,570
- Pizza for you!
- Thank you!

363
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:35,866
- Thank you, Mr. GOH!
- You know how I think about you.

364
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,906
Mr. GOH, thank you!

365
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,644
Thank you, thank you!

366
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,450
Hwa-jung.

367
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,321
Hwa-jung.

368
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,001
huh?

369
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:16,012
I'm sorry for
not saying 'goodbye'.

370
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,744
I appreciate
all your kindness.

371
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,855
Goodbye. Hwa-jung.

372
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:29,153
Hi. What brings
you here at this hour?

373
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,264
Where is Hwa-jung?

374
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:34,228
She's gone.

375
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:37,303
You didn't see her?

376
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:42,137
- To where?
- To Namwon. Why?

377
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:44,276
It's just...

378
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:49,144
She didn't clean up the room
before she left.

379
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:53,112
But, anyways..

380
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:06,155
Waiting at the Zoo

381
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,628
When the warm spring breeze starts
to blow in Serengeti Park,

382
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:11,594
all the wild animals
begin to emerge

383
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,200
from their winter hideouts.

384
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:17,428
Winter in Africa doesn't get too
cold. However, to all animals,

385
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:22,475
there's nothing more delightful than
a tickle of warm spring breeze.

386
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:25,038
With arrival of spring,

387
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,239
animals start their search for
their partners.

388
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:31,749
The mating season
starts in full swing.

389
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:37,150
This massive male hippopotamus
have found his female partner.

390
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:41,027
Giraffes, known as the gentlemen
of Serengeti, are not exceptions.

391
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:46,189
It's delightful to see greetings
from baby giraffes.

392
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:50,870
Even an orangutan, the lord of the
jungle, has found his female partner.

393
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:56,006
This is the season of love
for all animals.

394
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,801
However,
there are always exceptions.

395
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:03,348
Leopards don't have specific
mating season.

396
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,549
This lonely leopard is Amur
Leopard.

397
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:09,349
Unlike other African animals,

398
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,686
who travel and live in groups,

399
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,091
he takes pleasure in solitude.

400
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:21,565
He also wants a partner, but
he's not ready for one, yet.

401
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,910
What are you doing here?

402
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:39,745
- I can't go through with this.
- What?

403
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:44,649
You only got 30 min.
till the wedding!

404
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,017
Did you..?

405
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:49,152
I didn't know at first

406
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:53,563
but more I see her
I want to be with her.

407
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,330
You'll forget her
when you get married.

408
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:03,470
When you don't see her
you'll forget her.

409
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,170
But I can't not see her.

410
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,406
Who is she?

411
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,641
Jin-sook..

412
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,886
She's my wife's sister.

413
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:17,721
You understand me, right?

414
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,319
You're a piece of shit!

415
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,454
You don't deserve to love anyone!

416
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,428
Get your hands off me!

417
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,535
You don't deserve to be in love!

418
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,068
Do whatever you want!

419
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:35,141
Love may come easy to you,
but if you can't keep it,

420
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,177
it's meaningless.

421
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,234
What the hell do you
know about love?

422
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:42,146
You've never been
in love your self

423
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,147
I know.

424
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:51,982
I know the feeling

425
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,453
of not being able
to sleep at night and

426
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:58,358
spending the whole day

427
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,100
doing nothing because..

428
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:04,798
because I can't stop
thinking about her.

429
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:07,006
I know now.

430
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:12,544
You fell in love.

431
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:36,660
1, 2, 1, 2, Good! Good!

432
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,399
Hello.

433
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,608
How's your leg?

434
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:47,074
Good

435
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:51,214
This is my boyfriend.

436
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,917
How do you do?

437
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:58,520
You guys look good together.

438
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:02,519
How's Hwa-jung?

439
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,162
Good..

440
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,135
- Hi
- Hello

441
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:26,809
Waiting at the Zoo

442
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:01,650
- Hwa-jung
- Huh

443
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,450
- Another delivery.
- Again?

444
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:04,819
- Yeah
- To where?

445
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,550
Kwanghanroo, near the gazebo.

446
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:10,095
I don't know why anyone would
order coffee from there.

447
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,822
That's ok. I'll go.

448
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,294
- Bye
- Bye

449
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:22,468
Pretty cool, huh?

450
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:26,309
Hundreds of years ago, on
a fine spring day like today,

451
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:30,577
Mongryong sees
Chunhyang on this swing

452
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,677
and fall in love with her.

453
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:38,084
They endure much
suffering and pain,

454
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:45,565
but they let it blossom.

455
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:48,632
My heart aches just thinking
about them.

456
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,836
Doesn't yours?

457
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,365
Blossom what?

458
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:56,770
Their love!

459
00:42:57,177 --> 00:43:03,741
Mongryong sees Chunhyang
from that gazebo over there.

460
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,613
The gazebo is called Kwanghanroo.

461
00:43:07,053 --> 00:43:09,920
Shall we go over there?

462
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:19,397
I'm here

463
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:22,034
but nobody ordered coffee.

464
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:23,563
Alright.

465
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:27,430
I'm going back.

466
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,617
You look

467
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,957
just like someone I know.

468
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,157
Except for the bear.

469
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:59,063
Hwa-jung, it's me. GOH Seon-guk.

470
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,271
I ordered the coffee.

471
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:02,873
Mr. GOH?

472
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:06,806
What are you doing here?

473
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,614
And what's up with your beard?

474
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,650
Well.. I got lazy

475
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,917
and didn't want to shave..
I was bored and

476
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:24,190
just came out to
get some fresh air..

477
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:28,833
What's that? Wasn't the mole on
the other side?

478
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,568
Huh?

479
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:35,135
I put it on this side,
today. It's removable.

480
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:40,006
Depending on my mood, I put
it on different spots.

481
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:45,640
I see.

482
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,451
Are you...

483
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:56,585
Still really mad at me?

484
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:02,826
No. It's ok now.

485
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,196
I'm thinking

486
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:10,940
about starting a new novel..

487
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:15,911
and can we write it together?
Like the last time?

488
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,010
Your name will be on the cover.

489
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:27,989
If you don't want to, then it's ok.

490
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:32,631
Oh...

491
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:37,099
This is for you.

492
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:39,237
What is it?

493
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,216
My mom got this from her mother and

494
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,826
she wants me to

495
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,029
give it to you.

496
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,105
Are.. you..

497
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:23,178
proposing to me?

498
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:24,645
Well..

499
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:29,986
It's not.. I mean..

500
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:34,020
I went to see my mom and..

501
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:38,163
since I don't have a girlfriend..

502
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:42,959
you know I don't have
women at all...

503
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:46,405
I don't know any women and..

504
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,766
We're close,

505
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:51,876
$0..

506
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,142
What are you watching?

507
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:02,153
That man

508
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:08,089
is about to propose to her.

509
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:11,262
That's so romantic!

510
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:14,798
That man is about to
propose to that woman.

511
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:23,439
Even a pizza is too big
to order when you're alone.

512
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:32,317
Should we go somewhere else?

513
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:38,281
Well..

514
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:41,059
You can do it!

515
00:47:42,629 --> 00:47:45,427
He said, you can do it!

516
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:51,465
He said, you can do it.

517
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,309
To be honest with you,

518
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,408
well..

519
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:03,609
Honestly...

520
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:09,550
I didn't think much of you
when we first met.

521
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:14,689
But, more I got to know you..

522
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:16,353
I became...

523
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:17,453
Do your best!

524
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,828
Till the end!

525
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,196
He said, do your best
till the end!

526
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:37,546
You can do it!
You can do it!...

527
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:44,817
I like..

528
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:47,017
I like you.

529
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:52,396
What?

530
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,865
I can't hear you.

531
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:02,070
I really like you.

532
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:06,204
And I can't live without you.

533
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:13,482
Me, too.

534
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:16,646
I need you

535
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:26,196
And I can't live
