No Litter!

10
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,429
You bastard! That trash!!

11
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,441
You little shithead!

12
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,174
It said 'No Litter'!!

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,080
You human trash! Stop!

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,367
You're so dead.

15
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,210
What are you doing up there?

16
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,511
Me? I'm waiting for someone..

Written & Directed by JANG Hang-joon

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,642
He should be here soon..

19
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:38,046
After a good lap around my
neighborhood..

20
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,686
- I feel incredibly refreshed.
- I see.

21
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,024
Now, let's talk some more
about your work.

22
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,190
Your latest work
<Father's Love>

23
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,528
is a masterpiece.

24
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,567
I brought it with me and,

25
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,866
I must say the cover
is simply beautiful.

26
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,569
It's a photo of your late father
with your mother

27
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,542
They look lovely together.

28
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,548
How was your husband's funeral?

29
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:20,056
He broke my heart again and again,
but, none of that matters now.

30
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,858
My father? Well..

31
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,506
He was a child prodigy.

32
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,538
He finished '1000 Characters Text' by
age 5 and 7 Chinese Classics' by age 10.

33
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,908
His father was a scholar
of Chinese Classics.

34
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,810
Chinese Classics scholar my ass!

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,581
His father was a pimp.

36
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:52,731
And, even as a kid,
he had no interest in studying.

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,733
He only liked girls.

38
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,860
When he was 14..

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,565
he did it with a young maid
who worked at his house.

40
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:09,310
I was told he never had
any interest in women.

41
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,413
He was an unsusceptible man
towards women.

42
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,221
I guess I'm like
my father in that way.

43
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,649
He was a hard worker.

44
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,493
He studied all his life
to go to university.

45
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,193
When he was finally admitted

46
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,666
he only slept couple hours
a night to study even more.

47
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,033
He never studied!

48
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,576
His father's pimp money

49
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,840
was his entrance ticket.

50
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,883
And, of course,

51
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,278
he had no interest in education.
He was too busy getting laid.

52
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,117
When did you find out about
his other family?

53
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,685
When Seon-guk was 2

54
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,928
we went to
visit him in Seoul.

55
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,465
And there he was with his
4 other children.

56
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,561
- Bastard!
- He'll go to hell.

57
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,605
But, for some reason..

58
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,674
he really liked spring.

59
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,347
In the winter,
he'd never go outside.

60
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,951
But, when the warm spring breeze
starts to blow,

61
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,181
he'd go out and wander around

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,525
like a person under a spell.

63
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,364
SPRING BREEZE

64
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,851
Damn it!

65
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,815
- Teacher
- What?

66
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,259
Can we turn on the heater?
It's freezing today.

67
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,500
You didn't wear your thermals?

68
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,729
No.

69
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,840
Do you pay for the heating?
I told you to wear your thermals.

70
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,776
Oh, teacher

72
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,615
- Now what?
- You have to call the publisher.

73
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,312
Ok.

74
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,482
He said, if you don't submit the
manuscript by this month..

75
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,356
I heard you!

76
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,930
The new tenant is moving in today.

77
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,261
- New tenant?
- Yes.

78
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,894
I didn't rent out any rooms.

79
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,873
Is GOH Ki-nam your father?

80
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,399
Yes.

81
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,140
He signed a contract through
our real estate agency.

82
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,413
You see that registered seal?

83
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,912
The contract is legit.

84
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,556
I think the house is too big
for just one person.

85
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:18,034
You should hide your
registered seal somewhere safe.

86
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,537
So, who's moving in?

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,948
Here she comes.

88
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,235
This is your landlord.

89
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,873
Hi. I'm Hwa-jung.

90
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,102
It's very nice
to meet you.

91
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,303
Hello.

92
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,878
A respected man like myself

93
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,744
can't live with
a vulgar woman like her.

94
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,349
Tell her to look for another place.

95
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,745
- I can't.
- Why not?

96
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,682
Your father already
took the lease deposit.

97
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,259
Lease deposit?
How much?

98
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,258
30 million won.

99
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,522
30 million!

100
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,064
This is the room, right?

101
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,297
What the...

102
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:34,168
Excuse me. But, you didn't vacate
the 2nd floor room.

103
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,041
- The 2nd floor room?
- Yeah

104
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:40,084
That's the room I rented.
Please vacate it for me.

105
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,882
God damn it!

106
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:50,985
Wow!
This room can be rented out.

107
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,993
Dad, why are you doing this?

108
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:06,407
Male elephants start mating when
they're 10 years old.

109
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:12,115
For Asian elephants, the mating
season lasts for a month per year.

110
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:18,055
After only a few days with their
female partners, the mating ends.

111
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,724
Yes, she's got the contract
and the receipt.

112
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,061
No, he signed it when he was
alive and took the deposit.

113
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm not talking about me.

114
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,839
- I'll get it.
- Why would I lie about that?

115
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,837
So, is there a way or not?
Can he kick her out?

116
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,577
What?

117
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,806
- Welcome!
- Nice house!

118
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,313
Bye.

119
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,051
What are those?

120
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,056
Oh! Come and
say hi to my landlord.

121
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:08,740
Mr. GOH,
am I interrupting you?

122
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:13,140
My friends are here for a housewarming
party and they want to say hi.

123
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,873
They don't have to..

124
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,384
Everyone! This is my landlord and
that's Hee-gu.

125
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,319
- Hello!
- Hi!

126
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,620
- Your landlord is very handsome.
- He's exactly my type!

127
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,992
- You're so lucky!
- The one with glasses is so cute!

128
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,089
Look at him smile!

129
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:43,933
Go and tell those dumb vulgar
species to be quiet.

130
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,508
- OthenNise, get out of my house!
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,716
Who is that?

132
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,886
- Hee-gu!
- May I speak with you?

133
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,551
Sure. Come in

134
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,665
- Wait.. First, have a drink with us!
- C'mon. Just one drink.

135
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,292
No. I'mjust gonna..

136
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,168
What the hell happened to him?
Why is it getting louder?

137
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,210
"Clap your hands and sing"

138
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,249
"Everyone look this way!
Shake your body"

139
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,251
- "Champion"
- "Scream your head off"

140
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,218
- "Champion"
- "Let the music take over you"

141
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,021
- "Champion"
- "You! You! You! You! Champion"

142
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,031
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,305
Can I talk to you for a sec?

144
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,472
Me? Ok
I'll be right back.

145
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,339
I'm coming.

146
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,414
- What's up?
- Let me ask you for a favor.

147
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,389
- Sure.
- I have to work. So, can you be quiet?

148
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,086
What do you do?

149
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,127
none of your business. If you
wanna drink, drink quietly or go out

150
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,827
Alright. We'll go out then.

151
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:22,299
Can Hee-gu come with us?

152
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,340
Go. Go

153
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,775
and get wasted with this
coffee shop girl. Ok?

154
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:32,614
How did you know I work
at a coffee shop?

155
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,852
Isn't that obvious?

156
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,122
- Wow! You really can drink!
- Thank you.

157
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,991
When I'm in my top condition,
I can easily finish 12 bottles.

158
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,870
Uhm..
What's Mr. GOH like?

159
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,677
- My teacher?
- Yes.

160
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,944
He's a bastard. Bastard!

161
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,242
A real mean bastard.

162
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,948
He's got no friend
and no cell phone.

163
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,090
He still uses a beeper.

164
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,157
He says his work is all that
matters in his life,

165
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,627
but I don't think so.
He likes money! Money!

166
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,067
Fuck you, GOH Seon-guk!

167
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,700
What does he do?

168
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,845
- He writes..
- Writes? He's a writer?

169
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,454
- How did you know?
- You just said he writes.

170
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,286
Wow. That's totally cool!

171
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,691
- What kind of stories?
- A novel.

172
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,958
Right now, he's writing a love story
but it's not going well.

173
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,567
A love story?

174
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,362
That's my specialty.

175
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,434
That's what I know the best.

176
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,678
Talking about love stories..

177
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,644
do you wanna hear
a killer love story?

178
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,154
Damn it's hot!

179
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,030
Shit!

180
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,406
Who turned on the heater?

181
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,145
Is she out of her mind?

182
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,621
Good morning.

183
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,727
- Did you turn this on?
- Yes. I did.

184
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,357
Who said you could
turn on the heater?

185
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,201
No one did. I just turned
it on because it was cold.

186
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,864
I get cold easily.

187
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,643
What's up there?

188
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,047
Uh.. nothing.

189
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,616
Just don't ever
turn it on again.

190
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,319
Why not?

191
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,320
Because it's broken. Broken!

192
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,656
- If you're cold, wear thermals.
- I think it works fine

193
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,194
You don't believe me?

194
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,069
Hello? Hi.

195
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,704
Our heating system broke
No, it doesn't work.

196
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,070
Yes. My address is..

197
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,145
This is broken, too.

198
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,276
I just got it fixed but..

199
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,981
Don't use the phone
or the heater!

200
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:14,798
ﬁCome and talk to meﬁ

201
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,977

- You're super pretty!
- Super thanks!

212
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,924
Bye.

213
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,706
Forget Me Not Coffee Shop

214
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,351
What's the next question?

215
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,917
Question #7, across..

216
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:41,557
- Author of "Gone with the Wind."
- I know this one.

217
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,761
What's her name..
What's her name..

218
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,796
Wait.. Maybe it's Clark Gable.

219
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,402
- Which one?
- I'm not sure..

220
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,761
It is her....

221
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,065
Ah! She's the one who tells
the story, so.. Vivien Leigh.

222
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,871
Wow. You are so smart!

223
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,843
Vivien.. Leigh..

224
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,607
How about this one?

225
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,449
Something-egg.
Type of cooked egg.

226
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,486
- 'Fried' egg?
- No. I don't think that's right.

227
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,695
It's gotta be
more difficult word.

228
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,323
How about 'sunny side up?'

229
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,101
- Isn't it 'scrambled?'
- 'Scrambled..?'

230
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,898
Right! Ithink
that's the right answer!

231
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,405
'Scrambled.'

232
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,237
Wait.. The ruler of Catholic Church
is 'Pope', right?

233
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,944
Then it has to start with 'P.'

234
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,516
P?’ Word that Starts with 'P'?

235
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,846
Po.. Pa.. Pu..

236
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,395
hey

237
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,497
Hi.

238
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,326
Hi.

239
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,827
Are you also here to report
your new address?

240
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,575
- Rice
- Rice?

241
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,742
We came here to receive rice.

242
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,819
I see.

243
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,218
Is he your brother?

244
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,126
Did you eat?

245
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,175
Eat as much as you want.

246
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:42,302
Come by whenever
you're hungry. Ok?

247
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,281
Can we come
with our grandma?

248
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:51,555
Grandma?
Of course.

249
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,122
Hi, Mr. GOH!

250
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,727
Kids, say hello to Mr. GOH.
He's my housemate.

251
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,065
Hello.

252
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,497
Who are they?

253
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,106
They're my new friends.

254
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,566
Eat. I got plenty of food. Eat.

255
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,938
So, what's your problem?

256
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:23,578
I..
I met someone.

257
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,349
Again?

258
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,087
There's this new beauty salon.

259
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,356
I went there to get a hair cut..

260
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:39,670
and that's how I met her.
It must've been fate..

261
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,802
Teacher, he's ready.

262
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,812
Hello.

263
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:07,196
She started to gently caress my
hair with her long slender fingers.

264
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:12,330
Every living cell in my body was
being awakened from a long sleep

265
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,365
In my head, they were celebrating

266
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,967
their freedom from
the monotonous cycle of life!

267
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,069
Pow! Pow!

268
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,483
After the most ecstatic experience
of my life, as I was about to leave,

269
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,583
she said to me with
her sweet voice,

270
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,416
Come again.

271
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,758
And I said to her,

272
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,600
Yes. I'll be back.

273
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,535
You're pitiful.

274
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,642
My heart is still pounding..

275
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,776
- So, did you go back?
- Yup.

276
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,143
I dyed my hair black today.

277
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,082
Do you like it?

278
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,617
No

279
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,117
What did the publisher say?

280
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,925
He's really pissed
about the delay.

281
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,490
Why don't you return
the advance payment?

282
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:16,063
I already used it
to build my house.

283
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,769
The only source of income I have
is to finish this book.

284
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,771
Or a sudden rise in sale of
<Father's Love>.

285
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,642
- Can I use your phone
- Still using a beeper?

286
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,546
You're so cheap. Get yourself
a cell phone, will you?

287
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,281
Give it.

288
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,591
Nobody uses a beeper anymore.

289
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,451
No, there are 180,000 beeper users
in this country.

290
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,995
180,000!!

291
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,930
Hello, sir?
No

292
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:54,630
I wasn't yelling at you.
I swear I wasn't yelling.. No, sir.

293
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,444
So why didn't you deliver
it on time?

294
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,946
What?

295
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,050
I said 'by 9 o'clock!'

296
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,521
You delivered it
at 10 o'clock!

297
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,193
Why did you do that? I didn't say
'by 10 o'clock!

298
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,628
What? What did you say to me?

299
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,870
I'm your customer, asshole!

300
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,440
I want to talk to your boss!

301
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,169
Put him on the phone, now!

302
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,537
Please may I speak to your boss?

303
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,812
I'll speak to him directly.

304
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,545
Hello?

305
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,886
If you keep doing business like this
I'm gonna kick your ass!

306
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,262
What?

307
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,090
You want a piece of me?!

308
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,716
UFO!

309
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,492
Look! UFO!

310
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,060
- Get him!
- Get him! Get him!

311
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,521
He's here!

312
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,911
- did you say you were in a track team?
- Shut up.

313
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,345
He was too fast.

314
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,719
- You lost him?
- Yes.

315
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,815
- Sir, going to see the publisher?
- Yeah.

316
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,281
Aren't you gonna take your car?

317
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,749
Are you gonna pay for the gasoline?
Did you wear your thermals?

318
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,924
- You're not cold, right?
- No, sir.

319
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,495
It's a story I heard.

320
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,427
I thought it was
quite interesting.

321
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,565
Please take a look at it.

322
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,898
Wasn't it supposed to be
finished by last October?

323
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,199
It's already February.

324
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,601
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,545
That's not what I want to hear.

326
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,114
How much of it is finished?

327
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,649
It's almost done.
I'm very sorry.

328
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,553
I said, that's not
what I want to hear.

329
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,655
You're really
pushing me this time.

330
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,862
I'm really sorry.

331
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,391
I said stop saying that.

332
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,568
I even gave you the advance
payment like you asked.

333
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,333
Don't you feel
guilty about that?

334
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,941
If I were you, I would finish the
book as quickly as I can.

335
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,236
I'm sorry.

336
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,838
- Damn it! I said stop saying that.
- Then, what should I say?

337
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,816
You made me feel like shit and I
can't even say I'm sorry?

338
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,182
- Should I say 'thank you' instead?
- You're crazy!

339
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,986
Yes, I'm crazy! I'm so fucking
sorry that I went crazy!

340
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,218
I'm crazy! So what! What!!

341
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,024
Crazy bastard!

342
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,099
You don't feel sorry at all!
Look at yourself!!

343
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,136
You said don't say 'I'm sorry!'

344
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,736
Finish it by this month or return
the advance, plus the penalty fee.

345
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,739
Or else, they'll sue me.

346
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,210
Why did you act like that to him?

347
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,544
You don't wanna mess with him.

348
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:45,687
- How much of it is finished?
- Let's talk about something else.

349
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,458
What's going on with
that beauty salon girl?

350
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,955
I was just there today.

351
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,096
I can't stop
thinking about her.

352
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,332
You know..
love is like hair.

353
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:03,504
Even though you cut it,
it keeps growing and growing.

354
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,410
Shut up.

355
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,044
Just out of my curiosity,

356
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,514
what happened with that stalker?

357
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,987
- Who? Yong-shik?
- No, not him. The one from Chunan.

358
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,094
- Soo-chun?
- No, not that crazy bastard.

359
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,993
Sang-won?

360
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:31,568
Last girlfriend I had was..

361
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,236
During '88 Seoul Olympic.

362
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,434
- 1988? During JEON administration?
- No. During ROH administration.

363
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,647
- Why?
- she nagged me to go to the closing day

364
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,250
Before that?

365
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:54,188
No.. The one who lived with you in
that house with blue front door.

366
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,193
The one with hair like this..

367
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:00,229
- Oh, Hyun-doo!
- Yes, him!

368
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,356
Are you serious?

369
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,535
While the political
power changed 4 times,

370
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,502
you've only had 1 girlfriend?

371
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:12,006
You gotta have at least one for
every new administration.

372
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:16,305
Tell me the truth. Have you ever had
a sleepless night because of a woman?

373
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,946
- No.
- And you're writing a love story?

374
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,753
Why not?

375
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:27,955
Love is all fiction.

376
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:33,356
- I told you to buy more beer.
- I didn't think we'd run out.

377
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,193
Is the heater really broken?

378
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,327
That's what he said.

379
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,642
Can I help you?

380
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,714
Isn't this the residence of Mr. GOH?

381
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,085
Yes. But he's not here.

382
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,158
I see.

383
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,993
May I ask who you are?

384
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,428
I'm Hwa-jung.
I moved into the 2nd floor.

385
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,434
- And she's my super close friend.
- I see.

386
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,695
We are writer buddies of
Mr. GOH.

387
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,633
We dropped by for a drink with him.

388
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,977
Would you ladies like to join us?

389
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,478
Of course!

390
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,282
What are you doing? We shouldn't..

391
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,497
Hello? Yes, sir.

392
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,168
How do you do?
Mr. GOH?

393
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,995
His beeper doesn't work
here in the basement.

394
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,070
He's right here with me

395
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,038
Hold on.

396
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,746
It's the publisher.

397
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,714
- Asshole...
- Hello, sir.

398
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:03,084
I apologize about
this afternoon.

399
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:08,486
No, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

400
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,752
Yes. Sure..

401
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:16,223
Why didn't you tell me about that
amazing story when you came by?

402
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,099
Excuse me?

403
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,703
Passionate but
corrupted love!

404
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,906
It sucked me in
from the beginning.

405
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,239
So, what happens next?
Everyone wants to know.

406
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,678
What do you mean..

407
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:36,810
That synopsis you left in our office.

408
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,347
The synopsis?

409
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,186
It's a story I heard.
I thought it was quite interesting.

410
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,091
Please take a look at it.

411
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,593
Fine! Take it! Take it all!

412
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,266
This is going to be
the next bestseller!

413
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,745
Thank you. You're too kind.
I get behind schedule a bit,

414
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,977
but you know I deliver the goods.
Where are you now?

415
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,822
At the office?

416
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,030
Thank you!

417
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,946
Mr. GOH, you're home!

418
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,621
Have a seat.

419
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,719
- For our trip to Daeguanryung!
- Cheers!

420
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,662
Daeguanryung?

421
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,162
Oh, we forgot to tell you.

422
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:36,830
A week after next week, we're going
to the Daeguanryung farm. All of us.

423
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,774
- How about you?
- Sure. I guess..

424
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,343
Let's drink a toast, again!

425
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:51,111
- For Daeguanryung trip!
- Cheers!

426
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,092
Teacher, are you awake?

427
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,600
The story..
Did you come up with it?

428
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,472
It's Hwa-jung's story.

429
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,138
- What?
- Hwa-jung made it up.

430
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,578
Did you read it? Isn't it good?

431
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,617
She didn't tell me the whole story.
Should I ask her for the rest?

432
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,956
- No, don't.
- No?

433
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,383
Don't!

434
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,627
Yes, sir.

435
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,162
I'll get your breakfast ready.

436
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,527
That can't be.

437
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,695
She's only a dumb coffee shop girl.

438
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,106
This can't be! She's
stupid and vulgar and..

439
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,138
Then what am I? I'm a writer.
A writer!!

440
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,041
Impossible!!

441
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,317
I think your PR really worked.

442
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,889
- It's been full house since this morning.
- Really?

443
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,587
Our comrades from
last night are here, too.

444
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:41,993
- Hi!
- hi

445
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,226
- How are you this morning?
- Very well.

446
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,569
I came for a cup of coffee with
someone special..

447
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,409
Oh my....

448
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:18,061
- Get me a cup of coffee
- Yes, sir.

449
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,430
Did you put in sugar?

450
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,733
Why didn't you knock?

451
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,234
Get me green tea! Green tea!

452
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,149
Did you read it?

453
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,584
What do you think?

454
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,281
Congratulations.

455
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,226
Conventionality
and corruption.

456
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,993
Modern but classic!
Heartwarming! It's great!

457
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,730
You gotta tell me
what happens next.

458
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,068
So what happens?
What happens?

459
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,735
Well..

460
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,784
Is Hwa-jung home?

461
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:47,623
- No. Why?
- Then can you help us?

462
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,418
- Why should I?
- Our grandma..

463
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,598
She passed away.

464
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,311
Grandma..

465
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,430
She's alive!!

466
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,199
Grandma!

467
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,438
Call the ambulance!
What's wrong with your phone?

468
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,077
Our phone line is disconnected.

469
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,808
Can we use your cell phone?

470
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,214
I don't have a cell phone.

471
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,110
Please.. Help me..

472
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,806
She fainted due to
malnutrition.

473
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,215
Fortunately,

474
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,414
she doesn't have any major illnesses.
She'll recover by tonight.

475
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,783
Okay

476
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,058
Are you her guardian?

477
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,124
What? How much?

478
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,827
We're sorry but she doesn't
have a health insurance.

479
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,339
Wait

480
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,674
You heard, right?

481
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,714
That's a lot of money for me.

482
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,311
You have to pay me back. Ok?

483
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,617
Ok

484
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:05,017
You promised. And with interest
would be even better.

485
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,694
Alright

486
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,357
- Sir..
- What?

487
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,627
I'm hungry.

488
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:23,372
The worst kind of people are those
who never pay back what they owe.

489
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,450
You don't wanna be like those
people, right?

490
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,878
- Hey, guys
- Hwa-jung!

491
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,452
Hwa-jung!

492
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,460
I can't get pass this part.

493
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,439
What?

494
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,735
It was nice what you did today.

495
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,974
Me?

496
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,307
Oh, that. They'll pay me back.

497
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,881
I'm kinda busy. Do you mind?

498
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,358
Oh, sorry.

499
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,098
- Wait!
- Yes?

500
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,832
About that story you told Hee-gu..

501
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:27,634
- The one with a woman drowning..
- What about it?

502
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,177
I'm curious what happens next.
Can you tell me the rest?

503
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,078
Sure.

504
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,680
But, why?

505
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:42,319
Are you gonna write
that into a novel?

506
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,431
My story will get published?

507
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,634
For real?

508
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,201
You know my writer buddy Mr. SHIM?

509
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,776
Of course.

510
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,679
He wants to make it into a novel.
So he asked me to

511
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,049
get the rest of
the story and tell him.

512
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:17,385
Why didn't he ask me?

513
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,527
He's little shy.

514
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,626
I see.

515
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,037
So, can you tell me

516
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,638
the rest of the story?

517
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,966
- Completely.
- Completely?

518
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:36,271
Ok. I haven't thought
about the ending, yet

519
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,108
But I can try.

520
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,742
When she turns her head

521
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:47,317
she sees him sitting in a bus,
right across from her bus.

522
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:53,562
She's so happy to see him.
And as she's about to get off,

523
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,866
the bus leaves.

524
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,494
Why didn't I think of that?

525
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,162
The handkerchief that holds the
fragrance of his mother..

526
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,741
- Wait.
- of his mother.. And?

527
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,101
He starts to run.
And keeps running.

528
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:13,906
Crashing into every obstacle
that lies in front of him..

529
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,944
Then he sees the light.

530
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,554
How long has it been since he last
saw the light? His eyes glisten.

531
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,954
It's great.

532
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,093
I guess you'll really
finish it by this month.

533
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,762
Ithink so.

534
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,562
Hey, join me at Hwa-jung's coffee
shop. I'm going there right now.

535
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,100
- Why?
- Just to kill time.

536
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:43,305
No. I'll pass. I need to rest.
I pulled all nighter last night.

537
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,646
Ok. Bye.

538
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:05,927
Hey, join me at Hwa-jung's coffee
shop. I'm going there right now.

539
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:11,174
What? He used me to get
the story from you?

540
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:15,301
Yes! I can't believe he lied!

541
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,615
Liar! Liar! Liar!!

542
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,510
No!

543
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,719
Hello? Where are you?

544
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,689
- I'm almost there.
- No!

545
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,621
What's wrong?

546
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,456
- Just come to my place.
- Why?

547
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,928
- It's urgent!
- What's wrong with you?

548
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,599
You come out.
I'm almost there.

549
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,940
Just stay there and
don't talk to anybody!

550
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,597
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

551
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,969
- What?
- It's just that

552
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,536
You could've asked me directly. You
didn't have to go through Mr. GOH.

553
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:01,344
Mr. GOH?
What about Mr. GOH?

554
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,587
Move, Move!
Get outta the way!

555
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,882
About the story.

556
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,488
You mean the one
Mr. GOH's writing?

557
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:20,496
- No, the one you're..
- No!

558
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:36,180
What's up with your hair?

559
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,078
Mousse.

560
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,491
I need to talk to you..

561
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,992
- Why don't we talk here?
- Yes. Stay.

562
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:54,501
What? Hwa-jung likes me?
She said that?

563
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,166
Her boyfriend is in prison.

564
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,142
In prison?

565
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:04,714
When he gets out next month,
he's gonna come after you.

566
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,074
Why me?

567
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,913
He's jealousy incarnate.

568
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,714
Imagine what he'd do when
he finds out

569
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,255
that the love of his life has
betrayed him?

570
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,892
Would he hurt her?

571
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,756
No. He'll kill you first.

572
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:26,803
Avoid being seen
with her anywhere.

573
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,901
That is the only way
you'll live!

574
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,435
Did I seem little strange
this afternoon?

575
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:38,103
Yes. You looked like a lunatic.

576
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,842
I couldn't tell you, but..

577
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:49,583
Yesterday, I told you Mr. SHIM is..
too shy to ask you for the story, right?

578
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,523
- Yes.
- I lied.

579
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,563
But I can't tell you the truth.

580
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,367
No, no. You should know.

581
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,999
Mr. SHIM..

582
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,501
He's sick in his head.

583
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,070
Really? No..

584
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,380
He doesn't seem like so.

585
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,619
You can't tell byjust looking at
him, but when he has his fits..

586
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,125
I shouldn't tell you this.

587
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,491
I promise I won't tell anybody.

588
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,058
- Shh!
- Okay

589
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,705
When he loses control of himself,
he grabs his head like this..

590
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:43,038
and smashes it like this.

591
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:44,746
- And his nose bursts out in blood!
- God..

592
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,815
Especially

593
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,111
when his pride is hurt.
He strangles himself

594
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:54,279
foaming in his mouth..

595
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:59,985
If people find out that he's writing
your story into into a novel..

596
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:08,929
That's why you rushed to come over
with all that mousse in your hair.

597
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:13,972
It was a close call. Very close.

598
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:18,941
Now that I think of it, it was weird
how he always changed his hairdos.

599
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,442
It's the worst when he has a perm.

600
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,415
I'm sorry, buddy

601
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,251
I had no choice.

602
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,484
Daeguanryung?

603
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,525
Why would I go there?

604
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,290
You said you'd go. That's what
you told everybody.

605
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,567
I didn't mean what I said.

606
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,773
I'm not going.

607
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,475
So, I'm not going, either?

608
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,170
Why would you go if I'm not going?

609
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,450
Isn't it obvious why they're going?

610
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,714
They're gonna have a barbecue
party and get drunk.

611
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,251
With coffee shop girls
in their arms,

612
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,561
their goal is to get laid.
So vulgar and stupid.

613
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,100
What? He said I'm mentally sick?

614
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,400
Yes! And he told you I have
a boyfriend who's in prison?

615
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,738
Yes! And the story is yours?

616
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,641
Yes, it's mine!

617
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,245
He has no conscience!

618
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,316
- Bastard!
- Asshole!

619
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:34,354
- Coward!
- Shit head!

620
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,418
Teacher, what's the matter?

621
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,596
Let's go to Daeguanryung.

622
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,322
Mr. GOH, have you ever
been to the Daeguanryung farm?

623
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,124
- No.
- They must have milking cows there.

624
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,428
The white ones with black spots.

625
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,768
- Probably.
- I wonder how many. A lot, right?

626
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:59,837
I love animals.

627
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,377
I never miss an episode

628
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,878
of 'Animal Kingdom' on TV.

629
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,380
I bet you like that show, too

630
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,214
Last week was about
desert animals..

631
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,254
I hate animals.

632
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,821
And, especially, that stupid show!

633
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:22,758
I can't believe she's been talking
about animals for last hour.

634
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,247
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, but

635
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,453
my friend is hurt.

636
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,153
Can you please give us a ride?

637
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:54,497
- We're kinda behind schedule..
- Poor kids.

638
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,530
We'll pay you.

639
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,530
Thank you so much.
We're very sorry.

640
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,199
Assholes!

641
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,631
Ungrateful punks!

642
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:38,240
- Poopy heads.
- Poop.. Poopy..Poopy heads!

643
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,797
Bastards!

644
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,936
Those who don't
give a ride

645
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:11,030
are as bad as those
who steal cars.

646
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,077
We gave rides to everyone. But,
how come no one's giving us a ride?

647
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,111
Car's coming!

648
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,752
He's a bastard, too.

649
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,656
- I'm freezing.
- I'm freezing, too.

650
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:37,998
I'm starving.

651
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,796
I'm starving, too.

652
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,531
Why the hell did I come?

653
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:51,110
Look! Light!

654
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,043
Wait for me!

655
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,111
TV is going crazy again.

656
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,951
I told you to buy a new one!

657
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,060
Nonsense! This will last us
for another 10 years!

658
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,493
Hello?

659
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,730
Who is it?

660
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,293
Yes?

661
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:17,339
Hi. Can I please use your phone?

662
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,034
We don't have one.

663
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,474
I'm sorry to bother you

664
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:28,016
but I don't have a place to stay
for the night. May I stay here tonight?

665
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:32,280
- Sure. Come in
- Thank you so much.

666
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:38,488
I'm sorry, but there's
one more person.

667
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,821
C'mon! Come!

668
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,036
Please help yourself.

669
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,604
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

670
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,884
I can't believe
those bastards!

671
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,753
If it was me, I would've
taught them a good lesson!

672
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,760
What would you have done?
