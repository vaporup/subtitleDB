1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,723
If our gods and our hopes
are nothing but scientific phenomena,

2
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:08,461
then it must be said that our love
is scientific as well -“L'Eve Future"

3
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,603
[sirens, city sounds]

4
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,971
[helicopter approaching]

5
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:58,681
[over radio] Repo 202 to Control.
Arrived at target airspace.

6
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,618
Commencing data relay.

7
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,819
[background radio chatter]

8
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,228
[people shouting]

9
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,174
[loud crashing]

10
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,388
[Batou] Fill me in.

11
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,403
The perp killed the owner 52 minutes
ago, at crime scene #1, then took off.

12
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:56,374
Ambushed and murdered two cops
at crime scene #2, an unmapped alley.

13
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,970
All access points are blocked.
We storm it in 2 minutes.

14
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,842
That's the cyborg cop
from Section 9.

15
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,323
Keep your distance. I hear his bum luck
catches like the plague.

16
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:16,454
E-police want to horn in on us.
They're asking for a data link.

17
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,157
First it's Public Safety,
now the E-Police.

18
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,325
Decline their request respectfully.

19
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,545
[faint footsteps]

20
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,398
[electronic beeping]

21
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,746
[crash]

22
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,420
[woman] Help me.

23
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,125
Help me.

24
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,039
[stretching, tearing]

25
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,218
[explosion]

26
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,056
[singing in Japanese]

27
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:10,282
[recorded voice] We've had eight cases
of gynoids murdering their masters.

28
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,046
After each killing, they self-destruct,
electronic brains reformatted.

29
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:20,052
In each case, the model in question
is Locus Solus #2052, “Hadaly” type.

30
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,686
A prototype developed for testing,

31
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,526
they were provided free of charge
to contractors.

32
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,260
Now, they've recalled
all the prototypes.

33
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,235
According to their most recent report,

34
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,866
they've identiﬁed no defects
in either software or hardware.

35
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,316
You get all that?

36
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,416
Manufacturer's latest gynoids
go berserk, attacking their owners,

37
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,757
company panics
and recalls every one.

38
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,821
They can expect lawsuits
by bereaved families,

39
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,266
inevitable liability trials
and mammoth damage awards.

40
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,703
I get it all
except why Section 9 is involved.

41
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,262
You get it?

42
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,406
What you call getting it
may be just wishful thinking.

43
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,074
Right now, Section 9's involved
for two reasons.

44
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,846
First, not one single family
has filed a lawsuit.

45
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,721
In every case they've settled
with Locus Solus out of court.

46
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,727
Second, the victims
included a politician

47
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,322
and a retired Public Safety official.

48
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,629
Because terrorism's a possible motive,

49
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,400
it's our job to consider
if it's a matter for Section 9.

50
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,874
lshikawa and Azuma
are getting background on the victims.

51
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,776
You two check out the gynoids.

52
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,778
[Aramaki] No questions. Go.

53
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,926
Just for the record,
I didn't volunteer for this.

54
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,963
There's no way
I'll measure up to the Major.

55
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,632
That's beside the point.

56
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,198
I hear she's still listed as missing.

57
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,946
[Batou] The Major could only call
her brain and her ghost her own.

58
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,116
Although even she doubted
whether they were real.

59
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,160
Her brains and hardware
were government property

60
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,390
and her entire memory,
including the classified information,

61
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,932
were part of the deal.

62
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,094
The top brass only cares about
recovering that memory.

63
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,037
Her life is not an issue for them.

64
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,667
So, where do we start?

65
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,704
[Batou] Locus Solus is located
in the northern frontier.

66
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,013
The first step is to check in
with local Forensics.

67
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,055
POLICE

68
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,323
[background chatter]

69
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,807
[female voice on loudspeaker]

70
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,614
You guys...

71
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,383
About the gynoid
this guy wasted yesterday...

72
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,357
She cost us two young officers.

73
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,088
Don't tell me you want her back?

74
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,529
That's part of what
we've come to determine.

75
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,802
Forensics is up on 19,
a right at the end of the hall.

76
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:58,503
- Need a guide?
- No thanks, we'll skip the tour.

77
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,777
“Birds never peck
at green persimmons,

78
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,307
they wait until the fruit is ripe."

79
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,664
[metallic crash]

80
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,328
[elevator creaking]

81
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,204
you would've had a choice word or two
for guys like us

82
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,074
swooping down
to horn in on your case.

83
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,605
[Togusa] That's why it's so irritating.
It's like watching my old self.

84
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,672
[chuckling]

85
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,085
“It is no use to blame the looking glass
if your face is askew.

86
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:48,286
The mirror is not an instrument
of enlightenment but of illusion."

87
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,059
Well, neither of us has looks
worth staring at in the mirror.

88
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,094
[door opens]

89
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,973
[bubbling]

90
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,857
[electronic whirring]

91
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:38,906
[Haraway] You can come all you want,
I'm not sharing this investigation.

92
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,572
And if you're too persistent,
I'll have you detained.

93
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,914
l'm Togusa, Public Safety Section 9.
This scary-looking fellow...

94
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,547
Blew her apart with double-O buckshot.

95
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:57,094
A 50 caliber hollow point
would've left her easier to reconstruct.

96
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,597
She wasted 3 people,
two of 'em cops.

97
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,607
She was trying to commit suicide
before you shot her. Isn't that right?

98
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,851
- "Commit suicide" meaning... Miss...
- [Haraway] Haraway.

99
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,299
Miss Haraway, how exactly
would a robot kill itself?

100
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,566
By intentionally malfunctioning,

101
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,801
these gynoids are capable of
self-authorizing attacks against humans.

102
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,539
This liberates them from Moral Code #3.

103
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,175
[Togusa] Which stipulates, “Maintain
existence without injuring humans."

104
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,778
lsn't “self-destruction” more accurate?

105
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,452
[exhaling]

106
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,652
If you assume differences between
humans and machines are obvious.

107
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,130
[Togusa] Are such “suicides”
confined to a particular model?

108
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,463
[Haraway] Not necessarily.

109
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:14,165
In recent years we've seen a surge
of robot related problems,

110
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,969
especially among the “pets”.

111
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,141
[Togusa] The cause?

112
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,739
[Haraway] E-brain contamination
from microbes and viruses,

113
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:29,516
human production errors,
functional defects from wear-and-tear.

114
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,523
- Take your pick, but...
- [Togusa] But?

115
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:38,359
[Haraway] I say it's because humans
discard robots once they're redundant.

116
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,228
When owners trade up to newer models,

117
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,001
some of those abandoned
become vagrants, and degenerate.

118
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,109
Perhaps it’s a protest
against their own obsolescence.

119
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,440
Absurd.

120
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,741
[Haraway] Humans are different
from robots.

121
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,515
That’s an article of faith,
like black isn't white.

122
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,150
It’s no more helpful than the basic fact
that humans aren’t machines.

123
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:17,291
Unlike industrial robots, the androids
and gynoids designed as“pets,"

124
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,135
weren't designed along utilitarian
or practical models.

125
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,541
Instead, we model them
on a human image,

126
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,343
an idealized one at that.

127
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:35,849
Why are humans so obsessed
with recreating themselves?

128
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,369
- [Haraway] Do you have children?
- A daughter.

129
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,430
[Haraway] Children have been excluded

130
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,975
from the customary standards
of human behavior,

131
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,376
if you define humans as beings
who possess a conventional identity

132
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,745
and act out of free will.

133
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,950
Then what are children who endure
in the chaos preceding maturity?

134
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:13,583
They differ profoundly from “humans,”
but they obviously have human form.

135
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:20,588
The dolls that little girls mother,
are not surrogates for real babies.

136
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,126
Little girls aren't so much
imitating child rearing,

137
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:30,198
as they are experiencing something
deeply akin to child rearing.

138
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,675
What on earth are you talking about?

139
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:36,111
[Haraway] Raising children
is the simplest way

140
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,777
to achieve the ancient dream
of artificial life.

141
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,878
At least, that’s my hypothesis.

142
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,288
Children aren't dolls!

143
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:51,591
Descartes didn't differentiate man
from machine, animate from inanimate.

144
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,757
He lost his beloved
five-year-old daughter

145
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,666
and then named a doll after her,
Francine. He doted on her.

146
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,000
At least that's what they say.

147
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,733
[whirring]

148
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,442
Can we get back to reality here?

149
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,812
I'd like your observations
with respect to the Hadaly robot,

150
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,284
model #2052,
manufactured by Locus Solus.

151
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,812
Right.

152
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,982
It's very well designed.

153
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,494
I understand it's a prototype, but
it's intended for particular functions.

154
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,189
[Togusa] Particular functions?

155
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,825
lt's equipped with organs
unnecessary in service robots.

156
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,664
[Togusa] Meaning?

157
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,227
[exhales]

158
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,205
[Haraway] It's a sexaroid.

159
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,734
Nothing to brag about to your neighbors,
but hardly illegal.

160
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,941
I get it. Scandal. No wonder
those families settled out of court.

161
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,452
When its systems shut down,
the electronic brain reformats.

162
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,821
That’s standard protection for
manufacturer's proprietary software.

163
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,416
- But...
- [Togusa] But, what?

164
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:59,191
We found a file in the audio buffer.
Care to hear it?

165
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,990
[recorded voice] Help me.

166
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,560
[repeating] Help me. Help me.

167
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,072

[whirring winds down]

170
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,563
[Batou] Thanks for your help.

171
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,695
Uh, one last question.
lt’s none of my business, but...

172
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,575
No, I've never raised a child.

173
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,205
Nothing registered
at the ovum bank.

174
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,545
Thank you, Miss...

175
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,314
Haraway.
No need for Miss or Mrs.

176
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,685
[door opens]

177
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,162
[Togusa] She's not really the type
for technical work.

178
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,069
[Batou] Her reports are doubtless full
of unsolicited opinions, just like mine.

179
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,403
[Togusa] Which held you back
from promotion.

180
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,411
[Batou] We secure that gynoid's brain
for the labs at Section 9.

181
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,674
[Togusa] That's the last
we'll see of her.

182
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,184
- [Batou] She your type?
- [Togusa] Actually, I like older women.

183
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,515
- [Togusa] Next?
- [Batou] Follow procedure.

184
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,715
- Investigate the Hadaly inspector?
- [over radio] 09 calling 907.

185
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,520
There's been a 602
in the District 201 boathouse.

186
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,424
Victim is inspector for Locus Solus.

187
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,895
Scene secured two minutes
prior to local police.

188
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,365
- [Batou] Roger, 907.
- [Togusa] Unbelievable timing.

189
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,095
[Batou] “A fine spring day.

190
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,002
A carriage sprints between
this world and the next."

191
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,734
- [car starts]
- [brakes screeching]

192
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,615
You're all alone here?

193
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:09,059
Koga got reacquainted with his dinner
and went back with the corpse.

194
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,220
[Batou] What a wimp.

195
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,301
The scene, 22 minutes ago.

196
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,008
You made a rookie
deal with this mess?

197
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,642
[lshikawa] Life's a learning curve.
Here's what we've got.

198
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,243
Analysis of victim's brain yields...

199
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,620
Jack Volkerson, age 54.
Consignment inspector for Locus Solus.

200
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,320
He applied for leave five days ago
and vanished.

201
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,828
Three days ago,
he rented this boathouse.

202
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,227
The murder weapon,
kitchen utensils.

203
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,635
Inspection of the area
turned up a vehicle license

204
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,229
linked to organized crime.

205
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,534
We’re checking it out.

206
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,978
Seven credit cards found in jacket,
presumably the victim's.

207
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,281
Investigating transaction history.

208
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:34,476
38 caliber SW Model 2602.

209
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,715
Looks like he ran out of time.

210
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,117
Doubt it would've done him much good.

211
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:46,055
“An illegally powerful cyborg,"
or maybe a professional faking a psycho.

212
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:51,061
[over radio] 969 calling 906, 20 seconds
away from the scene, don 't touch.

213
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,994
Not a thing.

214
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,264
[Togusa] Let's leave this to Forensics.

215
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:01,772
[lshikawa] 907 calling 09.
We're handing the scene over to 969.

216
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,903
- [over radio] 09, Roger.
- [Togusa sighs]

217
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,843
It's my daughter's birthday.

218
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,906
- [lshikawa] Family man, huh?
- I'll drop you off.

219
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,510
- Wrong direction. lshikawa?
- [lshikawa] Not headed his way, either.

220
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,715
Okay.
Daughter's birthday takes priority.

221
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,451
You're a cheerful bunch.

222
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,993
The chief showing up at a scene?

223
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,427
The corpse is missing parts, that's why.

224
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,988
The place is all yours.
Take your time.

225
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,966
What’s the big deal
over a local case?

226
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,004
The boss has taken an interest.

227
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,507
[cop] Found it! Divided up in jars
in the refrigerator.

228
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:40,136
Heart, liver, kidneys,
even the pancreas.

229
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,180
Conscientious bastard.

230
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,886
[footsteps]

231
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,622
Fresh dog food, huh?
Stick to dry food and he'll last longer.

232
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,464
I can't feed him that.

233
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,605
You're teamed up with Togusa?

234
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,977
Beats being paired off with
a rookie fresh out of training.

235
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,882
For an ex-detective, he's got his uses.
I've got no complaints.

236
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:26,151
Except that the only one
up to your standards was the Major.

237
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,230
Cut the chatter, lshikawa.

238
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,395
J‘ But everything still holds me

239
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,769
J‘ In my heart

240
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:46,776
J‘ Hidden deep in my mind

241
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,716
J‘ The pictures are still on the wall J‘

242
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,660
- Later.
- Batou...

243
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,459
- What now?
- Stick to the dry food.

244
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:12,094
For nutritional balance,
it’s better for the dog.

245
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:19,434
J‘ And I am still here

246
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:32,083
J‘ Dreaming hopelessly
Holding in my heart

247
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,556
[car starts]

248
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,959
J‘ All the flowers you gave

249
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:46,735
J‘ Broken melodies

250
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,899
J‘ No more singing

251
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,172
J‘ No more laughing

252
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,678
J‘ In the sun

253
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:02,851
J‘ River of moonshine

254
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,322
J‘ I hear your voice

255
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,019
J‘ And it's calling

256
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,329
J‘ But I'm still alone

257
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,890
J‘ But I'm still alone

258
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,998
- J‘ I'm alone
- [dog growls]

259
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,878
[dog whines]

260
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,213
J‘ Alone J‘

261
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,681
[dog panting, whining]

262
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,697
[dog grunts]

263
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,704
[music box plays]

264
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,836
[dog whining]

265
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,912
[yeIpSI

266
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,340
[grunts, exhales]

267
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,162
[man #1] He died from a blow
that severed his cervical vertebrae.

268
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:09,571
The kitchen utensils
were for evisceration, not murder.

269
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,337
[man #2] Someone took their time
dismembering the corpse?

270
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,002
[man #1] So it appears.

271
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:18,105
We've confirmed the organs
in the refrigerator were the victim's.

272
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:23,143
They reveal gastritis and cirrhosis
of the liver. Apparently an alcoholic.

273
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,416
[man #2] Why'd the perp bother
with the organs?

274
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,618
[man #1] Maybe to create the impression
he was a psycho or a freak.

275
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,685
Or to underscore an element
of retribution or revenge.

276
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:35,597
[man #2] So we’re not looking for
an assassin posing as a thrill-seeker.

277
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,033
What's with the warped doorknob?

278
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:43,472
[man #1] Analysis indicates a Chinese
prosthetic limb, model NR26.

279
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,771
Known as the Crab Claw.
Strictly military.

280
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,540
Available on the black market,
defective ones, anyway.

281
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,447
The Claw jives with that stiff's
mutilated neck, too.

282
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,486
[man #2] Did you track down the license
on those yakuza wheels?

283
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,114
[man #1] They've covered their tracks
with a lot of illegal modifications.

284
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,885
[man #2] Stick to the facts.

285
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:05,157
[man #1] We tracked down records
from a nearby parking lot.

286
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,996
The vehicle in question's registered
to a crime group called Kojinkai.

287
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,400
Car's bulletproofed, with a
reinforced chassis and rear shocks.

288
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,371
It's been linked to a number
of assault scenes.

289
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,601
[man #2] Custom wheels for a cyborg.

290
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,269
An illegally powerful bodyguard at that.

291
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,405
- [man #2] So this was yakuza payback?
- But where's the motive?

292
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,973
The Kojinkai's an entrenched
Japanese crime syndicate.

293
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,747
[man #2] Drugs, hookers,
gambling, scams,

294
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,812
an anything-goes yakuza operation.

295
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,792
And a Hadaly gynoid yanked off
the big boss, Inoue's head 3 days ago.

296
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,226
A young turk, Wakabayashi,
took over the show.

297
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,763
[man #1] It’s a no-brainer.

298
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,994
[man #2] Avenge the boss' death
and his throne is yours.

299
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,058
Hold on.

300
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,604
If Volkerson knew
they had it in for him,

301
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,199
why'd he take the trouble
of hiding out on their turf?

302
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,039
[man #2] We don’t know.

303
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,671
His e-brain's wiped clean,
so the car's our only lead.

304
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,614
Let's leave this one to the locals.

305
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,210
The terrorists-masquerading-
as-deranged-robots scenario?

306
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,882
There's no political link
between the victims,

307
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,549
so I think that's a dead end.

308
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,828
But I'm putting Batou and Togusa on
all our berserk Hadaly cases full-time,

309
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,831
this one included.

310
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:20,235
The rest of you, get back
to your regular shifts. That's it.

311
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,330
Togusa.

312
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,242
See me before you go.

313
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,813
Talkto me.

314
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:41,450
We'll check out any links between
the Kojinkai mob and Locus Solus.

315
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,086
[Aramaki] I mean Batou.

316
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,826
Yourjob includes monitoring
your partner's emotional state.

317
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,836
[Togusa] I know, but I'm not a cyborg
or an electronic neurologist.

318
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,931
“One need not be Caesar in order
to understand Caesar."

319
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,707
You're a family man, right?
Do you consider yourself to be happy?

320
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,144
[Togusa] Well, sure.

321
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,480
Most of us are neither so happy
nor so miserable as we think.

322
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:12,285
The key is to stay engaged
with your life and your hopes.

323
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,552
[Togusa] I don’t understand.

324
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:20,029
Lately, Batou's reminding me
of the Major before she disappeared.

325
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:26,901
[Aramaki] You know,“Let one walk alone,
committing no sin,

326
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,668
with few wishes,
like an elephant in the forest."

327
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,174
[footsteps]

328
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,444
Chief, why did you pick me
for this job?

329
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,788
[Aramaki] Because it was the Major
who plucked you off your local beat.

330
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,055
[mechanical whirring]

331
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,929
[Batou] What'd he want?

332
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,369
Apparently you don't need to be Caesar
in order to understand him.

333
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,030
That goes without saying.

334
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,304
“The world cannot live
at the level of its great men."

335
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,484
You planning on starting a war?

336
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:21,389
[Batou] No need to be a yakuza to pay
them a visit, but we'll need weapons.

337
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,587
- I want to get something straight.
- What?

338
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,062
We're just going to chat
with these guys, right?

339
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,792
You dislike yakuza?

340
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,766
- Sure. Detest them.
- Same here.

341
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,735
But we're just going to chat, right?

342
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,637
Like I said, you don't need
to be a yakuza...

343
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,836
I know. To pay them a visit.
But you also said we need weapons.

344
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,378
I'm a family man.

345
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,970
I can always go alone.

346
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,311
No. I'll go with you,
I am your partner.

347
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,907
But I want your word.

348
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:51,387
Okay. We're just going to chat.
Avoid shooting as best you can.

349
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,253
- Happy now?
- Just fine.

350
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,848
Let's go then, pal.

351
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,790
[fish tank bubbling]

352
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,699
Who the fuck are you?

353
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:16,578
Here to chat with Wakabayashi.
Go get him.

354
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,985
What about, “Avoid shooting?"

355
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:34,464
I did as best I could.

356
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,898
[yelling]

357
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,969
[cat yowls]

358
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,526
Images!

359
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,495
That son of a bitch
infiltrated our vision!

360
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,505
[Batou] Blame your own
cheap shit electronics.

361
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,440
[gurgling]

362
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,817
[Batou] What's up?

363
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,021
[Togusa] Narrow, dark stairs.
What's the program?

364
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,657
- We take turns, I'll lead.
- No, I'll lead.

365
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:45,533
You're so damned big,
I can't cover you.

366
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,605
[QaSpSI

367
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,850
[grunting]

368
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,757
[gunshots]

369
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:15,125
[laughing, panting]

370
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,539
[Batou] Your little gifts exploded
above my head.

371
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:28,511
Even presuming they went off
at their most lethal range,

372
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,778
you think two grenades
are going to off an armored cyborg?

373
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,512
You insult me.

374
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,247
[gasping, whimpering]

375
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,394
Start by telling me about
the dead consignment inspector,

376
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,693
then spill your connections
to Locus Solus.

377
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,666
[explosion, garbled voice]

378
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,302
Well, look who's here.

379
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,347
[grunting]

380
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,223
Bring it on, Crab Man. You and that
claw look nasty, but I'm ready.

381
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,486
[mumbling]

382
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,765
[pained shout]

383
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:46,316
Betting on that obvious a move? Moron.

384
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,064
[heavy breathing]

385
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,772
...so we whacked him.

386
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,913
I'm fresh out of 3 years in the pen.

387
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:15,442
I knowjack shit about what the boss
was up to with that outfit.

388
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,988
Still with me, pal?

389
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,550
[Togusa] All I could see...
were my wife and daughter's faces.

390
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:26,222
That wasn’t your wife or daughter.

391
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:28,493
It was the grim reaper.

392
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,199
[Aramaki] I ordered you
to conduct an investigation.

393
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:37,173
I never said skip the paperwork
and act like vigilantes.

394
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:41,178
I certainly don't recall ordering you
to barge into any yakuza office.

395
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:45,808
This isn't the jungle and you're not
Special Forces hit men.

396
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:54,251
- [Batou] You still pissed off?
- [Togusa] I am not pissed.

397
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,523
And I hate to sound ungrateful
to the man who saved my life...

398
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,086
[brakes screeching]

399
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:05,995
But being your partner is definitely
gonna take atoll on me.

400
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,063
Look, it's only the two of us
on this case.

401
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,802
A half-assed approach
just won't cut it.

402
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:16,245
If Locus Solus has anything to hide,
they'll come after us.

403
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,544
So that's why you put on
that yakuza gun show.

404
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:23,987
Yeah, and if the chief was really
pissed, he'd have suspended us.

405
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,579
Pull over, will you?

406
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,009
[Batou] Later.

407
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,113
[bell rings]

408
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,629
[hushed voices]

409
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,710
[woman] You're in the kill zone.

410
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,121
[woman gasps]

411
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,551
[growling]

412
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,455
[rain falling]

413
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,012
Don't tamper with the settings
on that new arm of yours.

414
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:46,614
The operating system upgrades
can conflict with the weapon-control,

415
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:49,091
rendering it entirely useless.

416
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,458
[Batou] Then you'll have to
reformat the thing.

417
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,828
Hey, where are the remains
of my old arm?

418
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,925
Don't even think about it.
Not much left.

419
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,267
The organic components
in this new one match your DNA.

420
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,866
I suppose that, with enough use,
it'll feel like my own.

421
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,678
[dog whimpering]

422
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:11,476
Ouch. Hey, just hold on.

423
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,184
The fact that you carried him here
means that...

424
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,590
[lshikawa] Yeah.
I broke into your love nest.

425
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,063
I just couldn't stomach the thought
of him moaning with hunger,

426
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,122
covered in shit,
waiting for you.

427
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,464
Believe it or not, I'm a dog lover.

428
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:33,936
But I'm the one
that took him in for the night.

429
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,032
My daughter's in heaven and my wife's
fuming over her dirty carpets.

430
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,509
When did you start tailing me?

431
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,239
It's no big deal, man.

432
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,248
Yes, it is a big deal.
You used me as a smokescreen.

433
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,876
[lshikawa] With experience,
you would've caught on.

434
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,783
Blame it on the boss.

435
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,818
Is this pooch a clone?

436
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,018
Aren't originals
outrageously expensive?

437
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:59,996
[Batou] His was the first line
bred by artificial insemination.

438
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,397
It's hardly your style to let them
hack into your brain.

439
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,960
And any daily routine
just makes you vulnerable to traps.

440
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,199
I told you to stick to dry food.

441
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:14,177
But he likes the fresh stuff and that’s
the only store that carries it.

442
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,839
They had you going berserk,

443
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,577
shooting five bullets
into your own arm,

444
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,848
and nearly blowing away
the store owner.

445
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:27,881
He may be nuts, but it's a rare bird
that can hack into this guy.

446
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,553
[lshikawa] Except for the Major.

447
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:35,029
And why didn't they make me
blow my own head off?

448
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,593
[lshikawa] I think, because they want
to disgrace you, not wipe you out.

449
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,662
First, you barge into a yakuza office,

450
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,833
send a dozen men
to heaven or the hospital,

451
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:49,107
and that very same day,
unload your weapon in a grocery store.

452
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,742
So we think either you've gone mad
or your e-brain's shot.

453
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:59,518
[Togusa] But this was a planned attack.
It proves that our case wasn't random.

454
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,184
We can't pull out.

455
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,888
We'd jeopardize
the whole point of Section 9.

456
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,430
That's what the Major’d say.

457
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,624
And I’ve got a message
from the boss, too.

458
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,134
Stay on it,
but no more official Section support

459
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,363
until you come up with material proof.

460
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,929
We'll go to the source then,
Locus Solus.

461
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,498
[lshikawa] Nothing preserves
secrecy like speed.

462
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:21,136
You’re going to the northern frontier
immediately.

463
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,180
- Far north?
- You two can't handle it?

464
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,772
Sure, but what about the basset?

465
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:31,186
[lshikawa] A single man in this line of
work keeping a dog is preposterous!

466
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:35,089
And of all dogs, you choose
a high-maintenance hound.

467
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,219
It’s not my problem.
You guys figure it out!

468
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,395
[dog whimpers]

469
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,435
[aircraft approaches]

470
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:45,959
[aircraft approaches]

471
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,151
[Batou] This area was once intended

472
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,850
as the Far East's most important
information center,

473
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:44,588
a Special Economic Zone
in its heyday.

474
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:48,257
These towers survive as a shadow
of the city’s former glory.

475
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,324
Its dubious sovereignty
has made it the ideal haven

476
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:55,930
for multi-nationals and the criminal
elements that feed off their spoils.

477
00:47:56,007 --> 00:48:00,808
It's a lawless zone,
beyond the reach of UN or E-police.

478
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,871
Reminds me of the line,
“What the body creates,

479
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:08,180
is as much an expression of DNA
as the body itself."

480
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,653
But the same applies
to beaver dams and spiderwebs.

481
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,658
I'll take the coral reefs
as my metaphor.

482
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,058
Though hardly so beautiful.

483
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:23,459
[Batou] If the essence of life
is information carried in DNA,

484
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:27,095
then society and civilization
are just colossal memory systems

485
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:30,504
and a metropolis like this one,
simply a sprawling external memory.

486
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,339
“How great is the sum of thy thoughts.

487
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:37,745
If I should count them, they are
more in number than the sand."

488
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:41,876
Psalms 139, Old Testament.

489
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,683
The way you spout these
spontaneous exotic references,

490
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,885
I'd say your own external memory's
pretty twisted.

491
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,087
Look who's talking!

492
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:55,326
[over radio] Sorry to interrupt, but
we 're about to fly over Locus Solus.

493
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:58,425
This pass is for you,
so take a good look.

494
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:48,449
[over radio] So much for the free tour.
Prepare for landing.

495
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,550
“His legions, angel forms,
who lay entranced.

496
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,217
Thick as autumnal leaves
that strow the brooks."

497
00:49:55,293 --> 00:50:00,253
Now you're quoting Milton,
but we are not Satan.

498
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,300
[birds crying]

499
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,399
[singing in Japanese]

500
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,965
[howling]

501
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:39,211
[children shouting in distance]

502
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,357
[gasping] Batou!

503
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:04,298
[Batou] You sure have gotten informal,
Lin. Since when do you skip the “Sir"?

504
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:07,071
[Lin] I haven't forgotten
the debt I owe you.

505
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:10,113
[Batou] “The less one forgets
the less one can remember?"

506
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:12,445
[Lin] Oh, c'mon, Batou... Sir.

507
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:15,007
[Batou] Now you want
to butter me up with “Sir".

508
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,179
[Lin] Please, forgive me, I beg you.
I beseech you.

509
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,021
- Know a guy called Kim?
- Never heard of him.

510
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,619
Actually, they're a dime a dozen
up this way.

511
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:28,324
I'm just looking for a particular one.

512
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,594
[Lin] We got loyalty even in my line.

513
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:35,105
“There's loyalty that protects secrets
and loyalty that protects the truth. "

514
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:38,573
You cannot serve both masters,
so which loyalty is yours?

515
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,110
[Lin] They say there's no truth
without secrets.

516
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:43,772
[Batou] I'll ask you again,
do you know a guy called Kim?

517
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:47,579
[Lin] Never heard of him.
Actually, they're a dime a dozen...

518
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:53,253
[Batou] “Life and death come and go
like marionettes dancing on a table.

519
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:57,556
Once their strings are cut,
they easily crumble."

520
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:04,125
He used to be a long-range
military scout.

521
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,721
“Unfit as a commander,
unfit to be commanded,

522
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,665
fit only to languish by the wayside."

523
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,670
He bounced around between
Special Forces and Electronics,

524
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,504
and got into black market weapons.
His reputation turned to shit.

525
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:22,672
Wound up your garden-variety hacker.

526
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,306
Sounds like quite a story.

527
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,716
Yeah, but no matter how far a jackass
travels, it won't come back a horse.

528
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:34,486
His downfall came
when his reach exceeded his grasp.

529
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,492
Let’s go.

530
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,229
[Togusa] Batou,
the study on the top floor.

531
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,713
I guess we were a little late.

532
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:53,883
Pro-active firewalls must have
zapped him hacking in somewhere.

533
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:58,018
In any case, doesn't look like
he would've been of much use.

534
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,893
“The deceased firmly declines

535
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,929
offerings of fresh or artificial flowers
or birds released in his honor."

536
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,109
[grunts]

537
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:20,377
“Sleep not you of the dead."

538
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,409
Even Confucius says you should never
pretend to sleep like a corpse.

539
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:28,185
I haven't got time
for your stupid little jokes, Kim.

540
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,783
[laughing]

541
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:52,882
[Kim] Haven't seen you since
that landing operation in Nemuro.

542
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,645
[Batou] I'm here on a job.

543
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,709
[Kim] Meaning Locus Solus?

544
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:59,221
They came late to the robot racket,

545
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:04,818
but expanded rapidly once they focused
on high-end gynoids.

546
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,955
There are whispers of links
to politicians, bureaucrats,

547
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,329
even crime syndicates.

548
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:16,397
Wary of local regulators
for these “specialized” mannequins,

549
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:19,704
they shifted all production
to a multi-national factory ship

550
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,371
anchored in international waters.

551
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:27,406
They turn out
some mighty fine dolls.

552
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:31,250
Fine enough to commit suicide
after murdering humans?

553
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:35,223
[Kim] If that's true,
it's pretty unseemly.

554
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:41,824
[dishes rattling]

555
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:50,502
That would mean replicating humans
by breathing souls into dolls.

556
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,804
Who’d want to do that?

557
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,640
The definition of a truly beautiful doll

558
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,204
is a living, breathing body
devoid of a soul.

559
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:05,153
“An unyielding corpse,
tiptoeing on the brink of collapse."

560
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:09,784
Or reduced to a ravaged body
with an e-brain... like you.

561
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,091
The human is no match for a doll,

562
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:17,532
in its form, its elegance in motion,
its very being.

563
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,434
The inadequacies of human awareness

564
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:25,100
become the inadequacies
of life’s reality.

565
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:28,508
[Kim] Perfection is possible
only for those without consciousness,

566
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,012
or perhaps endowed
with infinite consciousness.

567
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,915
In other words,
for dolls and for gods.

568
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:38,079
Shouldn't we get back to business?

569
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:42,057
[Kim] Actually, there's one more
mode of existence

570
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,389
commensurate with dolls and deities.

571
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,258
[Togusa] Animals?

572
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,767
[Kim] Shelley's skylarks are suffused
with a profound, instinctive joy.

573
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:54,201
Joy we humans, driven by
self-consciousness, can never know.

574
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,798
For those of us
who lust after knowledge,

575
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:05,781
it is a condition more elusive
than godhood.

576
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,785
And this conundrum compelled you
to inhabit a doll and play dead?

577
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,081
Is that your reason?

578
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:21,391
[Kim] That's what Confucius says.

579
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,144
[Kim] It is a rare human
who knows death.

580
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:39,239
Most meet death unprepared,
armed only with ignorant familiarity.

581
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,649
In other words, people die
simply because it is inevitable.

582
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,918
[Batou] But death is a precondition
of life for a doll.

583
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:53,258
Kim chose to become a complete cyborg.
That was his reason.

584
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,501
and got into black market weapons.
His reputation turned to shit.

585
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,404
Wound up your garden-variety hacker.

586
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,169
Sounds like quite a story.

587
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:11,875
No matter how far a jackass travels,
it won't come back a horse.

588
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,885
What's wrong? Lets go.

589
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:26,112
[Togusa] Batou!

590
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:51,206
“The deceased hereby proclaims,
that on this day of this month,

591
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,250
“I have attained
my own celebrated death."

592
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,421
[grunts]

593
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,084
[mechanical gasping]

594
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:20,408
[Kim] Truly disturbing, isn't it?

595
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,604
I really understand.

596
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:36,557
The doubt is whether a creature
that certainly appears to be alive,

597
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:37,991
really is.

598
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,589
Alternatively, the doubt that
a lifeless object might actually live.

599
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,693
That’s why dolls haunt us.

600
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:50,035
They are modeled on humans.

601
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,542
They are, in fact,
nothing but human.

602
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,840
They make us face the terror

603
01:06:55,912 --> 01:07:00,815
of being reduced to simple
mechanisms and matter.

604
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:03,876
In other words,
the fear that, fundamentally,

605
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:08,550
all humans belong to the void.

606
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:12,326
Enough. Let's get down to business.

607
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:15,762
[Kim] Further, science,
seeking to unlock the secret of life,

608
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:19,461
brought about this terror.

609
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,403
The notion that nature is calculable

610
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:25,669
inevitably leads to the conclusion
that humans too,

611
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,210
are reducible
to basic, mechanical parts.

612
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:31,577
“The human body is a machine
which winds its own springs.

613
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:38,418
In this age, the twin technologies
of robotics and electronic neurology

614
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:42,015
resurrected the 18th century theory
of man as machine.

615
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:45,755
And now that computers have
enabled externalized memory,

616
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:50,163
humans have pursued
self-mechanization aggressively,

617
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,828
to expand the limits
of their own functions.

618
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,838
Determined to leave behind
Darwinian natural selection,

619
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,568
this human determination
to beat evolutionary odds

620
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:02,168
also reveals the desire to transcend

621
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:06,545
the very quest for perfection
that gave it birth.

622
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:12,780
The mirage of life equipped
with perfect hardware

623
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,450
engendered this nightmare.

624
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:19,461
“God's everlasting geometry.”

625
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,063
[clicking]

626
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,222
[QaSpingi

627
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:26,727
[gunshot]

628
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,827
Here goes!

629
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,782
[Togusa] Batou!

630
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,026
[aircraft overhead]

631
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,957
[groaning in pain]

632
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,051
How do you feel?

633
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,113
How did I...

634
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,683
Looks like a tangle of virtual
experience hacked into your e-brain.

635
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:04,730
Just as luck appears in threes,
misfortune also arrives three times.

636
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,634
A gaze averted in discomfort,
a realization unspoken, advice unbidden.

637
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,865
Without noticing,
we welcome catastrophe.

638
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:16,242
But our world cannot afford to ignore
the first sign, let alone all three.

639
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,679
Itold you, Kim, I don't have time
for your stupid jokes!

640
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,379
When did you catch on?

641
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,320
[Batou] No one's easier to trick
than the trickster.

642
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:30,517
You may be
an electronic warfare specialist,

643
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,084
but you forget my line's intelligence.

644
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,325
And besides...
I come complete with a guardian angel.

645
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:41,631
Try digging up the hall image
in your external memory database.

646
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:53,710
[Batou] Jacob Grimm wrote that by
inscribing “aemaeth” upon Golem's brow,

647
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:58,743
the clay man lived by drawing energy
from the word for “truth”.

648
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,756
But simply removing “ae”
to form “maeth” or “death,”

649
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:04,816
returned the Golem back
to inanimate clay.

650
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:08,295
That prophecy told me that no truth
would be found within these walls.

651
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:11,458
[Kim] Someone broke through
the firewalls I devised?

652
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:13,832
Preposterous. Who on earth could!

653
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:17,669
[Batou] Like I told you,
my guardian angel.

654
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:22,304
Game's over, Kim.
It's time you started talking...

655
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,272
[gunshot]

656
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,376
That's just a doll.

657
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:36,985
You don't know when to quit, Kim.
I won't fall for another diversion.

658
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:40,722
Batou, how can you disprove
this reality is genuine

659
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,755
or an extension of false illusions
generated by virtual signals?

660
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,728
My ghost is whispering to me.

661
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,763
Humans are nothing but the thread
from which the dream of life is woven.

662
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:56,300
If dreams, consciousness,
even ghosts are no more than rifts

663
01:11:56,378 --> 01:12:01,077
and warps in the uniform weave
of the matrix.

664
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:07,146
We are both but worthless humans,
though we walk very different paths.

665
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,555
Of course,
if you don't believe in ghosts,

666
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,459
you'll never know madness
or schizophrenia, either.

667
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:19,957
The little that's left of your body
will not rot, Kim,

668
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,799
but continue to function
until you meet a suitable death.

669
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,836
[QaSpingi

670
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,818
Are we actually back
in physical reality?

671
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:49,353
There is no way to distinguish
reminiscence from true memory.

672
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:56,360
Whatever they are, they can
only be analyzed after the fact.

673
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:00,067
The passage of time itself
can't be stored, so it's tough.

674
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:05,341
And inevitable, now that our e-brains
share external memories.

675
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:09,942
Do your wife and daughter,
waiting for you at home, really exist?

676
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,852
Or are you, in reality, still single,

677
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,982
living in some cheap rented room,
only dreaming of that family.

678
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,290
Don't you want to verify
what actually happened back there?

679
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,523
And if you knew
almost from the start, why?

680
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,624
I had to ascertain his motives.

681
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,636
Kim set his trap
knowing I'd come calling,

682
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,571
inserting the virtual reality
to shake us off.

683
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,198
That's about the gist of it.

684
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,210
Maybe he was the hacker who
planted something in my e-brain,

685
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:39,076
making me dance to his tune
and blow away my right arm.

686
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:44,677
Just as lshikawa surmised, not
many could have pulled that off.

687
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,813
Locus Solus suspects as much.

688
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,450
So you anticipated all of this.

689
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:54,223
Pretended to fall into his trap,
then beat him at his own game...

690
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,992
...that was my plan.
But Kim was pretty sophisticated.

691
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:59,626
I only made it out
because of the hallway clue.

692
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:03,103
The guardian angel you spoke of...

693
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,437
She's gone.

694
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,568
Somewhere beyond that “rift
in the uniform weave of the matrix."

695
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:12,478
She's definitely alive.

696
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:17,144
Merging somewhere on the vast net,
or with the entire domain.

697
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,380
Though that's not for me.

698
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,720
There are as many paths to proving
your existence as there are ghosts.

699
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,123
And you've got your daughter.

700
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,355
I thought Kim knew other paths too,

701
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,421
back when he and I
were in the jungle together.

702
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,832
- At least I've figured one thing out.
- What's that?

703
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,962
That I'll never cut it
as your partner.

704
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,939
Lost your nerve?

705
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:43,570
No, but to quote you,
I've got a daughter to go home to.

706
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,580
That may be, but you'll still need
to pay your way out of here.

707
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,377
Don’t you have enough?

708
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,477
We can nail Locus Solus
with the data from Kim’s e-brain.

709
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:57,184
We can only prove he interfered with an
investigation plus the ethics violation.

710
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,989
Besides, our investigation's
officially off the record.

711
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:04,897
So, if we're going to make charges
in those gynoid serial murders stick,

712
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:09,199
- we need material evidence.
- And Kim's a dead end.

713
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,533
No, he's not.

714
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:14,633
His ghost may be beyond reach, but
his e-brain's still tied to Locus Solus.

715
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:19,545
We've got to settle this case
before they clean out their operation.

716
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,140
There's an old saying,

717
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:26,153
“When you're neither right nor wrong,
it's time to beat the drums and attack.”

718
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:29,190
In other words, when dialogue fails,
it's time for violence.

719
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:33,422
Hey, this isn't like
barging into some yakuza office!

720
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,360
Then I won't count on
your Mateba revolver for cover.

721
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:43,702
“Birds seek refuge in the heavens,
fish dive deep into the sea."

722
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,307
[birds crying]

723
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,403
[Batou] I've made contact
with the escort.

724
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,673
[Togusa] Roger.

725
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,476
[man] Diving's risky
for a heavy cyborg physique.

726
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:31,076
It's so deep here, if you sank,
we'd never retrieve you.

727
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:34,782
[Batou] I used to know a cyborg
whose hobby was diving.

728
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:37,690
Don't know what got into her.

729
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,284
[man] I'm helping out because
you're Lin's friend,

730
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,695
but they say no one's
come back from that ship alive.

731
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,665
Then I don't know what's got into you.

732
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:49,135
- [Batou] Exactly. Let's go.
- [man] Hold on!

733
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:00,138
[bird cries]

734
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:06,314
[typing]

735
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,114
[Togusa] In 12 seconds,
we'll trip their sensors.

736
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,683
I'll send two seconds
of camouflage signal.

737
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:13,750
[Batou] Roger.

738
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:17,993
I’ve routed this thing
into the chief of security's e-brain.

739
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,998
[Togusa] Initiating synchronization.

740
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,228
[rumbling]

741
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,611
[breathing]

742
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,868
I'm in.
Forward the vessel data.

743
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,541
[Batou] Download complete.
Got my vision in your sites?

744
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:41,242
[Togusa] Recording now.
Wouldn't miss my mentor's assault.

745
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,149
You're a real smart ass.

746
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,484
Inﬁltra tor detected.
Rebooting security.

747
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,621
Review status of all onboard e-brains.

748
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,633
Scan for matches in memory usage
and virus size.

749
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:36,068
It may be a latent virus.
Cross monitor.

750
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,039
Logical contact
with the chief's e-brain denied.

751
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,837
Just go ahead and reformat!

752
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,970
Rebooting of level 2
security system complete.

753
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:47,982
Create a detour,
divert the inﬁltrator.

754
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,450
Rebuild the logic ﬁrewall.
Load antibodies.

755
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,385
Scanning viruses.

756
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,015
Response team,
prepare decoys for ambush.

757
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,286
Deploy all latent viruses
along ﬁrewalls.

758
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,263
Security wall 014 breached.
Error type 280 in security wall 032.

759
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:07,063
Rebuilding level 1
external security wall.

760
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,629
Fluctuation in enemy's proactive
ﬁrewall pattern detected.

761
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:14,369
Transmitting virus.

762
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,709
Pull out, Togusa. You're in danger.

763
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,112
They’re onto you.
They'll fry your brains!

764
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:24,710
- [Togusa] Not yet, a little further.
- You idiot! Don't be crazy.

765
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:55,080
[air hissing, gasping]

766
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,350
[grunting]

767
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,064
Illegal access
at gynoid production area.

768
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,969
Suspect an unconﬁrmed
latent virus attack.

769
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,667
Release all vaccines to thwart.

770
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,109
Too late, all systems activated.
Cannot establish logical contact.

771
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:01,115
Currently loading
combat robotics control software.

772
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:05,279
[loudspeaker] Warning.
Abnormality on the THO7 Line.

773
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:11,314
Security team,
arm and head for the line, I repeat.

774
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,024
[man whimpering]

775
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,758
“Veni sancto spiritus."

776
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,230
Been a while, Major.

777
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,393
How shall I address you now?

778
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:05,201
To be precise, it's just a fragment
of me downloaded via satellite.

779
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,367
This gynoid's e-brain lacks capacity.

780
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:12,038
It can only handle the combat
robotics control system.

781
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:15,412
This is the best I can do
for facial and vocal expression.

782
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:21,353
There should be an emergency access
terminal 50 meters down this passage.

783
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:25,325
If we can infiltrate that,
we’ll take over the whole system.

784
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:33,901
You haven't changed.

785
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:37,735
Move out. You're on point.
I'll cover the rear.

786
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,899
Just like the old days.

787
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:02,754
“Who can gaze into the mirror
without becoming evil?

788
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,732
A mirror does not reflect evil,
but creates it."

789
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,066
Poetics, now?
We're running low on ammo.

790
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:15,041
“Thus, a mirror bears a glimpse,
but not scrutiny."

791
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,195
[creaking]

792
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,951
[Batou] Hey, isn't that risky?

793
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,923
[Major] It's just until I shut down
the operating system.

794
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,426
Plug into the auxiliary inputs
in the floor.

795
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:13,060
I have to gain system control
or this gynoid's nonfunctional.

796
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,398
I'm counting on your 30-caliber arm.

797
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:20,271
[Batou] My brain can control firing,
but I've only got one clip left.

798
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:24,072
And I have my doubts about going
hand-to-hand with them.

799
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,241
Here goes!

800
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:32,051
Illegal onboard breach
of main system.

801
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,021
Onboard? Isolate access point,
erect proactive ﬁrewall.

802
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:39,493
Multiple camouflage signals identiﬁed.
No fluctuation in any terminal.

803
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:44,157
It may be an outside access.
Terminate all external network links.

804
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,700
Physically disengage external inputs.

805
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,895
Emergency control system
not responding.

806
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:54,237
Diffused viruses coalescing.
Breach in system area ﬁrewalls.

807
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:57,710
Prepare for system reset.
Isolate level 1 data.

808
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:02,216
Multiple illegal access in core system.
Our countermeasures can't keep up.

809
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,534
[silence]

810
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:19,384
[Major] We're in control.
All external links severed.

811
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,758
The ship is totally isolated now.

812
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:30,164
- We're moving?
- We're heading south,

813
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:33,639
leaving international waters
for sovereign territory.

814
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:38,509
This entire ship will be the material
evidence that proves Locus Solus' crime.

815
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,911
They'll come after us.

816
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,711
Before they do,
we'll have an escort vessel.

817
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,547
There. It's already done.

818
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:47,782
And we have the time to examine
the Locus Solus technique

819
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:50,188
that infused dolls with souls.

820
01:28:51,226 --> 01:28:53,126
Haven't you cracked it?

821
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:58,222
You've got a hunch, too. Right?

822
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:18,985
It's absolutely silent.
They must have sealed it off.

823
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,835
[Major] Ghost dubbing.

824
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:38,737
In past animal experiments, scientists
mass replicated inferior copies,

825
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:43,743
but had to abandon the practice
as it destroyed the original being.

826
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:47,804
[Batou] But Locus Solus brainwashed
girls supplied by the Kojinkai mob,

827
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,749
dubbing their ghosts onto gynoids.

828
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:56,221
[Batou] It was the ghost that made
Locus Solus gynoids so desirable.

829
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:02,188
[faint girl's voice] Help me...

830
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:18,672
Help me...

831
01:30:55,717 --> 01:30:57,651
[whimpering]

832
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:03,980
You came to help me.
Mr. Volkerson promised...

833
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:08,188
The police would come and rescue me.

834
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:13,097
I was stage four, but my friend Soana,
is already stage five.

835
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:17,399
She can't hear anything
and never answers anymore.

836
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:22,910
[Major] Volkerson, the murdered
inspector revised their ethics code.

837
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,743
Exposed, the yakuza served him up
to avenge the crime boss.

838
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:29,248
But Volkerson was right.

839
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:35,117
If the robots made trouble,
someone would notice.

840
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:38,124
Someone would come to save us.

841
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:42,487
[Batou] Didn't he consider the victims?

842
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,027
Not the humans.

843
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:52,801
What about the dolls
endowed with souls?

844
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,338
But... but...

845
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:04,312
I didn't want to become a doll!

846
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:07,150
[girl crying]

847
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:15,689
[Major] “We weep for the bird's cry,
but not for the blood of a fish.

848
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:18,231
Blessed are those who have voice."

849
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,824
If the dolls could speak,

850
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:24,133
no doubt they'd scream,
“I didn't want to become human."

851
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:29,802
Let me ask you this,
do you consider yourself happy?

852
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:35,509
[Major] A nostalgic value, I suppose.
At least I am free of qualms.

853
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:44,854
“Let one walk alone, committing no sin,
with few wishes."

854
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:48,555
[Batou] "Like an elephant
in the forest."

855
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,055
[Major] Always remember, Batou...

856
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:57,901
Whenever you enter the Net,
I'll be by your side.

857
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,575
I'm going.

858
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,207
[panting, barking]

859
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:50,356
She showed up on that boat,
didn’t she? Your guardian angel.

860
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,654
[Togusa] Clamming up again, eh? Why?
You think I'd report you?

861
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:58,062
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

862
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:01,590
I owe you for looking after him.

863
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:05,529
Why don't you come in?

864
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:10,007
Hanging out with someone else's
family just isn't my thing.

865
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:16,142
[little girl] My present, my present!

866
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:18,412
- [Togusa] I remembered, see?
- [girl shouts]

867
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,579
[Togusa laughs]

868
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,389
[dog whimpers]

869
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:55,418
