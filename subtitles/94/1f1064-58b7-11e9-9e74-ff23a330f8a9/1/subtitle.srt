1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,600
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,760
Right.

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,840
Come on through.

4
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,840
20 minutes and we were gonna
start looking for you.

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,360
Yeah. It's really something out there.

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,440
- You look a mess, sir.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,520
Your turn next, Ginsburg.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,960
OK. I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,720
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,200
What was that you were you saying?

11
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,840
You used to hear her chant
all night long. "Om mahney pod me om."

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,320
"- Om mahney pod me om."
- Over the plants?

13
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,600
She'd cup her hands over those seeds
and chant by the hour.

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,680
She grew the most beautiful
wandoos you ever saw, man.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Primo stuff. Resin city.

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,520
<i>Stand clear.</i>

17
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,040
The commander's been worried
about you. The roads must be a bear.

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,280
- What roads?
- Visibility.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,920
Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't
been on time for the last six months.

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,600
- I wrote you guys up in the logbook.
- Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Good night, gentlemen!

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,680
So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,360
Sinsemilla. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,440
Lay you out flat, man.

25
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,440
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
Give it a thump with your finger.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,200
Alarm reset.

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,080
Skybird, this is Dropkick with
a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
<i>Break. Break. Red dash Alpha.</i>

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,760
- Stand by to copy message.
- Standing by.

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,040
Romeo Oscar November Charlie

33
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Tango Tango Lima Alpha.

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,760
Authentication: 220040 Delta

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Lima.</i>

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,440
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

37
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,920
I agree with authentication also, sir.

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,760
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Target selection: Complete.
Time on target sequence: Complete.

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,040
- Yield selection: Complete.
- Begin countdown. Tminus 60.

42
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

43
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,680
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,920
On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

45
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,480
Three... two... one...

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,480
- Mark.
- Tminus 50.

47
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,120
Roger. At Set.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
- Sir?
- Tminus 40.

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,160
- Enable missiles.
- Number one enabled. Two enabled.

50
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,440
- Three enabled.
- Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Seven... eight...

52
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Nine...

53
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,680
Ten. All missiles enabled.

54
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,840
- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line.
- That's not the correct procedure.

55
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,200
- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF.
- That's not the procedure.

56
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,440
I want somebody on the goddamn phone
before I kill 20 million people.

57
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>T minus 20.</i>

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,520
I got nothin' here! They might
have been knocked out already.

59
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,160
Right.

60
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,360
On my mark,
rotate launch keys to Launch.

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,640
Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

62
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,000
- Fourteen...
- Thirteen... twelve...

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
Eleven...

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,640
<i>Seven... six...</i>

65
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
- Five...
- Sir, we have a launch order.

66
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,120
- Three... two...
- Put your hand on the key, sir.

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
<i>One... Launch!</i>

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,920
- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Turn your key, sir!

70
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,520
They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

71
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,280
- Hello. I'm Pat Healy.
- I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

72
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant.
I've got some passes for you here.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,760
We had scheduled a meeting
pending your arrival.

74
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,480
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

75
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I'd be happy to fill you in
if there's any way I can.

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,960
They're here.

77
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
Good.

78
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,160
Let's go.

79
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,160
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators. No congressmen.

80
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,480
I wish they'd brought a few senators.
I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

81
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,160
John, please! Don't start that right away.

82
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,800
I had them on the phone
and they're calmed down.

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Well, are we positive that these men had
no way of knowing this was only a test?

84
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times
are we gonna go through this?

85
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,880
- It doesn't make any difference.
- I've spoken to these men.

86
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,240
They all believed it was the real deal.

87
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Look, we gotta be on a plane
in less than an hour.

88
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
I have to explain to the president
why 22% of his missile commanders

89
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,800
failed to launch their missiles. What
am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

90
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,440
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,320
I've ordered a re-evaluation of
our psychological screening procedure.

92
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,720
Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

93
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,800
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

94
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,040
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!
You can't screen out human response!

95
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Those men know what it means to turn
the keys, and some are just not up to it!

96
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,480
Now, it's as simple as that!

97
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,640
I think we oughta take
the men out of the loop.

98
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,200
- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.
- Why am I out of line?

99
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,800
Excuse me!

100
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Take them out of the loop?

101
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,120
Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

103
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,400
For myself, I sleep pretty well at night
knowing those boys are down there.

104
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,480
General, we know they're fine men,
but in a nuclear war we can't afford

105
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,240
to have missiles
lying dormant in those silos

106
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,040
because those men refuse to turn
the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

107
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,320
You mean when
the president orders them to.

108
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,960
The president will probably follow
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

109
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,720
I imagine the Joint Chiefs
will have some input.

110
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,360
- You're damn tootin'.
- Well, hell...

111
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,880
In a surprise attack, there's no time.

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,440
23 minutes from warning to impact.

113
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
- Six minutes if it's sub-launched.
- Six minutes.

114
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,400
That's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

115
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Once he makes the decision,
the computer should take over.

116
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,040
Now, sir, I know that you've got
a plane waiting for you,

117
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,560
but if you could indulge me,
I'd like to show you something.

118
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,920
These computers give instant access
to the state of the world.

119
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,360
Troop movements, Soviet
missile tests, weather patterns.

120
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,160
It all flows into this room,
and then into the WOPR computer.

121
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,680
- WOPR? What is that?
- War Operation Plan Response.

122
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
This is Mr Richter.

123
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,360
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

124
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,840
Well, the WOPR spends all its time
thinking about World War III.

125
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,880
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
it plays an endless series of war games

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
using all available information
on the state of the world.

127
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,280
The WOPR has already fought
World War III, as a game,

128
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,360
time and time again.

129
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,560
It estimates Soviet responses
to our responses

130
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,880
to their responses, and so on.

131
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,480
Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

132
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Then it looks for ways
to improve its score...

133
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,720
The point is that the key decisions

134
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
of every option have already
been made by the WOPR.

135
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,480
So all this trillion-dollar hardware
is really at the mercy

136
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,880
of those men with the little brass keys?

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
That's exactly right. Whose only problem
is that they're human beings.

138
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,320
But in 30 days we could put in electronic
relays. Get the men out of the loop.

139
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Gentlemen...

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,560
I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of
microchips further than I could throw it.

141
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,080
I don't know if you wanna trust the safety
of our country to some... silicon diode...

142
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,680
Nobody is talking about entrusting
the safety of the nation

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,760
to a machine, for God's sake!

144
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,800
We'll keep control,
but here at the top where it belongs.

145
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,240
All right, gentlemen.

146
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I think I'm going to recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

147
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,880
And I'll get back to you on this.

148
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,600
You won't regret this.

149
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,960
OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

150
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,760
Damn!

151
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,080
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Howie!

152
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

153
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,200
- You wanna take this over? I gotta go.
- Sure!

154
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,280
- Go ahead.
- Thanks!

155
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,760
- Bye, David!
- Bye!

156
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,680
All right. Question number two.

157
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,360
Seeds that are germinated in water
before they are planted will... what?

158
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
- Robert?
- Sprout roots?

159
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,480
Ah! David!

160
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,880
Nice of you to join us.
Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

161
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,440
Question number four.
In the history of science,

162
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
novel and innovative concepts
occasionally arise

163
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,520
from sudden left-field inspiration.

164
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,320
Miss Mack...

165
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Could you tell us your answer
to question number four?

166
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,160
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

167
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,640
Love?

168
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,920
Jennifer, what do you know about
nitrogen nodules that we don't?

169
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,440
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

170
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,960
- No.
- I see.

171
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,240
No, you didn't know
the correct answer - symbiosis.

172
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,600
Because you don't pay attention in class.

173
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,200
There seems to be a lot of confusion on
this next question - asexual reproduction.

175
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,400
Could someone tell me, please

176
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,680
who first suggested the idea
of reproduction without sex?

177
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,160
- Miss Mack!
- Yes?

178
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,800
What is so amusing?

179
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,040
What?

180
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,760
All right, Lightman.

181
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Maybe you can tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex.

182
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,280
Your wife?

183
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
Get out, Lightman! Get out!

184
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,120
Mr Ligget wants me to discuss
my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

185
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,480
I think Mr Kessler's getting tired
of your attitude problem.

186
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,160
Me, too.

187
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Lightman. What a... surprise.

188
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,080
Won't you come in?

189
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Hi!

190
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Hi!

191
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,560
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

192
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,640
That's OK. You were perfect.

193
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
- I was?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
- You want a ride home?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,800
Hop on.

196
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,840
- So you got an F on that test today, too?
- Yep.

197
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,640
Guess we're both gonna be
stuck in summer school.

198
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,560
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

199
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

200
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,040
- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not?
- Make a left.

201
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Why don't you come up to my house
and I'll show you?

202
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,240
What are you gonna show me?

203
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how you do it.

204
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,400
- Hi, Bo!
- Oh! Hi, Bo!

205
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,480
Hey, Bo! How you doin'?

206
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,240
My room's upstairs.

207
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

208
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,760
A little mess.

209
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,840
It's OK. You should see my room.

210
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,720
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

211
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,120
- What are you doing?
- I'm dialling into the school's computer.

212
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,440
They change the password every couple
of weeks, but I know where they write it.

213
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,480
- Are those your grades?!
- Yeah.

214
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,800
I don't think that I deserved an F, do you?

215
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,040
- You can't do that!
- Already done.

216
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,440
- Do you have a middle initial?
- K. Katherine.

217
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,160
Those are my grades.

218
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,920
- How can anybody get a D in home ec?
- That's none of your business.

219
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,320
- Can you erase this?
- No. It's too late.

220
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
What are you doing?

221
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,120
- I'm changing your biology grade.
- No. You'll get me in trouble.

222
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,040
Nobody can find out. You got a C!
Now you won't go to summer school.

223
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't...

224
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,400
- I said change it back.
- OK. OK.

225
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,080
I guess I'd better get going.

226
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,520
Thanks for the ride.

227
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
Yeah. OK. Bye.

228
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,440
Bye.

229
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Get down. Get down. You've already
had your dinner. Now just sit.

230
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Sit! Stay!

231
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,480
- Don't forget to take out the garbage.
- David.

232
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,360
- Put that lid on real tight.
- I know, Ma.

233
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

234
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,160
Sure. I think we can really work out
some creative financing.

235
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh, but you've gotta see it!

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,640
There's a Jacuzzi
in the master bedroom...

237
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,840
Oh, sure. We can work that out.

238
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,840
That is true. You'll have a balloon
payment at the end of five years.

239
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,280
But that's nothing.
The economy is gonna be great then.

240
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,360
He who dances must pay the piper.

241
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,120
- See you, Dad.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye.

242
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,960
You know, I worry about that kid.

243
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,040
Why?

244
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,360
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

245
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,320
This corn is raw!

246
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,960
I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp.

247
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,840
- Of course it's crisp! It's raw!
- It's terrific!

248
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,960
You can just taste the vitamin
A and D in here. It's great.

249
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Couldn't we have pills,
and cook the corn?

250
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,840
- What city, please?
- For Sunnyvale, California.

251
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,920
The number for Protovision.

252
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,160
<i>Yes. That's 5558632.</i>

253
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,120
Thank you. Could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

254
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,480
<i>There's 399, 437, 767, 936.</i>

255
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,960
Thanks.

256
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,160
Protovision... I have you now.

257
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,840
<i>Yes?</i>

258
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,080
<i>Saul's Fish Market.</i>

259
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,720
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

260
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
What?

261
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,120
I've been thinking.
That thing with my grade.

262
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,800
- Can you still change it?
- Oh, I don't know...

263
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,560
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've just let you do it.

264
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,640
- I don't know. It might be kinda rough.
- Why?

265
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,000
They might have changed the password.

266
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try?

267
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,800
- Damn!
- Please.

268
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,240
OK.

269
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,840
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game.

270
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,760
- What's it doing?
- Oh. It's dialling numbers.

271
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,440
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

272
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,960
Excuse me.

273
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,360
This computer company's coming out
with these amazing new games soon.

274
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,280
The programs are probably
still on their computer.

275
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,880
So I told my system to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

276
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,720
They answer with a tone that other
computers can recognise. You hear?

277
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,200
You're calling every number
in Sunnyvale?

278
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,120
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

279
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,840
You can go to jail for that.

280
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,000
Only if you're over 18.

281
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Is this going to take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

282
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,080
Oh. That's funny, actually.

283
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,160
Cos...

284
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,360
I already changed it.

285
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,680
- I told you not to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,720
But I figured you'd change your mind.
I didn't want you to flunk.

287
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,040
- Well, what did I get?
- You got a D.

288
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,480
- You gave me a D?
- No. You got an A.

289
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,520
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

290
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,720
Well, that's OK.

291
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,960
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

292
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,600
Excuse me.

293
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,680
Did you really give me an A?

294
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,760
Yeah.

295
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

296
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,600
Hey! You got a bank!

297
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Gotta make a note of that one.
Might come in handy someday.

298
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
Pan Am.

299
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,320
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere?

300
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,400
- Anywhere.
- New York?

301
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,240
- New York. OK.
- No, Paris. Paris.

302
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,160
Will you be travelling alone?

303
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,920
Yeah... No. You wanna go with me?

304
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
OK.

305
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,760
- All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

306
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,520
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 114

307
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,400
leaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport
at 8.15am on 18 August.

308
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,920
Do we need a rental car? No.

309
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,480
- Do we really have tickets to Paris?
- No. You have a reservation though.

310
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,800
It doesn't identify itself.

311
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,120
Try anything.

312
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,680
Connection terminated. How rude.

313
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,760
We'll ask it for help.

314
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,000
- Can you do that?
- On some systems.

315
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
The more complicated they are,
the more they have to help you out.

316
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,880
Now what?

317
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,640
Help games.

318
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,400
Games refers to models,
simulations and games

319
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,560
which have strategic applications.
What does that mean?

320
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,640
I don't know. That's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer.

321
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,160
List games.

322
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Oh, my God!

323
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,120
So these guys can tell you
what that print-out means?

324
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,040
They probably invented it
in the first place.

325
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,480
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

326
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,400
- Cos these guys can get a little nervous.
- OK.

327
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,240
Jim.

328
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,440
Oh. Lightman.

329
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,240
Hi, Lightman!

330
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,320
I want you to take a look at this.

331
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,240
- Hey! What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

332
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,520
Wow! Where'd you get this?

333
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,040
Protovision. I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

334
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,520
- Can I have this?
- I'm not through yet.

335
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,480
Remember you told me to tell you when
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

336
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
You're doing it right now.

337
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,240
Theatrewide biotoxic
and chemical warfare.

338
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,120
- This didn't come from Protovision.
- Ask him where it did come from, Jim!

339
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
- I told you already.
- Looks military to me. Definitely.

340
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,200
- Probably classified, too.
- If it's military, why does it have games

341
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,440
- like checkers and backgammon?
- Those games teach basic strategy.

342
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,640
Jim, how do I get into that system?
I wanna play those games.

343
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,840
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

344
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,560
- You'll never get in.
- No system is totally secure.

345
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,040
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- I bet you he couldn't!

346
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,560
- I bet you he could.
- You won't get through frontline security.

347
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,000
- But you might look for a back door.
- I can't believe it, Jim!

348
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,040
That girl's listening,
and you talk about back doors!

349
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,280
Mr Potato-head.

350
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,200
Mr Potato-head!
Back doors are not secrets!

351
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,080
- You're giving away all our best tricks.
- They're not tricks.

352
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,080
- What's a back door?
- Whenever I design a system

353
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
I put in a password
that only I know about.

354
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

355
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,040
I can bypass whatever security they've
added on. That's basically what it is.

356
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah?

357
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,560
OK. You really wanna get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

358
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,840
Come on! I don't even
know the guy's name.

359
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,840
Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are
so dumb. I got this thing all figured out.

360
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it?

361
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,560
The first game in the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

362
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,360
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

363
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,440
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

364
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah. He's up in his room.

365
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,640
Thanks.

366
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,440
Have you ever heard
of the word tumulus?

367
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,280
Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry.

368
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,360
Neither have I.

369
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,520
Yeah?

370
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,800
Hi!

371
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,640
- Where have you been?
- What?

372
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,840
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

373
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,680
No, no. I was...

374
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,840
I was doing things.
You wanna sit down? How are you?

375
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,440
- No. I'm going to get some water, OK?
- OK.

376
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,040
- What is all that stuff?
- Oh, it's nothing. I was just...

377
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,160
I was trying to find out about the guy
who designed those game programs,

378
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,560
so I could get his secret password.

379
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,200
- Why?
- Why? Cos...

380
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,400
What's so special about playing
games with some machine?

381
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,680
Oh, no...

382
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,920
No, it's not just some machine.

383
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,360
Here. Look at this.

384
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,960
This is a tape that I got from the library.

385
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
It's about this guy named Falken.

386
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,320
He was into games as well as computers.

387
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,080
He designed them so that
they could play checkers or poker.

388
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,480
- Chess.
- What's so great about that?

389
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,080
- Everybody's doing that now.
- Oh, no, no. What he did was great!

390
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,520
He designed his computer
so it could learn from its mistakes.

391
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
So they'd be better
the next time they played.

392
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,920
The system actually learned how to learn.

393
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,720
It could teach itself.

394
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,520
If I could just get that damn password,
I could play the computer.

395
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,160
That's him. That's Falken.

396
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
That's him? Wow!

397
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,440
He's amazing-looking!

398
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,440
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

399
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,880
No. He's dead.

400
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,760
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

401
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,920
Here. Look. Here's his obituary.

402
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,960
- He wasn't very old.
- Well, he was pretty old. He was 41.

403
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

404
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,360
That's his little boy.

405
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,440
Oh, yeah?

406
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,560
This is really sad. Did you know the child
and his mother were killed in a car crash?

407
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
- I know.
- In the years that followed

408
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,840
the tragic loss of his family,
Dr Falken's health deteriorated.

409
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,520
My dad is 45.

410
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
- Once he was really sick...
- What was his name?

411
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,040
- My father?
- No, no, no. Falken's kid.

412
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,960
Joshua.

413
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,960
It can't be that simple.

414
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
- Wow!
- What?

415
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,120
We got something.

416
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,400
We're in!

417
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,920
It thinks I'm Falken!

418
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,240
Hello.

419
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,640
- How can it ask you that?
- It'll ask whatever it's programmed to.

420
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,720
- Do you wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah!

421
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,360
I'll ask it how it feels.

422
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm fine. How are... you?

423
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,400
Excellent. It's been a long time.

424
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,600
Can you explain the removal of
your user account on June 23rd, 1973?

425
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,680
They must have told it he died.

426
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,600
People sometimes make... mistakes.

427
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,320
- Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

428
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,440
It's not a real voice. This box interprets
signals and turns them into sound.

429
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,960
<i>Shall we play a game?</i>

430
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,440
Oh!

431
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,280
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

432
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Love to!

433
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:08,080
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

434
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,120
Wouldn't you prefer
a good game of chess?

435
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,200
Later.

436
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,360
Let's play

437
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,480
Global Thermonuclear War.

438
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,360
<i>Fine.</i>

439
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
All right!

440
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,720
Wow!

441
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,200
Which side do you want?

442
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,200
I'll be the Russians.

443
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
<i>Please list primary targets.</i>

444
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,040
- Who shall we nuke first?
- Let's see.

445
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,840
How about... Las Vegas?

446
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,320
Las Vegas! Great!

447
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,520
- What next? Seattle!
- Yeah!

448
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,680
Kill 'em!

449
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,480
I have seven, correction, eight Red birds
two degrees past apogee.

450
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,600
Better get the old man down here.

451
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,760
We have Soviet missile warning.

452
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,280
Check for malfunction
and report confidence.

453
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,480
Projected target areas
NORAD regions 25, 26.

454
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,040
This is Crystal Palace initiating
emergency conference. Stand by!

455
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,080
19 degrees past apogee.

456
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,400
Possible 18 targets in track.
Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu.

457
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,160
- What you got up here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

458
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,400
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

459
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,120
Estimated impact: 11 minutes.
Target area: Western United States.

460
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,400
- Why didn't we get a launch detection?
- We're checking for DSP malfunction.

461
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,120
BMEWS has continuous radar tracking
on inbounds.

462
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,160
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

463
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,120
- What is all that stuff?
- Trajectory headings

464
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,640
- for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles.
- What does that mean?

465
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,720
I don't know. But it's great!

466
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,560
- Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

467
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,840
- Blow 'em up.
- Blow 'em out of the water.

468
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,560
- What's a trajectory heading?
- I've no idea.

469
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,680
The president's diverting to Andrews.
The vice president is out of position.

470
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,880
- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on...
- Missile warning reports no malfunction.

471
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,960
Take us to DEFCON 3.

472
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,720
Get onto SAC.
Tell 'em to flush the bombers.

473
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,160
Yes, sir.

474
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,880
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

475
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

476
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,880
Inbounds presently MIRVing.

477
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,480
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

478
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,840
- New time to impact: Eight minutes.
- SAC is launching the bombers.

479
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,600
- General Powers is on the line.
- Beringer.

480
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,800
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite.

481
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,960
Radar picked 'em up already out of the
atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it.

482
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,760
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

483
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,600
- Get me the president on the horn.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,880
Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD.

485
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,960
Oh, attack!

486
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,680
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give 'em the works.

487
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,760
David!

488
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,040
Excuse me.

489
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,120
David!

490
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,880
How many times have I told you
to fasten these lids on tight?!

491
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,760
- Look at this mess!
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

492
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,480
Now! Come down now!
I want this cleared up now!

493
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,520
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to pronto, David.

494
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

495
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,440
- You wanna invite your little friend?
- Please!

496
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,600
David!

497
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,720
Shit!

498
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,280
Little friend.

499
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,040
Mr President, something's happening.
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

500
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,200
- What's happening, Joe?
- BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

501
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,480
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

502
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,120
Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady.

503
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,680
Stop! It's a simulation!
There's an attack simulation running!

504
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,160
What the hell's he yelling about?
I didn't order that.

505
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,040
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

506
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,760
Whoa, now! Hold it!

507
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,000
You're not supposed to be runnin' here.

508
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,080
We don't know how it happened.

509
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,960
Someone outside fed an attack simulation
into the main... It's a simulation!

510
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,560
Conley...

511
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,480
Take us off full alert.

512
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,200
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly
what in the hell's happening here!

513
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,560
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line!

514
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,320
They shut down
before we could complete our trace.

515
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,480
We did locate the area
where the transmission originated.

516
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,560
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

517
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,480
Shut it down!

518
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,720
Somebody's playing a game with us.

519
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,280
At a prophylactic recycling centre...

520
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,360
Hi, Dad!

521
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,360
David!

522
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,240
- David, come in here!
- What did I do?

523
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,320
Plenty, mister. Plenty.

524
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

525
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,480
Congratulations, dear!

526
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,560
Show this to your dad.

527
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,880
Honey! David has something to show you.

528
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,960
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

529
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,840
Uh-oh.

530
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,000
This is good!

531
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,080
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,400
... went on a full-scale nuclear alert,

533
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,560
believing the Soviet Union
<i>had launched a missile attack.</i>

534
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,000
A spokesman places blame
on a computer malfunction,

535
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,080
emphasising that the problem
has been corrected.

536
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
For more on the story,
let's go live to Washington DC.

537
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,960
Well, that's your phone.

538
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,040
Yeah.

539
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Seriously, David. Congratulations.
This one'll be a pleasure to sign!

540
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,040
- Hello?
- David?

541
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,880
Are you watching the news?

542
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,480
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

543
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,160
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?

544
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,640
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

545
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
What am I gonna do? They're gonna
come get me. I'm really screwed!

546
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,840
<i>I'm screwed!</i>

547
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,600
No! Sh! Calm down!
Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen...

548
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,520
If they were so smart,
they would have found you already.

549
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,600
Yeah.

550
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,960
OK. So all you have to do is throw
the number away and don't call it again.

551
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,280
- That's all.
- Yeah.

552
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,160
- Maybe they didn't trace the call.
- Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call.

553
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,040
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.
All you have to do is act normal.

554
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,960
We'll both act normal
and everything will be fine.

555
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,320
<i>OK?</i>

556
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,400
- OK.
- OK.

557
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,960
God! This is so unbelievable!
Can I call Michelle and tell her?

558
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,120
No, Jennifer! Don't call her!

559
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,960
Sorry. All right. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

560
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,400
OK. Good night, Jennifer.

561
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,400
Greetings, Professor Falken.

562
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,040
Oh, my God.

563
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,280
Incorrect identification.

564
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,640
I am not Falken.

565
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,680
Falken is dead.

566
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,760
Sorry to hear that, Professor.

567
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,240
<i>Yesterday's game was interrupted.</i>

568
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,080
Although primary goal has not yet
been achieved, solution is near.

569
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,400
<i>Game time elapsed:</i>
31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds.

570
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,280
<i>Estimated time remaining:</i>
52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds.

571
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,640
What is the primary goal?

572
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,440
You should know, Professor.
You programmed me.

573
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,520
Oh, come on.

574
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,200
What is the primary goal?

575
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,320
To win the game.

576
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,160
David Lightman, hold it right there. FBI.

577
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,800
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over to the van.

578
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,600
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

579
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,680
What did I do?

580
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
You have the right
to consult with an attorney

581
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,560
and to have one present
during questioning.

582
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,320
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

583
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,800
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

584
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,360
Are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

585
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,440
All right. Let's move.

586
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,200
This rather large room
is command centre for NORAD.

587
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,640
No picture taking. The screens in front
of you are connected to our satellites

588
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,840
and missile tracking stations
throughout the country.

589
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,960
This is the commander's desk.
Colonel Conley is in charge.

590
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,720
Would you mind relinquishing
your command, sir?

591
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,560
Miss Dailey, would you come
and sit in this rather important chair?

592
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,080
These buttons are connected
with the Strategic Air Command

593
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
and missile launching stations.

594
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,560
Miss Dailey, would you press
this button here? The red one.

595
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,560
- The one in the middle?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,040
Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

597
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,600
It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything.
Look what you did do.

598
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,480
Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham.

599
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,000
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

600
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,120
He said, Colonel Thomas, why are we
at DEFCON 4? as we are right now.

601
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,200
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

602
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,120
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

603
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,960
We told them it was just an exercise, but
we want them to relax their posture first.

604
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,280
Wait. Wait.

605
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,800
- Give me that.
- Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

606
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,880
Just what we need today. Why don't they
go to Disneyland where they belong?

607
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.
- OK. All set? Oh, here.

608
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,000
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

609
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,840
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

610
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,920
The phone company screwed up!

611
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,920
- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

612
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,440
George is with the FBI.
He brought the kid in.

613
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,680
It looks like we've got
a high-school prank on our hands.

614
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,560
Paul, what happened?

615
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,240
The kid broke into the war game using a
password left by the original programmer.

616
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,880
- A password?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,960
None of my team even knew it was there.

618
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,680
Kid claims
he was looking for a toy company.

619
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,920
That's great!
Anybody in here buy that one?

620
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,720
We can find the password and take it out,
but it might help to beef up security.

621
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,760
Oh. Beef up, huh?

622
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,880
How about screwed up?

623
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,560
We did all that and he broke in again.

624
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,320
Kid says your computer called him.

625
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,960
What the hell is going on, John?

626
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,000
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

627
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,120
You know what an idiot that makes me
look? Not to mention the general.

628
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,320
I think we're being a little naive here.

629
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,400
There is no way a high-school punk

630
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,400
can put a dime in a telephone
and break into our system.

631
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,760
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

632
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,560
He fits the profile perfectly.
He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

633
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,360
Alienated from his parents.
Has few friends.

634
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,880
Classic case
for recruitment by the Soviets.

635
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,600
What does this say
about the state of our country?

636
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,080
I mean, have you gotten any insight
as to why a bright boy like this

637
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,440
would jeopardise the lives of millions?

638
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,680
He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

639
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,040
Dammit, John, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now!

640
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,880
- Let me talk to this little prick.
- I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

641
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,480
Come on, Paul.

642
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,960
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

643
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,400
What?

644
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,720
Good morning, sir.

645
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,840
- Where's the Lightman kid?
- In the infirmary, sir.

646
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,520
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

647
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,240
Sergeant, these aren't necessary,
the handcuffs?

648
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,760
No, sir.

649
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,960
Well, David, we called your parents.

650
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,320
We told them everything's fine.

651
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,200
No charges have been filed... yet.

652
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,880
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

653
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,760
How much time?

654
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,120
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

655
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Oh, of course.

656
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,600
Sergeant, would you tell the OD
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

657
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,240
Let's go down to my office.
We'll be more comfortable there.

658
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,320
Go ahead.

659
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,680
You used to work with Stephen Falken?

660
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,200
I started as his assistant.
How d'you know?

661
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,560
I read an article you wrote with him
on poker and nuclear war.

662
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,000
Bluffing. Yeah,
that shook a few people up.

663
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,080
- He must have been pretty amazing.
- He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

664
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,120
He never understood the practical uses
of his... of his work.

665
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,360
This machine over here
runs his game program.

666
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,520
Joshua.

667
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,600
Come here a minute, David.

668
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,480
See that sign up here? Up here?

669
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,200
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

670
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,560
That indicates
our current defence condition.

671
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,440
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

672
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,000
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

673
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,360
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,
it might have gone to DEFCON 1.

674
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,640
- You know what that means, David?
- No. What does that mean?

675
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,280
World War III.

676
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
Wow.

677
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,560
You broke into our system
just to play a game, right?

678
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,960
That's right. That's exactly right.

679
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,920
After the news, you must have
realised how serious it was.

680
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,280
- Why'd you do it again?
- I didn't do it again.

681
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,200
- I even threw the number away.
- They found it in the trash.

682
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,600
Joshua called me.

683
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,520
Hey!

684
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,880
Look at that! That's some setup.

685
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,120
- What did you say?
- This is some setup.

686
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,960
No, no. Before that.

687
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,040
Joshua called me.

688
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,720
David, machines don't call people.

689
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,000
Yours did.

690
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,600
Who are you going to Paris with?

691
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,680
Paris? Oh!

692
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,520
No... You don't understand.

693
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,000
You had reservations for two to Paris.

694
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,280
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

695
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,200
Why don't I believe you?

696
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,640
I don't think I should say anything else
until I talk to a lawyer.

697
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,120
I think we'd better forget
about the lawyer crap

698
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,760
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

699
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,480
Are you gonna answer the phone?

700
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,560
Hello.

701
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,880
Yeah.

702
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,960
What?

703
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,640
All right. I'll be right down.

704
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,560
You stay here. Don't move.

705
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,080
What's going on?

706
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,920
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

707
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,360
- What the hell's he sayin'?
- In English.

708
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,760
I'll give it to you. Somebody got
into Mr McKittrick's system

709
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,520
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

710
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,280
There's no cause for alarm.
The system won't accept a launch code

711
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,960
unless we're at DEFCON 1.
I can change those codes in an hour.

712
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,480
Well, who did this?

713
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,400
I think the kid's working
with somebody on the outside.

714
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,960
I don't know what they're up to, but
I don't want our bombers on the ground.

715
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,160
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

716
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,680
- Where are you?
- Sir.

717
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,960
Get me an update on those subs. I wanna
know what those bastards are up to.

718
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,160
Joshua.

719
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,480
Greetings, Professor Falken.

720
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,560
Hello.

721
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,320
Are you still playing the game?

722
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,040
Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1

723
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,800
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

724
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,240
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

725
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,720
69% of the housing destroyed.

726
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,840
72 million people dead?

727
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,360
Is this a game

728
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,520
or is it real?

729
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,600
<i>What's the difference?</i>

730
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,800
Oh, wow.

731
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,920
You are a hard man to reach.

732
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,000
Could not find you in Seattle

733
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,720
and no terminal is in operation
at your classified address.

734
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,600
What classified address?

735
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,400
DOD pension files
<i>indicate current mailing as:</i>

736
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,880
Dr Robert Hume.

737
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,760
<i>AKA Stephen WFalken.</i>

738
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,560
5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose Island, Oregon 97...

739
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,520
Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick?
I think I know what's going on.

740
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,200
I'm escorting you to Denver
where you'll be placed under arrest,

741
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,120
- pending indictment for espionage.
- Espionage?!

742
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,680
Let me talk to him!
He's right over there.

743
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,760
- Get that bastard out of the war room!
- No! It's Joshua!

744
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,840
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

745
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,080
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

746
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,120
Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please,
call him. Please, call him. Call him!

747
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,640
What the hell's he doing in here anyway?

748
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,000
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

749
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:21,440
Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent
with use of marijuana and possibly PCP.

750
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,240
Depending on what information you want,
there's a button to press.

751
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,240
Let's say I wanted to find out
how to hit a backhand.

752
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,800
I don't think I have the right program.

753
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,400
Excuse me. What do you want?

754
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,800
Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

755
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,880
Excuse me.

756
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,400
Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick.

757
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,480
You can't talk to anybody.
The FBI'll be here any minute.

758
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,920
- Do you have to take a leak or not?
- No.

759
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,200
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

760
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,280
Stop it!

761
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,120
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

762
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,440
I'll get the elevator.

763
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,520
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

764
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,200
I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

765
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,280
Will you stop it?!

766
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,360
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

767
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,000
- Do you want me to leave?
- Yes.

768
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,320
I want this door open right now.

769
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,120
- How about getting on the phone?
- Is there a technician?

770
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,040
Hey, Scooter! Wait up.

771
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,320
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

772
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,400
OK. I'll be right with you.

773
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,840
- I think it's jammed from inside.
- Come on.

774
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,320
David! Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

775
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,880
OK.

776
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,960
Let's go.

777
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,160
Right this way, folks. I've been informed

778
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,640
that they're cleaning the floors
in the computer centre.

779
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,680
Don't want anyone to slip and hurt
themselves, so we'll end the tour here.

780
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,120
If I can ask you to board the bus
as quickly as possible,

781
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,240
you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting for each of you.

782
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,200
Hold it! What are you doing?

783
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,400
Got it. Here it comes.

784
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,520
- You kids think you own this place?
- Oh! I was... just looking around.

785
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,600
You're not supposed to leave the group.
So get back there!

786
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,320
OK. Excuse me.
Thank you very much, sir.

787
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,160
Out of the way.

788
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,680
Thank you. Careful there.

789
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,000
Take care. Watch your step.

790
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,960
- Bye.
- Bye now.

791
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,560
Watch your step.

792
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,080
- Check everywhere. He can't be far.
- Move it, will you?

793
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,080
- Thanks.
- Take care.

794
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,160
Bye.

795
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,600
- What city, please?
- Goose Island, Oregon, please.

796
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,240
The number for Dr Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

797
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,000
Checking under Dr Robert Hume,
H- U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road,

798
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,880
I find no listing.

799
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

800
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,640
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

801
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,720
Oh, wait.

802
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,000
Falken. Dr Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

803
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,720
I find no listing
for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

804
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,040
on Tall Cedar Road, Goose Island.

805
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,040
Thank you.

806
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,760
Yeah?

807
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,560
Jennifer? It's me. David.

808
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,320
- David?
- Yeah.

809
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,720
Listen, I'm in Colorado

810
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,040
and I need a really big favour.

811
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,440
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

812
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,360
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back when I can.

813
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,400
I need a ticket from Grand Junction,
Colorado to Oregon.

814
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,480
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

815
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,760
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

816
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,760
I went by your house.
Your parents were just freaked.

817
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,960
There are men around from the FBI
asking questions.

818
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,040
I can't talk about it right now.

819
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,440
When you buy the ticket, tell them that
I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport.

820
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,480
David, what's happening?

821
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,760
I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone.
Please, will you just do this for me?

822
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,800
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

823
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,720
22 Typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

824
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,160
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

825
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,400
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

826
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,880
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me
eat none of them damn fish eggs.

827
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,520
Give me an update...

828
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,320
Sir, the Soviets deny any increase
in their submarine deployment.

829
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,640
They wanna know
why we're provoking them.

830
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,600
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

831
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,240
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

832
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,160
Surprise!

833
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:10,160
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't sound too good on the phone.

834
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,240
- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble.
- Why?

835
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,720
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

836
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,360
You kids better hustle.
The ferry leaves any second.

837
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,440
Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

838
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,960
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!
- Hold it, hold it!

839
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,200
If he's still alive,
why would the obituary say he's dead?

840
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,280
No, he's not dead. He left.

841
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,720
When they know too much,
they give 'em new identities.

842
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,800
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

843
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,080
The computer that's still playing
the games? It's the military's computer!

844
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,680
- Why wouldn't they know about it?
- They don't know about Joshua.

845
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,440
Falken knows about Joshua. He's
the only one who knows what it can do.

846
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,320
That computer is trying to win the game
that we asked it to play.

847
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,400
For real!

848
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,560
You don't even believe me!

849
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,600
David... David.

850
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,200
- He's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,600
I believe you.

852
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh!

853
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,200
What was that?

854
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,960
I don't know.

855
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,040
Did you see that? There are still people
who won't believe they could fly.

856
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,200
The sky was once filled with them.

857
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,960
- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume.
- Is either of you a palaeontologist?

858
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,040
No. We're high-school students.

859
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,120
Oh... Pity.

860
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,960
Well, high-school students,

861
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,720
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

862
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,800
But

863
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,160
aren't you Stephen Falken?

864
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,120
Now, listen carefully.

865
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,640
Path. Follow path.

866
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,440
Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

867
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,000
Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

868
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,360
Wait! Wait.

869
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,440
I came because of Joshua.

870
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,960
Radar reports two unknown tracks are
penetrating the Alaskan air defence zone.

871
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,200
Confidence is high. Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

872
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,680
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

873
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,240
Go to DEFCON 2.

874
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:41,320
Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.
I have negative radar contact.

875
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,560
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

876
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,640
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

877
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,720
You're almost on top of 'em.

878
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,320
Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

879
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,440
<i>and 40 miles visibility.</i>

880
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,160
There's nothin' out there, General.
<i>Just blue skies.</i>

881
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,240
What the hell?!

882
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,120
- You haven't been listening.
- Yes, I have.

883
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,600
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

884
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,000
A suitably biblical ending for the place,
don't you think?

885
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,640
Are you gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

886
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,800
Now, children, come on over here.
I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

887
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,120
Are you sitting comfortably?

888
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,080
Then I'll begin.

889
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:37,040
Once upon a time, there lived
a magnificent race of animals

890
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,160
who dominated the world
through age after age.

891
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,040
They ran and they swam

892
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,360
and they fought and they flew.

893
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,360
Until suddenly,
quite recently, they disappeared.

894
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,680
Nature just gave up and started again.

895
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,320
We weren't even apes then.

896
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,320
We were just these smart little rodents
hiding in the rocks.

897
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,040
And when we go, nature will start again.

898
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,840
With the bees probably.

899
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,160
Nature knows when to give up, David.

900
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,240
I'm not giving up.

901
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,040
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

902
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,800
My fault? The whole point was
to find a way to practise nuclear war

903
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,880
without destroying ourselves.

904
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,720
To get the computers to learn from
mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

905
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,160
Except I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

906
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,680
What's that?

907
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,000
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

908
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,080
What kind of a lesson is that?

909
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,600
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

910
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,160
Yeah. Of course.

911
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,240
- But you don't any more?
- No.

912
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,480
Why?

913
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,200
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

914
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,360
Exactly. There's no way to win.

915
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,960
The game itself is pointless.

916
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,440
But back at the war room,
they believe you can win a nuclear war.

917
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,080
That there can be acceptable losses.

918
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,240
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

919
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,920
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

920
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,600
Did you know that no land animal

921
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,080
with a body weight of over 50lb
survived that age?

922
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,960
Extinction is part of the natural order.

923
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,440
Bullshit!

924
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,080
If we're extinguished, it's not natural.
It's just stupid!

925
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,560
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

926
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,000
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

927
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,040
A millisecond of brilliant light

928
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,840
and we're vaporised.

929
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,080
Much more fortunate than the millions
who'll wander sightless

930
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,600
through the smouldering aftermath.

931
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,280
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

932
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,280
I'm only 17 years old.

933
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,200
I'm not ready to die yet.

934
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,440
You won't make a simple phone call?

935
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,800
If the real Joshua was still alive,
your Joshua,

936
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,080
- you'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Look, we might gain a few years.

937
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,480
Perhaps time enough for you
to have a son and watch him die.

938
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,800
But humanity
planning its own destruction...

939
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,640
That a phone call won't stop.

940
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:21,440
This is unreal! You don't care about death
cos you're already dead.

941
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,360
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

942
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,760
What was the last thing you cared about?

943
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,440
You've missed the last ferry.

944
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,080
You're welcome to stay.
You want to sleep on the floor?

945
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,440
Good night.

946
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,120
Let's get outta here.

947
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,000
Come on. We'll find a boat.
There's gotta be a boat.

948
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,600
Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States.

949
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,080
And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

950
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,240
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert. Yes, sir...

951
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,320
Well, that's a load of shit!

952
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,960
No, sir. Not you.

953
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,920
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

954
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:48,160
Intelligence reports rumours of a new
Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities.

955
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,920
It can project a false radar image
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

956
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,400
Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows.

957
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,160
I think I saw one.

958
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,040
What kind of an asshole lives on an island
and he doesn't even have a boat?

959
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Maybe we can swim for it.
How far do you think it is?

960
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,400
No. It's two or three miles.

961
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,480
At least. Maybe more.

962
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,240
- Well, what do you say? Let's go for it.
- No.

963
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,920
- Come on.
- No!

964
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,360
I can't swim.

965
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,960
You can't swim?

966
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,040
No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim.

967
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:39,040
What kind of an asshole grows up
in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim?

968
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,240
I never got around to it, OK?

969
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,440
I always thought
there was gonna be plenty of time!

970
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,640
I'm sorry.

971
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,120
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

972
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,240
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world.

973
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,200
Then tomorrow it would just be over.

974
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,400
There wouldn't be any time to be sorry.

975
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,800
About anything.

976
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,960
Oh, Jesus!

977
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,320
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

978
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,400
I swear to God I did.

979
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,320
Did I tell you that next week

980
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,240
I was gonna be on TV?

981
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,600
You're kidding?

982
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,840
On that aerobics show
with some girls from my dad's class.

983
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,840
A movie star.

984
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,880
Yeah!

985
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,400
It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody
would have been watching me anyway.

986
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,680
I would have.

987
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,840
Oh, Jesus!

988
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,920
The bastard turned us in!

989
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,760
<i>It's all right. Get in.</i>

990
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,920
We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

991
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,000
BMEWS has confirmed a massive attack.

992
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,080
- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confidence is high.

993
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,280
- Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?
- This is not an exercise.

994
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,960
General, DPS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

995
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,480
- Tell me this is one of your simulations.
- It's not, Jack.

996
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,160
All right. Flush the bombers.
Get the subs in launch mode.

997
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,120
We are at DEFCON 1.

998
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,240
<i>DEFCON 1.</i>

999
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,200
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1000
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,640
Initial attack profile
is a full-scale Soviet strike.

1001
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,600
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces.

1002
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,040
What does WOPR recommend,
Mr McKittrick?

1003
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,520
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1004
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,240
I need some machine to tell me that?

1005
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,400
President's on his way
to join Airborne Command.

1006
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,200
We have to give launch option.

1007
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,880
- Has he spoken to the premier?
- The Russians deny everything.

1008
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,400
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

1009
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,240
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

1010
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,240
<i>This is Crystal Palace.</i>
We're closing up the mountain.

1011
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,360
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

1012
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,800
Initiate internal power.

1013
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,880
Generators on and functioning.

1014
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,320
External power disconnected.

1015
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,760
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1016
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,640
Shaft locks sealed.

1017
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,240
The gate's closed!

1018
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,400
Is everybody OK?

1019
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,000
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it!

1020
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,200
The gate's gonna shut! Come on!

1021
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,280
Come on!

1022
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,960
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1023
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,880
Hold the goddamn door!

1024
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,480
Come on! Hurry!

1025
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,960
They're clear! They're clear!

1026
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:54,920
All units confirm weapons targeted
and ready. Awaiting launch codes.

1027
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,000
We are in a launch mode.

1028
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,360
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1029
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,440
Roger. Lock out enabled.

1030
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,960
All right. I'll call you back.

1031
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,440
Here!

1032
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,960
I don't know what you think
you can do here, Stephen.

1033
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,640
John! Good to see you!
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1034
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,960
- What has this kid been telling you?
- How far has it gone?

1035
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:37,240
The president's ready for a counterstrike.
That's what we're recommending he do.

1036
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,480
- It's a bluff, John. Call it off.
- No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1037
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,240
Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken.

1038
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,720
Mr Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1039
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:53,000
General, what you see
on these screens up here is a fantasy.

1040
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,880
A computer-enhanced hallucination.

1041
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,120
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1042
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:03,280
There's nothing to indicate a simulation.
Everything's working perfectly.

1043
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,080
- Does it make any sense?
- Does what make any sense?

1044
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,080
That!

1045
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,640
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now.

1046
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,080
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1047
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,160
You betcha!

1048
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,160
- Do you think they know that?
- I believe we've made that clear enough.

1049
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,040
Then... don't.

1050
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:24,080
Tell the president to ride out the attack.

1051
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,360
Sir, they need a decision.

1052
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,640
General, do you really believe
that the enemy would attack

1053
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,960
without provocation,
using so many missiles and subs,

1054
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,360
so that we would have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1055
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,720
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1056
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,480
General, you are listening to a machine.

1057
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,800
Do the world a favour
and don't act like one.

1058
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,880
One minute and 20 seconds to impact.

1059
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,520
Yes, Mr President.

1060
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,680
Sir, at this point in time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1061
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,480
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1062
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,880
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1063
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,400
Yes, sir.

1064
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,760
I do, too.

1065
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,840
One minute to impact.

1066
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,600
Who's first and how soon?

1067
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,600
Initial impact
in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring,

1068
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,720
319th at Grand Forks,
and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf.

1069
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,800
50 seconds to impact.

1070
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,880
Get me the senior controllers.
I wanna talk to 'em myself.

1071
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,040
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1072
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,880
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1073
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,520
Elmendorf Air Force Base Operations.
Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1074
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,680
319th Bomb Wing Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1075
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,840
Colonel, this is Loring Air Force Base.
The senior controller isn't here right now.

1076
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,920
That's all right. Who are you?

1077
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,600
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1078
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,000
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1079
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,080
Our current situation...

1080
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,200
Men, we're currently tracking

1081
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,360
approximately 2,400 inbound
Soviet warheads.

1082
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,960
But at the moment
we cannot confirm this.

1083
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,600
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1084
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,520
30 seconds to impact.

1085
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,120
We're right there with you guys.
We've taken all the steps we can.

1086
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,440
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1087
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,080
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1088
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,160
We'll be standing by.

1089
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,240
20 seconds to impact.

1090
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,200
Ten... nine...

1091
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,080
eight... seven...

1092
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,560
six...

1093
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,360
five...

1094
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,480
four...

1095
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,880
three...

1096
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,200
two...

1097
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
one... Impact.

1098
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,000
This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1099
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,120
This is Crystal Palace.
Are you still on? Anyone there?

1100
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,800
<i>That's affirmative, sir.</i>

1101
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,280
<i>Yeah! We're here!</i>

1102
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,880
- Jesus H Christ! We're still here!
- Our boards are showing impact.

1103
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,840
No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1104
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,320
All right!

1105
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,240
All right!

1106
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,240
All right!

1107
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,680
All right! Recall the bombers!

1108
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,840
Stand down the missiles!

1109
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,520
Joshua, what are you doing?

1110
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,960
COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1111
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,040
- This is McKittrick.
- Sir, we got a problem.

1112
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,280
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1113
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,640
- I can't get in to stand down the missiles.
- Stand by.

1114
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,560
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1115
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,840
The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1116
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,360
I know. No one can get back on.
We're trying everything.

1117
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,800
It's like the entire password file
has been wiped out.

1118
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,680
I tried that! Don't you think
I would have tried that?

1119
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,640
What are those?

1120
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,720
Those are launch codes.

1121
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,800
What are they for?

1122
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,000
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1123
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,080
<i>What's happening?</i>

1124
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,600
The random number generators
aren't running.

1125
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,680
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1126
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,320
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1127
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,400
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1128
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,360
Yeah?

1129
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,320
General, the machine has locked us out.
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1130
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,400
Codes. To launch the missiles.

1131
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,480
Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1132
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,720
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, General.

1133
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,040
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1134
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,800
The computers in the silos would carry
out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1135
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,200
- Can't we disarm the missiles?
- Over a thousand of them?

1136
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:21,200
There's no time. At this rate
it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1137
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,880
Mr McKittrick?
After very careful consideration, sir,

1138
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,160
I have come to the conclusion
that your new defence system sucks.

1139
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,880
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1140
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,720
I was hoping for something a little better
than that from a man of your education.

1141
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,800
General, it's the president.

1142
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,400
What do you...
What are you gonna tell him?

1143
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,560
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1144
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,640
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1145
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,200
Yes, sir.

1146
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,400
He's got one. When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1147
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,760
- Well, can't they get in and stop it?
- No. They can't.

1148
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:19,080
They've taken out my password.

1149
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,000
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. Do you?

1150
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,360
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1151
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,360
It's games.

1152
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,360
- Games!
- Try it.

1153
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,960
- John, feed it a tapeworm.
- Too risky. It might smash the system.

1154
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,640
- Did the kid get in the back door?
- We took it out.

1155
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,040
- Invade the deep logic.
- We hit a fire wall.

1156
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:46,160
If it wants to play a game, then play it.
Have it list games.

1157
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:49,080
- For Christ's sake!
- He's played before.

1158
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,480
- He can hardly do worse.
- Two numbers.

1159
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,360
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1160
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,040
- Let the boy in there, Major.
- List games.

1161
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,400
Chess.

1162
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,880
Three numbers locked in.

1163
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,280
Poker.

1164
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,200
Security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1165
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,480
Global thermonuclear war.

1166
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,280
Four numbers.

1167
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,960
Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something.

1168
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,400
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1169
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,480
- Put the list back up.
- We already tried that.

1170
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,320
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1171
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,800
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1172
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,760
Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere.

1173
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,640
Tic-tac-toe.

1174
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,120
You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles.

1175
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,400
No! No.

1176
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,040
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1177
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,280
One.

1178
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,680
- Put X in the centre square.
- I know.

1179
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,520
- Six up.
- There's no way you can win.

1180
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:50,600
I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned.

1181
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:55,160
- Is there any way to make it play itself?
- Yes. Number of players zero.

1182
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,600
Seven!

1183
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,200
Come on. Learn, goddamn it.

1184
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,640
Eight.

1185
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,080
It must be caught in a loop. It's taking
power from the rest of the system.

1186
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,880
Nine numbers.

1187
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,560
Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch.

1188
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,000
Colonel Conley, call SAC.
Get me a launch status report.

1189
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,360
Major Davis, get me the president.

1190
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,440
How you doin', Colonel?

1191
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,920
Land lines out of the mountain are dead.
I'm trying satellites.

1192
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,000
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1193
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,040
Greetings, Professor Falken.

1194
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,160
Hello, Joshua.

1195
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,760
<i>Strange game.</i>

1196
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,040
The only winning move is not to play.

1197
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,880
How about a nice game of chess?

1198
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,440
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1199
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,520
Yes, sir.
