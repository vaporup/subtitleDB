1
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,207
Leaving?

2
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,261
Hsiao-tsing...

3
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:31,465
Hsiao-tsing...!

4
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,509
So windy!

5
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,415
Ning!

6
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:44,279
What happened to your eyes?

7
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:45,544
Afool punched me!

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,652
Who?

9
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,549
Kneel down!

10
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,624
What are you doing?

11
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:55,023
It's pouring!

12
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:59,362
It's OK. I'm always getting wet

13
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,463
Let's go to the temple

14
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,603
You are in danger

15
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:06,240
That bearded guy is a killer

16
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,931
Come in first

17
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:12,979
I'm back to tell you to be careful

18
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:18,051
lt's dripping. Come

19
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,585
Did you come to rescue me?

20
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,758
I miss you!

21
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,027
The seller said

22
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:36,033
the girl died long time ago

23
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,237
Don't mention this

24
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:53,379
Don't forget, I'll get married in 2 days

25
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,657
It's also in the picture

26
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:48,701
Give it back to me

27
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,996
It sounds beautiful

28
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:51,767
Give it back!

29
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,804
You know kung fu?

30
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,036
Go!

31
00:04:58,446 --> 00:04:59,879
What upset you?

32
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,046
Go away quick

33
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,775
I didn't know it was so important to you

34
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:06,351
Please don't be mad

35
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:09,012
I didn't mean it like that. To be honest

36
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,992
I'm not a human being

37
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,389
Don't say that

38
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:19,795
If you're not human, I'm not either

39
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:22,927
I'll take responsibility for what we did

40
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:29,341
Don't follow me!

41
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,269
Go find the bearded guy

42
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,482
He's a murderer

43
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,015
I'll get killed

44
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:38,977
You'll die!

45
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,251
Hsiao-tsing...

46
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:43,982
Hsiao-tsing...

47
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:45,620
Don't follow me

48
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:46,885
You can't go

49
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,362
Where's Hsiao-tsing?

50
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,421
Hsiao-tsing!

51
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:24,057
I'm not coming for you

52
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,423
Heaven and earth are limitless

53
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:58,057
Ning!

54
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,358
The bearded guy killed your sister

55
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:00,865
Let's report him

56
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,165
I can't go with you

57
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,304
I don't care, I must get you out of here

58
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:29,520
Hsiao-tsing!

59
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,857
Hsiao-tsing's gone?

60
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:47,774
Court!

61
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,652
Someone is coming to pay you money

62
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,684
Yes!

63
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:55,420
Did you get the money?

64
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,614
Not yet!...

65
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,053
Master, sit up properly

66
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,930
Clean your teeth, Master
Wash your face, Master

67
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,027
Master!

68
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,528
Disturbing me at this hour

69
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,137
Beat him up!

70
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,795
Double the strokes

71
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,132
Stop, stop hitting!

72
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:15,570
l'll forget everything

73
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:16,641
Did you get the money?

74
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,641
Yes, of course!

75
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:19,973
Nonsense?

76
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:20,671
Beat!

77
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:23,817
I saw the murderer Liu

78
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,384
Liu?

79
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:26,912
Who's he?

80
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:30,353
He's a fugitive

81
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,857
But we got him 3 hours ago

82
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,622
I'm a greedy man

83
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,231
You're worse than me!

84
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,665
Want to take my money?

85
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,203
l'll beat you to death

86
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:45,737
Beat!

87
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,870
I really saw him

88
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,201
Did you?

89
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:51,607
Who's in the jail?

90
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,303
Yes, it's Liu!

91
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,140
Guilty!

92
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,304
Beat!

93
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,347
Master!

94
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,075
I think you got the wrong man!

95
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,277
We always get the wrong man!

96
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,182
Really?

97
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,947
Yes!

98
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,682
Get Liu!

99
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:05,826
Get Liu!

100
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:08,558
Get Liu!

101
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,857
If he's really Liu

102
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:12,931
Then we'll make a loss!

103
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,362
Don't plead guilty. Beat!

104
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:15,661
Yes!

105
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:17,133
Beat!

106
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:20,800
Why are you still hitting?

107
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,370
Stop it!

108
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:24,636
Killer!

109
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,872
Liu...

110
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:27,707
Liu?

111
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,680
Not robbing. l'm poor!

112
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,079
Mr. Chiu!

113
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:37,385
Yin?

114
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,852
Yin?

115
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,986
l'm docking your pay

116
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,995
You don't know Yin?

117
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,655
He's so famous...

118
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,927
In 26 Province

119
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,597
He hates greedy Master

120
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,762
I'm not involved

121
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,204
Swordsman Yin, are you coming to get me?

122
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,071
I don't care for politics

123
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,938
I'm coming to see my brother

124
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,380
Don't listen to him. He's not my brother

125
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,072
Hold it!... Maybe it's wrong

126
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,445
Your honour, Liu is here

127
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,619
Master, Liu is in jail

128
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,654
Take him away! No reward

129
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:14,624
Go home!

130
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:15,762
Go away!

131
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:18,563
Yes!

132
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,435
You must protect me

133
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:22,762
He's a murderer.

134
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:23,699
Nonsense!

135
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,339
This case is too complicated.

136
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,634
It'll be triple the price

137
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:30,003
Right!

138
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:30,871
Where's the killer?

139
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:31,841
That's him!

140
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:35,414
I'm not a killer

141
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,984
I'm tired

142
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:41,715
What's happening?

143
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,255
lt's serious. Add some more

144
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,523
Listen, no dead body, no case

145
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,824
Our action should speak for itself

146
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,694
You are wasting our energy

147
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:56,200
It's worth paying more for a good show

148
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:57,664
Why are you such a fool?

149
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:01,740
Just be smart and pay it

150
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,944
I want to, but I don't have money

151
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,444
You can go and rob

152
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,114
Your honour, let's cancel the case!

153
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:12,151
He's so generous

154
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,981
Pay quickly and cancel the case

155
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,849
Where's the crime scene?

156
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:17,752
Speak up!

157
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,222
Orchid Temple

158
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:33,238
The one who died is not a human being

159
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,102
I saw you chop off that woman's head

160
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,141
Not a woman, a ghost

161
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:38,403
Ghost?

162
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,748
Anything not of this world
is not my concern

163
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,507
Right!

164
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,378
Then I don't charge you?
Right

165
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,610
Let's adjourn without charge...

166
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:46,844
Adjourned without charge...

167
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:56,093
I know that woman

168
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:58,194
Her family lives behind that Temple

169
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,856
It's now deserted

170
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,797
Behind it is the grave

171
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:05,398
Grave?

172
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:10,205
Because of the chaotic situation

173
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,174
the people in town have all left

174
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,110
The spooky sounds at night

175
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,407
are made by ghosts

176
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:24,854
Ghosts? I don't believe it!

177
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:28,426
If you don't believe, I'll take
you to see them

178
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,520
See for yourself!

179
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,145
You believe it now?

180
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,283
If she was a ghost
why didn't she kill me?

181
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:29,678
Maybe you still have some use

182
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,455
Really?

183
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:34,183
Only a ghost can tell

184
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:38,530
Ghosts use each other like people

185
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:42,434
Get out of here before it gets back

186
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:43,933
And you?

187
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:50,103
I'm staying. The world
is too complicated

188
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:55,748
lt's simpler to get along with ghosts

189
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,244
I'm staying

190
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,279
Go now!

191
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,147
I've thought it over
You'd better stay

192
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,981
Stay? Those female ghosts may hurt me

193
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:41,917
So much the better

194
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,695
I can wipe them all out

195
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,428
If they come to you, ring this bell

196
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:52,236
and I'll come to your rescue

197
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,098
You want to use me to kill Hsiao-tsing?

198
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,744
Yes, they got fed up with me and

199
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:03,244
won't tolerate me anymore

200
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:05,744
This one is powerful

201
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,054
Can you cope with them?

202
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,358
Sure, evil can't conquer good

203
00:15:18,632 --> 00:15:21,192
Hold this Sutra

204
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:24,629
What language is that?

205
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:25,669
Sanskrit

206
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,069
Remember, concentration invites Buddhism

207
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:31,567
What's the first line?

208
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,846
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

209
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,641
You know Sanskrit?

210
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:40,548
No, but I know this principle

211
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:44,283
Remember to ring the bell

212
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,426
when you see the evil

213
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:55,968
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

214
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:57,192
Don't keep reciting that!

215
00:15:57,671 --> 00:16:00,071
The evil may not appear then

216
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:04,599
Who?

217
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,069
Who is it?

218
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,668
Say it, or I'll open the door

219
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:23,584
Why are you back?

220
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:25,623
Old Evil knows you are here

221
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,422
Are you a ghost?

222
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:29,723
Yes!

223
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,092
Did you kill those men in that temple?

224
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,460
I had no choice

225
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:38,196
I had to do it under the circumstances

226
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,067
Keep away...

227
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:43,800
Keep away, or I'll be nasty!

228
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:45,839
Did you hurt yourself?

229
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,749
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you

230
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:02,859
Why don't you believe me?

231
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:04,989
Have I ever hurt you?

232
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:06,631
A ghost is evil

233
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,664
Can I trust a ghost?

234
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,971
But some men more scary than ghosts

235
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,069
Sometimes, they are more harmful

236
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:20,378
Some ghosts are unable

237
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,640
to vent their grievances

238
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,783
That's why I'm wandering

239
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:29,011
In fact, some ghosts are better than men

240
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,846
Why did you kill then?

241
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:34,721
Old Evil forced me to

242
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,693
She's a 1000-year old tree monster

243
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,024
lam from a good family

244
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,197
but I was murdered

245
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:47,668
My father buried me under that old tree

246
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,736
He was later also killed

247
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:52,836
Then Old Evil controlled my body and

248
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,071
used me to lure men to
absorb their yang elements

249
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:59,913
She's now selling me to that old monster

250
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:01,519
Stop!

251
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:04,983
Hsiao-tsing!

252
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,797
Bastard! Why don't you ring the bell?

253
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:24,642
Are you still afraid of me?

254
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:27,781
No, I must deliver you from Old Evil

255
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:28,972
Really?

256
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:31,845
After tomorrow, take my ashes

257
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,044
to a family before dusk

258
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,246
and I will have a chance
of reincarnation

259
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,889
Rest assured

260
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:41,387
l'll unearth it early tomorrow

261
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,126
and deliver it

262
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:49,997
Damn! Go quick!

263
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,604
That Taoist will fix you!

264
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:56,368
Old Evil asked me to hurt you

265
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
She doesn't trust me

266
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,712
She may come to kill you. Go now!

267
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:05,578
Don't worry! We are blessed

268
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:08,812
l have magic

269
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,479
Damn Taoist, you fooled me...

270
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:12,557
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

271
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,954
It won't work?

272
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,256
Why doesn't it work?

273
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:19,629
What's this?

274
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:20,765
Old Evil's tongue

275
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:31,169
Ning Tsai-shen!

276
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:32,534
Hsiao-tsing...

277
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,241
Ning Tsai-shen!

278
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:40,151
What's this?

279
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,458
Hsiao-tsing!

280
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:07,445
Hsiao-tsing!

281
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,408
Shut your mouth or
the tongue may get in!

282
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,822
This way!

283
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:01,691
Hsiao-tsing!

284
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:02,892
Leave me alone!

285
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:06,764
Ning Tsai-shen!

286
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,777
Follow the cloth; don't ever look back

287
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,514
Hsiao-tsing! l...

288
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,845
Go?

289
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:34,959
Ning Tsai-shen...

290
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:36,295
Hsiao-tsing!

291
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:44,639
Ning Tsai-shen!

292
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,540
Hsiao-tsing!

293
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:50,544
Old Evil!

294
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:13,601
lt's you, damn Taoist!

295
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:15,241
Who else, if not me?

296
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,838
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come?

297
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,672
Why didn't you ring the bell?

298
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,211
I nearly got killed

299
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,414
How dare you take away my meat?

300
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:29,512
I don't mind your killing those bad ones

301
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:31,483
But this scholar

302
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:33,558
who is so pure

303
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:37,163
but weak and good for nothing

304
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,661
What good is he to you?

305
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,894
Don't compliment me!

306
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:43,535
I can't convince her without bluffing

307
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,368
Killing him means not giving me any face

308
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,069
What about your killing my maid?

309
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,766
That's not giving me any face either

310
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,172
Damn old woman, let's not
talk about face

311
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:57,273
Well, let's fight it out!

312
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:59,783
Let's see who is stronger

313
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:04,883
Her tongue's longer than yours!

314
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:05,990
Go away!

315
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:16,860
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

316
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:23,271
Blessed sword!

317
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:25,035
Watch out!

318
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:38,155
No scruples in Heaven or on Earth

319
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,228
Hsiao-tsing!

320
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,765
Ning Tsai-shen!

321
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:51,730
Keep away!

322
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:53,999
Hit!

323
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:57,368
Don't kill her!

324
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:58,835
Hsiao-tsing

325
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:01,043
Bastard! Come back quick!

326
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,398
Help that Taoist fight with Old Evil

327
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,768
Where?

328
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:30,303
Anywhere will do!

329
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:32,206
What if I hit?
Hit!

330
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,604
My bum!

331
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:45,285
She's coming again!

332
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:05,374
Run! Don't dawdle!

333
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,374
Hsiao-tsing!

334
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:20,652
Watch out!

335
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,563
I want your lives

336
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,535
l chop!

337
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,974
Hsiao-tsing!

338
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:49,053
Hsiao-tsing...

339
00:26:49,823 --> 00:26:51,381
Are you mad? You know she's harmful

340
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:52,650
Why have you fallen for her?

341
00:26:52,826 --> 00:26:55,090
She was forced. Don't misunderstand

342
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:58,956
There's a boundary between
men and ghosts

343
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,134
Men should avoid ghostly affairs
Not get involved

344
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:06,198
I've broken her century-old magic

345
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:08,974
She's powerful

346
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,440
but can only wreak havoc in a century

347
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:17,140
If nothing happens, she won't interfere

348
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,447
I must keep my promise

349
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,856
I must bring her ashes
back to her birth place

350
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:29,325
So that she can be reincarnated

351
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,519
Swordsman

352
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:35,595
I know you don't want to get involved

353
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,464
a lot of highlanders are
on the way to town

354
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,935
I can't make it without your help

355
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:46,838
Swordsman Yin, I beg you

356
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,537
Help me take her ashes back

357
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:51,616
Give her a chance. Please!

358
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:54,015
On your feet!

359
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,582
I retired

360
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:03,853
because I hate dealing with mean people

361
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:06,361
Sol hid in this temple

362
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,933
l pretended to be a ghost
in front of a man

363
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:11,229
and a human in front of a ghost

364
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,170
and now I don't know if
I'm a man or a ghost

365
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:16,841
I'm not a swordsman

366
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,841
Swordsman
Ridiculous!

367
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:20,673
What's so funny!

368
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,810
I don't want to be a man

369
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,745
But Hsiao-tsing wants to reincarnate

370
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,477
Don't say that!

371
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:29,485
The most important is to get out here

372
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:35,790
I don't understand all this nonsense!

373
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:38,260
Alright, I promise you!

374
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,551
I found it!

375
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:09,293
Why so much?

376
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:10,451
How strange!

377
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,597
Which one?

378
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:13,858
No time to sort out now
Take them away!

379
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,028
Where should we put the Sutra?

380
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:21,295
In the satchel!

381
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,908
No, keep it to make
the spirits follow us

382
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:39,689
Follow me closely!

383
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,451
I can't, you're riding too fast

384
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:43,892
We're in a rush

385
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:53,736
Yin, something's wrong!

386
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:55,033
Why are we still at the same old place?

387
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,436
Must be those evil spirits

388
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:57,769
What then?

389
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:00,344
We must get out of the forest
before it's dark

390
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,691
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

391
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:25,964
Follow me

392
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,657
Someone's celebrating!

393
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:53,059
lnn keeper!

394
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:54,200
Why is it deserted?

395
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:56,198
All gone to hell?

396
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:57,962
Who died?

397
00:30:58,571 --> 00:30:59,560
What are you doing?

398
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:00,932
We want to stay the night

399
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:10,975
You can go!

400
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:13,209
Don't shout!

401
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:31,497
Hsiao-tsing, come out if
you're among them

402
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:40,836
Master, looking for me?

403
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,986
Master, looking for us?

404
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,518
No sign of Hsiao-tsing
Maybe the wrong ashes!

405
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,716
Grab your things and get lost

406
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:55,155
Don't wreak havoc anymore

407
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:58,729
Thank you!

408
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:00,160
Vanish!

409
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,467
Last chance

410
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:07,032
This is the last

411
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:08,639
Hsiao-tsing, come out

412
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:10,298
if it's you!

413
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:13,877
Come out!...

414
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:17,448
Master, looking for me?

415
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:21,412
A male!

416
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,647
No chance!

417
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:28,960
Why do you keep calling me?

418
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:31,058
It's the waiter

419
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,826
You scared me!

420
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,659
Damn!

421
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,665
Why did you appear so abruptly?

422
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:38,428
Come out!

423
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:48,308
Hsiao-tsing!

424
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:51,676
Ning Tsai-shen!

425
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,283
Hsiao-tsing!

426
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:02,160
Thank you for saving my life!

427
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,998
Well...! Stand up!

428
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,336
Don't be formal. We're friends

429
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:14,233
You're wasting time!

430
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:17,308
l'll replace 2 horses
for the journey tomorrow

431
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,974
What a pair of lovers!

432
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:26,944
That's his style

433
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,111
He must do it before leaving

434
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,629
lt's frosty all over the lake

435
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:58,541
Time flies when all goes grey

436
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,050
Facing the moon alone, I need company

437
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:10,124
Lovebirds fare better than fairies

438
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,664
This picture is the only thing I leave

439
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,994
I'll keep it forever

440
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:19,630
We must be in town by dusk tomorrow

441
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:22,866
or I won't be reincarnated

442
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,601
You should be happy for me

443
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:28,474
It's a wonderful chance for you

444
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:37,919
But we must part before dawn

445
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,956
and forever

446
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,058
Heavens! Don't ever get dark!

447
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:48,761
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

448
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:54,701
Evil in the air!

449
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:01,743
Blood bun!?

450
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,283
A ghost wedding

451
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,181
Stop dawdling!

452
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,621
This inn is haunted

453
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:16,785
Pack up and get out of here

454
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:19,758
I'll get the golden pagoda

455
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,228
Hurry up!

456
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:26,397
Oh, I forgot the painting!

457
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:29,905
Ning Tsai-shen!

458
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:32,609
Today's a good day in hell

459
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,303
They must've got Hsiao-tsing back

460
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,412
Old Evil's coming to collect the bride

461
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:38,243
Scholar, it seems we have to storm Hell!

462
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:40,484
We must rescue Hsiao-tsing

463
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,881
We can't go back when the day breaks

464
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,255
Remember, close your eyes!

465
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:50,019
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

466
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:04,938
Can I open my eyes now?

467
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:06,840
You must, if you want to find her

468
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,198
Hsiao-tsing's inside

469
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,735
Hsiao-tsing!

470
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:34,904
Ning Tsai-shen!

471
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:36,336
Hsiao-tsing!

472
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,472
Why can't I get hold of her?

473
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:43,114
Ning Tsai-shen!

474
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:44,749
Hsiao-tsing...

475
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:45,747
In the mundane world
men can't see ghosts

476
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:47,180
ln hell ghosts can't see men

477
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:51,685
Hsiao-tsing can see you now. Go now!

478
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:04,167
They're going to hell!

479
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:06,933
Go!

480
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,733
Hsiao-tsing!

481
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:09,806
What now?

482
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,273
Go into hiding

483
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,073
Go and rescue Hsiao-tsing at once

484
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:19,843
Me?

485
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,281
Let's go!

486
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:22,918
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

487
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,251
Heaven and Earth are limitless

488
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:41,002
Here I am!

489
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,800
Don't mind me, run!

490
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,135
I'm here to help you

491
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,208
l'll cut it for you!

492
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:55,617
Run!

493
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,418
The magic powers!

494
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:09,760
Swordsman Yin, watch out!

495
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:27,552
You go first, I'll stay behind

496
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:09,153
Find another exit

497
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:36,883
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

498
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:43,820
Swordsman Yin!

499
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:44,985
Why have you come back?

500
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:45,926
We can't get out of here!

501
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:47,622
Old Evil has blocked the exit

502
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:52,304
You can't get out of here

503
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,132
Help me get an arrow

504
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:55,765
Draw the bow

505
00:39:57,076 --> 00:39:57,940
Let loose!

506
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,873
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

507
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,148
Damn, we're not his match

508
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,823
Pull at him. This is 1000-year old Evil

509
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:17,519
He may drain your soul away

510
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:20,797
Swordsman Yin!

511
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:39,010
Concentrate!

512
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:40,943
Recite! Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi

513
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:45,653
Lord Black, please let them go

514
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:52,160
Break the golden pagoda
and be my company

515
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:55,190
Hsiao-tsing, don't be taken in

516
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:58,135
Concentrate! Recite!

517
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,431
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

518
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:06,438
Don't!

519
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:13,876
l'll rescue you!

520
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:25,959
Hsiao-tsing!

521
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,939
Hsiao-tsing!

522
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:47,284
Yin Che-hsia, Ning Tsai-shen
I'll take your lives

523
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,524
Don't

524
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:58,555
What's this?

525
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:01,726
The Sutra?

526
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:06,366
You've done enough

527
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,268
l have to get rid of you damn evil

528
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:30,093
Damn old Evil!

529
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,190
Swordsman Yin!

530
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:35,291
The way's clear! Help Swordsman Yin out!

531
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:42,064
Swordsman Yin!

532
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:05,286
Swordsman Yin, we're back on Earth!

533
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:08,156
Damn, it's dawn!

534
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:09,494
Hsiao-tsing's not yet here!

535
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:11,863
Help her out

536
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:21,203
Swordsman Yin, lend a hand!

537
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:32,051
Hsiao-tsing!

538
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,283
Keep her from the sunshine

539
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,395
Or she may evaporate and
can't be reincarnated

540
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:45,430
Hsiao-tsing, come back to
the golden pagoda!

541
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,412
The sun is rising, I've got to go!

542
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:00,178
Hsiao-tsing, be a good human being

543
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,079
l'll remember you always

544
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:08,054
I can't even see you before we part

545
00:44:08,727 --> 00:44:10,194
Take care!

546
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:17,798
She's gone!

547
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:25,567
Hsiao-tsing

548
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:36,313
Hsiao-tsing

549
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:47,725
Hsiao-tsing, I'll take you back

550
00:45:14,326 --> 00:45:15,884
Wonder if she has been reincarnated

551
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:21,329
In these times, an unlucky man
may fare worse than a ghost

552
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:28,170
Look ahead

553
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,307
Let's go!
