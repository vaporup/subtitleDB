1
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,560
Stop!

2
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,730
Have mercy, sir! Take it back!

3
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,200
How dare you steal from me?
Damn you!

4
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,638
Go away!...

5
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,773
Stop! Stop!

6
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,379
Is it him?

7
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,676
Doesn't look like him! Get going!

8
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,255
Thank you!

9
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,826
Don't go!

10
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,893
If you're not a fugitive, step aside!

11
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,197
You're in my way, scram!

12
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,533
Stop!

13
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,840
Not him!

14
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,978
Tell him to leave!

15
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,708
Stop!

16
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,617
Stop!...

17
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,378
Don't run!

18
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,486
Over there!

19
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,946
Stop!

20
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,618
Stop!

21
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,952
There's a fugitive there!

22
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,092
Did you ask me to stop?

23
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,823
Pilgrimage? How hilarious!

24
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,129
You're carrying money

25
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,168
Don't fish in troubled waters

26
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,498
Don't say that

27
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,640
I don't need this money

28
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,968
You may need it sooner or later!

29
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,009
Thank you!

30
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,170
Want a room, Sir?

31
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,042
Get the luggage for him

32
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:30,978
There's a nice room

33
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,879
Sorry, but I'm a collector
from Tsi Pao Zai

34
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,744
Collector?

35
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,413
That's too rude!

36
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,121
Why is it a different man each time?

37
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,657
The ex-collector was killed
on his way home

38
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,295
Why don't you just do me a favor?

39
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,930
Since you might get
killed for the money

40
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,064
Just don't collect

41
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,491
You're kidding

42
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,803
Can I see your books?

43
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:58,941
It's the new rule

44
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,177
New rule? Show me!

45
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,837
Sorry, no!

46
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,140
What kind of record is that?

47
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,308
It's a mess. How do you collect?

48
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,784
I can't return without the money

49
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,887
Help me out here

50
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,951
Since I'm not in your books

51
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,387
I don't owe you anything

52
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,188
Don't deny it or I'll take you to court

53
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,134
Where can I spend a night for free?

54
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,310
Go to the Orchid Temple!

55
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,678
Madam, I didn't lie to you

56
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,583
Where's Orchid Temple, please?

57
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,622
Orchid Temple?! 3-1/2 miles to the East

58
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,058
You'll see a spooky temple!

59
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,163
Thank you!

60
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,294
Sorry! Excuse me!

61
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,973
Madam, are you going to buy it or not?

62
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,451
Well done!

63
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,765
Master, you've good taste, make an offer!

64
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,833
I don't even have money
for travel expenses

65
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,807
Good taste, but no means, what's the use?

66
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:39,500
What are you doing?

67
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,941
I'm taking your measurement

68
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,444
for your coffin!

69
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,240
Thank you!

70
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,644
Remember

71
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,910
there are wolves in the woods

72
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,418
You may come upon them when it's dark

73
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,578
Don't go...

74
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,335
The fire must not go out

75
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,237
If it does, I can't get
out of the forest

76
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,425
Anybody in?

77
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,380
Have you finished?

78
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,278
Hsia-hou, we're fought for 7 years

79
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,180
and you're always lost

80
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,253
But you're quite persevering

81
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,754
You follow me wherever I go

82
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,415
You've been in the
Temple for a fortnight

83
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,494
And you've improved your swordsmanship!

84
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,358
But you've wasted your youth too

85
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,797
You're ambitious, but not aggressive

86
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,028
For the sake of the title

87
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,365
you've become corrupt

88
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,202
You're petulant but not focused enough

89
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,537
Your blows are violent but ineffective

90
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,844
You have to cool down

91
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,642
If you win, it's just luck

92
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,580
I'm here to duel with you

93
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,014
Not to listen to your sermon
You...

94
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,418
Right, he's right

95
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,156
You've already won

96
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,259
You shouldn't have

97
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,758
said that to disgrace him

98
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,659
He's right too

99
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,629
You shouldn't have followed him

100
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,995
Lay down your swords

101
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,296
Move him with sincerity

102
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,063
The universe is limitless

103
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,069
and love is eternal

104
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,074
Love conquers the world

105
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,474
Love is the most powerful weapon!

106
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,783
You speak too much

107
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,379
I'm not trying to follow you

108
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,892
Your clothing is torn

109
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,221
To hell with your love!

110
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,693
The kind of love you need

111
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,092
you should find in a whorehouse

112
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,425
I'm trying to find shelter

113
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,464
It's not convenient!

114
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,499
Why not?

115
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,402
Are you a brave man?

116
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,664
Yes!

117
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,273
Look over there!

118
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,377
When I shout

119
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,377
Hide behind me

120
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,606
If there's a real tiger

121
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,148
Where should you hide?

122
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
What? There's really a tiger?

123
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,447
No!

124
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,716
But we've something scarier then a tiger

125
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,053
Do you always keep
so close while talking?

126
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,095
I have bad breath, and this
will keep you away

127
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,156
Get out of here!

128
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,665
Your compassion can't save you

129
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,094
I know. I'm off!

130
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,929
Me too!

131
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,413
Hsia-hou, you were ambitious

132
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,183
but after death

133
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,418
you're still a nobody

134
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,860
I won't leave your body in the open

135
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,464
You never change, you fight
even when dead

136
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,336
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

137
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,275
That monster's out again!

138
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,775
Shit! Is he still here?

139
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,995
I meant no harm

140
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,221
I'll fling it away if you're afraid

141
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,209
What is it?

142
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,449
Where's my veil?

143
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,910
Veil? I'll find it for you!

144
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,021
Water's deep!

145
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,993
Come up quick!

146
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,124
Come up!

147
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,631
Thank you!

148
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,394
It's too dark, I can't see

149
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,902
I'll look for it early tomorrow

150
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,866
This water is both deep and cold!

151
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,907
Your hands are colder than mine

152
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,674
Because you're warmer

153
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,020
You're sick

154
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,750
you look so pale

155
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,821
Go see a doctor

156
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,553
I need your warmth

157
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,893
I shouldn't have pushed you

158
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:14,862
Otherwise, Iwould have

159
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,193
spurted all over you

160
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,199
It hurts!

161
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,499
I shouldn't have pushed you

162
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,074
It's cold!

163
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,942
I'm wet, you'll feel colder lying on me

164
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,743
Do you feel pain or cold?

165
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,543
Carry me inside!

166
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,083
Carry you?!

167
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,053
I can't, you're too heavy

168
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,556
I need some help...

169
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:56,638
You look nice, but you're
in the wrong place

170
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,269
Or else, you wouldn't die in vain

171
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,617
Why am I still in water?

172
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,021
Miss, you forgot your lute!

173
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,765
Why are you following me?

174
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,245
Why are you leaving?

175
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,509
A villain! I must run for my life!

176
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,415
Who? I can't see it

177
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,009
Don't be afraid!

178
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,541
Let me get rid of it

179
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,487
I'll stomp you to death

180
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,990
Still here?

181
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,986
Snake!

182
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,866
Where's the snake?

183
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,598
Don't shout!

184
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,144
The villain just passed by

185
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,539
Which one?

186
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,740
The bearded one from Orchid Temple

187
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,078
If he discovers us, we'll be killed!

188
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,419
The one living opposite me?

189
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,320
I can tell he's no good

190
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,890
It's too dangerous. I'll take you back

191
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:33,928
No, you can't!

192
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,532
My family won't allow this

193
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,632
They're very strict

194
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,496
I see, Miss

195
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,996
Let me lure him away then

196
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,105
Run when he tries to get hold of me!

197
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,770
Don't let him see you

198
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,747
Here's your lute, Miss!

199
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,526
What's your name?

200
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,357
Ning Tsai-shen!

201
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,793
What's yours?

202
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,561
Nieh Hsiao-tsing!

203
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,203
Nieh Hsiao-tsing!

204
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,667
Tomorrow night...

205
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,068
Tomorrow night I'll come to see you

206
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,649
Stop running!

207
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,885
It's dangerous

208
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,730
Stop! You can't get away!

209
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,676
If you can scream; I can scream too!

210
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,444
Damn Taoist

211
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,249
Both of us want shelter here

212
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,221
Actually, all the men
I killed deserve it

213
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,519
Why have you been annoying me?

214
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,189
I am not

215
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,456
I'm hiding in this hellish place

216
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,123
to stay away from
the fighting in the world

217
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,697
Our common aim is to
rid the world of villains

218
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,168
for the good of mankind

219
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,170
We are fellowmen

220
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,704
Fellowmen? Nonsense!

221
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,976
You're hurting me too

222
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,878
One day, you'll be in big trouble

223
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,715
then I'll finish you off

224
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,628
You're a good man. Don't see me anymore

225
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,534
Hsiao-tsing!

226
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,923
Man of love

227
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,094
Did you come upon anything last night?

228
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,731
I've bumped into everything in the house

229
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,065
Did you see anything eerie?

230
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,433
Including you?

231
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,573
Idiot!

232
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,649
I'm serious. Why are you joking?

233
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,054
Who knows if you're serious or not?

234
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,556
When do Ijoke?

235
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,886
You're always joking

236
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,586
Get out of this place. It's haunted

237
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,995
Show me the ghost if you can!

238
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:10,866
Stupid fool!

239
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,333
If you can see it
then it can't be a ghost

240
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,597
They won't show up in the day!

241
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,638
Big beard, don't scare me!

242
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,740
If not in the day, then

243
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,172
tell them to come tonight

244
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,981
It'll be too late if you see them

245
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,314
Why don't you believe me?

246
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,352
If I see you at night
I'll throw you out

247
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,028
Come on, do that

248
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,424
No, I'll kill you

249
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,035
There's no better way to help him

250
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,867
than to scare him

251
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,836
Ghost? He must be kidding

252
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,674
Where's my lower torso?

253
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,351
Damn big beard!

254
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,716
Where have you put it?

255
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,384
Isn't it connected to your upper part?

256
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:11,891
Don't talk nonsense!

257
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,155
Take it!

258
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,798
He's incoherent. No point in helping him

259
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,976
It's illegible anyway
I'll fill it in myself

260
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,397
Have you really lived in Orchid Temple?

261
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,301
It clearly shows 70 taels

262
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,707
Pay up!

263
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,308
Take it!

264
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,277
Thank you!

265
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,111
Inn keeper!

266
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,654
You scared me. What do you want?

267
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,450
I was scared too

268
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,622
EXCUSE me, excuse me...

269
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,367
Hsiao-tsing!

270
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,314
Hsiao-tsing!

271
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,049
Can you hear me?

272
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,585
Stop!

273
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,416
Did you hear me, stop!

274
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,056
Don't go!

275
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,288
Who said that? Who did?

276
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,827
Let me see who's a fugitive

277
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,973
I told you to stop!

278
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,248
That man of taste is here again

279
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,619
Boss!

280
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,022
Why are you here again?

281
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,955
Boss, where's that painting
"The girl washing hair"?

282
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,928
I'll get it

283
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,401
for you at once

284
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,066
Boss, what are you doing?

285
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,704
Why is it missing?

286
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,904
No one has ever asked for it

287
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,571
Well, come again tomorrow

288
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,341
I promise I'll find it for you

289
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,042
Well, I'll come again tomorrow

290
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,398
How could all 3 lanterns be out?

291
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,837
See howl deal with you
when the wolf comes

292
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,402
Can't you see the Yellow River flows

293
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,738
into the sea without returning?

294
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,507
Can't you see the sadness of those

295
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,547
with grey hair before the mirror?

296
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,882
Don't face the moonlight without a drink

297
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,586
Can't you see the Yellow River flows

298
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,019
into the sea without returning?

299
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,887
Can't you see the sadness of those

300
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,652
with grey hair before the mirror?

301
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,389
Don't face the moonlight without a drink

302
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,499
Give and spend and God will send

303
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,100
1234567

304
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,031
7654321

305
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:52,794
1234567

306
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,494
Know the scriptures, and you
have the sword for 10 years

307
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,162
This secret cannot be leaked

308
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,140
I can hardly breathe

309
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,846
Why is there no wolf?

310
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,881
The wolf's coming!

311
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,646
Nieh Hsiao-tsing

312
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:27,095
Hsiao-tsing...

313
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,273
Open the door, Hsiao-tsing!

314
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,733
Why are you here?

315
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:41,969
I came because I heard the lute

316
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,477
Come in quick!

317
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,081
You shouldn't come here

318
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,151
I'm leaving tomorrow
I must say goodbye!

319
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,809
Tomorrow?

320
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,683
Yes, but I'll try to
come back to see you

321
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,085
Don't!

322
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,686
Someone's coming!

323
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,884
Old Evil has a sharp nose

324
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,823
Hide in the water

325
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,587
she can't smell you

326
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,590
In the water again?

327
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,613
Sister Tsing!

328
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:22,384
I know the Old Evil's
waiting impatiently

329
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,544
As soon as I put on my make up

330
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,555
Tramp!

331
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,060
You're hiding a man!

332
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,496
I am not!

333
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,068
Don't deny it!

334
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,438
Here's the proof!

335
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,340
See for yourself

336
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,775
Why have you written such stuff?

337
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,341
You obviously do that to defy me

338
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,210
I must punish you

339
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,374
You bitch!

340
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,950
Don't forget the ordeal you suffered!

341
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,689
Do as I tell you or
I'll destroy your ashes

342
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,984
and you'll evaporate like thin air

343
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:11,666
Tonight, you must...

344
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,827
get me a human to increase my vitality

345
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,275
and prolong my life

346
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,439
You'll be forgiven for
this first offence

347
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,015
Tsing, bring medicine for your sister

348
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,343
Yes!

349
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,421
You've been betrothed to Lord Black

350
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,796
In three days you'll be his wife

351
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,631
He's a bit old

352
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,124
But he's not good-natured

353
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,503
When he flares up even we
can't control him

354
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,203
After you marry him, you'll never return

355
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,400
Hsiao-tsing!

356
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,303
Yes!

357
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,105
Try it on. Your bridal dress

358
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,344
Come and have a look

359
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,174
Seems there's some sort of smell

360
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,344
The smell of a living man

361
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,850
My dress is torn

362
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,684
Why are you so careless?

363
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,755
I must wash my hand!

364
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,255
Tsing, let me help you

365
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,284
Thank you!

366
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,484
You're welcome

367
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:45,992
Why are you doing that?

368
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,494
An oversight

369
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,627
Don't keep offending her

370
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,233
I didn't mean to

371
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,763
You haven't cleaned up yet

372
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,732
You did it on purpose, I give up

373
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,001
Take it off so I can mend it

374
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,210
Tsing, what are you doing?

375
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:46,288
I must take a bath before going out

376
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,186
If not

377
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,050
I can't get you a living man

378
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,524
Good girl

379
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,966
Learn from her

380
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,029
Old Evil, don't worry

381
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,569
I won't let you down tonight

382
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,439
Come!

383
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:15,984
Hurry up!

384
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:34,565
Why rush? After I get married

385
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,036
this room will be yours

386
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,989
Dress up! I won't look at you!

387
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,288
Come!

388
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,159
You...

389
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,659
Go!

390
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,524
I've a lot to tell you!

391
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,394
Go to the temple!

392
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:04,932
I'll wait for you there!

393
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,296
Yes!

394
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:20,909
Ning!

395
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,481
Why are you so speedy?

396
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,291
It's faster coming down!

397
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,584
Are you OK?

398
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,632
Do you like this picture? It's yours

399
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,599
The picture?

400
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,333
Why are you here?

401
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,137
My father commissioned it a year ago

402
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,044
Just found it 2 days ago

403
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,179
That's me!

404
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,518
See the picture and you see me

405
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,847
You sound like we'll never meet again

406
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,892
Yes! I'll marry the old monster
in 3 days

407
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,757
Unwillingly, I know

408
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,323
Go away if you want to

409
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,470
Let me go. It's dawn

410
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,299
It's better, then we can go

411
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,545
Let me go

412
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,838
I won't if you don't go with me

413
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,677
Release me!

414
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,681
Hsiao-tsing!

415
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,746
Don't dream on, you beggar

416
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,654
You want my money

417
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,454
I see so many of your kind

418
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,392
I won't be tricked

419
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,254
How dare you say this?

420
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,593
If you don't go, I'll get
someone to catch you

421
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,529
OK! I'll go!

422
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,577
Take care!

423
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,293
Mister!

424
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,432
I can't find the picture!

425
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,532
We'll change it to another

426
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,469
I saw the girl

427
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,127
Forget her. She died a year ago!

428
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,773
It's pouring, go and find shelter!

429
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,409
Don't curse her

430
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,407
Keep to my side

431
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,306
You are totally wet

432
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,036
Don't be superstitious!

433
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,410
Don't go away!

434
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,377
Who's shouting?

435
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,558
I'm not a fugitive!

436
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,260
Grab the shouting one

437
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,894
You won't get a reward

438
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,725
Get him

439
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,393
So cool

440
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,904
The bearded man is a killer

441
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,472
Is she dangerous?

442
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,814
Help me on my feet

443
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,042
Beware, don't let my new gown get wet

444
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,445
You can't effort it

445
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,253
I'm coming to save you

446
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,685
My mom will punish me; | wet my clothes
