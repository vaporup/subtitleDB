1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,190
Two thousand years ago...
during the Warring States period,
China was divided into seven Kingdoms.

2
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,912
For years they battled for supremacy
while the people suffered.

3
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:46,421
The King of Qin was the most ruthless
in his efforts to conquer the land
and unify all under heaven.

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,090
He was regarded as a common threat
by the other six Kingdoms.

5
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:57,537
The annals of Chinese history
are abound with tales of the assassins
sent to kill the great King.

6
00:00:57,537 --> 00:01:02,915
This is one of the legends...

7
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,963
I was orphaned at an early age

8
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,832
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

9
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,169
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

10
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,474
After 10 years of practice

11
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,613
I acquired a unique skill

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,446
The King of Qin has summoned me

13
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,245
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

14
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,550
By order of His Majesty

15
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,852
we have brought the mighty warrior

16
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,478
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

17
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,444
the three assassins from Zhao

18
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,248
have sought His Majesty's life
for 10 years

19
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,722
His Majesty has known no peace

20
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,589
To the astonishment of all

21
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,529
a mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

22
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:25,802
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

23
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,735
We rejoice for our King!

24
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,535
This warrior sent from Heaven

25
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,745
has exterminated the assassins

26
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,284
Summon the warrior!

27
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,392
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty

28
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,128
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

29
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,097
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me

30
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,433
Do you know why?

31
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,307
To guard against assassins

32
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:15,079
Yes. That's why I am confined
in this armor

33
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,217
You have removed a great peril for me

34
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,580
How should I reward you?

35
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,318
My service was for Qin, not for a reward

36
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,587
Achievements must be rewarded

37
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,756
Sky's silver spear...

38
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,067
wounded many of my brave warriors

39
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,799
Announce my edict!

40
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,201
By order of His Majesty

41
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,711
he who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

42
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,212
and be allowed to drink

43
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,873
within 20 paces of His Majesty

44
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,635
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

45
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,305
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

46
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,500
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

47
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,872
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,273
How did you defeat such opponents?

49
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,845
I took them on one by one

50
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,014
Tell me the details

51
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,549
Does Your Majesty know

52
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,055
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

53
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,759
Yes, I do

54
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,860
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

55
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,563
For three years? Why?

56
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,702
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

57
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,500
Broken Sword never forgave her

58
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,205
Why haven't I heard this before?

59
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,870
I went to great lengths to uncover it

60
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,538
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

61
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,475
I first needed to eliminate Sky

62
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,744
I have an idea of what you planned

63
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,412
Your Majesty is wise

64
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,018
What did you use to defeat Sky?

65
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,385
The sword

66
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,555
I must arrest criminals in my county

67
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,859
On the fifth day of the sixth month

68
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,569
Sky attended a chess house

69
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,031
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess

70
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,069
and listening to music there

71
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,256
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

72
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,996
We are here to arrest you!

73
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,902
Identify yourself by showing your spear

74
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,699
Halt!

75
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,341
What can a minor official do?

76
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,539
This is my territory

77
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,973
So?

78
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,118
You are on the King's most wanted list

79
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,885
I am placing you under arrest

80
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,780
Old man, please play one more tune

81
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,143
Martial arts and music are different

82
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,049
but they share the same principle

83
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,347
Both stress attaining a supreme state

84
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,656
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

85
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,759
Neither of us moved

86
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,690
We fought the battle in our minds

87
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,292
How swift thy sword!

88
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,571
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

89
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,440
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

90
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,911
held a talent like yours

91
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,048
Broken Sword

92
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,853
Flying Snow

93
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,494
By order of His Majesty!

94
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,356
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

95
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,156
have teamed up for assassination

96
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,926
He who kills either of them

97
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,764
will receive gold and land

98
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,064
and be allowed to drink

99
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,900
within 10 paces of His Majesty

100
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,242
Three years ago, Flying Snow

101
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,820
stormed the palace with Broken Sword

102
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,686
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them

103
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,919
I've since emptied the palace

104
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,623
so assassins cannot hide

105
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,163
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

106
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,366
No

107
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,332
How did you do it, then?

108
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,218
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

109
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,853
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

110
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,617
I learned they were hiding

111
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,422
in a calligraphy school

112
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,525
under the names Highcliff and Springbrook

113
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,862
Rumor had it

114
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,023
the Qin army would attack that day

115
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,564
Most of the townspeople had fled

116
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,765
Only the school's students remained

117
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,106
Why have you come at such a time?

118
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,368
Who are you?

119
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,542
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

120
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,077
My father's dying wish

121
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,212
was for one of your scrolls

122
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,819
I fear this may be our school's last day

123
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,888
Which calligrapher do you seek?

124
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,820
I respectfully request Master Highcliff

125
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,461
Highcliff was Broken Sword

126
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,323
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

127
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,798
was rooted in his calligraphy

128
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,999
So I had my concerns

129
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,534
I needed to find out if it was true

130
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,435
What do you want written?

131
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,805
"Sword."

132
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,907
You are fond of the sword?

133
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,353
It was my father's dying wish

134
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,758
What size scroll?

135
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,958
Eight feet

136
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,860
For that size I will need red ink

137
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,732
My master has asked me

138
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,507
to borrow some red ink

139
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,639
My master wants to borrow some red ink

140
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,119
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

141
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,019
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink

142
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,592
Tell him to come himself

143
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,245
Could I have some red ink?

144
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,339
The character "sword"
was still being written

145
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,180
when Your Majesty's troops

146
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,440
arrived at the city gates

147
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,645
Draw!

148
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,720
Your Majesty's army is invincible

149
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,383
not only because it is brave

150
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,461
but also because of its archery

151
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,562
with a greater range than any other army

152
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,568
The Qin archers are like artillery

153
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,229
intimidating the enemy

154
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,454
Hail! Hail! Hail!

155
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,800
Please remember

156
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,894
their arrows might destroy our town

157
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,836
and topple our Kingdom

158
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,741
but they can never
obliterate our culture

159
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,439
Today

160
00:21:55,747 --> 00:22:00,116
you will learn the essence of our culture

161
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,438
Hail! Hail! Hail!

162
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,870
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

163
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,073
They drew strength from their calligraphy

164
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,901
What was so difficult about "sword"?

165
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,738
There are 19 different ways to write it

166
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,412
I asked Broken Sword

167
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,516
for a 20th way

168
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,809
Both calligraphy and swordplay

169
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,317
rely on one's strength and spirit

170
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,612
The 20th style would reveal

171
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,883
the essence of his swordsmanship

172
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,051
How odd to write it in 19 ways

173
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,988
It makes the written language

174
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,761
impossible to comprehend

175
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,558
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

176
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,202
and all the northern tribes

177
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,965
I will eradicate this problem

178
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,267
by mandating one style of writing

179
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,909
Wouldn't that be ideal?

180
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,238
Your Majesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

181
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,210
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

182
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,144
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

183
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,218
and establish a great empire

184
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,793
Hail! Hail! Hail!

185
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,455
Master Springbrook

186
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,320
Why are you going outside?

187
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,956
To fend off the arrows

188
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,388
You aren't needed. Stay inside

189
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,864
The Qin archers are powerful

190
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,036
You alone may not stop them

191
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,465
Hail! Hail! Hail!

192
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,132
You are good

193
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,094
You are even better

194
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,005
You didn't come here for calligraphy

195
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,773
Who are you?

196
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,677
I've travelled here to deliver an item

197
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,616
Please meet me in the library at midnight

198
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,884
Great calligraphy

199
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,385
Great swordplay

200
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,889
You didn't even see my swordplay

201
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,828
I couldn't have written without it

202
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,260
At midnight

203
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,631
meet me in the library

204
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,973
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

205
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,769
were readying for the next onslaught

206
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,247
I studied the character all night

207
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,249
trying to unlock the secret of his skills

208
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,991
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

209
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,897
But it's just an ordinary word

210
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,102
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

211
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,136
One must comprehend their true essence

212
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,338
Did you discover it?

213
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,908
It eluded me

214
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:07,116
So how did you challenge them?

215
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,458
Sky died by your sword?

216
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,664
Yes

217
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,399
Who are you? Why are you here?

218
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,271
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

219
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,271
I have a message from Sky

220
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,641
Go on

221
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:33,808
He said he had lived a life

222
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,845
without responsibilities or commitments

223
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,982
He cared for only one person

224
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,150
Who?

225
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,645
Flying Snow

226
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,833
Sky was certain she would avenge his death

227
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,578
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

228
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,798
You can leave now

229
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,809
Go!

230
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,765
I know you saw us!

231
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,276
I let you see us on purpose!

232
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,217
I no longer care about you at all!

233
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,115
We were both very foolish

234
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,271
I'm not going to fight you

235
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,473
Go away!

236
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,009
I will kill you in honor of my master!

237
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,408
You ask to die. I will help you.

238
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,588
Why do you laugh?

239
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,516
What you did last night was stupid

240
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,396
My plan proved successful

241
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,662
When Flying Snow was fighting me

242
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,770
she was disturbed and disoriented

243
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,107
I defeated her easily

244
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,157
I never imagined supreme warriors

245
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,124
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

246
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,127
allowing their emotions
to be a liability

247
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,552
It sounds as if you did divide them

248
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:49,683
Yes

249
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,215
In that case, they must have been

250
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,358
petty and narrow-minded

251
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,583
True

252
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,456
Your story sounds logical

253
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,755
But

254
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,831
you have underestimated one person.

255
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,064
Who?

256
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,002
Me

257
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,373
Would you like my impression of them?

258
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,940
Three years ago they stormed the palace

259
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,211
I was impressed

260
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,842
by their valor and dignity

261
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,814
Their character could not be petty

262
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,051
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie

263
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,883
Their betrayal of one another is a lie

264
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,025
The story you just told is a lie!

265
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,493
Except for one thing

266
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,436
Sky did know one of you

267
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,663
Who?

268
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,134
You

269
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,206
I surmise you two were old friends

270
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,782
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation

271
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,009
What's that?

272
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,449
He permitted it

273
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,387
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact

274
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,466
using my men as witnesses

275
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,761
That was not hard to arrange

276
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,201
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

277
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,703
to put his life in your hands

278
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,706
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

279
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,641
He died willingly under your sword

280
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,209
Such devotion deserves true respect

281
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,949
He was the first to sacrifice himself

282
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,018
for your mission

283
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,983
Sky was proud

284
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,820
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter

285
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,724
What convinced him you could succeed

286
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,387
where he had failed?

287
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,560
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

288
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,998
with one goal, my assassination

289
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,801
You have a great skill
that few can counter

290
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,754
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me

291
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,721
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

292
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,161
I surmise that your skill

293
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,320
requires you to come within 10 paces

294
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,362
You needed a second sacrifice

295
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,231
to claim another reward

296
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,996
to bring you within 10 paces

297
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,371
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

298
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,444
had never met Sky

299
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,738
they instantly understood

300
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,348
the reason for his defeat

301
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,654
How far am I from the bookshelves?

302
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,358
About 10 paces

303
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,599
10 paces is fine

304
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,912
I need one of you to help me

305
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,739
Please decide between yourselves

306
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,608
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning

307
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,727
How swift thy sword!

308
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,459
True

309
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,337
Sky was a superior warrior

310
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,431
He willingly gave his life to this man

311
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,474
He can kill the King

312
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,210
We must proceed

313
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,987
That means we will die

314
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,325
Then we die together

315
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,022
You were one step ahead of me

316
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,908
Did I hurt you too much?

317
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,644
I should be the one who fights him

318
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,617
I want you to live

319
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,687
If you died, how could I live?

320
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,719
You will live on, promise me

321
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,168
Say it!

322
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,277
All right

323
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,992
Moon is on her way

324
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,495
I had better go

325
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,185
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

326
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,990
Please allow me to fight this assassin

327
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,130
She is on His Majesty's most wanted list

328
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,169
Now she's here, I will arrest her

329
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,497
The assassin and I have an agreement

330
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,401
to fight one on one

331
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,610
Should I be unable to defeat her

332
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,109
please apprehend her

333
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,978
Your permission is sought

334
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,122
Draw your sword!

335
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,151
Hail! Hail! Hail!

336
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,257
Make your move!

337
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,754
Hail! Hail! Hail!

338
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,289
I die willingly

339
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,456
Make your move

340
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,674
Hail! Hail! Hail!

341
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:21,812
Hail! Hail! Hail!

342
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,986
Hail! Hail! Hail!

343
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:35,156
Hail! Hail! Hail!

344
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,221
How swift thy sword!

345
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,456
I believe you and
Broken Sword also fought

346
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,529
And like your fight with Sky

347
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,026
it was not real

348
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,927
but rather it was

349
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:24,403
a battle in your minds

350
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,668
A fight to honor Flying Snow.

351
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:35,958
My master wishes you to have his sword

352
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,068
Why?

353
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,002
He and she are bound in life and death

354
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,939
They will never part,
nor will their swords

355
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,819
It is his dying wish

356
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,657
that you take his sword for your mission

357
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,926
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

358
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,562
sacrificed themselves

359
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,197
so you can be within 10 paces of me

360
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,958
All three gave you their lives

361
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,230
The best of friends could not give more

362
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,139
Therefore you are

363
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,797
the most dangerous assassin of all

364
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,646
How did you uncover my plan?

365
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,856
The flames of these candles

366
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,225
are disturbed by your murderous intent

367
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,696
All of you

368
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,171
are willing to die for a cause

369
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:28,406
I'm ashamed to say
I am not that committed

370
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,636
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

371
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,115
If I had realised this sooner

372
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,919
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

373
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,489
A citizen of Qin would not do this

374
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,854
Who are you?

375
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,689
A man of Zhao

376
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,528
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

377
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,099
I wandered into Qin

378
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,792
and was adopted

379
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,664
I discovered my real identity
10 years ago

380
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,939
and set my heart on this plan

381
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,236
You've come to avenge Zhao

382
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,874
I see

383
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,344
I would like to know

384
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,885
if your special skill has a name

385
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,517
As Your Majesty guessed

386
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,355
there is only one crucial move

387
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,647
What is that?

388
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,591
"Death within 10 Paces."

389
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,986
"Death within 10 Paces." A good name!

390
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:21,823
All my guards are 100 paces away

391
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,262
outside the palace

392
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,629
You are within 10 paces

393
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,694
It would seem

394
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,797
that today I am doomed

395
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,145
But I sense your hesitation

396
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,212
Your Majesty is perceptive

397
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:46,978
However

398
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,355
you too have underestimated someone.

399
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:52,289
Who?

400
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,861
Broken Sword

401
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,771
I needed to prove to them

402
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,305
that my sword was fast and accurate

403
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:52,816
Within 10 paces

404
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,923
my sword strikes with surgical precision

405
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,555
If it enters at precise pressure points

406
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,786
it will not cause any fatal injury

407
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,160
If one of you would take a blow

408
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:06,960
before witnesses, we can fool the King

409
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,002
Such a blow is hardly child's play

410
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,099
How is Sky now?

411
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,738
Fully recovered

412
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,344
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

413
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,878
The King's security is impenetrable

414
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,814
There was no other way

415
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,619
His lmperial Guards were useless

416
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,558
He should have died three years ago.

417
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:30,815
What went wrong?

418
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,128
I abandoned the plan

419
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,900
The King must not be killed

420
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,805
He said that?

421
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:44,598
Yes

422
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,798
Why?

423
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,374
I also asked him

424
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,768
What did he say?

425
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,004
He would not explain that day

426
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,980
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

427
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:59,481
He and I are probably equal in skills

428
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:04,819
What he told me later

429
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,552
greatly unsettled me

430
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,095
While I'm alive

431
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,093
I'll stop you assassinating the King

432
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,767
I will help you

433
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,371
He let the opportunity go by

434
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,712
This time, we must succeed

435
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,279
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp

436
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,454
Please do me a favor

437
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,393
Help me fight Broken Sword!

438
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:50,969
Master!

439
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:58,645
What are you waiting for?

440
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,746
Although I had agreed to help her

441
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,847
attack from behind is dishonorable

442
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,683
so I couldn't draw my sword

443
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:10,320
But we both knew

444
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,253
if we did not stop Broken Sword

445
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,857
we would never succeed

446
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,164
Moon, don't!

447
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:09,438
You're no match for him. Stop

448
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,368
I knew this would happen

449
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,102
You can't stop me now

450
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:42,172
Even wounded, I will still stop you

451
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,579
Then I will kill you!

452
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,717
Did I hurt him too much?

453
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:55,984
Your special medicine

454
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,984
should heal his wounds in a day

455
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,155
Have you delivered it?

456
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,199
I tended to the wound myself

457
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,731
After the battle, take my sword

458
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,394
and follow Nameless to see the King

459
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:10,761
Yes

460
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,237
They won't treat a servant harshly

461
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,033
If the assassination succeeds

462
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,403
wave a red flag on your return

463
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,381
If it fails, a yellow one

464
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,848
If something happens to you

465
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,612
any message will be useless

466
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,453
I will smile from Heaven

467
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,727
if I see a red flag

468
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,870
How is Flying Snow?

469
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,472
She is resting

470
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,551
She doesn't know I've come

471
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,552
You said you'd stop me

472
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,590
Please abandon the mission

473
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:38,288
You know I am a man of Zhao

474
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,650
So am I

475
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,552
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

476
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:42,953
Yes

477
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,996
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

478
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,332
Yes

479
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,467
Who are you trying to defend?

480
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,169
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

481
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,378
Flying Snow has asked me that too

482
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,212
When we first met

483
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,946
I was living a carefree life

484
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,818
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

485
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,525
who died in battle against Qin

486
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,590
She inherited his sword

487
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,294
I knew she would avenge her father

488
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,297
I promised to help her

489
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,697
Calligraphy and swordplay

490
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,301
share the same principles

491
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,872
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

492
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,136
and to heighten our powers

493
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,414
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

494
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,452
calling no place home

495
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,017
Once we'd killed the King, she said

496
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,250
she would take me to her home

497
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,257
There'd be no more swordsmen

498
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,889
only a man

499
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,156
and a woman

500
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,615
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

501
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,256
Swordsmanship is the same

502
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,186
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

503
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,822
Gradually I recognised a greater cause

504
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:29,894
Three years ago we perfected our skills

505
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,197
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

506
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,166
Together, we stormed the palace

507
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,683
She asked why I had abandoned the mission

508
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:42,784
I told her the King must not be killed

509
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,125
That is what calligraphy taught me

510
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,825
I didn't kill the King

511
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,360
After that she refused to talk to me

512
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,103
Please abandon your plan

513
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,302
No

514
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,842
Was your sword forged in hatred?

515
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,238
Yes

516
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,576
For 10 years, it has never tired

517
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,311
I can't stop now

518
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,113
How can I dissuade you?

519
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,885
Only by killing me

520
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:15,782
Are you that determined?

521
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,447
Yes

522
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,556
Allow me to convey my conviction

523
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,494
in three words

524
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:01,334
These words express my mind

525
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,795
Please consider

526
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,107
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

527
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,380
Flying Snow and I will never part

528
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:19,953
nor will our swords

529
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,028
Master Nameless

530
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,235
although I am just a humble servant

531
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,670
allow me to say a few words

532
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,804
I've been with my master since
I was eight

533
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,975
He taught me martial arts

534
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,012
and how to be a decent person

535
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,383
Whatever my master does

536
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,111
is for a good reason

537
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,123
The words he has given you

538
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,620
carry a deep meaning

539
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,959
Master Nameless, please take his advice

540
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:18,535
What were the words he wrote?

541
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,181
"All under Heaven."

542
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,214
All under Heaven...

543
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,612
Broken Sword said

544
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:27,253
"The people
have suffered years of warfare"

545
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,854
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

546
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,160
"by uniting all under Heaven."

547
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,595
He asked me to abandon the assassination

548
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,127
for the greater good of all

549
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,197
He said, one person's suffering
is nothing

550
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,670
compared to the suffering of many

551
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,505
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

552
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,438
compared to the greater cause

553
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,977
The person who really understands me

554
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,782
is my most feared enemy

555
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,024
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

556
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,928
So many attempts on my life

557
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,535
No one understands my intentions

558
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:18,104
Even my court officials

559
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,809
see me as a tyrant

560
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:27,415
But I never imagined

561
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,744
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

562
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,386
would truly understand

563
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,815
and appreciate my real motives

564
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,228
I would like to know

565
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:53,971
how you mean to kill me
without your sword?

566
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,770
By capturing yours!

567
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,582
This sword has protected me

568
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,193
through all my battles

569
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:17,226
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

570
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,232
if I die, I am content with my life

571
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,664
Let "All under Heaven"

572
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,199
guide your decision

573
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,256
It's just dawned on me!

574
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,186
This scroll of Broken Sword's

575
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,386
isn't about sword technique

576
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,963
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal

577
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,525
Swordsmanship's first achievement

578
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,169
is the unity of man and sword

579
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:38,363
Once this unity is attained

580
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,804
even a blade of grass can be a weapon

581
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,673
The second achievement is when

582
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:46,610
the sword exists in one's heart

583
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,342
when absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces

584
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,577
even with bare hands

585
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,285
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

586
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,849
is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

587
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:00,355
The swordsman is at peace

588
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:01,757
with the rest of the world

589
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,025
He vows not to kill

590
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,463
and to bring peace to mankind

591
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:38,161
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

592
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:42,634
that you are committed to the highest ideal

593
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,095
of ultimate swordsmanship

594
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,636
Therefore I cannot kill you

595
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,581
Remember those who gave their lives

596
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,718
for the highest ideal: peace.

597
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,569
No more killing
Nameless went within 10 paces of the King

598
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,972
He could not have missed

599
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,644
There is only one explanation

600
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,645
He must have abandoned the mission

601
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,120
What did you say to him?

602
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,122
I wrote three words

603
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:17,983
What words?

604
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,222
"All under Heaven."

605
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:24,889
That is all you care about!

606
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:25,964
And you

607
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,135
I don't believe you

608
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:30,701
How can I convince you?

609
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,348
Draw your sword

610
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,144
You've misled Nameless

611
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:47,179
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

612
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,522
Draw!

613
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,291
When we first met...

614
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,696
I had to prove myself to convince you

615
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,367
What can I do this time?

616
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:04,431
Just draw your sword!

617
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,614
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

618
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,492
So that you'd believe me

619
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,727
I always wanted to go home with you

620
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,776
Sadly, it won't happen now

621
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,507
Take good care of yourself

622
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,190
Why didn't you defend yourself?

623
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,742
Why didn't you defend yourself?

624
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,421
Why didn't you?

625
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,826
No more drifting, no more roaming

626
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,395
I'm taking you home now

627
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:02,474
Our home

628
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:12,704
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

629
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,974
Permission to execute?

630
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,350
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

631
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,883
Permission to execute?

632
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,702
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty

633
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,210
Show no mercy!

634
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,976
This is the law of Qin!

635
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,684
To conquer all under Heaven

636
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,983
the law must be enforced

637
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,752
Set an example for the world!

638
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,323
Execute him! Execute him!

639
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:05,898
Execute him!

640
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:11,603
Execute him! Execute him!

641
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:13,297
Execute him!

642
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:23,908
Execute him!

643
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:49,168
Hail! Hail! Hail!

644
01:31:52,607 --> 01:32:04,007
Hail! Hail! Hail!

645
01:32:40,193 --> 01:32:42,606
Nameless was executed an assassin
but buried a hero...

646
01:32:42,606 --> 01:32:45,470
Sky gave up his sword
in honor of his fallen friends...

647
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:50,737
In 221 B.C., the King of Qin conquered
all six kingdoms and unified China.

648
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:55,061
He ceased all expeditions and built the Great Wall
to protect his subjects from the Northern Tribes.

649
01:32:55,061 --> 01:32:57,620
The Qin Empire became the first dynasty of China...

650
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:01,404
And Qin Shihuang... the First Emperor.
