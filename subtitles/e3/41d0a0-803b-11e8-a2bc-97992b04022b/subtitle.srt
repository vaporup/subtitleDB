1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,043
STUDIO 2.0 presents

2
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:19,846
In association with OCN
KOCCA, and KTB Network

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,651
a J TEAM Studio production

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,486
The world has run out of
all forms of energy.

5
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,893
People built a new city
by making

6
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,693
a new energy with
their excrements.

7
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,071
Soon after the city's leaders

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,572
announced two legislations

9
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,563
to generate and
control the new energy.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,446
First, installing an ID chip

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,073
in each of the citizen's anus

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,272
to monitor their
defecation level.

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,377
Second,

14
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,021
provide defecating
citizens in return

15
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,922
one addictive "juicybar".

16
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,893
Later, defecation amounts
have skyrocketed,

17
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,392
but the city became
full of addicts

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,566
due to the
juicybar's strong addiction.

19
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,962
Illegal trade of juicybars
became prevalent,

20
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,167
and the juicybar's
side effects

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,931
have created
dumb pint-sized mutants.

22
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,507
These mutants organized
a gang to plunder juicybars.

23
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,675
They became known
as the 'Diaper Gang'.

24
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,705
They're coming.
They're coming.

25
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,575
Hey, they're coming!

26
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,045
They're coming.
They're coming.

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,612
They're going. They're going.

28
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,152
They're coming.
They're coming.

29
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,221
Outta my way!

30
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,088
Hey slowpoke,
think you're faster?

31
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,067
You betcha!

32
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,260
Hey!

33
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,971
Bald bastard.

34
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,212
AACHI & SSIPAK

35
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,544
We are the forgotten orphans.

36
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,260
We once dedicated our crap
and youth to this city.

37
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,188
But what did our leaders
do for us?

38
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,891
Did they appreciate us
for our crap?

39
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,030
Never!

40
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,575
We became addicted to juicybars,
so we can never shit

41
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,067
or even reproduce because our
dicks have shrunk like peanuts.

42
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,144
Then they ran us out of
this city like garbage!

43
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,877
Why?

44
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,626
Because we've evolved into mutants,
liberating ourselves

45
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,821
from having to shit
all the time!

46
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,755
Diapers! Diapers!

47
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:40,057
Nonetheless,
we're in shitcreek now.

48
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,994
Juicybars is our only
source of food,

49
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,426
but we haven't had any
for a month.

50
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,061
And why is this?

51
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,060
Because of that
special cop, Geko?

52
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,997
No.

53
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,577
It's because
a whole bunch of you

54
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,341
piss-ass dumb shits

55
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,980
can't even blow away
one fuckin' cop!

56
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,717
Stand up!

57
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,383
This is your last chance to
redeem yourselves.

58
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,662
Tell me where
we can find juicybars

59
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,798
for our hungry brothers.

60
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,533
Kindergarten defecation classes.

61
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,868
Where were you before?

62
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,927
A kindergarten defecation class.

63
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,834
A juicybar factory?
No, a juicybar market?

64
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,473
No, how about...

65
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,678
You freaks don't deserve to
be called gangsters.

66
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,483
Know what punks
like you are called?

67
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,917
I know! Hoodlums!

68
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,955
Yes, hoodlums!

69
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,090
What?

70
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,457
I mean, these hoodlums...

71
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,997
A lot of hoodlums are

72
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,398
dealing juicybars in Section 4.

73
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,271
Hoodlums, you say...

74
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,205
You bonehead!

75
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,373
There's only eighteen in here,
not twenty!

76
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,278
You swiped two, didn't you?

77
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,836
Count it yourself, idiot!

78
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,841
You hopeless chimp.

79
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,555
You won't get your cut unless
you get two more.

80
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,090
And no chick as well.
Got it?

81
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,387
You twirp!

82
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,687
Why am I always doing
the dirty work?

83
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,192
Hey, you get the easy way out.

84
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,500
I always risk my life
being on the lookout.

85
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,406
Go and get some more.

86
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,237
We need to make up for it.

87
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,136
You little piss ant!

88
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,003
Then every chick we
find tonight are mine.

89
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,015
And if you cheat me again
and take off,

90
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,279
you're really gonna
pay this time.

91
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,090
Damn it, that hurt!

92
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,284
Stupid mutt!

93
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,536
Today the police
scored big again

94
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,595
for mopping up the
Diaper Gang.

95
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,542
We will rigidly tackle

96
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,100
any insincere defecation!

97
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,504
Have any problems defecating?

98
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,582
Well, I'm constipated.

99
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,919
Drink! Dump-free Yogurt!

100
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,443
FLUSH ITALL DOWN!

101
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,024
Now get ready, gear up and...

102
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,855
Headbump!

103
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,464
One, two, givin' it to ya'.
Don't get too wasted now.

104
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,695
Stop showing off and
do some kickin'!

105
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,837
Here comes daddy!

106
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,429
Your juicybar is being prepared.

107
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,329
Sorry to disturb.

108
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,643
Man! That's one hell
of a dump!

109
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,144
Juicybar delivery complete.

110
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,771
Smells damn good, too!

111
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,579
The way kids shit these days
is so impolite.

112
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,785
He's such a hopeless case.

113
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,685
His damn showing off gives
me the runs.

114
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,557
Abio, showing off here is useless.
We're in the can.

115
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,756
Screw off.

116
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,230
Run!

117
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,773
It's too damn hot
for this crap.

118
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,442
Let's go.

119
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,522
You little punks.

120
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,525
You assholes swiped a ton of
juicybars in Section 4.

121
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,220
Think you're big shots?

122
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,964
You cheating scums.

123
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,091
There's taxes on what you made.

124
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,426
What?

125
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,372
Bastard got some balls!

126
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,777
You little shit,

127
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,210
stop being a wus again.

128
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,523
Look here, cue ball.

129
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,627
Unless you want me to make sushi
out of your tongue,

130
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,663
bring me 100 juicybars a day.

131
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,290
Damn, you got cavaties.

132
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,199
Be a good boy!

133
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,924
And grow some damn hair!

134
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,070
You know my boss's cell
in prison, right?

135
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,434
Hand the juicybars over to him.

136
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,602
Let's go!

137
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,816
Oh yeah, Jimmy says hi.

138
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,882
You got a really good friend!

139
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,353
Ciao!

140
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,315
Jimmy, you son of a bitch.

141
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,426
John Doe is this month's
"King of Defecation".

142
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,560
If you become the "King",

143
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,796
you'll receive
unlimited VIP service

144
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,098
with beautiful girls
at a luxurious resort.

145
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,367
Try your best to defecate,

146
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,935
and be the "King of Defecation".

147
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,733
You can be the "King", too!

148
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,447
Foul bastards.

149
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,979
How dare they stuff things
into the sacred anus.

150
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,722
Those beasts are the real traitors
of our establishment.

151
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,349
They're evil to our society.

152
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,453
Don't you think, Captain?

153
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,798
Chief, so you mean...

154
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,665
They're illegal anus users?

155
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,272
- Like this, bitch?
- Harder!

156
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,573
- Like this?
- Harder!

157
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,908
- Like this?
- Harder!

158
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,009
- Like this?
- Harder!

159
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,499
Cut! Cut!

160
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,802
Cut!

161
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,414
You idiots,
get it right for once!

162
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,972
How many times
I gotta tell you?

163
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,376
Think we're shooting
a cheap porn?

164
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,042
You sluts.

165
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,223
Each whip should be
the sublime.

166
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,697
A girl who sacrifices her
anus to save the world.

167
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,799
Oh how beautiful she is.

168
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,096
Once this film is complete,

169
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,825
it will be praised
by critics and moviegoers,

170
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,706
and be a world-wide success!

171
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,977
Oh my Lord, how art thou
I be this talented?

172
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,069
Bullshit!

173
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,287
Hey asslover,
you're in deep trouble!

174
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,621
You freak!

175
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,163
Dr. Strange sawed another guard

176
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,405
into pieces again in prison.

177
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,465
That crazy old fart.

178
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,010
He'd be cooked on the
electric chair

179
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,069
if he hadn't created our cyborg.

180
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,315
Move him into the special cell
so that he can't touch anyone.

181
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,512
And report that he's
cooperating very well with us.

182
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,652
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,395
Geko, good work and...

184
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,762
My report for today.
99 kills and no arrests.

185
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,998
That despicable cyborg, how rude.

186
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,302
ANAL INSTICT

187
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,679
S&M MIZERY

188
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,153
HORNYALIENS

189
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,205
You freak,
what's with your room?

190
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,637
Don't you have anything kinky?

191
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,411
He's totally high, man.

192
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,384
Don't sweat it, dude.
Keep stuffing his face.

193
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,909
Look at him.
I'm telling you, he's toasted.

194
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,452
Okay, okay.

195
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,085
You like feeling high,
you pervert?

196
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,166
From now on, you're Shitman.

197
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,067
Shitman. Shitman.

198
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:14,033
Shitman. Shitman.

199
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,060
Yes!

200
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,059
I am!

201
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,766
Shitman!

202
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,635
Shitman, shall we save
the world now?

203
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,307
Here comes Shitman to bring
peace to the fuckin' world!

204
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,868
That was so cool.

205
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,234
Let's take him to
a higher place this time.

206
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,240
Then he'll croak for sure,
you meathead.

207
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,105
We need him for something else.

208
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,517
What the hell is this?

209
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,617
Pigeon poo?

210
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,518
Is this the right way?

211
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:44,925
Yes, sir!

212
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,098
I'm positive this is
the way to Section 4's prison.

213
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,502
Oh, how corrupt the world is.

214
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,501
A prison is a hideout
for hoodlums?

215
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,342
I'm bored!
Give me a vacation!

216
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,037
Who stole my Teddy Bear?

217
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,111
This sucks!

218
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,784
The world's too corrupt for
good citizens like me.

219
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,514
80 juicybars from the
Razor Gang in Section 3.

220
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,287
80 juicybars from the
Razor Gang in Section 3.

221
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,186
25 juicybars from the
Cobra Gang in Section 4.

222
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,719
25 juicybars from the
Cobra Gang in Section 4.

223
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,227
A measly 25 juicybars?

224
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,368
The Cobras seem to be
out of heart lately.

225
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,498
Yes, they do.

226
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,835
I'll break your balls
if you sleep on the job again!

227
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,046
Someone's here to see you.

228
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,040
What does he want to
snitch this time?

229
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,558
- What the hell?
- What's that?

230
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,737
Why are you stripping?

231
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,837
How dare you, you looney!

232
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,151
What are you going to do?
Charge me for smoking?

233
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,600
What's gotten into his head?

234
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,236
Of course it's prohibited,
you freak!

235
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,330
Who the hell do you
think you are?

236
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,440
That freak turned out to
be a useful friend.

237
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,782
Hey lady, time for the
'Misery' version.

238
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,250
Misery.

239
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,980
Misery.

240
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,017
Misery.

241
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,152
Misery. Misery.

242
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,401
Misery...

243
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,269
One, two, one, two.

244
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,497
Misery...

245
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,972
One, two, one, two.

246
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,305
You freak!
I'm gonna slice you in half!

247
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,778
Write it again!
Write it again!

248
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,109
Write it again!
Write it again!

249
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:25,180
Didn't I warn you not to kill
Misery without my permission!

250
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,152
This is much better
than the movie.

251
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:40,061
If you won't give it up,
then don't hit me at least!

252
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,246
Crap, it's my first erection
in three years.

253
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,544
You pervert.

254
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,812
How dare you hit your director!

255
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,354
Director, my ass.

256
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,487
You crazy bitch!

257
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,061
You call an animator
a real director?

258
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,363
Yes, I do.

259
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,956
What a bummer.

260
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,577
Hey, kid!
What are you looking at?

261
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,821
Who are you calling "kid"?
You rude bitch!

262
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,119
Isn't she totally hot?

263
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,369
Damn horndog is at it again!

264
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,805
Peabrain!
We have to finish the job first!

265
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,332
You horny bastard!

266
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,573
Diapers, diapers, diapers.

267
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,882
Die, you mushroom head!

268
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,745
Shoot that crazy bitch!

269
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,682
I mean that crazy asshole
right now!

270
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,890
Absent-minded myself.

271
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,493
What's this red crap?
Is the ceiling taking a shit?

272
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
What the hell are all these diapers?
Is this some kindergarten?

273
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,864
Let's go if it's all done.

274
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,510
Go, go, go!

275
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,675
One, two, one, two!

276
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,303
One, two, one, two!

277
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,873
Go, go, go!

278
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,841
Where am I?

279
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,740
Aliens?

280
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,913
Then that means...

281
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,413
Then that means...

282
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,080
Come to mama!

283
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,648
You evil beasts!

284
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,066
Alien Queen!
Give me my baby back!

285
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,969
Come on, bitch!

286
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,977
Oh no.

287
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,639
How can I give you a slow
and painful death...

288
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,732
I don't know why
I did that, but...

289
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,736
I'll compensate
you with juicybars.

290
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,212
Do you have any juicybars?

291
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,840
Well, I don't have any now,

292
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,749
but if my movie
becomes a big hit.

293
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,011
Movie?

294
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,310
Yes.

295
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,383
When my heroine takes a dump,

296
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,859
juicybars come gushing out.

297
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,292
Doesn't it sound like a hit?

298
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,895
Juicybars gush out
with just one dump?

299
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,665
How is that possible?

300
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,135
It happens only
in a fictional world.

301
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,670
Stop bullshitting!

302
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,005
Just tell me how.

303
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,496
Or else, you'll die
in the real world!

304
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:14,737
Right, I mean my movie is
about a holy sacrifice.

305
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,248
I mean in order to
enlighten her...

306
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,754
God digs out this
corruptive chip from her anus.

307
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,222
Yes, digs out.

308
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,758
Then, he sticks a blessed chip
back in there,

309
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,385
so...

310
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,696
So whenever she shits,
tons of juicybars gush out.

311
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,391
In other words...

312
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,633
Yes! It becomes a magical anus!

313
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,562
A magical anus...

314
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,699
So he digs it out
and sticks it in?

315
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,856
You've been implanted with
an ID chip at your birth.

316
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,228
This is your soul mate

317
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,130
to supply you with precious
juicybars for a plentiful life.

318
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:12,835
This ID chip in your anus is
your second identity.

319
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,992
Why didn't I think
about this before?

320
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,604
Since you gave me
this great idea,

321
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,199
I'll put these chips
into your rear with honor.

322
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,847
But...

323
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,374
I don't shit very well.

324
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,087
Nobody here can
shit better than you.

325
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,727
I'm extremely constipated,

326
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,490
and I even have hemorrhoids.

327
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,968
Sorry, I do a lot of
things with my butt.

328
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,244
Gross.

329
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,775
Drop him.

330
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,606
Wait!

331
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:33,718
Wait!

332
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,921
I'm gonna have an audition for
a girl who's good at shitting.

333
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,123
Wait!

334
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,715
Please don't kill me.

335
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,315
If you don't kill me,

336
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,729
I'll stick those
chips into a girl

337
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,424
who can shit
several times a day.

338
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,530
I beg you!

339
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,238
There she is.

340
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,201
She's going.

341
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,216
"Wanted ASAP"

342
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,877
"Excellent defecation skills"

343
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,278
"Need actress
with experienced anus"

344
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,679
"Jimmy's Pure Cinema"

345
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,860
Jimmy, that tough cockroach.

346
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,225
He's still alive.

347
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,700
Hey, let's beat the hell out of
Jimmy in front of Beautiful.

348
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,498
If I show her how strong I am,

349
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,361
I'll sweep her off her feet.

350
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,744
So Jean D'Arc is this lady

351
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,178
who was born to save the world.

352
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,847
But one day
a juicybar tycoon shows up.

353
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,912
May the anal force be with me.

354
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,655
Show me the anus!

355
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,146
So angry Jean D'Arc
tramps on him.

356
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,346
Oh my god!

357
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,427
But he turned out to
be an angel

358
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,895
looking for the city's saviour.

359
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,528
Oh, Jean D'Arc!

360
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,368
I will give you
a blessed anal chip.

361
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,496
Save the world with this.

362
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,866
That's stupid!

363
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,975
It's so boring.

364
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:10,241
How about a woman who saves
a man with her breasts?

365
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,615
A very, very rich man.

366
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,077
Hey, I'm the director here!

367
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,243
Oh my.

368
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,387
This is a film
about a noble sacrifice.

369
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:24,826
I mean, art...

370
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,724
An auteur film.

371
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,532
You know what
an auteur film is?

372
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,437
Why do I have to know that?

373
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,608
Being pretty is enough.

374
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,709
Come on baby.

375
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,880
Change it into tits, okay?

376
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,811
What the hell do you know?

377
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,482
A ditz like you will
never be a star in this business!

378
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,316
Then do it yourself,
Mr. Auteur.

379
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,952
Ciao!

380
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,204
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

381
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,569
Bend over, asshole!

382
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:12,177
You see, there are all
kinds of shit in this world.

383
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,546
Some are soft, some are hard,

384
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,315
and some just don't
turn out right.

385
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,716
But in the end, shit is shit.

386
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,352
The same goes for chics.

387
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,842
Then is my
Beautiful Shit inside?

388
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,786
Not a bad show.

389
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,694
Jimmy's bolder than I thought.

390
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,026
What are they doing, damn it?

391
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,164
What is it?

392
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,699
Oh, nothing.
They're just chit-chatting.

393
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,966
Well, it looks too loose.

394
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,869
Can she take a good crap?

395
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,640
Look how elastic her anus is.

396
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,282
Ten times a day
will be no problem.

397
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,292
I'll stick it in beautifully.

398
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,027
What the hell?

399
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,760
Damn it.

400
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,136
You idiot!

401
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,934
Jimmy, that son of a bitch,
is dead.

402
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,011
What are you doing,
you perverts!

403
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,178
What is it?

404
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,215
Run!

405
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,718
Oh, my tummy!

406
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,280
What's wrong with your tummy?

407
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,461
You perverts also with them?

408
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,830
No way.

409
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,100
How could we possibly
be with those jerks?

410
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,602
We were just passing by and...

411
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,126
Damn it!

412
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,968
What a major bitch.
She's the one who followed us.

413
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,543
Rotten perverts.

414
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,875
Why into my anus
of all places?

415
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,172
Damn it.

416
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,881
You must be constipated.

417
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,259
You think that will work?

418
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,658
No.

419
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:47,799
For constipations...

420
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,634
GOLD LAX!

421
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,902
And SILVER LAX!

422
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,704
Shut up!

423
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,441
She's a real pain in the ass.

424
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,375
How could she shit now?

425
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,846
Isn't she super sexy?

426
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,245
You blockhead!

427
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,416
Just bring her juicybar
after she finishes.

428
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,651
ID check complete.

429
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,676
Your juicybar will be delivered.

430
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,929
Oh my goodness!

431
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,633
Is it broken?

432
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,208
If anyone is on patrol in
Section 4, please comply!

433
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,310
What's with all these juicybars?

434
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,524
What did that pervert do to me?

435
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,527
She's pretty,
has an awesome personality,

436
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,586
and she's so fertile.

437
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,559
I love you!

438
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,992
She's a walking
juicybar factory.

439
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,500
Now I know why the
Diaper Gang wanted her so bad.

440
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,636
She takes one dump and
tons of juicybars are delivered.

441
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,410
Anyway, what should
I do with these leaches?

442
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,223
Beautiful,
trust me from now on.

443
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,624
I'll be your manager,
and we'll...

444
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,896
Flies like him tend to

445
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,698
swarm around
a beauty like you.

446
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,701
Let go! Gonna kill
a friend over a chic?

447
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,304
Whatever.
Remember when you ran away?

448
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,296
Don't worry, sweety.
I'm your man from now on.

449
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,236
You traitor!

450
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:51,479
Forgive me for asking you this,
but since I helped you

451
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,713
find their place,

452
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,858
mind if I go home now?

453
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,567
Help me!

454
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,202
Help me!

455
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,016
Eat this, you diapers!

456
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,936
Turn left! Left!

457
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,972
Is that left, you idiot?

458
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,987
Sons of bitches.

459
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,598
You show your juicybar trick
to the whole damn world?

460
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,912
That was the first time
I pooped so many juicybars!

461
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,278
Then what's up their asses?

462
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,111
How should I know what's in there?
I'm no ass expert.

463
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,013
Then go find out
and resolve this!

464
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,982
Who do you think I am?

465
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,267
This is 0497.

466
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,928
I don't see anything strange.

467
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,531
Not a soul in sight...

468
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,968
Shit! The Diaper Gang!

469
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,947
Cease fire!

470
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,848
Find the girl!

471
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,425
Find the girl, find the girl.

472
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,060
What are you waiting for?
Go after them!

473
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,645
This is evidence one
discovered on the scene.

474
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:32,783
His name is Jimmy,

475
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,775
and was presumed to be killed
by the Diaper Gang.

476
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,518
He pretended to be
a movie director,

477
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,021
and has a criminal record with
regard to illegal movies.

478
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,356
They were at the crime scene,

479
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,224
and were presumed
homeless hoodlums.

480
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,532
If an error occurred

481
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,868
in the computer on the
numerous ID registrations,

482
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,428
these two culprits are
very likely to have the answer.

483
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,473
So if we analyze
the defecation data

484
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,174
of the checked IDs...

485
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,835
Get to the point!

486
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,579
How are they related
to this case?

487
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,915
Well, they had
an illegal affair...

488
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,284
Shut up, you idiot!

489
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,447
Mobilize all the forces
and catch them all.

490
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,063
WANTED

491
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,092
We found her!

492
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,728
We found her!

493
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,536
We found one woman

494
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,305
who last defecated
in our records.

495
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,441
The rest of the IDs have
no record of defecation.

496
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,309
The Diaper Gang
cannot defecate.

497
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,844
So their need for juicybars

498
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,679
makes them a big suspect.

499
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,680
If we capture her,

500
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,910
we'll be able to uncover
everything about this case.

501
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,985
A SWAT team is
now positioned

502
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,920
to track down
any massive supply

503
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,751
of juicybars within
three minutes.

504
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,354
Get to the point!

505
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,354
So will you catch them or not?

506
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,862
I will catch them, ma'am.

507
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,124
If you miss them this time,

508
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,228
you'll be the first to die.

509
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,170
Man, this is frustrating!

510
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,196
Look, I'm not
the same old Aachi.

511
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,442
If you wanna survive
in Section 4,

512
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,243
you better not get on
my bad side.

513
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,110
I got many customers waiting
in line besides you, old man.

514
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,713
Alright, I won't get upset.

515
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,020
Anyhow, hoodlums like
you walking

516
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,114
into this fancy hotel
is humiliating.

517
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,789
So quietly use the back door.

518
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,324
Senile old bastard.

519
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,292
Who does he think
he's talking to?

520
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,427
Beautiful, the old man is
coming to buy some juicybars.

521
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,263
How about a nice
whole-hearted shit?

522
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,002
Moron.

523
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,375
I'm the one who
feeds you punks.

524
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,706
What? Moron?

525
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,045
You bitch!

526
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,811
We got them!

527
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,550
All enforcements mobilize
to coordinates 646!

528
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,464
Just rough them up a little.

529
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,834
And remember,

530
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,734
my share is two thirds.

531
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:55,946
Are you ready?

532
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:56,810
Let's go.

533
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:58,846
Let's go!

534
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,413
Hold your gun right, idiot!

535
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,026
I got no hair,
but I got the body.

536
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,637
I'm such a hottie.

537
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,662
Cut the crap.

538
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,443
Old man, I told you
to use the back door.

539
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,337
You think my words
don't count?

540
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,514
You son of a...

541
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:44,228
One, two, one, two.

542
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,196
Ready! Ready!

543
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,788
Throw it!

544
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,594
Who the hell are you?

545
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,202
Where is she?

546
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,871
Who are you talking about?

547
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,805
I can't remember all my chics.

548
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,935
One, two...

549
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,038
You'll be okay, sweety.

550
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,684
Damn it, this is humilating.

551
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,912
You know who I am?

552
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,957
Wait! Let's talk!

553
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,049
So, well...

554
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,531
Over there...

555
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,702
Put your guns down!

556
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,646
- Don't move or we'll shoot!
- Put your guns down!

557
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,210
You little assholes,
how dare...

558
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,723
Who the hell are you?

559
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,224
Going up the stairs with
one leg is a pain in the ass.

560
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,791
What are you waiting for?
Go inside!

561
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,465
Move it!

562
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,474
Diapers! My leg!

563
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,465
Sons of bitches!

564
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,722
My money! My money!

565
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,468
You stupid old man,
don't be such a meanie.

566
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,165
We're in trouble.
We need back-up.

567
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,076
What are you doing?
Get in there and fight!

568
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,600
I hate you. Boss!

569
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,941
You bastards!
I have grenades!

570
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,027
Shit.

571
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,403
Damn it!

572
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,329
My hands are burning.

573
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,398
Get them!

574
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:38,926
Hurry and stand up!

575
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,209
You sons of bitches!

576
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,878
What have I gotten myself into!

577
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,816
How did things
turn out like this?

578
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,808
And is that little rat
alive or what?

579
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,077
Hold on tight, babe.

580
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,358
You little rat!
You're alive!

581
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,162
You idiot!

582
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,375
How could you bring
the Diapers with you?

583
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,175
I didn't, you moron.
They're the ones who followed me!

584
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,481
- Asshole!
- Yeah, asshole.

585
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,857
Man, you never make
things any easier.

586
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,382
Shut up and just follow me!

587
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,490
Crap, we're screwed.

588
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,537
Oney, do something!

589
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,172
Yeah! Bring it on!

590
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,471
Shit, we got a code
fucking red here.

591
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,639
Get them!

592
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:36,646
Get them! Get them!

593
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,260
Let go! Let go!

594
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,004
I said let go! Let go!

595
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,904
Damn it.

596
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,509
You son of a bitch!

597
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,485
Hey, who do you think you are?

598
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,343
You asshole.

599
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,783
Think you're a tough guy, huh?

600
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,113
Get him!

601
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,447
I'm a fake.

602
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,877
You lost.

603
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,509
Large illegal distribution
of juicybars...

604
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,678
The toilets in Section 4
were attacked...

605
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,613
The Diaper Gang attacked...

606
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,615
Growing crimes
by the Diapers...

607
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,116
Citizens, please stay calm.

608
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,414
We will poke out
the axis of evil.

609
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,223
Useless idiots!

610
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,248
Wipe them all off this planet!

611
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,992
This situation is terribly...

612
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,553
I won't eat it! I won't!

613
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,367
I'm not a shitmaker
for you dwarves!

614
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,436
- We were annihilated.
- You idiot!

615
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,470
According to a recent report,

616
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,671
a female in her 20s

617
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,196
seems to be related
to this case...

618
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:27,285
The Diaper Gang will rule
this city soon.

619
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,365
Yesterday we were
forgotten orphans.

620
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,637
But tomorrow we will stand up
as remembered orphans!

621
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,265
Diapers! Diapers!

622
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,610
Damn it!

623
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,077
I was a juicybar tycoon
just the other day.

624
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,049
The Diapers are rich now that
they have Beautiful,

625
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,518
while we're homeless fugitives.

626
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,325
That bitch!
It's all her fault!

627
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,962
This sucks.

628
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,601
How dare you call her that!

629
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,039
Shut your trap!

630
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,207
Beautiful made you rich
with all those juicybars.

631
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,076
Make me rich? Screw you!

632
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,476
You see us with
any juicybars now?

633
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,715
Then what the hell did you do
when my Beautiful got caught?

634
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:19,783
You're the one

635
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,774
who fainted after one punch!

636
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,217
I'm going.

637
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,649
Where are you going?

638
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,824
I'm going to save Beautiful.

639
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,027
What?

640
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,461
Hey, meathead!
Talk some sense!

641
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,069
Even the pigs can't beat them,

642
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,333
so what the hell
are you gonna do?

643
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,368
I'm going with or without you.

644
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,542
Cowards like you

645
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:49,740
will always live off of
snitching juicybars.

646
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,371
Hey!

647
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,286
You don't know
what true love is!

648
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,617
Hey!

649
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,282
You stupid romantic.

650
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:05,657
You dumb Romeo!

651
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,933
We have a traitor among us.

652
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,509
Otherwise,

653
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,876
it's impossible for the Diaper Gang
to obliterate us like this.

654
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,981
Actually, since Geko was

655
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,516
in charge of the
Diaper Gang until now,

656
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,211
we don't know their strategies.

657
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,020
No excuses!

658
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,717
Think we're weaker
than those dwarfs?

659
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,654
We need another plan.

660
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,190
Doctor, long time no see.

661
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,693
I'll get straight to the point.

662
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,132
Can you revive Geko?

663
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,270
I created him,
so it won't be so difficult.

664
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:29,012
But, I need a lot of corpses.
Very fresh ones.

665
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,980
If you can bring him
back to life,

666
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,916
I'll bring you all the
filth in Section 4.

667
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,981
I'm happy to hear that.

668
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,188
And one more.

669
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,354
Give me his corpse, too.

670
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,460
As you wish.

671
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,434
Damn it.

672
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,142
Wait, you!

673
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,303
You're that little shit!

674
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,103
What's up?

675
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,284
You little prick!

676
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,985
Don't you have anything
better to do?

677
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,655
Go to school, shithead.

678
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,987
I was a juicybar tycoon
just yesterday, damn it.

679
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,440
Tell me! Tell me now!

680
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,220
Where's my Beautiful?

681
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,756
Who are you?

682
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,053
Where's Beautiful?

683
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,686
Tell me where Beautiful is!

684
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,817
You sons of bitches!

685
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,343
Shit!

686
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,675
My motorbike! You assholes!

687
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,454
What the hell
are you doing here?

688
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,223
Just passing by, bonehead.

689
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,592
Then keep going, you twirp.

690
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,260
Mind your own business,
jackass.

691
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,129
You little turd.

692
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,598
Screw you and that
pride of yours.

693
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,199
What, you little dwarf?

694
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,734
You son of a bitch.

695
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,970
You're the worst character
in this movie!

696
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,631
Screw you, asshole!

697
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:35,213
My baby,
daddy will do you good.

698
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,749
You're so adorable.

699
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,239
If you bring me the scientist
who created Geko,

700
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,435
I will dispose of the Chief.

701
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:59,716
And I want the number
two position in your gang.

702
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,883
It's yours.

703
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,319
But if you're thinking
of betraying us

704
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,722
or plan to do
something stupid,

705
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,589
then you'll suffer a pain
worse than death.

706
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,527
If you don't kill the Chief,
she'll kill me first.

707
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,296
You can be assured that
I'll never betray you.

708
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,764
I'll be ready for you tonight.

709
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,468
Now do you feel like talking?

710
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,439
I don't know. I don't.

711
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,150
Bastard must be
high on juicybars.

712
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,018
How the hell do you not know
where your home is?

713
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,053
Asshole!

714
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,578
I have no idea!

715
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,623
He's really not gonna talk.

716
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,021
This punk's pretty loyal.

717
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,788
We better just kill him.

718
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,494
No! No!

719
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,837
Doctor, from now on you'll
work for us.

720
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,614
Now even mutants come
looking for me.

721
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,619
This will be quite a new thrill.

722
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,490
I'll go to any place
that has fresh corpses.

723
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,922
Escort him out.

724
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,230
Escort, escort.

725
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,289
When will you dispose
of the Chief?

726
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,899
No betrayer like you deserves
to be in our gang.

727
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,734
When will you dispose
of the Chief?

728
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,804
When will you dispose
of the Chief?

729
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,140
When will you dispose
of the Chief?

730
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,980
You raised a good assistant.

731
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,521
If you have the guts,
come to the desert.

732
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:54,259
You despicable fool,
how dare you betray me.

733
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,490
We can't find any traces
of Dr. Strange.

734
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,077
HAIL THE DIAPER KING!

735
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,735
Damn it, it's boiling hot.

736
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,896
True love conquers everything.

737
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,166
My Beautiful.

738
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,771
Attack!

739
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,445
What the hell is that?

740
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,310
Did they already clash
with the pigs?

741
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,180
That spells bad news for us.

742
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,782
This won't work.

743
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,487
We should think over our plan,

744
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,122
and then come back.

745
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,625
We gotta finish what

746
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,127
we started whether it
kills us or not.

747
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,163
Stop trying to be a hero and
let's just go back.

748
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,965
- You!
- You blockhead,

749
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,832
go without me.
I don't wanna die.

750
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,855
Execution to all who are
caught red-handed.

751
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,873
Geko, you lunatic!

752
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:51,874
It's dangerous!

753
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:52,806
Get out of here!

754
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,019
He's coming, he's coming.

755
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,481
Isn't that Beautiful?

756
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,914
Where?

757
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,825
He's coming, he's coming.

758
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,907
Damn it! My head!

759
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,544
Long live the Diapers!

760
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:26,363
Juicybars! Juicybars!

761
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:19,154
I told you we should've
just gone back!

762
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,352
Then what about Beautiful?

763
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,455
Who's more important?
Me or Beautiful?

764
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,223
Beautiful.

765
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,061
Think you can kill me?

766
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,869
I'm afraid not.

767
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:49,278
I told you we should've
just left!

768
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,846
But you go nuts over a chic!

769
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:51,938
Screw you!

770
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,045
Beautiful.

771
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,781
Stop talking crap!

772
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:01,649
Beautiful!

773
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,500
- Beautiful!
- Beautiful!

774
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,002
Hold on tight!

775
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,393
Hold her tight, idiot!
Beautiful's in danger!

776
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,207
Hurry! Pull her in!

777
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:38,714
Do something!

778
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,443
Put more muscle into it!

779
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,763
No!

780
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,165
Beautiful!

781
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:30,698
Very interesting-Iooking specimens.

782
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:46,181
Geko passed the XX point, roger!

783
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,282
Okay, roger!

784
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,749
Hey! Get it ready fast!

785
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,451
Fast! Fast!

786
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,918
What the hell is this?
Untie me!

787
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,628
You crazy old bastard!

788
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,292
Screw you!

789
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:10,996
He's coming, roger.

790
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,298
What? Coming?

791
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,005
Hey! He's coming!

792
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,307
Here he comes!

793
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,344
Fire!

794
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,909
Stop acting like Paris Hilton!

795
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:26,578
I let you slide until now,
but you've disrespected me.

796
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:31,353
I oughta slice your belly
and yank out your chip.

797
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,378
Get ready to die!

798
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,222
Don't touch Beautiful.

799
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:43,626
You damn hoodlum,
you're such a pain in the ass.

800
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,693
But no more games.

801
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,271
Hey! I'm right over here!

802
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,568
Srew you!

803
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,894
No!

804
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,895
Die, please! Die!

805
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,885
- You...
- Wait, that's...

806
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,512
Jimmy the freak?

807
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,756
When did you start working
for the pigs?

808
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:43,281
But I killed you with
my bare hands.

809
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,094
Let go!

810
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,363
Let go, you filthy bastard!

811
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:50,929
Die! Die!

812
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,408
You son of a bitch!

813
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,515
What the hell?

814
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,522
No!

815
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,734
You worthless hoodlum.

816
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,963
Stop, you blue asshole!

817
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,206
You belong down there.

818
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,315
You son of a bitch!

819
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:43,751
Beautiful.

820
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,381
- You bastard!
- Beautiful.

821
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,646
Beautiful!

822
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,219
Come back here!

823
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:53,290
Save the world like
you said you would.

824
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,039
Die!

825
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:14,672
Hey, it stopped.

826
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,349
How dare you.

827
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,695
Around and around we go!

828
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:43,735
Die!

829
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:58,460
Cut!

830
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,257
Cut! Cut!

831
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,240
You sluts!
I told you not to do it that way!

832
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,109
How many times do I
have to tell you!

833
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,620
You are charged

834
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,921
for interfering with
police duties,

835
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,288
for organizing an illegal clan,

836
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,222
and for murdering a policeman.

837
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,062
Whether dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

838
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:54,332
Beautiful! More!

839
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:55,975
Stretch a bit more!

840
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,773
Oh no, what is this?

841
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,311
You filthy bastard.

842
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,345
Nothing went right whenever
you showed up.

843
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:07,050
I didn't do anything!
I swear!

844
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:08,953
Idiot!

845
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,881
Please do something about this!

846
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,593
I don't want to die!

847
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,090
I hate you!

848
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:29,905
Beautiful! Try harder!

849
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,075
Do something fast!

850
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,149
Stretch out a bit more!

851
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,517
I can't anymore!

852
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,484
Stretch more!

853
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,949
Damn it!

854
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,313
I can't anymore.

855
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:46,127
- More!
- I can't! I can't!

856
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,925
A little bit more!

857
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,535
I can't stand it anymore!

858
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,333
Be patient, sweetheart.
I'll find you one soon.

859
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:00,933
Let's find you the right toilet,
so you can let out a big load!

860
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,477
What are you so happy about?

861
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:07,175
We're millionaires now!

862
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,208
Did you say "we"?
Who's "we"?

863
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,822
Who's "we"?
We're business partners of course!

864
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,449
Who asked you to be my partner?

865
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,093
In business,
logistics is more important

866
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,261
than production.

867
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,853
Got to know your stuff.

868
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,567
That big mouth never shuts up.

869
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,103
Anyway, your share is
one-fifth.

870
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:31,937
Stop talking and let's
jet out of here.

871
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:35,977
If you take a dump on the road,
it's a huge loss.

872
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:39,214
My shit is supporting you guys.
Better be grateful.

873
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,308
Let's go to the city
and run it dry!

874
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,848
SO LONG!

875
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:57,555
I'm going to have fun with
this new friend.

876
