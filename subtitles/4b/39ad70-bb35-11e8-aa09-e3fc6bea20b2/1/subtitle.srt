1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,213
Work harder! Keep on!

2
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,372
Cut!

3
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,840
Wake up! Even extras are actors.

4
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,143
We're not making a ghost film now.

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,913
Though you guys
play the roles of pedestrians,

6
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,818
but your roles still have life an soul.

7
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,587
Especially we've chance to act with
the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu...

8
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,593
so we should grasp this chance.

9
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,493
Act smartly, OK?

10
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,360
Action!

11
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,533
Cut!

12
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,404
- Who are you?
- I'm an actor.

13
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,807
Aunt Ha!

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,842
Yes.

15
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,972
- Who is this guy?
- An extra.

16
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,046
I'm an actor.

17
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,047
Are you mistaken?

18
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,716
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
I just went to toilet.

19
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,684
so I asked him to do the rehearsal.

20
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,281
Find someone who knows how to act,
we need one urgently.

21
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,927
- Let me do it.
- You?

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,726
Show me the expression of "nervous".

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,433
There're several kinds
of nervous expression.

24
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,499
The one on the face of a husband
whose wife is delivering a baby.

25
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,736
The baby is given birth.
But the wife is dead.

26
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,741
The baby calls him dad, he's a genius.

27
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,339
His dick is on his head, he's abnormal.

28
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,581
He wins Mark Six... first prize!

29
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,646
His son is dead...

30
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,848
His wife comes back to life.

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,455
His wife comes back to life.

32
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,784
No more response,
if one is struck too hard emotionally...

33
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,655
he will enter a state of mental coma,
he'll show no response.

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,688
Is there another guy?

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,631
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

36
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,892
I don't know what you were doing.

37
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,165
Was there anything wrong
with my expression?

38
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,998
I've said I didn't know
what you were doing.

39
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,667
Aunt Ha, none of your extras
is smart enough.

40
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,071
All these extras are above standard.

41
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,975
Sunny, is it done?

42
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,309
Everyone is waiting.

43
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,541
OK... Director, it'll soon be done...

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,847
- You, go and change your clothes.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,122
- Stand in this position.
- Got it.

46
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,715
- Lighting.
- Lighting is ready.

47
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,257
- Settings.
- Settings ready.

48
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,756
Actors.

49
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,758
Stand-by.

50
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,931
Sorry, Director.

51
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,066
According to the character of my role.

52
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,261
I want to play my role
with a bit naughtiness...

53
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,302
But contradiction. Will this be better?

54
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,634
OK, Speed.

55
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,234
Speed.

56
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,238
- Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1.
- Action!

57
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,278
Cut!

58
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,853
What is it?

59
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,514
What's wrong with the guy behind.

60
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,849
He's supposed to be dead.

61
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,152
- What are you doing? Aunt Ha!
- What is it? Brother Sunny?

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,625
What is your extra up to?

63
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,323
How come you are still alive?

64
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,092
As I said I'd play my role
with a bit naughtiness.

65
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,635
So subconsciously
I don't want to die yet.

66
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,673
You must pretend to be dead.

67
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,510
Actually, I was dying.

68
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,738
If you give me a bit more time,
I'll die eventually.

69
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,179
Do you know how many frames of film
are there in one second?

70
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,851
24 frames, Sister Cuckoo.

71
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,216
Do you know
how long is the shot just then?

72
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,882
I guess it about one minute.

73
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,315
Do you know as you didn't want to die...

74
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,292
that you've wasted how many seconds,
how many frames and how much money

75
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,022
and how much time
and effort of everyone here?

76
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,863
Are you fooling around here?

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,927
I'm begging you, you'd better
find a professional extra for this role.

78
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,162
Get someone smarter and shoot again!

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,902
You'd better be smart!

80
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,702
Go home and think about
when exactly you want to die.

81
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,674
OK, Brother Sunny.

82
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,510
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

83
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,480
Don't ask me again, I really don't know
what you were doing.

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,048
- Then I...
- Get lost.

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,449
You remind me I must go to a meeting
of Neighbour Welfare Association.

86
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,316
I'll be right back.

87
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,820
You don't have to come back.

88
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,086
I'm begging you, stop making trouble.

89
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,228
Let the director watch your performance?

90
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,062
Director, what kind of performance?

91
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,260
You are shot to dead, ready.

92
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,367
Action!

93
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,442
Was it OK, Director?

94
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,544
This is it, go and change your clothes.

95
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,110
- Go ahead.
- Thanks...

96
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,646
Where did you learn acting, man?

97
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,182
- I've never learnt it.
- You're a real genius.

98
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,985
You can make it if you work hard.

99
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,220
Why are you still standing here?
Fuck off!

100
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,792
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,195
Unit manager,
I want to get a lunch box only.

102
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,460
It's not yet lunch time.

103
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,370
- As I'm leaving now, so I...
- Then you just go!

104
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,507
Do you know why it's not yet lunch time?

105
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,072
Just because of you, bastard,
you didn't want to die!

106
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,712
And now everyone is working
and starving.

107
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,371
I haven't eaten as well!

108
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,608
Do you want to have lunch?
Share your lunch with that puppy!

109
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:10,495
Shit, you're a dump of shit.
Your life is cheaper than ants.

110
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,358
I ride a Mercedes,
you pick your nostril.

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,968
You want to have lunch?
You better eat shit!

112
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,140
Why did you just come back now?

113
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,122
- You guys have lunch already?
- Shut up, get me a ping pong racket.

114
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,759
OK!

115
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,558
Where's the ping pong ball?
Get me one now.

116
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,057
Quick.

117
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,362
- Right away.
- Hurry.

118
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,963
This is Neighbour Welfare Association.

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,907
You mustn't be late,
many people are waiting for you.

120
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,338
Hello, Aunt Ha?

121
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,376
Nothing, I want to check the time
for tomorrow notice.

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,447
You haven't for tomorrow.

123
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,276
What about the day after tomorrow?

124
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,815
Nothing for the day after tomorrow
and so on.

125
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,883
Aunt Ha, where are you?

126
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,290
None of your business, what do you want?

127
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,727
I check with you again, is there notice
for role without dialogue?

128
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,297
No.

129
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,800
- Any role that can't be seen clearly?
- No.

130
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,802
Any role that can't he seen completely?

131
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,032
I can't see you now. Don't trouble me.

132
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,602
- Aunt Ha, where are you?
- Go to hell!

133
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,799
Dear fellows.

134
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,706
The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from
a well-known Chinese classic literature.

135
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,538
You guys all know it well.

136
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,240
Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor,
you guys want to see it, right?

137
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,508
So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

138
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,752
Kelly, is there anything to do
after dinner tomorrow?

139
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,186
Taking a dump.

140
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,855
Come and watch Uncle San's play
after taking a dump, it'll be fun.

141
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,087
Remember to bring your dad and mom too.

142
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,926
If they don't come, you can cry,
spit around.

143
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,067
Do whatever you can until they come,
then you'll be a good girl.

144
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,862
I pamper you, Kelly.

145
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,070
Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow.

146
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,541
You'll result like this doll.

147
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,574
You get that?

148
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,285
Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm"
will be on show tomorrow night.

149
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,582
Have you studied the script well?

150
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,318
Yes, don't worry.
I can even compose a song.

151
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,587
Old Master sings
whenever he sees the maid.

152
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,860
You're beautiful...

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,264
Uncle Chi, I'm the one
who sing the theme song.

154
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,131
And the role of "Old Master"
you play is a Chinese as well.

155
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,704
When the maid sees the Old Master,
she will sing...

156
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:54,141
You're so handsome, you're so smart...

157
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:59,478
- Thank you much, please to...
- Uncle Chi, please don't...

158
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,517
- I accept you...
- Are you OK?

159
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,348
Think positive, Uncle Chi.

160
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,819
Someone helps me, come on.

161
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,950
Master Hung, morning.

162
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,527
My play "Thunder Storm"
will soon be showing.

163
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,594
Shall we make another rehearsal?

164
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,859
Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm"
is about righteous, I knew it.

165
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,535
We're triad society member,
we only talk about two things.

166
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,867
First, about righteous,
second, about money.

167
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,234
I'll talk about righteous first.

168
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,834
"Righteous" is good, but we mustn't
ignore the love line of the story.

169
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:31,007
Because the role you play
will finally be struck to death.

170
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,811
Talking about "struck" (chopping),
let me tell you...

171
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,410
There are two kinds of "struck"
(chopping) in our world.

172
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:41,552
First, it is "dragging".
Second is "stabbing".

173
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:48,394
Look, this scar was dragged by knife.

174
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,362
While "stabbing" is like this.

175
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,232
This scoundrel is new comer, sorry,
he shows no expression.

176
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,367
"Stabbing" is like this.

177
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,741
Be serious,
let us know if you feel the pain, OK?

178
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,881
Your acting is lousy.

179
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,949
Brother Sau, teaching him for me.

180
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,287
Talking about "pain"...

181
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,793
according to Stanisslavski,
master of acting from Russia.

182
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,125
Pain is transmitted from your body to
the inside, and outside again.

183
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,197
Let try one more time.

184
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,868
Look, it's much better this time.

185
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,642
Isn't it? He acts much better now.

186
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,272
Let's try one more time.

187
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,515
Right, a little bit more, more,
being stabbed.

188
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,118
Maybe I can help you this way.

189
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,763
This is working, tears come out now.

190
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,404
Look clearly, remember this expression,
remember this feeling.

191
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,845
Do remember this, get it?

192
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,173
Let's go.

193
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,512
What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow.

194
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,845
No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm".

195
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,386
We will come for sure,
promise is a promise!

196
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,288
I'll bring hundreds of people
to watch your play as well.

197
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,793
- It's a deal.
- Just don't worry.

198
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,021
Faster.

199
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,060
Get into position.

200
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,400
Granny, you stepped on someone.

201
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,368
I didn't step on anyone.

202
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,568
You just couldn't feel when you
stepped on him, look at his foot.

203
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,004
Yes, he's sweating as well.

204
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,708
Give me some money and I'll
send him to the hospital.

205
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,179
I have no money.

206
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,217
Look at him, he's dying.

207
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,015
I only have $100 left.

208
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,417
Give me, that $100.

209
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,152
Let's move!

210
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,663
Granny, you've dropped some money.

211
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,463
Really good luck.

212
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,932
Sir...

213
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,073
- Are you free tomorrow?
- What is it?

214
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,333
"Thunder Storm" is on show
at Neighbour Theatre.

215
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,908
"Thunder Storm"? Good!

216
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,444
Miss, what's your name?

217
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,452
Piu, and you?

218
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,090
This is your name, really?

219
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,226
Whatever I told you,
just call me Piu, idiot?

220
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,985
You're really a student?

221
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,530
Sure I am, I'm still a virgin,
isn't that great?

222
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,026
It's your luck, Uncle.

223
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,496
Let's play 'Chai Fist'?

224
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:44,698
I don't know how to play it.

225
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,998
You don't know 'Chai Fist'?
Have you been educated?

226
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,164
Fanny, come here.

227
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,768
Your belly is really big!
Mind you can't get into the coffin.

228
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,572
'Chai Fist', Bingo!

229
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,977
Come on, relax, have some fun.

230
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,640
Cheer up, why did draw your face?
Your parents are dead or something?

231
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,216
Chai Fist', Bingo!

232
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,854
Triangle, rectangle, four!

233
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,280
Good, I'll drink!

234
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,201
Tonight is College Girls'
First Love Evening.

235
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,434
So please mind your words,
do behave like a student girl.

236
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,209
If clients complain about you again,
then I can't help you anymore.

237
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,104
What College Girl? Just a damned trick.

238
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,178
If I can be a college girl,
I won't be working here.

239
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,542
You believe you did nothing wrong?

240
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,878
Mamasan, the man at Table 7
is really ugly.

241
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,647
I can't stand it and
lam not doing business with him.

242
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,087
Do you all want to
be selecting on clients?

243
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,452
No...

244
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,322
You're too much.

245
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,223
You are not professional,
you can concentrate on one single.

246
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,592
One single spot?

247
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,325
If that man is ugly,
you needn't look at him.

248
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,003
If his ears are pretty,
just stare at his ears.

249
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,038
If his mouth is ugly but the teeth
are nice, just look at his teeth.

250
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,369
So you new comer are really ignorant.

251
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,912
Let me deal with him.
Come on, watch what I'll do.

252
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,377
Be smart.

253
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,949
Hi!

254
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,721
You're pretty.

255
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,154
What's your name, Boss?

256
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,060
My name is Pierre.

257
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,828
It's a French name.

258
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,301
Are everyone says I look like
a Frenchman, so I get a French name.

259
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,034
If you can't pronounce that well,
just call me Pi or Erre.

260
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,244
What's on?

261
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,940
You used to be proud,
now you get a lesson.

262
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,319
You can't blame me, he's a real rarity.

263
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,354
Have you seen anyone
put a cockroach on his head?

264
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,424
What's the problem?

265
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,287
Look at LuLu,
she's playing with that cockroach now.

266
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,959
I admit failure.

267
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,534
OK, from now on,
you won't have clients to sit at.

268
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,603
You'll be bored to death.

269
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,500
You're all like this.

270
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,571
Connie, come and teach her for me.

271
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,602
You're not amateur, you should know
you must act in front of clients.

272
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,511
But your problem is: you acting stinks.

273
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,810
I can do nothing about it.

274
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,978
I hear someone teaches acting for free.

275
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,348
I'll take you to see him.

276
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,350
Teaches acting?

277
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,594
- Hey, men.
- Yes!

278
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,667
Hurry up, start working.

279
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,036
You again?

280
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,868
Morning, Brother Sunny.

281
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,634
Aunt Ha!

282
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,002
I'm looking for him too.

283
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,145
I haven't given you a notice,
what brings you here?

284
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,179
Remember last time that you asked me
to think about the ways to die.

285
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,445
I've thought over and
I have some new ideas now,

286
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,621
and I believe my performance
will make you satisfied.

287
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,915
I would have killed you in the past.

288
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,319
Talking about knife,
it's different from a gun.

289
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,156
The position of the wound
is usually under the armpit, here.

290
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,255
The wound is a bit bigger,
and the face will twist more.

291
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,231
If you're betrayed by your own friends,
you will even...

292
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,067
I didn't expect... it's you...

293
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,542
Get lost!

294
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,305
Brother Sunny, I...

295
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,911
I just want to act,
give me a chance please.

296
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:16,981
Do you love standing here?

297
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,083
OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime.

298
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,015
I'll act even if you don't pay me,
I only want a lunch box.

299
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,281
But lunch box costs money too, beat it!

300
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,516
Sunny.

301
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,549
What is it, Martial Art Director?

302
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,356
It's bad to use this mannequin
to disguise as a dead man.

303
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,191
Figure it out, we're in a hurry!

304
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,832
Yes, OK... got it.

305
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,269
Thank you, Brother Sunny.

306
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,369
Only a lunch box.

307
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,438
No problem,
should I put some make up on?

308
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,509
Put it on now.

309
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,908
Director, the actors are ready.

310
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,148
Actors are all ready.

311
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,817
Cockroach...

312
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,083
Let's help sister Cuckoo.

313
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,456
Cockroach!

314
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,496
Go to hell!

315
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,067
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid.

316
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,364
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid,
it's OK now.

317
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,473
Director, can we cut now?

318
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,834
It's still running?

319
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,333
Cut!

320
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,068
- OK.
- Are you OK?

321
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,805
Must you do all these
to kill a cockroach!

322
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,543
Let's see if he's alright?

323
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,282
I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo,
thanks for your concerns.

324
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,879
Why don't you move at all?

325
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,258
I didn't move
since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

326
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,087
So I mustn't move.

327
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,558
Do you hear that...

328
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,934
He keeps on acting since the Director
hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

329
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,095
This is what I always tell you:
professionalism.

330
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,669
What's your name?

331
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm called Wan Tin Sau.

332
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,644
- Yee, give him a cup of coffee.
- Yes.

333
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,314
- Get his phone number for me.
- Yes.

334
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,282
You... work in my team from now on.

335
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,217
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

336
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,548
- Is this shot OK?
- Yes.

337
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,348
Weapon comes.

338
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,520
- Sunny.
- Yes.

339
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,493
lam telling you,
even extras are important.

340
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,362
The one who played the father,
we mustn't use him again.

341
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,397
Got it, Sister Cuckoo.

342
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,926
Sister Cuckoo,
I am the one who played the Father.

343
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,842
In fact, it is like this...

344
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,805
Fine...

345
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,778
Let me clean it for you,
towel, get the towel.

346
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,319
- Sister Cuckoo!
- Watch out!

347
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,727
Sister Cuckoo, are you alright?

348
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,022
Don't touch.

349
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,068
Don't touch!

350
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,107
Very pretty.

351
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,114
Sister Cuckoo!

352
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,338
Security guard, is there someone here
who teaches acting?

353
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,880
I've been in the field of art for ages.

354
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,451
Whether it's movie or TV,
I'm experienced.

355
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,647
I was the creative director
in Amusement Park Theatre.

356
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,759
So I can sing and dance.

357
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,827
You mean you are the instructor here?

358
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,691
Well, many people here
love theatre and play.

359
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,198
They love studying plays with me.

360
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,029
Those people introduce us here indeed.

361
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,465
OK, this way please.

362
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,430
It's you?

363
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,440
Didn't you play in that film... that...

364
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,440
The stupid man standing behind, falls
after stepping on a banana peel?

365
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,811
You noticed my performance too?

366
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,249
You idiot! Only an idiot will fall
after stepping on a banana peel.

367
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,422
- Why don't you go dying?
- Thanks.

368
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,716
- Are you really that stupid?
- You're flattering me.

369
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,361
You damned extra, you are...

370
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,090
In fact, I am an actor. That way please.

371
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,424
Damned extra.

372
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,866
What can I do for you?

373
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,235
Frankly,
we're hostesses of a night club.

374
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,532
I can tell.

375
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,538
We're holding "College Girls'
First Love Evening" right now.

376
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,477
These girls dare to say they don't
have the feeling of first love at all.

377
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,211
How can you work like this?

378
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,545
First love was shown at the stage
when we where babies.

379
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:01,524
Say, when a baby sees a comforter,
he wants to suck it.

380
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,128
This is a kind of love.

381
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,665
Why did you suck a comforter?
You damned extra.

382
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,160
In fact, I am an actor.

383
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,933
Well, so why did you talk about
sucking a comforter?

384
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,272
I'm going to explain everything to you.

385
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,304
OK, let's explain it.

386
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,708
First, you must dress up
like a college girls,

387
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,078
about dialogue, at some vital points...

388
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,583
such as: I love you, I hate you, etc.

389
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:34,384
It'll be more impressive
if you have some tears in your eyes.

390
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,024
Just like this.

391
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,335
Do you see? That teardrop...

392
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,702
Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes.

393
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,531
Where is the teardrop? You damned extra.

394
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,643
In fact, I am an actor.

395
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:01,283
You might need something to help you
since you've no experience,

396
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,613
and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi.

397
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,224
Wasabi? What are you talking about?

398
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,019
Must we be fooled by this damned extra?

399
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,661
Miss, if you must call me an extra,

400
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,698
you don't need to add 'damned'
in front of it.

401
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,436
In fact, being club girls...

402
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,905
If you can show some respect
to the others, then...

403
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,940
- What are you calling us?
- Excuse me.

404
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,779
Forget it, we are club girls indeed.

405
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,312
I just don't like him
calling me that way.

406
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,242
She's always like this, never mind her.

407
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,023
It's OK...

408
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,330
I've asked you not to stir up trouble!

409
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,495
It's OK...

410
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,436
It's OK...

411
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,112
Why must you still behave like this?
Don't panic, it's alright.

412
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,178
- Don't panic, it's alright.
- Club girls?

413
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,577
It's alright... Don't panic,
take it easy, it's alright.

414
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,718
How could I know he's so amusing?

415
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,583
I brought you there as I thought
he charged for nothing.

416
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,493
Please, beware what you say
to the clients.

417
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,161
- Go out...
- I'm sorry.

418
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,127
What's going on?
This is a big night club.

419
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,594
Get lost, I'm sorry.

420
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,666
- Are there other hostesses?
- Yes, they're coming soon.

421
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,861
Connie, come here.

422
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,799
What is it, Mama Debra?

423
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,472
Master Lung is here and he's drunk.

424
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,939
He thought he's being dumped
and he wants his first lover back.

425
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,872
All the girls here are college girls,
they'll suit him.

426
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,045
Look,
he has scanned almost all my girls.

427
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,942
But none of them suits his taste,
he's nuts.

428
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,984
Look at his money, it's piled up.

429
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,711
- Have you gone inside?
- Not yet.

430
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,482
Wait here for a while.
Go and send some more girls here.

431
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,784
I have so much money.

432
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,193
Come and get it if you can.

433
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,791
I want my first lover.

434
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,127
First lover!

435
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,207
You wanna try?

436
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,875
I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard
to tell the taste of a rich man.

437
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,274
Get lost.

438
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,847
Hurry up, be smart.

439
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,721
Master Lung, here come the beauties.
Say Hi to Master Lung.

440
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,252
Boss.

441
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,065
Get lost!

442
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,098
- Master Lung, don't get mad.
- Go away!

443
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,369
None of them is pretty!

444
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,406
They are not sincere,
I want my first lover!

445
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:45,482
First lover...

446
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,850
They're all here for money!

447
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,064
I am sincere.

448
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,963
I really love you.

449
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:12,467
Mary, I'll give you anything you want.

450
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,011
I can give you
all the money on the table...

451
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:22,378
as long as you don't leave me, Mary.

452
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,040
- What is it?
- Are you alright?

453
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,747
I've hit you hard, sorry.

454
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,385
If that table wasn't there
and I could kick you,

455
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,882
I wouldn't have been defeated by you.

456
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,889
I'm not here to fight with you,
I'm here to learn acting from you.

457
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,251
Go away.

458
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,260
To some honest friends
who have the same interest as I do.

459
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,800
I'll be more than willing to teach them.
Just a second.

460
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,612
I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3.

461
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,671
Must it take you so long for make up?
You damned...

462
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:52,810
Don't again!

463
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,741
- Your tie is high-classed.
- Thanks.

464
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,473
Since I've taken your money,
I should act accordingly.

465
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,646
- Where's the ping pong racket?
- Under the table.

466
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,543
There're many people here,
let's go over there.

467
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,354
I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you?

468
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,390
Lau Piu Piu.

469
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,888
What do you want to learn?

470
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,757
How to pamper
those bastards in the night club.

471
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:16,400
The first love feeling of college girls
must be built from the base.

472
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,094
You can take me as your client,
and greet me first.

473
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,464
Boss, want some fist games?

474
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,835
Don't call me "Boss",
you're college girl now.

475
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,532
You can say Good Morning,

476
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,270
or Morning, Sir.

477
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,904
Good morning, Sir.

478
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,476
Try to lower your head a little bit,
pretend to be shy.

479
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,276
Let your client touches your chin
and raise your head and then say.

480
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,048
Morning, Sir.

481
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,848
Your regards are bad, again.

482
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,219
Give me glistened regards.

483
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,923
Morning, Sir.

484
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:46,890
Too glistened now, I'll faint, again.
Take it easy.

485
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,394
Morning, Sir.

486
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,004
These are eyes of dead body,
you'll scare others to death.

487
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:59,074
Again. Be natural.

488
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,376
Morning, Sir.

489
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:10,985
Good!

490
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,923
Now let's discuss about your action,
say, hugging.

491
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,194
Hug me with your way.

492
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,402
What for?

493
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,164
What for?

494
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,840
You needn't lock others
with your thigh every time.

495
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,667
- Sorry, my job requires this.
- You must stop doing that.

496
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:37,976
Being a college girl,
you needn't always take initiation.

497
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,983
You can act shyly
so that men will hug you.

498
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,721
What do you mean by shy?

499
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,989
Like this.

500
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,660
- Like biting a quail?
- Act on.

501
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,757
Right, when men see you biting a quail,

502
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,832
they'll naturally hold and hug you.

503
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:02,633
Now you can put your head
on their shoulders.

504
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,082
What for?

505
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,744
Excuse me, myjob requires this.

506
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,582
You must stop doing that!

507
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,514
Superficially it's all.

508
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:24,025
If we go further, I must then ask you
about your first love.

509
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,458
I never have first love.

510
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,425
Everyone has first love.

511
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,828
I said I never have one.

512
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,737
You must have some unforgettable memory.

513
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,039
No.

514
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,350
Or you must have heard someone
say something you can never forget.

515
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,777
Neveﬂ

516
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,786
I hope I can be with you forever.

517
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,219
Promise me, let me take care of you
for the rest of your life.

518
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,371
Then you must have
unforgettable experience.

519
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,239
Neveﬂ

520
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,846
Being club girl? Didn't say
you'll take care of me?

521
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,855
How come I have money
if you don't work as club girl?

522
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,084
How can I take care of you
if! have no money?

523
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,822
Now, imagine
I'm your first boyfriend lover.

524
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,378
Sau, on the night of your play,
I was engaged in a transaction.

525
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,110
So I was too busy to come, sorry.

526
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,321
- Was there good response?
- Sure.

527
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,491
It's good then.
I will surely come next time.

528
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:07,162
Someone're shooing kids karaoke,
you aren't one of them?

529
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,627
Take me new boy
to collect protection money for me.

530
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,737
Help me improve his appearance...
About the way he speaks?

531
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:20,435
Right, that's it,
you won't refuse my request, right?

532
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,271
Thanks for teaching me.

533
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,708
Over there.

534
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,919
Being a triad member...

535
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,112
you must have a unique appearance.

536
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,983
It's right
you have a gold chain with you.

537
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,526
You must try to look furious and severe.
Try it.

538
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,159
More furious. Show some anger.

539
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,133
Wrath.

540
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,004
Throw that nibble away.

541
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,372
This is it,
you know what you're going to say?

542
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,241
I seem to know.

543
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,713
Good, I'll remind you from time to time
in this dim place.

544
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,685
Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up.

545
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,691
- Shooting a movie?
- What is it?

546
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,888
I forget already.

547
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,838
You know, HK is in economic recession.

548
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,568
And being hit by financial storm,
it's all because of the 'Ross'.

549
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,711
There are many factors.

550
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,039
Now the SE.
Asia collapses in economics...

551
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,682
and that infects HK too.

552
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,443
Those enterprises suffer much.

553
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:40,249
The worse is there'll be
global economics recession soon.

554
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,789
You have a view in economics.

555
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,052
I majored Economics in HKU.

556
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,593
Did you? I graduated this year.

557
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,460
Did you? I graduated in 1996,
this is my name card.

558
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,992
- You're my senior, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

559
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,728
- How come you shoot kids karaoke?
- I can't help.

560
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,843
What are you doing now?

561
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,241
Nothing, I fool with triad members.

562
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,644
Seeing you shooting movie here,
I come to collect protection money.

563
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,917
Brother Kei,
someone collects protection money.

564
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,918
Who collects protection money?

565
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,061
- Economics in HK is now...
- Is it you?

566
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,829
Good.

567
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,741
Bastard,
what triad groups are you come from?

568
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,298
Dare you to fool me?

569
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,072
Fix him!

570
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,841
Kill you!

571
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,478
Go to hell! Bastard...

572
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,826
Don't come near...

573
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,895
It hurts...

574
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,397
Don't talk with me,
pretend we're at a duel.

575
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,437
Make a call... pretend calling for help.

576
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,334
I want to go home.

577
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,446
You must act on until I shout cut.

578
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,743
- You must be profession.
- I want to go home.

579
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,747
It's a day.

580
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,444
They're gone.

581
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,254
Don't be afraid, they're gone, all gone.

582
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,556
Take a chopper and a rush there,
get some fame.

583
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:07,866
What's wrong?

584
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,472
That scoundrel is still there.

585
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,007
Concentrate! you're scoundrel too,
show some anger!

586
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,009
I want to eat ice-cream.

587
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,845
Bastard! Show some anger!

588
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,225
You needn't do that.

589
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,506
Forget it, I fear you now.

590
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,447
What's up? You acted very well.

591
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:02,986
What has happened?

592
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,128
He acted really well to get this.

593
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,196
He managed to collect $20.

594
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,765
Why are you still crying?

595
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,231
You managed to get $20 protection money
in front of a temple.

596
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,993
You're making a fame for yourself.

597
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,468
You do look like a hero.

598
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,875
Keep the image and use it
to collect protection money now.

599
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,139
Brother Sau, you're competent, great!

600
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,073
You're flattering me.

601
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,909
Let's get a feast, with this $20.

602
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,950
What are you laughing at?
Keep this image, got it?

603
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,213
- Stop laughing! Cry!
- Stop laughing! Cry!

604
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,754
Be good, cry, cry now!

605
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,154
What are you laughing at! Cry now!

606
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,888
That under-graduate hold two choppers.

607
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,859
And rushes over
while crying and shouting.

608
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,795
He's crying loudly.

609
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,064
He is capable
to play the spirit of a triad member.

610
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,829
Thanks for his persistence,

611
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,203
He managed to get $20
as a protection money.

612
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,366
What are you talking about?

613
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,339
Persistence, Aunt Ha.

614
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,446
I believe that I'm a good actor,
do me a favour please.

615
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,445
I have new experience
about holding choppers.

616
00:41:58,616 --> 00:41:59,981
I'd play well in a kung fu movie.

617
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,644
What?
You've brought enough trouble to me.

618
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,550
How dare you asking me for help?
Go away!

619
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,757
Sorry, Brother Sunny, he's leaving now.

620
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,487
I've looking for you.
Make up and get ready.

621
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,788
Thanks!

622
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,194
Director, we've found the stunt man.

623
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,130
You said you can't find one just then?
You're wasting my time!

624
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,236
I've found one now.

625
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,267
You have no problem?

626
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,406
No problem, I'll try my best to be
the stunt man for Sister Cuckoo.

627
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:24,632
Director, no problem.

628
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,374
Light the fire.

629
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,272
Director.

630
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,740
Beside responding with the hot fire,

631
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,881
Can I show an expression
of cool loneliness?

632
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,115
As you like,

633
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,945
As long as you don't turn your face
to the camera, get it?

634
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,019
Got it.

635
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,452
Light the fire, just don't move.

636
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,986
Ready.

637
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,022
Who put the pigeons here?

638
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,252
Director, I put them here intentionally.

639
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,057
There're pigeons here in our last shot.

640
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,166
If the pigeons fly,
they'll stir up the fire.

641
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,199
- Take them away.
- Director...

642
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,569
The mood of this shot will be better
if the pigeons are there.

643
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,968
How much better?

644
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,438
It's hard to say,
it's something abstract.

645
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,010
Anyway, the mood will be better.

646
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,776
Put them up and let's see the effect.

647
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,882
That stunt man mustn't turn his head!

648
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,648
Director, how do you like it?

649
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,215
It's a bit better.

650
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:16,787
Let's try the effect
with the pigeon's head towards me.

651
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,930
Now put the pigeon's tail towards me.

652
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,562
Take it away. Ready.

653
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,529
It's better without the pigeons,
take it away.

654
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,299
Ready.

655
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,442
Where's my lighter?

656
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,706
Man, bring me a lighter?

657
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:37,814
Director, here it is.

658
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,108
- Really?
- Yes.

659
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,681
- It works?
- Yes.

660
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,685
Hurry, quick, ready!

661
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,314
Ready, keep your posture, don't move.

662
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,459
Roll, action!

663
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,121
What is it?

664
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,298
What's wrong with you?
You screwed up every time!

665
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,999
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
it's very hot here.

666
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,230
I've told you already,
and you said no problem.

667
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,374
Shall we try again?

668
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,336
Again? Get a smarter guy.

669
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:07,908
It's your fault, Sunny?

670
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,611
Sorry, Director. Get lost!

671
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,843
I've tried my best to help you,
don't ever come again.

672
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:17,921
Just then...

673
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,749
Do you smell BBQ chicken wing?

674
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,519
I've sacrificed my arm
just for this movie.

675
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,558
Unit Manager, give him an over-cooked
chicken wing rice lunch box.

676
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,559
OK.

677
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,025
You, don't ever let me see him again...

678
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,289
Or I'll fire you instantly as well!

679
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,432
Aunt Ha...

680
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,126
Don't ask me anymore. Brother Sunny!

681
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,734
Chicken wings rice.

682
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,697
Let me see which is over-cooked,
the chicken wing or your arm.

683
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,974
Not over-cooked, go away now.

684
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,677
- Brother Sunny said I have a lunch box.
- Go away!

685
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,810
Extras are human being as well.

686
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,417
What? Repeat it loudly!

687
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,553
Aren't extras human?

688
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,881
Why must you always jump in me?

689
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,889
- You want to know the reason?
- I want to know the reason.

690
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,186
Because you're not entitled
to eat this lunch box!

691
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,156
You thought you're talented
and teach others acting.

692
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,993
You always talk about theory.

693
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,932
You teach someone to be a triad member
and collect protection money.

694
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,336
You're indeed insulting
the word 'acting'!

695
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,673
Don't shout on, let's get to work.

696
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:18,242
You talk about 'acting' in front of me?
Shit!

697
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,779
Damn it!

698
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,050
They dare to collect protection money
from those 2 ice-cream cars?

699
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,087
I'm the protector
of those 2 ice-cream cars.

700
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,020
They don't respect me at all.

701
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,956
Men, get some weapons
and teach them a lesson.

702
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,595
Sau, come with us.

703
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,889
You can experience
how we fight for our right,

704
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,795
and keep guard for us as well.
Men, let's go.

705
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,627
Little Hung, where are you going?

706
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,168
Granny, where are you doing here?

707
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,600
You're getting better
with you tuberculosis.

708
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,934
So mind you catch a cold,
have you taken your medicine?

709
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,704
Yes, you're going to
fight with someone again?

710
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,675
No.

711
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:49,937
Don't go.

712
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,138
I'm not fighting with anyone.

713
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,342
- Don't go fighting.
- I'm not.

714
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:58,612
Granny, he isn't going to fight,
he's going to act in a play.

715
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,791
That Neighbour Theatre,
we're playing "Thunder Storm".

716
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,424
"Thunder Storm"? It's a good play.

717
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,653
Bruce Lee, Bark Yin,
Ng Chor Fan did it years ago.

718
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,025
There was great response,

719
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,529
so we're putting up one more show.

720
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,199
We're hurrying for the rehearsal.

721
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,295
You're acting in a play?

722
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,731
Yes.

723
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:19,707
Good, my grandson is an actor,
how smart he is!

724
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,376
I'm very happy!

725
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,810
OK, come on, go home now.

726
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,374
She's put much saliva on my face.

727
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,118
Your granny brought you up alone,
she's a real heroine.

728
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,483
You're not.

729
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,424
See how happy she is.

730
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,364
Stop fighting anymore,
come and join our rehearsal.

731
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,669
If you can defeat me,

732
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,210
I'll swallow this plate.

733
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,143
You aren't convinced?

734
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,610
You should speak with stressing tone
"You aren't convinced?"

735
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,016
This is raise my wrath from the inside.

736
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,156
No need, as no one is watching.

737
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,451
You suddenly want to play
"Fist of Fury".

738
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,185
And make us to wear this costume,
this way is too much.

739
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,990
I'm doing you a favour, right?

740
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,463
- I only want to change the wig.
- Let's leave.

741
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,550
That girl is pretty, your girlfriend?

742
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,614
Sure.

743
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,717
- Let's get serious, try again!
- Coming.

744
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,146
If you can defeat me.

745
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,416
I'll swallow this plate.

746
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,094
You aren't convinced?

747
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,837
Change the position, hurry.

748
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,848
We're concentrated
when acting on the stage.

749
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,182
It's dangerous if you suddenly rush up.

750
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,083
I want to join you as you guys
were fevering up there.

751
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,022
I chose "Fist Of Fury"
for some commercial reasons.

752
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,495
Because there're fighting scenes,
audience will like it.

753
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,259
The story is consisted
of blood and tears.

754
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,524
Speaking of blood and tears,

755
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,431
I wonder if my spine is injured.

756
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,531
Last time I was in a bad mood
and I slapped at your face.

757
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,239
So I came here to apologize.

758
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,934
I'm grateful
as you watched our play tonight.

759
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,744
- Thanks.
- You mean it?

760
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,977
Thanks...

761
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,118
Thanks.

762
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,784
Thanks for your encouragement,
I'll remember it.

763
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,052
You'll make it!

764
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,822
Last time you taught me
pretending to be shy...

765
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,795
and men really lift up my chin
and I said...

766
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,394
Morning, Sir.

767
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,766
They're all enchanted by me
and I'm making lots of money.

768
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:35,667
Really?

769
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,707
Surely,
I've made a fame in the night-club now.

770
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,603
Congratulations.

771
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,903
You will become an excellent club girl.

772
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:41,773
Thanks.

773
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,913
You will become
an excellent damned extra too.

774
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,172
Thanks.

775
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:57,625
Looks, it's so dark out there,
I can't see anything.

776
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,429
No, it'll become scenic when dawn comes.

777
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:08,771
I got to go.

778
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,466
Those 3 guys are dead beat.

779
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,003
What's wrong with you?

780
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,010
What's wrong with me?

781
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,410
Your lips are chapped,
you need lip balm?

782
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:21,584
Thanks.

783
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,888
I only have this, is it better?

784
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,155
Yes, it's better.

785
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,132
- You want some more?
- No, thanks.

786
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,201
Forget it then.

787
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,705
Go to hell, asshole!

788
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,672
What's wrong with you?

789
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,807
I hate people with chapped lips.

790
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,575
But I don't want to have chapped lips.

791
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,245
Why don't you
put some more lip balm then?

792
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,516
OK, I'll put on some more!

793
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,481
Go to hell, don't force yourself to!

794
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,625
I do want to put some more on.

795
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:03,721
I'm
w
a
r
n
ing
Y
o
u
.

796
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,828
don't nag when I put it on your lips.

797
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,329
I've said I want to put on some more.
Wait.

798
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,728
You asshole!

799
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,769
Put it on for me
like professional beautician, OK?

800
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,131
OK.

801
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,053
- Master Hung.
- What is it?

802
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,816
How much is a night-club hostess
charge for overnight?

803
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,291
Around $1000 to $1200
with a fair appearance.

804
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,725
- What if she's pretty?
- How pretty is she then?

805
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,762
I mean she's a real beauty.

806
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,400
About $1 million to $10 million.

807
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,256
Thanks, Boss.

808
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,120
What is it?

809
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,223
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

810
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,253
- Where are you going?
- Going home.

811
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,753
- And then?
- Going to work.

812
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,559
Is it possible if you don't go to work?

813
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,495
Are you supporting my living
if I don't go to work?

814
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,282
What now?

815
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,526
I'll support your living!

816
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,303
Take care of your living first, nuts.

817
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,853
Whether you despite me or not.

818
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,387
I'm an actor.

819
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,687
You're talking to me?

820
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,061
You're calling yourself an actor,
fuck you!

821
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,934
You owe me 3 lunch boxes,
I want to take them back now.

822
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,337
Take them!

823
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,374
Dare you take them!

824
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,039
Thanks.

825
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,378
- Wan Tin Sau!
- Stand there!

826
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,079
Don't run!

827
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,586
Aunt Ha, this is my lunch box.

828
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,225
As you like, someone's looking for you.

829
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,291
Come on.

830
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,569
Mandy, you may go now.

831
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,673
Go inside. Put down the lunch box.

832
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,316
Close the door!

833
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,862
Sister Cuckoo, director.

834
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,832
Take this seat.

835
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,568
I want you to do an audition now.

836
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:00,901
We're lovers.

837
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,341
Here is the dialogue before I die.

838
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,344
Take a look.

839
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,810
And my role is...

840
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,918
You play the role of Wan Tin Sau,
and I'll play the role of Cuckoo.

841
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,925
OK.

842
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,528
- Call "Action" now.
- Action.

843
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,523
Tin Sau...

844
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,332
Cuckoo...

845
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,237
Tin Sau... I...

846
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,638
You will be alright, Cuckoo...

847
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,250
I don't think I can make it...

848
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:51,655
Cuckoo, I've encountered too much
failure in my life.

849
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,490
I'm very tired.

850
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,827
If I lose you too.

851
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,996
I can't hold on anymore.

852
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,339
You... take care.

853
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,777
Don't go, Cuckoo...

854
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:16,277
Cuckoo, answer me...

855
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,516
Cuckoo...

856
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,327
Cut.

857
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,927
- Sister Cuckoo, clean it first.
- Get lost.

858
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,126
What's wrong? A running nose?

859
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,736
You were really absorbed in the role.

860
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,099
Not only absorbed in it,
very stunning too.

861
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,412
Let me tell you,
I won't wait for Big Brother.

862
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,343
You can compromise on the schedule
with Big Brother.

863
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,279
Who will compromise?

864
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,381
I've had it, I want a new partner.

865
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,346
You rather use this guy
than Big Brother?

866
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,148
Don't fucking, sorry.
Don't bullshit me, OK?

867
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,381
Cause I'm not doing business like this.

868
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,752
"Oh", don't you bullshit me.

869
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,392
We need some new blood.

870
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,754
New bloods are all around,

871
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,260
but we're making a big budgeted movie.

872
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,897
So you can't just introduce
a common guy like him to me.

873
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:02,998
He's not a common guy.

874
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,895
Mr. Shaw,
I've noticed him for quite some time.

875
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,161
He's a real professional actor.

876
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,702
What professional?
We're talking about business here.

877
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,133
Don't mix your personal feeling into it,
Sister Cuckoo.

878
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,469
Let me tell you something man.

879
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,642
I'm not going to work with these people
and that bitch.

880
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,368
I'm not gonna work with this man,

881
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,742
I don't want to see him,
I don't want to talk about it!

882
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:22,976
Mr. Shaw.

883
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,990
I want you to be the leading actor
in my next movie.

884
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,386
What do you think?

885
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,254
Good.

886
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,690
Here're the character,
background relationship.

887
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,888
Scenario, script...

888
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,159
And the novel,
you may take them home for reference.

889
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,562
I think they'll help you a lot.

890
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,532
Here're the schedules
and the character's images.

891
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,569
We'll get your measurement
as soon as possible.

892
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:44,968
Any problem?

893
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,504
I'll surely have a lunch box everyday?

894
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,996
Mama, I don't want
to do any business tonight.

895
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,897
What? You fool me again.

896
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,094
I'm not fooling you.

897
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,172
No? You're fooling me right now.

898
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,841
Master Lung comes to see you,
he's willing to pay a lump sum.

899
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,103
You must treat him nicely tonight.

900
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,711
Stop fooling now.

901
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,545
I don't want to work anymore?

902
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,343
You don't want to work?
You think you're a virgin.

903
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,919
Why don't you just quit.

904
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,819
I've fallen in love with someone.

905
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,919
I don't know how to thank you
for giving me this chance.

906
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,026
Just try your very best.

907
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:15,286
I'll input all my strength
and time into this movie.

908
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,531
I hope your girlfriend won't complain
if you can't accompany her.

909
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,961
I don't have girlfriend.

910
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,368
You'd rather choose love than money?

911
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,273
You're nuts! I don't care.

912
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,242
You must treat him tonight,
whatever you do.

913
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,982
We'll talk about it after that.

914
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,449
Miss, get up and get your handbag.

915
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,280
Master Lung, sorry,
I feel sick suddenly.

916
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,752
I'm afraid
I can't accompany you tonight, sorry.

917
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,556
Forget it, don't pretend like a virgin.

918
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,961
I have lots of money.

919
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,861
Take it, how's that?

920
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,033
I'm really feeling sick, I can't.

921
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,236
I don't want to hear "I can't".

922
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,076
Is that clear? Say again.

923
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:05,974
I really can't.

924
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,011
Is it hurt?

925
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,220
Didn't you say you're a dancing master?

926
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,356
Yes, I can dance very well.

927
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,922
Then what make you step on my feet?

928
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,253
Is it because your pace
is a bit too fast?

929
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,393
Can you slow down your beat,
just for me?

930
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,691
OK, just for you.

931
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:30,335
Bitch! Last time I spent over
thousands of dollar on you.

932
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,269
And now I came here and...

933
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,136
you turn me down?

934
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:36,211
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody here.

935
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,777
I'll give you another chance.

936
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,540
Say it again in front of everybody,
can you?

937
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,610
I can't.

938
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,416
Master Lung, stop beating her.
She's a little girl.

939
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,898
Master Lung, stop beating her.

940
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,637
Can you?

941
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:15,877
I can't!

942
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,727
Let's go.

943
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,094
Call someone for help!

944
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,130
- Morning!
- Morning!

945
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,181
- Morning!
- Morning!

946
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,850
- Are you Cuckoo Tu?
- Hello.

947
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,180
It's you? I'm Lau Piu Piu.

948
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,119
I'm your fans,
can I've your autograph, please?

949
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,656
You're very beautiful,

950
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:57,884
I love watching your movies.

951
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,192
It's Cuckoo, ask for her autograph,
she's leaving now.

952
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,391
In today's movie, You play the role
of a waiter at a Chinese restaurant?

953
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,900
Or a bell boy a hotel?

954
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,804
What's happened at your face?

955
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,069
Don't bother.

956
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,438
Cuckoo,
who are you dating with recently?

957
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:17,779
You guys are neighbours?

958
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,107
You know him?

959
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,075
Sister Cuckoo helps me,
she wants me to be leading actor.

960
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,243
- Go to hell.
- It's true!

961
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,048
Sau, let's go.

962
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,816
Mr. Shaw doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

963
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,820
- Reall
y?
- Yes!

964
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,460
I've said
you can make it someday, remember?

965
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,587
I've said
he'll make it, he will make it.

966
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,095
Cuckoo, ask him if you don't believe me.

967
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,200
Sau, Mr. Shaw is flying
to the States this afternoon.

968
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,165
Let's h u rry.

969
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,100
I think he wants to talk with you
before he departs.

970
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,864
Do you remember,
I've said you'll make a fame.

971
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,008
Didn't I say this
to you that night on the beach?

972
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,836
I really said that to him
on the beach that night.

973
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,068
The producer has reserved
the shooting range for you.

974
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,678
You must practise shooting.

975
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,574
He'll also teach you somersault,
and spring board.

976
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,114
And also fly with wire,
you have underwear on?

977
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,483
You must wear underwear
when flying with me.

978
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,382
I have.

979
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,054
- OK.
- Let's go.

980
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,961
Is your friend looking for you?

981
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,661
No.

982
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,531
I've something to give you back.

983
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,331
You took it.

984
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,803
Yes, I took it for fun.

985
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,836
For fun? Is it funny?

986
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,407
No, so I'm giving it back to you.

987
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,452
- Anything else?
- No.

988
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,485
Good bye.

989
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,401
That's all.

990
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,749
You said you'll support my living,
are you serious?

991
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,457
Yes!

992
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,127
You mustn't cheat me.

993
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,836
I've said yes,
I'm only waiting for you to say "yes".

994
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:30,906
Why don't you go aside and chat,
just don't be late.

995
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,047
OK.

996
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,509
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Never mind, come there.

997
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,441
Let me introduce.

998
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,945
This is Peter, our Producer,

999
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,947
And Johnny, our Associate Producer.

1000
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,183
Mr. Wan, morning.

1001
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,354
- Morning!
- Morning.

1002
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,117
- Sit down.
- Please sit down.

1003
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,518
I've analysed the character.

1004
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:20,361
I've found there are 3 levels,
4 stages...

1005
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,622
And 5 different ways to act it.

1006
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,665
I've written it all down,
maybe we can discuss it.

1007
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:26,893
Very good.

1008
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:32,402
In order to let foreign audience
to accept me as a new actor...

1009
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,635
I'll have to
get an English name, Number.

1010
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,172
Number? Number One?

1011
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,872
Yes, Number One.

1012
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,041
Good, excellent.

1013
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,517
About the image, I also have...

1014
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:49,019
Tin Sau, the leading actor
was played by Big Brother.

1015
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,616
As he is too busy,

1016
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,556
we've decided to use a new actor.

1017
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:53,888
Just then he called us up,

1018
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,394
saying he has time for this movies.

1019
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,398
So he'll be the leading actor.

1020
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,101
Then...

1021
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:08,434
If so,
I can play the role of the scoundrel.

1022
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,378
For me, this is also a challenge.

1023
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,580
Sorry, we've chosen the actor
who plays the role of scoundrel.

1024
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:20,914
Then... I think... there is...

1025
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:24,183
Mr. Wan, just as Cuckoo has said...

1026
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,587
we all know you're a professional actor.

1027
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,491
Don't worry.

1028
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,394
We'll get you another role.

1029
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,693
Thanks.

1030
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,961
What role is it?

1031
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,175
You play the role of the lawyer.

1032
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,746
Read the script,
and remember your lines.

1033
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,645
Get prepared.

1034
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,781
How many lines are there?

1035
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,286
You've three.

1036
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,292
What are they?

1037
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,802
- The first is: "What".
- What?

1038
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,905
- The second is: "Yes".
- Yes...

1039
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,999
The third is: "Go away".

1040
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:24,212
I understand. I'll study them well.

1041
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:28,516
Mr. Wan, mind giving us back the script?

1042
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,512
Tin Sau.

1043
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,193
- Don't be like this.
- Sorry.

1044
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,926
Mr. Wan, please take off the costume.

1045
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,499
We have clothes for you to change.

1046
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,860
This way please.

1047
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,427
Tin Sau.

1048
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,439
Sorry.

1049
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,510
Sister Cuckoo,
about the schedule of Big Brother...

1050
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,773
Go out first.

1051
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,243
It's usual in movie business.

1052
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,678
Get out!

1053
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,695
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1054
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:54,367
My life is cheaper than ants.

1055
01:11:55,844 --> 01:12:01,009
You ride a Mercedes,
while I pick my nose.

1056
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:06,252
It's worse than dying.

1057
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:11,825
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1058
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,655
Kid, still want to play a character?

1059
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,724
- How may lines?
- Definitely more than 3.

1060
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,927
- What kind of role is it?
- A good guy.

1061
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,459
What movies is it?

1062
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,930
- Yes.
- Come here.

1063
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,305
What is the situation?

1064
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:03,738
I'm working on it.

1065
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,208
Frankly.

1066
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,244
I'm not a real Unit Manager.

1067
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,385
I'm Police Officer, he's my supervisor.

1068
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,713
We're from Criminal Intelligency Bureau.

1069
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:13,979
Or short-formed as C.I.B.

1070
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,115
To make it simple, I'm an undercover.

1071
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:17,387
You're an undercover?

1072
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,255
You don't believe that? I'm much better
than those so-called actors.

1073
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,590
I'm more skillful.

1074
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,766
Because I'm acting every day
when I work here.

1075
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,764
Though I have no script,
I never make any NG.

1076
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,064
Because any NG
will cause the death of me.

1077
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,504
So I should be the Best Actor in Oscar.

1078
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,271
Mighty!

1079
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,910
Today I should be going on
a mission with my informant.

1080
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:43,042
But he suffers from epilepsy suddenly,
be can't go with me.

1081
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,444
I want you to substitute him,

1082
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,248
We'll pay you $800
for being our informant.

1083
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:51,219
Money is not important,
I only want to practise my acting.

1084
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,520
You surely can.

1085
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,832
Big Brother, policemen are outside,
you'd better run away.

1086
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,371
Buddy, just left, I'll stay behind.

1087
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,608
You betray me?

1088
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,411
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1089
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:21,444
What make me pull the trigger?

1090
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,558
I'll go to the robber's place
in an hour.

1091
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,661
And I want to install bugs
to collect their criminal evidence.

1092
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,956
But every time I got there,
they'll search me thoroughly.

1093
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:32,895
So, I want you to deliver a lunch box
to me, with the bugs inside.

1094
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:33,865
Then you go away.

1095
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,636
- You mean I am...
- The delivery boy.

1096
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:36,700
I have no...

1097
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,399
Your role is important,
grasp the chance.

1098
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,800
What about the character,
the relation and background?

1099
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,912
The character,
the relation and background...

1100
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,876
are all on the menu of the coffee shops.

1101
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,244
Study them now.

1102
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,717
But you must act accordingly
when you are on the scene.

1103
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:52,821
Why choose me?

1104
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,956
We need a professional actor.

1105
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,352
I think that person is you.

1106
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,355
You're the leading actor this time.

1107
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,605
What is there in a Mixed Grill?

1108
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,299
Pork chop, beef steak, chicken wing,
sausage, egg.

1109
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,544
And Set Lunch A?

1110
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,909
Sunny-side-up-egg, minced beef rice,
chicken corn soup.

1111
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,170
Coffee or tea.

1112
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,042
And Set Lunch B?

1113
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,909
Vegetable and pork rice, Chef's soup,
tea or coffee.

1114
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,981
- The charge for a cold drink is...
- $2.

1115
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,311
What is served all day round?

1116
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,578
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger.

1117
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:26,721
How much?

1118
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,188
- $20.
- Study it better, man.

1119
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,420
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger...

1120
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,790
What is there for in a Mixed Grill?

1121
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,897
You're a delivery boy now.

1122
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,363
Remember to play the role well.

1123
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,160
I'll go into their place soon.

1124
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,031
I'll order the steamed rice with tomato
and egg at once.

1125
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,738
You must deliver it to me
in exactly 10 minutes.

1126
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,998
Let's start.

1127
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,073
- It's formal?
- Yes.

1128
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,245
- No more rehearsal?
- No.

1129
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,440
- Could you say "Action" first
- Action.

1130
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:16,997
- Ben.
- Mao!

1131
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,672
Why didn't you ask me
to go to Macau with you?

1132
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,704
I did page you for that.

1133
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,068
When did you page me?

1134
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:21,971
I think you didn't turn the pager on.

1135
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,545
How come? I turn it on 24 hours.

1136
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,282
No wonder you're so poor.

1137
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,744
Hey, check my dick...

1138
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,946
This bastard takes advantages of
others all the time.

1139
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,121
Feel free to check it.

1140
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,691
Just call me Mao, Brother Chu.

1141
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,155
Leather jacket again? Is it a gathering
for leather jacket wears?

1142
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,490
We've the same design too.

1143
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,393
I'm here to deliver food...

1144
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,161
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5, please.

1145
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,533
- Kee.
- Yes.

1146
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,264
His jacket is worn out naturally.

1147
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,465
Look at the texture.

1148
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,838
His jacket must be worn
for at least 20 years.

1149
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,872
- Your grandpa left it to you?
- I bought it recently.

1150
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,245
Bastard.

1151
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,957
I want one too.

1152
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,328
Order some food now.

1153
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:24,972
Time for meal.

1154
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,268
- Come over, help me.
- Time to eat.

1155
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,741
Mao, come here.

1156
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,517
Let's chat while eating.

1157
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,084
OK, good dishes!

1158
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,781
Good dishes? We can eat something
much better after the project.

1159
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,182
Project?

1160
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,589
Wait... no tomato and egg?

1161
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:48,354
I want tomato and egg,
I want rice with tomato and egg.

1162
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,861
No need, want tomato and egg?
Here it comes.

1163
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,124
How come?

1164
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,961
It's really tomato and egg, bingo.

1165
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,233
Scrambled egg?

1166
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,502
No, I want sunny-side-up.

1167
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,678
Let me order sunny-side-up with tomato.

1168
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,913
Sunny-side-up? Chu,
make one for him now.

1169
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:10,245
Why making trouble?
Delivery service is convenient.

1170
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,214
You're asking for trouble indeed.

1171
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:14,446
Is it Kuen Fat?

1172
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,286
How come the delivery is so fast?

1173
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:22,761
Yeah, I haven't ordered yet.

1174
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:28,664
Why is it taking so long?

1175
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,702
I still have something else to deliver,
men.

1176
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,168
Have you ordered anything?

1177
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,138
I ordered it, mutton stew.

1178
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:36,744
How come it is here so quick?

1179
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:37,809
Is it well done?

1180
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,606
Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please!

1181
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,448
- I'll pay.
- No need.

1182
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,811
Why not? Let me pay.

1183
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,350
- I've said I'll pay.
- It's alright.

1184
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,680
I will pay.

1185
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:49,154
You pay next time, it's my bill.

1186
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,826
No... don't do that.

1187
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,623
Let me treat you this time!

1188
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,956
Just $40
and you two push around and around.

1189
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,498
Why don't you pay by credit card,
asshole!

1190
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:00,963
What did you say, bastard?

1191
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,129
Don't move, either you pay now
or I'll take it back.

1192
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,364
Or I'll pay for you.

1193
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,839
What are you doing?

1194
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,876
I've said many times,
why don't you walk closer?

1195
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,548
Walk closer and shoot him from the top.

1196
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,718
Then blood won't splash on the wall.

1197
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,852
You never listen to me.
Can't you be a professional?

1198
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,290
But delivery boys
are very rude these days.

1199
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,762
They are always like this.

1200
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:34,459
Let's eat.

1201
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:36,766
Who is it?

1202
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:40,272
I'm here to deliver some food.

1203
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,910
Go and take a look, Chu...

1204
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,923
How are you,
I'm here to delivery some food.

1205
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,351
OK.

1206
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,792
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5 please.

1207
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:01,758
You ordered that?

1208
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,398
No, I haven't.

1209
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,668
You haven't ordered?

1210
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,065
Have you come to the wrong place?

1211
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,669
- NO.7.
- NO.7?

1212
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,080
It's NO.1, send it to NO.1.

1213
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:21,415
Do you still want it?

1214
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,519
Are you out of your mind,
I didn't order it.

1215
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:25,779
Rice with tomato and egg?

1216
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:34,922
What do you mean? Are you nuts, Go away.

1217
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:39,128
You want rice with tomato and egg,
I'll take it.

1218
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,859
No, someone else ordered it.

1219
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,165
I said I want it, come here.

1220
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,373
Come here!

1221
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,271
Can you give it to us first?

1222
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,015
What a coincidence! NO.1 also
ordered rice with tomato and egg.

1223
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:01,286
Is tomato and egg good?

1224
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,118
The egg and tomato are both nutritious.

1225
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,088
What do you mean nutritious?

1226
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,092
It contains a lot of Vitamin C.

1227
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,389
Other fruits contain that too.

1228
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,191
Other fruits don't contain
as much as tomato.

1229
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,627
You don't want the money?

1230
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,361
$25.5 please.

1231
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:15,433
How come it's so expensive?

1232
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:17,195
- It's one and a half order.
- How much for one order?

1233
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,463
$36.8.

1234
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:19,733
How come it is more expensive?

1235
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,173
It's 12.2 for one order.

1236
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,105
And how much for one and a half order?

1237
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,208
$36.8.

1238
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,403
You just said $25.5.

1239
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,140
It's $25.5.

1240
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,515
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1241
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:28,277
What?

1242
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,883
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1243
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:30,985
Ham and egg.

1244
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,277
How much is it?

1245
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,284
$12.2.

1246
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:34,422
How much if I want one and a half order?

1247
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:35,520
$25.5.

1248
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,986
How come there is
one and a half order for breakfast?

1249
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,153
You can order two extra sausages.

1250
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:41,159
How much if I want 3 extra sausages?

1251
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,158
Don't do that.

1252
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,626
How much is it?

1253
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,464
I'm only a delivery boy.

1254
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:46,896
I ask you how much it is.

1255
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,701
I don't know.

1256
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,896
How much?

1257
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,904
I'm really a delivery boy!

1258
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:55,271
You are not!

1259
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:59,772
Kid, tell us frankly,
are you a delivery boy?

1260
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,250
- I've just started work today!
- Just started work today?

1261
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,352
I didn't know being delivery boy
must answer so many questions.

1262
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,577
Don't fucking fool me?

1263
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,355
What are you doing? Are you a cop?

1264
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:09,614
Yes, what's wrong?

1265
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,089
I'm really a delivery boy.

1266
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:16,658
Nothing... he's an idiot.

1267
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,366
Search him if you don't believe.
Search him!

1268
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:26,163
Kid, I let you go now,
be smart in future!

1269
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,142
What is it?

1270
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,517
Why did you do this?

1271
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:47,388
What do you want?

1272
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,330
What is it?

1273
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,739
Want to harm me?

1274
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,808
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1275
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,892
Cut.

1276
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:00,431
How's that?

1277
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,533
I'm fine, I'm still alive.

1278
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,070
I mean my performance.

1279
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,901
Very well, as this is your first time
being the leading actor.

1280
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,606
Good take.

1281
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,305
Thanks.

1282
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,044
I'll call to police.

1283
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:21,180
- Police!
- Freeze!

1284
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,416
He's on my side...

1285
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,284
Call the ambulance!

1286
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:34,593
Piu Piu.

1287
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,501
What's going on? It's dark already,
and you didn't give me a call?

1288
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,267
- Shall I cook dinner for you?
- Just then I...

1289
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,400
What's happen to you?
Didn't you play as the leading actor?

1290
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,771
I don't care whether
you're a leading actor or an extra.

1291
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,278
You must support my living forever.

1292
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,573
Come on, try it
and see if it suits or not.

1293
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,053
Red? Is it lipstick?
You're dating someone else?

1294
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,749
I forgive you but...

1295
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:56,515
I won't cook for you
if you dare next time, go!

1296
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,529
What are you looking at?
Fight back, nuts!

1297
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,559
Piu Piu, I love you.

1298
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,412
Wait

1299
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,182
You two mustn't get married!

1300
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,358
Why?

1301
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:33,859
Because you guys are brother and sister.

1302
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:38,228
Sister, I'm sorry.

1303
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:41,297
It's not your business,
I'm willing myself.

1304
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,165
Your mood is wrong for this situation.

1305
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,306
I've told you before.

1306
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:48,874
Mood begins from your heart,
then goes to the outside of your body...

1307
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:49,805
and returns to the heart, got it?

1308
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,504
- Yes, got it.
- Don't be nervous.

1309
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,042
I'm not nervous.

1310
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:58,179
Sau, I think
the role of Master suits you more.

1311
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,786
Why don't you play it?

1312
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:03,117
Forget it, I'm not talented in acting.

1313
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,121
I'd better be audience.

1314
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:06,851
Not at all.

1315
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:07,792
You're good.

1316
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,897
Brother Sau,
audience are waiting outside.

1317
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:10,998
- Are they?
- Hurry up.

1318
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:12,862
- Take off your clothes first.
- For what?

1319
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:13,796
I'll play it.

1320
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,435
- Oh, no.
- Give it to me.

1321
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,832
But you're not talented.

1322
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:17,996
I'm not? Are you talented then?

1323
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:19,164
lam.

1324
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:20,967
Give it to me!

1325
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,303
- No.
- Sau, stop fighting.

1326
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,243
Stop fighting, eat potato chips,
why fighting for?

1327
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,166
There're really many audience.

1328
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,996
Sure, as we have special guests today.

1329
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,865
Sister Cuckoo comes to help us today.

1330
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,498
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

1331
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,404
You're welcome, we finally have
the chance to act on the same stage.

1332
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,577
Thanks!

1333
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,571
Kung Hei Fat Choi! Thanks!

1334
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,715
Happy New Year.

1335
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,147
Congraduation! Everybody cheers up.

1336
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,913
Thanks! Kung Hei!
