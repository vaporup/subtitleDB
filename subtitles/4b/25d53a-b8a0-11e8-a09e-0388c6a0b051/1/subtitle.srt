1
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,274
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,238
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,440
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,183
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,332
Oh, come on, Billy, you've got
to be messing with me.

6
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,774
No, doctor.

7
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,860
<i>Feels So Good,</i> Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,655
Honestly, Billy, you said
this one would be hard.

9
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,740
- Ha! It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

10
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,410
While <i>Feels So Good</i>
may have charted in 1978...

11
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,955
the album was released
in December of 1977.

12
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,707
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

13
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,833
Check again.

14
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,084
Where do you store

15
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,269
all this useless information?

16
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,294
Useless?

17
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,302
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

18
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,132
Status, Billy?

19
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,299
1977.

20
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,676
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

21
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:42,969
Oh!

22
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,971
Feels so good, doesn't it?

23
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,143
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

24
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,103
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

25
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,188
What is it?

26
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,440
GSW.

27
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,054
It's amazing you kept him alive.

28
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,672
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

29
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,112
and the apnea reflex test.

30
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,823
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

31
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,575
You left a bullet in his head.

32
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,428
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

33
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,871
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

34
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,755
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

35
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,790
We have to run.

36
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,334
Doctor West.

37
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:16,836
What are you doing? Hey.

38
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,337
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

39
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,196
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

40
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,192
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

41
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,318
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

42
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,502
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

43
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,304
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

44
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,847
What do you see?

45
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,891
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

46
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,941
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

47
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,647
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

48
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,500
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

49
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,525
We gotta go.

50
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:41,170
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

51
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,612
Still want to harvest his organs?

52
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,031
- I'll assist you.
- No.

53
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,158
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

54
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,967
Thank you.

55
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,226
Image guidance, stat.

56
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,894
We don't have time for that.

57
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,687
You can't do it freehand.

58
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,022
I can and I will.

59
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,952
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

60
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,192
How about 10 minutes ago

61
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,861
when you called
the wrong time of death?

62
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,413
<i>Cranial nerves intact.</i>

63
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,732
Doctor West, cover your watch.

64
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,129
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

65
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,714
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

66
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,449
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

67
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,909
Nic is a great doctor.

68
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,160
You came to me.

69
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,679
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

70
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,787
You had a second opinion.

71
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,311
What you needed was a competent one.

72
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,457
Well, all the more reason

73
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,642
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

74
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,126
You could make such a difference.

75
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,794
I can't work in your butcher shop.

76
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:04,962
Hey!

77
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,190
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

78
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,442
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

79
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,819
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

80
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,262
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

81
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:14,388
Yeah, you're right.

82
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:15,932
In ER, we're only saving lives.

83
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,808
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

84
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,560
CNN interviews.

85
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,520
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

86
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,647
Whoa, wait a minute.

87
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,010
You're not... You guys aren't...

88
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,316
What?

89
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,152
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

90
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,779
Explicit, actually.

91
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,114
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

92
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,199
Oh, really?

93
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,426
I call it the "Strange Policy."

94
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,994
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

95
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,413
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

96
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:42,392
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

97
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,918
We invented that technique.

98
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,504
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

99
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,842
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

100
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,261
Come with me.

101
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,137
Another speaking engagement?

102
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,222
So romantic.

103
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,283
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

104
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,558
We had fun together.

105
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,310
No! You had fun.

106
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,187
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

107
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,356
Not only about me.

108
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,442
Stephen. Everything is about you.

109
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,945
Maybe we could hyphenate.

110
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,114
Strange-Palmer Technique.

111
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,074
Palmer-Strange.

112
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,415
Billy.

113
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,750
What have you got for me?

114
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,477
<i>I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...</i>

115
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,379
<i>crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.</i>

116
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,839
<i>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</i>

117
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,382
Yeah, well, I could help...

118
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,792
but so could 50 other people.

119
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,302
Find me something worth my time.

120
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,764
<i>I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.</i>

121
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

122
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,143
Definitely not.

123
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,547
<i>How about a 22-year-old female...</i>

124
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,874
<i>with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...</i>

125
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,107
<i>struck by lightning?</i>

126
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,734
Mmm. That does sound interesting.

127
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,029
Can you send me the...

128
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,947
Got it.

129
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,760
Hey.

130
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,556
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

131
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,572
What did they do?

132
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,033
They rushed you in a chopper.

133
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,202
But it took a little while to find you.

134
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,457
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

135
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,209
What did they do?

136
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,090
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

137
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,135
Multiple torn ligaments...

138
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,305
severe nerve damage in both hands.

139
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,808
You were on the table for 11 hours.

140
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,810
Look at these fixators.

141
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,397
No one could have done better.

142
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,739
I could have done better.

143
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,352
No.

144
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,104
Give your body time to heal.

145
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,525
You've ruined me.

146
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,086
How long until I can take...

147
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,111
Doctor Strange.

148
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,905
Those tissues are still healing.

149
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,031
So, speed it up.

150
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,867
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

151
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:28,953
It's possible.

152
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,998
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

153
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,000
All I need is possible.

154
00:14:58,566 --> 00:14:59,567
<i>Up.</i>

155
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,027
Up.

156
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,530
Show me your strength.

157
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,328
This is useless.

158
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,582
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

159
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,085
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

160
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,838
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

161
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,506
this severe to do this...

162
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,841
and actually recover?

163
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,467
One guy, yeah.

164
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,012
Factory accident, broke his back...

165
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,514
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

166
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,849
He had pain in his shoulder,

167
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,933
from the wheelchair.

168
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,561
He came in three times a week.

169
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,926
Then one day he stopped coming.

170
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,939
I thought he was dead.

171
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,108
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

172
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,693
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

173
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,654
Bullshit. Show me his file.

174
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,449
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

175
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,951
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

176
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,703
Worth it.

177
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,637
<i>I looked
at all your research...</i>

178
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,930
<i>I read all the papers you've sent.</i>

179
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,807
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

180
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,392
<i>I don't think you realize...</i>

181
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,062
<i>- how severe the damages are.</i>
- Here's the thing...

182
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,385
<i>The best have tried and failed.</i>

183
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,149
I understand. Here's the thing.

184
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,360
<i>What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.</i>

185
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,736
Come on.

186
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,571
<i>I've got my own reputation to consider.</i>

187
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,448
- Etienne, wait. No.
<i>- I can't help you.</i>

188
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,783
No, no, wait!

189
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:37,998
Hey!

190
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,964
He won't do it.

191
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,927
He's a hack.

192
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,596
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

193
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,181
They culture donor stem cells...

194
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,474
and then harvesting them

195
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,017
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

196
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,328
If I could get a loan together...

197
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,353
Stephen.

198
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,063
A small loan, just $200,000.

199
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,291
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

200
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,359
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

201
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,153
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

202
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,615
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

203
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,451
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

204
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,453
But this isn't medicine anymore.

205
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,288
This is mania.

206
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,041
Some things just can't be fixed.

207
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,669
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

208
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,919
This isn't the end.

209
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,840
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

210
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,717
Like what? Like you?

211
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,471
This is the part where you apologize.

212
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,432
This is the part where you leave.

213
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,977
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

214
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,590
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

215
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,647
Yes, it is.

216
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,983
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

217
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,235
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

218
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,713
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

219
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,048
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

220
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,323
We are not friends, Christine.

221
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,742
We were barely lovers.

222
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,660
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

223
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,120
Is that what I am to you now?

224
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,873
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

225
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,082
"He finally needs me."

226
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,886
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

227
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,336
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

228
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,921
heart's just humming.

229
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,341
You care so much, don't you?

230
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,847
Goodbye, Stephen.

231
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,397
All the way. Here we go.

232
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,650
Let's go! All day! All day!

233
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,736
Yeah! All day.

234
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,425
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

235
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,575
Talk a lot.

236
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,786
Jonathan Pangborn...

237
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,956
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

238
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,666
Who are you?

239
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,976
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,544
Partial paralysis in both hands.

241
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,754
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

242
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,924
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

243
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,636
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

244
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,514
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

245
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,099
I never got past your assistant.

246
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,269
You were untreatable.

247
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,771
No glory for you in that, right?

248
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,025
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

249
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,699
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

250
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,704
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

251
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,296
All right.

252
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,592
I'd given up on my body.

253
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,054
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

254
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,013
I should at least try to elevate that.

255
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,640
So, I sat with gurus...

256
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,434
and sacred women.

257
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:28,478
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

258
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,646
And finally...

259
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,482
I found my teacher.

260
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,152
And my mind was elevated...

261
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,486
and my spirit deepened.

262
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,447
And somehow...

263
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,615
Your body healed.

264
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:40,824
Yes.

265
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,453
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

266
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,431
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

267
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,249
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

268
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,716
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

269
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,134
But the cost there is high.

270
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,136
How much?

271
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,888
I'm not talking about money.

272
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,350
Good luck.

273
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,646
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

274
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,876
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

275
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,629
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

276
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,071
Kamar-Taj?

277
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,907
Kamar-Taj.

278
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,478
Okay.

279
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,108
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

280
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:39,860
Your watch.

281
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:43,155
No, please. It's all I have left.

282
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,364
Your watch.

283
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,952
All right.

284
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,328
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

285
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,193
Really?

286
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,278
Sure we got the right place?

287
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,533
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

288
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,079
I once stood in your place.

289
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,667
And I, too, was disrespectful.

290
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,045
So, might I offer you some advice?

291
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,423
Forget everything you think you know.

292
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,427
All right.

293
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,022
The sanctuary of our teacher.

294
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,232
The Ancient One.

295
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,192
The Ancient One?

296
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,402
What's his real name?

297
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,113
Right.

298
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,740
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

299
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,295
Um, thank you for... Whoa!

300
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,632
Okay, that's a thing.

301
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,926
Thank you for...

302
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,136
Hello.

303
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,471
Oh, thank you.

304
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,432
And thank you.

305
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,559
Uh, thank you...

306
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,437
Ancient One, for seeing me.

307
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,606
You're very welcome.

308
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,318
The Ancient One.

309
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,321
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

310
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,072
Mr. Strange.

311
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,325
Uh... Doctor, actually.

312
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,952
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

313
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,204
Isn't that why you're here?

314
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,789
You've undergone many procedures.

315
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,209
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,961
It's good tea.

317
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,296
Yes.

318
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,303
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

319
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,512
A paralyzed man?

320
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:55,680
In a way.

321
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,766
You helped him to walk again.

322
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:58,975
Yes.

323
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,687
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

324
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,648
Well, I didn't correct it.

325
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,107
He couldn't walk.

326
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,609
I convinced him that he could.

327
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,694
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

328
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,738
When you reattach a severed nerve...

329
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,282
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

330
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,367
It's the cells.

331
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,035
The cells are only programmed...

332
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,238
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

333
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,287
Right.

334
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,832
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

335
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,169
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

336
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,340
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

337
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,676
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

338
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,678
Is that why you're working here?

339
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,055
Without a governing medical board?

340
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,099
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

341
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,184
Quite.

342
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,979
So, you've figured out a way...

343
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,356
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

344
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,900
No, Mr. Strange.

345
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,404
I know how to reorient the spirit...

346
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,197
to better heal the body.

347
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,702
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

348
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,831
No. All right.

349
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:03,999
How do we do that?

350
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,667
Where do we start?

351
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,174
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

352
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,428
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

353
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,804
in gift shops.

354
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:20,932
And what about this one?

355
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,560
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

356
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,688
What about that one?

357
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,566
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

358
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,235
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

359
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,030
who could see in part, but not the whole.

360
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,591
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

361
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,827
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

362
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,413
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

363
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:44,956
You've spent your whole life

364
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,434
trying to widen that keyhole...

365
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,084
to see more, to know more.

366
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,254
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

367
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,256
in ways you can't imagine...

368
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,924
you reject the possibility.

369
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,570
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

370
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,262
about chakras or energy...

371
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,014
or the power of belief.

372
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,183
There is no such thing as spirit!

373
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,811
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

374
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,148
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

375
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,566
within an indifferent universe.

376
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,276
You think too little of yourself.

377
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,487
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

378
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,654
Well, you don't.

379
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,616
But I see through you!

380
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,718
What did you just do to me?

381
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,970
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

382
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,680
What's in that tea?

383
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,474
Psilocybin? LSD?

384
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,267
It's just tea...

385
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,394
with a little honey.

386
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,187
What just happened?

387
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,689
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

388
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:52,774
The what?

389
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,902
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

390
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,904
Why are you doing this to me?

391
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,490
To show you
just how much you don't know.

392
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,617
Open your eye.

393
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,958
Oh, shit!

394
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,502
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

395
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,045
No, no, no!

396
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,213
What's happening?

397
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,465
This isn't real!

398
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,020
<i>His heart rate is getting
dangerously high.</i>

399
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,360
He looks all right to me.

400
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,699
<i>You think you know
how the world works?</i>

401
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,077
<i>You think that this material universe
is all there is?</i>

402
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,876
<i>What is real?</i>

403
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,589
<i>What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?</i>

404
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,093
<i>At the root of existence...</i>

405
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,346
<i>mind and matter meet.</i>

406
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,391
<i>Thoughts shape reality.</i>

407
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,775
Oh!

408
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,991
<i>This universe is only one
of an infinite number.</i>

409
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,746
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

410
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,957
<i>Some benevolent and life giving.</i>

411
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,589
<i>Others filled with malice and hunger.</i>

412
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,468
<i>Dark places...</i>

413
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:48,431
<i>where powers older than time
lie ravenous...</i>

414
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,351
<i>and waiting.</i>

415
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:05,198
<i>Who are you in this
vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?</i>

416
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,388
Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

417
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,604
Teach me.

418
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,358
No.

419
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,198
No.

420
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,283
No!

421
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,493
No, no, no!

422
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:53,746
No!

423
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,124
Open the door! Please!

424
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,671
Thank you, Masters.

425
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,136
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

426
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,597
5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

427
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,391
There's a strength to him.

428
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,185
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

429
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,937
I've seen it all before.

430
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,149
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

431
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:24,068
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

432
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,404
only to lose him to the darkness.

433
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:29,866
You didn't lose me.

434
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,535
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

435
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,247
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

436
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,292
And to live within the natural law.

437
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,587
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

438
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,714
We only learn to live above them.

439
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,178
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

440
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,639
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

441
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,140
upon us all.

442
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,976
There may be dark days ahead.

443
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,855
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

444
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,784
Don't shut me out.

445
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,665
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

446
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,586
Thank you.

447
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:29,967
Bathe.

448
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,303
Rest.

449
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,639
Meditate...

450
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,641
if you can.

451
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,851
The Ancient One will send for you.

452
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,944
What's this? My mantra?

453
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,281
The Wi-Fi password.

454
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,493
We're not savages.

455
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,985
<i>The language
of the mystic arts...</i>

456
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,654
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

457
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,198
The sorcerers of antiquity...

458
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,160
called the use of this language "spells."

459
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,406
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

460
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,914
you can call it a "program."

461
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,084
The source code that shapes reality.

462
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,044
We harness energy...

463
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,675
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

464
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,762
to cast spells...

465
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,974
to conjure shields...

466
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,018
and weapons...

467
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,187
to make magic.

468
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:22,079
But even if my fingers could do that...

469
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,833
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

470
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,085
How do I get from here to there?

471
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,714
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

472
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,383
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

473
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,969
Study and practice, years of it.

474
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:46,562
Hey.

475
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,609
Mr. Strange.

476
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,653
Uh, Stephen, please.

477
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,905
- And you are?
- Wong.

478
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,240
Wong.

479
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,158
Just Wong?

480
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,993
Like Adele?

481
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:04,580
Or Aristotle.

482
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:07,333
Drake.

483
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,793
Bono.

484
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:12,255
Eminem.

485
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,511
<i>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</i>

486
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,930
<i>Astronomia Nova.</i>

487
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>Codex Imperium.</i>

488
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,642
<i>Key of Solomon.</i>

489
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,229
You finished all of these?

490
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:29,564
Yup.

491
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,315
Come with me.

492
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,525
All right.

493
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,486
This section
is for masters only...

494
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,030
but at my discretion, others may use it.

495
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,617
You should start with <i>Maxim's Primer.</i>

496
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,038
How's your Sanskrit?

497
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:50,126
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

498
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,004
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

499
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:58,009
What are those?

500
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,762
The Ancient One's
private collection.

501
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,139
So, they're forbidden?

502
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,808
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

503
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,768
Only certain practices.

504
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,605
Those books are far too advanced

505
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,773
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

506
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,829
This one's got pages missing.

507
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,290
That's <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

508
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,125
A study of time.

509
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:34,086
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

510
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,882
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

511
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,928
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

512
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,513
and relieved him of his head.

513
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,060
I am now the guardian of these books.

514
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,855
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

515
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,357
I'd know it...

516
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,735
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

517
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,532
What if it's just overdue?

518
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,906
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

519
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,541
People used to think that I was funny.

520
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,918
Did they work for you?

521
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,212
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

522
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,130
Thank you for the books...

523
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,424
and for the horrifying story...

524
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,343
and for the threat upon my life.

525
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,418
We will now receive the power

526
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,420
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

527
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,091
The one who betrays the world.

528
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:05,279
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

529
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,948
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

530
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:10,493
All you need to do is focus.

531
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,536
Visualize.

532
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:15,956
See the destination in your mind.

533
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,126
Look beyond the world in front of you.

534
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,129
Imagine every detail.

535
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:27,384
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

536
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,845
the gateway will come.

537
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,600
And stop.

538
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,311
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

539
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,105
Of course.

540
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,527
My hands.

541
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,778
It's not about your hands.

542
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,988
How is this not about my hands?

543
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,657
Master Hamir.

544
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,464
Thank you, Master Hamir.

545
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,593
You cannot beat a river into submission.

546
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,637
You have to surrender to its current...

547
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,056
and use its power as your own.

548
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,392
I control it by surrendering control?

549
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,893
That doesn't make any sense.

550
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,437
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

551
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,691
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

552
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,317
but it will take you no further.

553
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,820
Surrender, Stephen.

554
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,030
Silence your ego...

555
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,199
and your power will rise.

556
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,243
Come with me.

557
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,457
Wait.

558
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,501
- Is this...
- Everest.

559
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,129
Beautiful.

560
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,756
Yeah, right, beautiful.

561
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,342
Freezing but beautiful.

562
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:51,594
At this temperature...

563
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,013
a person can last for 30 minutes...

564
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,682
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

565
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:57,933
Great.

566
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,477
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

567
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,898
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

568
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,107
No!

569
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,951
How's our new recruit?

570
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,245
We shall see.

571
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,748
Any second now.

572
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,126
Oh, no, not again.

573
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,466
Maybe I should...

574
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:45,708
Stephen.

575
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:46,959
Wong.

576
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,082
What do you want, Strange?

577
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,503
Books on astral projection.

578
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:51,588
You're not ready for that.

579
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,008
Try me, Beyoncé.

580
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,470
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

581
00:43:58,554 --> 00:43:59,930
She's a huge star, right?

582
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:03,892
Do you ever laugh?

583
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,770
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

584
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:08,897
No.

585
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,010
<i>Once, in this room,</i>

586
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,429
<i>you begged me to let you learn.</i>

587
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:43,432
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

588
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,100
preferring to teach yourself.

589
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:47,162
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

590
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:49,104
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

591
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,606
that make no sense.

592
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,734
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

593
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:55,361
Wong told on me?

594
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,030
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

595
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,783
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

596
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,261
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

597
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:24,098
ever present but undetected.

598
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,308
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

599
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:31,438
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

600
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:34,566
and sometimes to contain threats.

601
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,891
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

602
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,696
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

603
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:53,460
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

604
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,755
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

605
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:58,382
you'd run from here in terror.

606
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,849
So just how ancient is she?

607
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,562
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

608
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:15,524
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

609
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:17,526
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

610
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:18,652
I know she's steadfast...

611
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,279
but unpredictable.

612
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:21,738
Merciless, yet kind.

613
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,367
She made me what I am.

614
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,370
Trust your teacher...

615
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,247
and don't lose your way.

616
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:31,540
Like Kaecilius?

617
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:32,958
That's right.

618
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:38,922
You knew him.

619
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,255
When he first came to us...

620
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:43,552
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

621
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:47,556
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

622
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,560
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

623
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,723
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

624
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,155
He left Kamar-Taj.

625
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:05,782
His disciples followed him like sheep.

626
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,826
Seduced by false doctrine.

627
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,329
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

628
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,413
Yes.

629
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,748
What did it do?

630
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,418
No more questions.

631
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,004
What's that?

632
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,339
That's a question.

633
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,926
This is a relic.

634
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,928
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

635
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,294
so we imbue objects with it...

636
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:30,557
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

637
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:33,602
This is the staff...

638
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,395
of the Living Tribunal.

639
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,317
There are many relics.

640
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,277
The Wand of Watoomb.

641
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,905
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

642
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:46,907
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

643
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,667
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

644
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:51,119
I think I'm ready.

645
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,956
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

646
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,874
For now...

647
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:57,876
conjure a weapon.

648
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:00,629
All right.

649
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,136
Fight!

650
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,764
Fight like your life depended on it.

651
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:18,355
Because one day...

652
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:19,856
it may.

653
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,219
Wong?

654
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:44,900
Okay.

655
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:49,112
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

656
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:10,509
All right.

657
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:35,158
Oh, my.

658
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:50,799
What if...

659
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,072
"Dormammu."

660
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:16,992
"The Dark Dimension."

661
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:19,411
Eternal life?

662
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,710
- What the...
- Stop!

663
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,175
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

664
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,802
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

665
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,220
What did the book say

666
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:38,865
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

667
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,533
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

668
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,560
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

669
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:45,979
Unstable dimensional openings.

670
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:48,356
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

671
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,484
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

672
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:51,860
over and over forever...

673
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,278
or never having existed at all?

674
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:56,948
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

675
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,992
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

676
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,411
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

677
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:02,496
you were breaking it.

678
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:05,874
We do not tamper with natural law.

679
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:06,958
We defend it.

680
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:08,502
How did you even do that?

681
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:09,878
Hmm?

682
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,048
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

683
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,358
I've got a photographic memory.

684
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,422
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

685
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,886
What you just did...

686
00:52:18,637 --> 00:52:20,305
takes more than a good memory.

687
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:22,307
You were born for the mystic arts.

688
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,559
And yet my hands still shake.

689
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,936
For now, yes.

690
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,229
Not forever?

691
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:28,522
We're not prophets.

692
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,610
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

693
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,489
While heroes like the Avengers

694
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,866
protect the world
from physical dangers...

695
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,411
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

696
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:46,957
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

697
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:48,208
of Sorcerers Supreme...

698
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,087
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

699
00:52:52,254 --> 00:52:53,380
the mighty Agamotto.

700
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:58,510
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

701
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:03,515
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

702
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,684
where great cities now stand.

703
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,936
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

704
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,564
That door to the New York Sanctum.

705
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:12,513
That one to the London Sanctum.

706
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,651
Together...

707
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:18,363
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

708
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,532
The Sanctums
protect the world...

709
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:21,950
and we sorcerers...

710
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,869
protect the Sanctums.

711
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:25,996
From what?

712
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:28,790
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

713
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,625
Like Dormammu.

714
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,503
Where did you learn that name?

715
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:37,382
I just read it in
<i>The Book of Cagliostro</i>. Why?

716
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:45,140
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

717
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:47,309
Beyond time.

718
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:50,145
He is the cosmic conqueror...

719
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,147
the destroyer of worlds.

720
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,984
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

721
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,486
on a quest to invade every universe...

722
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,281
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

723
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:05,160
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

724
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,496
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

725
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:11,082
A ritual to contact Dormammu

726
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,686
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

727
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,715
Uh... Okay...

728
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,301
Um... I'm out.

729
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:24,679
I came here to heal my hands.

730
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,725
Not to fight in some mystical war.

731
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:32,020
London.

732
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:37,859
Kaecilius!

733
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:39,152
No!

734
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,243
Wong? Mordo?

735
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:39,254
Hello?

736
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:09,617
Hello?

737
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:51,951
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

738
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,163
You know what that means?

739
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:57,332
That you'll die protecting it.

740
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:14,557
Stop!

741
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,238
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

742
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:29,656
Doctor.

743
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:32,117
Mister Doctor?

744
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:34,202
It's Strange.

745
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:38,206
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

746
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,679
Ha!

747
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,311
You don't know how to use that, do you?

748
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:07,480
Uh...

749
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,918
What?

750
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,299
Oh, stop it.

751
01:01:58,424 --> 01:01:59,425
I said stop it.

752
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:01,074
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

753
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,596
I don't even know what "this" is.

754
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:04,806
It's the end...

755
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,808
and the beginning.

756
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,727
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

757
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,956
If you're not gonna start making sense...

758
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,792
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

759
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:15,858
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

760
01:02:16,526 --> 01:02:19,320
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

761
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,155
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

762
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,323
A scientist.

763
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,492
You understand the laws of nature.

764
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:27,954
All things age. All things die.

765
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:29,580
In the end, our sun burns out.

766
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,916
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

767
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:33,793
But the Dark Dimension...

768
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:36,629
it's a place beyond time.

769
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,440
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

770
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:40,025
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

771
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,733
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

772
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:44,137
as part of the One.

773
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:46,681
The great and beautiful One.

774
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:49,183
We can all live forever.

775
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:50,685
Really?

776
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:55,940
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

777
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,025
The same as you.

778
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:01,028
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

779
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,531
People think in terms of good and evil...

780
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,541
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

781
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,326
Time kills everything.

782
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:09,162
What about the people you killed?

783
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:10,538
Tiny.

784
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:13,082
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

785
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,086
Yes. You see.

786
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,922
You see what we're doing.

787
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:22,300
The world is not what it ought to be.

788
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:24,886
Humanity longs for the eternal...

789
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,680
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

790
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:30,016
Time is an insult.

791
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,726
Death is an insult.

792
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:34,395
Doctor...

793
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,857
we don't seek to rule this world.

794
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,192
We seek to save it...

795
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:42,778
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

796
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,615
the why of all existence.

797
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:49,535
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

798
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:53,331
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

799
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:54,832
Was it enlightenment?

800
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:56,834
Power?

801
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:01,088
You came to be healed, as did we all.

802
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,426
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

803
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,512
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

804
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,431
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

805
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:14,268
The real magic she keeps for herself.

806
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,688
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

807
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:25,279
I saw the rituals
in <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

808
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,782
So, you know.

809
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:29,700
The ritual gives me the power

810
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:31,118
to overthrow The Ancient One...

811
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:32,954
and tear her Sanctums down.

812
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:35,706
To let the Dark Dimension in.

813
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,792
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

814
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:39,502
Dormammu gives freely.

815
01:04:40,336 --> 01:04:41,837
Life everlasting.

816
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,966
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

817
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,968
He's the savior of worlds.

818
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,262
No. I mean, come on.

819
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:51,180
Look at your face.

820
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,724
Dormammu made you a murderer.

821
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:56,018
Just how good can his kingdom be?

822
01:04:57,979 --> 01:04:59,522
You think that's funny?

823
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:01,649
No, not that.

824
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:04,235
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

825
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:13,679
Sir, can I help you?

826
01:06:13,763 --> 01:06:14,972
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

827
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,700
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

828
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:18,225
The nurse's station.

829
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,393
Christine!

830
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:22,563
Stephen?

831
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:23,731
Oh, my God.

832
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,400
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

833
01:06:26,484 --> 01:06:27,610
Now! I haven't any time.

834
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:29,320
What happened?

835
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:32,365
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

836
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,909
What are you wearing?

837
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,582
Chest cavity is clear.

838
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:45,378
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

839
01:06:48,339 --> 01:06:49,507
No, no, no.

840
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,591
Stephen?

841
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:53,386
Come on, come on.

842
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,330
Just a little higher.

843
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:23,942
Please be careful with the needle.

844
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:26,877
Stephen?

845
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,631
What am I seeing?

846
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,675
My astral body.

847
01:07:33,968 --> 01:07:34,969
Are you dead?

848
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:36,846
No, Christine. But I am dying.

849
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,933
Right.

850
01:07:42,393 --> 01:07:43,394
Yeah. All right.

851
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,146
Okay.

852
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:50,401
Oh, wow.

853
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,866
I've never seen a wound like this.

854
01:07:57,408 --> 01:07:58,826
What were you stabbed with?

855
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:00,578
I don't know.

856
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:22,099
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

857
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:23,559
What?

858
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,186
Keep me alive, will you?

859
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:27,772
Huh?

860
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:30,316
Okay.

861
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:32,818
Uh-huh.

862
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:55,841
Oh, shit.

863
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,672
Come on, come on.

864
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:40,845
Stephen, come on.

865
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:44,974
Hit me again.

866
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,642
Stop doing that!

867
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,602
Up the voltage and hit me again.

868
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:49,728
No, your heart's beating!

869
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,146
Just do it!

870
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,649
Oh, my God.

871
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,722
Oh, God! Oh, God!

872
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:25,973
Are you okay?

873
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,141
Yeah.

874
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,309
Okay.

875
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,817
After all this time...

876
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:38,777
you just show up here...

877
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:42,406
flying out of your body.

878
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:44,283
Yeah, I know.

879
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,993
I missed you, too, by the way.

880
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:47,953
Ha ha.

881
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:50,664
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

882
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:51,999
Why would I?

883
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:55,210
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

884
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:58,130
For all of it. You were right.

885
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:01,926
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

886
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:04,428
And you deserved so much more.

887
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,055
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

888
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,309
What the hell is happening?

889
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:11,769
Where have you been?

890
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:15,856
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

891
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,901
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

892
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:20,193
Kathmandu?

893
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:21,528
Yeah.

894
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:23,697
Like the Bob Seger song?

895
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,783
1975, <i>Beautiful Loser,</i> side A. Yeah.

896
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:29,662
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

897
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:33,499
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

898
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,626
Oh. So you joined a cult.

899
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,295
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

900
01:11:38,504 --> 01:11:41,215
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

901
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,633
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

902
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,051
It's not a cult.

903
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:45,779
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

904
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:46,804
Oh, no.

905
01:11:47,388 --> 01:11:49,848
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

906
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:51,725
I'm late for a cult meeting.

907
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,605
This is insane.

908
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:57,773
Yeah.

909
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,858
- Where are you going?
- Um...

910
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:01,819
Can you tell me the truth?

911
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,488
Well, a powerful sorcerer

912
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:06,331
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

913
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,993
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

914
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,929
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

915
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:13,515
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

916
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:14,683
that I opened up in the mop closet.

917
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:16,583
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

918
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,721
Really do have to go.

919
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:30,889
Yeah.

920
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:17,770
Strange!

921
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:21,523
You're okay.

922
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,859
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

923
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,403
The Cloak of Levitation.

924
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:28,906
It came to you.

925
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:31,116
No minor feat.

926
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,494
It's a fickle thing.

927
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,662
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

928
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:36,955
Yeah.

929
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,750
He can fold space and matter at will.

930
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,378
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

931
01:13:43,545 --> 01:13:44,630
in the real world?

932
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:45,839
Yeah.

933
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,800
- How many more?
- Two.

934
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:50,886
I stranded one in the desert.

935
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,054
And the other?

936
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:53,597
His body's in the hall.

937
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,474
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

938
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:57,351
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

939
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:58,852
The London Sanctum has fallen.

940
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:01,355
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

941
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,607
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

942
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,236
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

943
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:09,238
With its master gone, it needs another.

944
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:10,906
Master Strange.

945
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:14,785
No.

946
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,996
It is Doctor Strange.

947
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,791
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

948
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,042
Doctor Strange.

949
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,922
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

950
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,340
And I have just killed a man!

951
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:30,259
I'm not doing that again.

952
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:32,803
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

953
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:36,223
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

954
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:37,307
Your own.

955
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,561
Still seeing through me, are you?

956
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:44,398
I see what I've always seen:
Your over-inflated ego.

957
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:48,110
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

958
01:14:48,277 --> 01:14:49,611
even death...

959
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,405
which no one can control.

960
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:54,241
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

961
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:56,577
Not even Dormammu?

962
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,080
He offers immortality.

963
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:02,249
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

964
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,625
He feeds off it.

965
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:06,044
Like you feed off him?

966
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:07,963
You talk to me about controlling death?

967
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,131
Oh, I know how you do it.

968
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:12,009
I've seen the missing rituals
from <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

969
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,929
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

970
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,890
Because you might not like them?

971
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:21,018
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

972
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:22,769
What is he talking about?

973
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:26,231
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

974
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,651
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

975
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,278
to stay alive.

976
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,364
That's not true.

977
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,742
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

978
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,036
I know how you do it.

979
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:42,164
Once they regroup...

980
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:43,916
the Zealots will be back.

981
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,460
You'll need reinforcements.

982
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:55,427
She's not who you think she is.

983
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:57,471
You don't have the right to say that.

984
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:00,307
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

985
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,309
No, and I don't want to know.

986
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:03,769
You're a coward.

987
01:16:04,144 --> 01:16:05,187
Because I'm not a killer?

988
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:06,957
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

989
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:09,608
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

990
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,109
What do you think I just did?

991
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:12,527
You saved your own life!

992
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:16,448
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

993
01:16:16,657 --> 01:16:18,137
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

994
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:20,827
You've no idea the things I've done.

995
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,873
And the answer is yes.

996
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:26,667
Without hesitation.

997
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,038
Even if there's another way?

998
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,003
There is no other way.

999
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,463
You lack imagination.

1000
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:32,631
No, Stephen.

1001
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:36,343
You lack a spine.

1002
01:16:41,473 --> 01:16:42,683
They're back.

1003
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:50,774
We have to end this.

1004
01:16:50,983 --> 01:16:52,067
Now!

1005
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:58,407
Strange!

1006
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,242
Get down here and fight!

1007
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:01,660
No!

1008
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:07,374
The Mirror Dimension.

1009
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,377
You can't affect the real world in here.

1010
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,170
Who's laughing now?

1011
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,505
Asshole.

1012
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,425
I am.

1013
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,731
I've got his sling ring.

1014
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:32,774
They can't escape, right?

1015
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,277
Run!

1016
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,087
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1017
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:56,091
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1018
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:58,573
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1019
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:01,428
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1020
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:20,238
That is hilarious.

1021
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,203
This was a mistake.

1022
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:23,093
Whoa.

1023
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,642
Oh!

1024
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,796
It's true.

1025
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:46,092
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1026
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:50,639
Kaecilius.

1027
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:56,269
I came to you broken...

1028
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:59,272
lost, in need.

1029
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:02,275
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1030
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:04,236
I tried to protect you.

1031
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:06,738
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

1032
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,115
I have a new teacher now.

1033
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:10,617
Dormammu deceives you.

1034
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:13,912
You have no idea what he truly is.

1035
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,958
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1036
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:19,334
Liar.

1037
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,182
Christine!

1038
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:18,602
Are you kidding me?

1039
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:20,770
Oh, my God.

1040
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:25,525
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1041
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:26,735
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

1042
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:33,033
Someone get the swabs.

1043
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:36,536
Nic?

1044
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:41,633
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1045
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,379
She's still dropping.

1046
01:22:46,463 --> 01:22:47,505
We're losing her!

1047
01:22:47,589 --> 01:22:48,840
We need to increase her oxygen!

1048
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:50,049
I need a crash cart!

1049
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:51,092
Her pupils have dilated!

1050
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:52,886
No reflexes.

1051
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:54,449
We're not reading any brain activity.

1052
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,525
What are you doing?

1053
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:10,236
Come on, you're dying!

1054
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:21,414
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1055
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,208
Time is relative.

1056
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,585
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1057
01:23:27,504 --> 01:23:29,297
I've spent so many years...

1058
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:31,091
peering through time...

1059
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,760
looking at this exact moment.

1060
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:35,470
But I can't see past it.

1061
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:39,683
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1062
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:42,352
And after each one,
there's always another.

1063
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:44,813
And they all lead here...

1064
01:23:44,896 --> 01:23:45,897
but never further.

1065
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:48,108
You think this is where you die.

1066
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:51,403
You wonder what I see in your future?

1067
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:52,612
No.

1068
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:55,990
Yes.

1069
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:57,617
I never saw your future.

1070
01:23:57,909 --> 01:24:00,245
Only its possibilities.

1071
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:03,039
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1072
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:05,125
You always excelled...

1073
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,711
but not because you craved success...

1074
01:24:07,794 --> 01:24:10,255
but because of your fear of failure.

1075
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:12,090
That's what made me a great doctor.

1076
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:14,884
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1077
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,054
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1078
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:19,514
from learning the simplest

1079
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:21,641
and most significant lesson of all.

1080
01:24:21,725 --> 01:24:22,726
Which is?

1081
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:27,188
It's not about you.

1082
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:32,277
When you first came to me...

1083
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,530
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1084
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:37,824
I didn't.

1085
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:43,997
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1086
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:45,915
He uses magic to walk?

1087
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:47,167
Constantly.

1088
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:49,586
He had a choice...

1089
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:52,338
to return to his own life...

1090
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:55,216
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1091
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,969
So I could have my hands back again?

1092
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,471
My old life?

1093
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:01,389
You could.

1094
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:05,268
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1095
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:10,148
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1096
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:11,399
But as you well know...

1097
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:13,860
sometimes one must break the rules...

1098
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,737
in order to serve the greater good.

1099
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:17,906
Mordo won't see it that way.

1100
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:20,617
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1101
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,911
forged by the fires of his youth.

1102
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,913
He needs your flexibility...

1103
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:27,040
just as you need his strength.

1104
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:31,836
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1105
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,546
I'm not ready.

1106
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:37,050
No one ever is.

1107
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:40,887
We don't get to choose our time.

1108
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:47,227
Death is what gives life meaning.

1109
01:25:48,353 --> 01:25:50,939
To know your days are numbered.

1110
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:53,066
Your time is short.

1111
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,320
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1112
01:25:58,279 --> 01:25:59,989
But look at me.

1113
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:03,076
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1114
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:05,662
just so that I can watch the snow.

1115
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:45,827
Are you okay?

1116
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:55,753
I don't understand what's happening.

1117
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,005
I know.

1118
01:26:57,797 --> 01:27:00,675
But I have to go away now.

1119
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:08,474
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1120
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:10,226
That it could be a beginning.

1121
01:27:10,435 --> 01:27:11,477
Yeah.

1122
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:15,690
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1123
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,320
A harder way.

1124
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:24,824
A weirder way.

1125
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:26,826
<i>Doctor Palmer
to the ER, please.</i>

1126
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:28,536
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</i>

1127
01:27:32,832 --> 01:27:34,667
I don't want you to go.

1128
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:23,925
Stop!

1129
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,832
Choose your weapon wisely.

1130
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:01,337
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1131
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:04,632
No one.

1132
01:29:20,565 --> 01:29:21,774
Kaecilius.

1133
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:24,444
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1134
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:38,666
She's dead.

1135
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,959
You were right.

1136
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,212
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1137
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,132
She was complicated.

1138
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,138
Complicated?

1139
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:57,769
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1140
01:29:57,977 --> 01:29:59,145
Dangerous.

1141
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:01,189
What if it overtook her?

1142
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,443
She taught us it was forbidden...

1143
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,239
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1144
01:30:10,323 --> 01:30:12,158
She did what she thought was right.

1145
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,951
The bill comes due.

1146
01:30:14,869 --> 01:30:16,287
Don't you see?

1147
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:21,250
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1148
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:24,796
Kaecilius was her fault!

1149
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:26,714
And here we are...

1150
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,050
in the consequence of her deception.

1151
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:33,763
A world on fire.

1152
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:36,307
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1153
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,267
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1154
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:39,936
You know where they're going next.

1155
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:41,479
Hong Kong.

1156
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,888
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1157
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:44,980
because one day, it might.

1158
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:46,692
Well, today is that day.

1159
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:49,904
I cannot defeat them alone.

1160
01:31:07,296 --> 01:31:08,714
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1161
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:18,516
The Dark Dimension.

1162
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:21,769
Dormammu is coming.

1163
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:25,398
It's too late.

1164
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,191
Nothing can stop him.

1165
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:30,820
Not necessarily.

1166
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:36,242
No.

1167
01:32:17,617 --> 01:32:18,910
The spell's working.

1168
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,663
We've got a second chance.

1169
01:32:31,214 --> 01:32:32,423
Whoa!

1170
01:34:01,304 --> 01:34:03,264
No!

1171
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:14,900
Wong.

1172
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:24,952
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1173
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,622
Well, don't stop now.

1174
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,667
When the Sanctum's restored,

1175
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:32,918
they'll attack it again.

1176
01:34:33,002 --> 01:34:34,170
We've got to defend it.

1177
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,671
Come on!

1178
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:04,950
Get up, Strange.

1179
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,452
Get up and fight.

1180
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,329
We can finish this.

1181
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:11,624
You can't fight the inevitable.

1182
01:35:14,919 --> 01:35:16,796
Isn't it beautiful?

1183
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,716
A world beyond time.

1184
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:24,637
Beyond death.

1185
01:35:28,808 --> 01:35:31,310
- Beyond time...
- Strange.

1186
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,511
He's gone.

1187
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:10,182
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1188
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:45,384
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1189
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:47,887
You've come to die.

1190
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:52,308
Your world is now my world...

1191
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,060
like all worlds.

1192
01:37:24,924 --> 01:37:28,344
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1193
01:37:28,677 --> 01:37:31,347
You've come to die.

1194
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:34,433
Your world is now my...

1195
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:37,102
What is this?

1196
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,104
Illusion?

1197
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:40,606
No. This is real.

1198
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:42,191
Good.

1199
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:55,496
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1200
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:58,999
You've... What is happening?

1201
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:02,378
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1202
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:04,964
I brought a little power from mine.

1203
01:38:05,339 --> 01:38:07,466
This is time.

1204
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:11,095
Endless looped time.

1205
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:13,556
You dare!

1206
01:38:14,014 --> 01:38:15,015
Oh...

1207
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:19,645
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1208
01:38:20,437 --> 01:38:22,940
You cannot do this forever.

1209
01:38:23,107 --> 01:38:24,650
Actually, I can.

1210
01:38:24,984 --> 01:38:27,278
This is how things are now.

1211
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:30,489
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1212
01:38:30,573 --> 01:38:31,657
endlessly.

1213
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:35,494
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1214
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:39,790
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1215
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:41,542
But you will suffer.

1216
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,669
Pain's an old friend.

1217
01:38:46,046 --> 01:38:47,673
Dormammu...

1218
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:49,008
I've come to bargain.

1219
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:50,175
End this!

1220
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:53,053
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1221
01:39:09,278 --> 01:39:12,281
You will never win.

1222
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:14,700
No...

1223
01:39:15,409 --> 01:39:16,869
but I can lose...

1224
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:20,331
again and again...

1225
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,082
and again...

1226
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,877
and again, forever.

1227
01:39:26,378 --> 01:39:27,880
And that makes you my prisoner.

1228
01:39:28,047 --> 01:39:29,298
No!

1229
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:30,382
Stop!

1230
01:39:31,175 --> 01:39:33,594
Make this stop!

1231
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,888
Set me free!

1232
01:39:36,889 --> 01:39:37,890
No.

1233
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,351
I've come to bargain.

1234
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:44,396
What do you want?

1235
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:48,233
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1236
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:50,903
End your assault on my world.

1237
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:52,946
Never come back.

1238
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:54,531
Do it...

1239
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:57,284
and I'll break the loop.

1240
01:40:06,877 --> 01:40:07,920
Get up, Strange!

1241
01:40:08,212 --> 01:40:09,338
Get up and fight.

1242
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:11,548
We can finish this.

1243
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:13,092
Isn't it beautiful?

1244
01:40:15,594 --> 01:40:17,930
A world beyond time.

1245
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:22,101
Beyond death.

1246
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:35,280
What have you done?

1247
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,990
I made a bargain.

1248
01:40:39,952 --> 01:40:40,953
What is this?

1249
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:44,873
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1250
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:48,127
Eternal life as part of the One.

1251
01:40:50,754 --> 01:40:52,506
You're not gonna like it.

1252
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:13,795
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1253
01:41:13,819 --> 01:41:16,739
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1254
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:19,074
The warnings come after the spells.

1255
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:30,169
Oh, that's funny.

1256
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,031
We did it.

1257
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:03,035
Yes.

1258
01:42:03,827 --> 01:42:05,537
Yes, we did it.

1259
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:07,956
By also violating...

1260
01:42:08,207 --> 01:42:09,708
the natural law.

1261
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:13,212
Look around you. It's over.

1262
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:16,173
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1263
01:42:17,633 --> 01:42:19,301
No price to pay?

1264
01:42:19,885 --> 01:42:22,888
We broke our rules, just like her.

1265
01:42:23,889 --> 01:42:27,351
The bill comes due.

1266
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,144
Always!

1267
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:31,563
A reckoning.

1268
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:37,486
I will follow this path no longer.

1269
01:43:11,395 --> 01:43:12,855
Yeah, okay.

1270
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,532
Wise choice.

1271
01:43:24,283 --> 01:43:26,368
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1272
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:28,704
once you've mastered its powers.

1273
01:43:28,787 --> 01:43:29,955
Until then...

1274
01:43:31,081 --> 01:43:33,709
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1275
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:34,835
A what?

1276
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:38,297
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1277
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,215
but you still have much to learn.

1278
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:45,345
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1279
01:43:45,429 --> 01:43:47,973
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1280
01:43:48,473 --> 01:43:49,474
We must be ready.

1281
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:50,642
We'll be ready.

1282
01:46:37,142 --> 01:46:40,479
<i>So Earth has wizards now, huh?</i>

1283
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:43,482
Tea?

1284
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:45,484
I don't drink tea.

1285
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:46,568
What do you drink?

1286
01:46:47,944 --> 01:46:49,279
Not tea.

1287
01:46:52,783 --> 01:46:54,326
So, I keep a watch list...

1288
01:46:54,576 --> 01:46:56,328
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1289
01:46:56,453 --> 01:46:57,853
that may be a threat to this world.

1290
01:46:57,996 --> 01:47:01,583
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1291
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:05,670
Worthy inclusion.

1292
01:47:05,754 --> 01:47:06,922
Yeah.

1293
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:12,094
So why bring him here to New York?

1294
01:47:12,302 --> 01:47:13,762
It's a bit of a long story.

1295
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:15,847
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1296
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:17,682
But we're looking for my father.

1297
01:47:18,183 --> 01:47:21,394
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1298
01:47:21,478 --> 01:47:24,523
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1299
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:25,982
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1300
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:27,567
Great!

1301
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:30,487
Allow me to help you.

1302
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:32,849
Can I help you?

1303
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:37,228
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1304
01:53:38,521 --> 01:53:40,732
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1305
01:53:42,108 --> 01:53:43,109
Mordo.

1306
01:53:45,945 --> 01:53:47,780
So what can I do for you, man?

1307
01:53:47,864 --> 01:53:49,699
I've been away
for many months now,

1308
01:53:49,782 --> 01:53:51,534
and I've had a revelation.

1309
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:54,954
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1310
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:57,874
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1311
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:00,293
stealing power...

1312
01:54:01,127 --> 01:54:02,629
perverting nature.

1313
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:04,631
Like you.

1314
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,926
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1315
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,803
- Mine.
- Power...

1316
01:54:11,971 --> 01:54:13,598
has a purpose.

1317
01:54:27,654 --> 01:54:29,781
Why are you doing this?

1318
01:54:29,989 --> 01:54:33,159
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1319
01:54:38,456 --> 01:54:40,583
Too many sorcerers.
