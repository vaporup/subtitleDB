1
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:14,586
Why'd she come here?

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,227
Her dying mom gave her a note to find
her aunt here

3
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:22,662
But her aunt has gone to Canada

4
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:23,934
She has no one there

5
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:26,035
What could she do?

6
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:29,731
Fucked up so she decided to earn money here

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,849
Her writing is a total mess unlike her
pretty face

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,385
To Lee Kangjae?

9
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:52,493
It looks like she really took you for
her husband

10
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,404
Dear Mr. Kangjae

11
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:13,378
Thank you for marrying me

12
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,313
Thank you

13
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:21,584
Because you married me, I am able to work here

14
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:26,754
Everyone's kind to me

15
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:31,868
I want to keep working here

16
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:41,076
Everybody's kind but you're the kindest of all

17
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:45,204
Because you married me

18
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:49,751
I sincerely thank you

19
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,414
Where should we go first?

20
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,214
To the job agency

21
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:26,253
We need some information about her

22
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:31,193
Pull over, please

23
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,236
Why?

24
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:47,537
Even though it's all fake,
I can't go there like this

25
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:50,112
What?

26
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,673
Why, am I wrong?

27
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,514
Oh, my god!

28
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:02,682
Thanks to you two, now I can be rest assured

29
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,895
Let's have a drink

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,936
Because of that bitch, I'm in this trouble now

31
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,579
I should've helped her then

32
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:24,339
Have some more

33
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,606
No, thanks

34
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:30,186
Well, that bitch came to me a month
before she died

35
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:32,288
Do you know what she said?

36
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:34,117
She said that she was sick

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,383
She looked all right to me

38
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,858
As you know, I'm not doctor

39
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,362
And besides, she owes me lots of money

40
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:45,195
How could she be sick without my permission?

41
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,266
It's cold

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,032
lsn't he a fucking bastard?

43
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:56,168
If it was his own daughter,
could he still talk that way?

44
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,977
There are so many bastards in the world

45
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,316
Hey, he looks exactly like you,
you know that?

46
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,218
You're like brothers

47
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,325
Shit, stop it!

48
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:18,065
Born in 1978... Let's see

49
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:22,672
She's only 23, 24 years old

50
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:28,842
What a pity at such a young age!

51
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:42,483
Thank you for marrying me

52
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,428
You're the kindest of all

53
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,526
Good night

54
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,997
You're really making this hard for me

55
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:07,579
It's warm in here

56
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,378
The cell is so damn cold

57
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,092
Husband, Lee Kangjae,

58
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:23,891
Occupation, a real hoodlum

59
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:28,528
A kind idiot who goes to prison for his friend

60
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:34,141
Wife is a dead bitch who died so pitifully...

61
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:42,443
You are pathetic and I am, too!

62
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,550
What a perfect match we are...

63
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,222
Why are you hassling her?

64
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:31,164
I'm just checking if she's legally married or
not, that's all.

65
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:38,336
Your husband's name?

66
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,510
Lee Kangjae... Lee Kangjae

67
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:48,879
What's his occupation?

68
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,646
He's in lnchon

69
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:56,850
He's a sailor

70
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,921
So he's busy

71
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,394
Even if he's that busy,

72
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:04,557
what kind of a husband never visits his wife?

73
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:09,932
They're all bastards who make life hard
for their wives

74
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:12,873
She is a hard-working girl

75
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,603
Just leave her alone

76
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:21,274
Go on, now!

77
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:55,751
Husband LEE Kangjae

78
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,254
Wife KANG Failan

79
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:26,713
The mountain is beautiful

80
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:32,880
The sea is beautiful, too

81
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,558
I want to see

82
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:19,769
Dear Mr. Kangjae

83
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,274
Failan!

84
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:33,977
It's me, don't you remember me?

85
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,549
Hello

86
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,847
Now you can speak Korean well

87
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:43,187
Failan, aren't you sick any more?

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,191
You've got a bit thin

89
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:48,229
She's really making you work hard, huh?

90
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:53,366
She's kind, everyone's kind

91
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:57,507
I thank Mr. Kangjae

92
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:02,874
Why should you thank Kangjae? For marrying you?

93
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,674
Well, he thanks you, too

94
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:07,840
He wants to see you

95
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,516
He wants to see me?

96
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:17,056
Yeah, he fucking misses you a lot

97
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,553
Fu...?

98
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:26,435
Fucking means... It means...

99
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:29,071
Anyway, he fucking misses you

100
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,673
Oh, shit! That bastard...

101
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:34,367
Hey, I'll come back later

102
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:36,740
Let's do some art together at the beach!

103
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:47,320
One sheep, two sheep, three sheep...

104
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,494
Why do we get off here?

105
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,639
Let's get some air here

106
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:08,403
Shit! Fucking crazy... It's freezing cold, fuck!

107
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,131
Now what?

108
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:35,836
Hey, isn't it good? Wow!

109
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:40,837
Don't go in there! It's dangerous!

110
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,037
The ice will break

111
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:47,410
Come on, you chicken!

112
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,855
What did I tell you? Hey, man! Hey!

113
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,527
That's not how you skate

114
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,893
You don't know a thing

115
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:07,967
Watch me, now!

116
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,662
Ready! Go!

117
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:36,864
Oh, home, sweet home!

118
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:41,093
Hurry up! Will you?

119
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,672
There won't be any problem, right?

120
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,503
When your wife's dead,

121
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,477
why would they look you up let alone
consoling you?

122
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,276
Are you a criminal?

123
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,181
You always feel uncomfortable
with cops, right?

124
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:01,289
Hey... You go in alone

125
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:05,253
Am I Failan's husband? Why should l?

126
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,825
Do I have to cry?

127
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:13,035
That's a bit exaggerating but
you should look sad

128
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,534
Hurry up!

129
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:16,831
All right! Wait!

130
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,232
I'm freezing!

131
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:27,380
Let's go in!

132
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,092
Who's the husband?

133
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,657
I am

134
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,558
Do you have your lD?

135
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:52,506
I forgot to bring it in such a hurry

136
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:55,904
But I brought this instead

137
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,641
Her social security number is...

138
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,719
781 01 1 245431 1

139
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:12,627
You even memorize your wife's number?

140
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:21,728
Husband LEE Kangjae

141
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,668
Wife KANG Failan

142
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:29,836
She died the day before yesterday, right?

143
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:32,810
Yes...

144
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,850
Since we were apart for a long time

145
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:45,222
I didn't know she was ill so...

146
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:52,291
If she had told me, I could...

147
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,061
That'll be all.

148
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:57,468
That's all? Can we go now?

149
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:59,472
What do you mean?

150
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:00,575
Let's go

151
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:03,008
What do you mean by that?

152
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,305
Hey, let's go

153
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:07,279
I meant that the process is over
so you can go now

154
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,847
Okay, I see

155
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,214
But wait!

156
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,118
Why is it that simple when
a person had just died?

157
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,087
lsn't it strange?

158
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,749
What do you think you're doing?

159
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,328
I'm not doing anything, but...

160
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:22,760
What the hell is he doing? Hey!

161
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,297
We're sorry

162
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,298
Yes, sir!

163
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:28,994
What did you say? Is she your wife or what?

164
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:31,003
It's over, just get out of here!

165
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:34,337
I don't want to stay here either

166
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:45,545
He's just very upset, sorry, sir

167
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,190
Ah, am I a criminal or what?

168
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,286
Hey, who the hell do you think you are, huh?

169
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,662
Why are you so pissed off?
Is she really your wife?

170
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:02,570
Legally, yes

171
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:07,109
Jesus, you're really losing your mind

172
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:11,871
Anyway, I don't know what the
hell's got into Yongsik

173
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:13,879
He asked me to say hello to you

174
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,245
Anything else?

175
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,488
Just give him a call

176
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,065
Take this!

177
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,647
You should move this

178
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:49,978
Don't touch

179
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:03,289
How may I help you?

180
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:05,331
Sir!

181
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:06,799
What is it?

182
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,631
I can tell who's the loser

183
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:16,811
Right

184
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:19,537
Do it quickly

185
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,851
I'm sick

186
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:30,786
What?

187
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,563
I'm very sick

188
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:43,270
What? You're sick?

189
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,339
I will work very hard

190
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:47,669
I can recover, I'll try hard

191
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:52,646
You don't look sick to me!

192
00:22:54,317 --> 00:23:03,089
If I don't get your money in time,
my toes are sick, too

193
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:08,319
I can't wait even a month

194
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:29,981
Checkmate

195
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:33,814
You can put it here

196
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,685
Leave it there

197
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:47,397
Great

198
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,846
You're always smiling

199
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:37,951
Do you know how scared I am right now?

200
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:49,859
I might die

201
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,224
To lnchon

202
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,601
Funeral

203
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,757
It's so funny!

204
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:57,799
I'll take this

205
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,298
Only that?

206
00:25:59,469 --> 00:25:59,696
Yes

207
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:01,769
Get it back quickly

208
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:05,931
You're going to High School next year, right?

209
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:07,633
Yes

210
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:14,739
Grow up, kid! Want to see something really cool?

211
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,895
It's cheaper there

212
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:35,128
Then go rent it there!

213
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:36,664
Bye

214
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:57,811
Well, it's spooky to see a dead body, isn't it?

215
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:29,335
Do you know who I am? I'm KANG Failan

216
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:34,381
Do you know who I am? I'm KANG Failan

217
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,858
Stay away!

218
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,593
Search high and low!

219
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:05,506
Hey, Officer, give me a break

220
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:06,841
You hopeless bum, let's go!

221
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,446
Get in

222
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:11,083
Wait, wait

223
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,744
Get in, bastard

224
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:01,933
Is she really dead?

225
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,708
It's okay now

226
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:23,086
Hey! If you overdo it...

227
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:27,185
What is the matter?

228
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:37,895
Fuck!

229
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:01,695
You fucking bastard!

230
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:03,855
Who? Me?

231
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,661
Of course, it's you, you fucking bastard

232
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,303
Who else is here besides you?

233
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,099
What about me?

234
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:15,669
You're such shit!

235
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,214
Why are you eating that?

236
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:26,845
Are you hungry? Or is it for your health?

237
00:32:28,491 --> 00:32:32,985
Fuck! What is the matter with you?

238
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,230
Eat all you want, you bastard

239
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,603
Even your kinds need to stuff his
stomach to live

240
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:50,177
But I hate that!

241
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:53,611
Hey, what do you live for?

242
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,142
What bullshit!

243
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:04,286
Yours is more fucked up than mine

244
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,429
Shut up!

245
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,757
I can see your whole life

246
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:17,201
You're exactly Kangjae Jr.

247
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:21,072
That's enough!

248
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:27,815
I hate to tell you this

249
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:34,022
But if my life were like yours, I'd rather die

250
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:39,250
Yeah, you're right

251
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:45,026
I'm always fucked up

252
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:52,698
I'm the most fucked up in the world

253
00:33:55,845 --> 00:34:01,750
But did you see her?

254
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:06,911
That bitch lying dead in the hospital said

255
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:11,158
I'm the kindest person in the world

256
00:34:15,598 --> 00:34:19,261
Bullshit! So what?

257
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,735
What shall I do now that she's dead?

258
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:28,270
Do I have to live with the dead body, huh?

259
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,207
Okay, I got it, stand up please

260
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:36,647
Do I have to live with the dead body?

261
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:41,779
Lee Kangjae! Okay, okay, seat down, fuck!

262
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,425
Watch your mouth, you shithead!
Are you my father?

263
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:52,226
You little piece of shit

264
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:56,804
Shut up and just drink, Mister!

265
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,634
Yeah, okay, you motherfucker!

266
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,064
You are an actor!

267
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:02,396
Everyone would take you for her real husband!

268
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:08,407
It's all over now, let's go

269
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,807
Whom do I get her debt from?

270
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:27,586
Are you crazy?

271
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,565
What's wrong? Hey!

272
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:57,453
What are you going to do with the remains?

273
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:59,423
I don't know

274
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,258
Let's scatter them in the sea here

275
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:11,896
I think that would be best

276
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,938
Hello! Ah, yes, sir!

277
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,278
Wait a second

278
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:35,120
Yes, right

279
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:38,959
Everything's done

280
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:45,534
I'll go back soon

281
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:49,304
See you then

282
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:53,844
What did he say?

283
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,706
Nothing much

284
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,233
Who's there?

285
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:27,104
Are you the husband?

286
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:34,382
How could you show up now?

287
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:36,717
How could you!

288
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:40,326
You don't know how much Failan had
waited for you

289
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:46,492
How could you...How could you...

290
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:49,637
She'd waited so long

291
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:04,518
She worked so hard waiting for you

292
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:13,185
Poor girl, I feel so sorry for her

293
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,587
Hey! Wait!

294
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:21,424
Failan told me to give you this
when you come here

295
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,690
I almost forgot

296
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,678
She must've had lots to tell you

297
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,011
Aren't you going to read it?

298
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:42,542
Dear Mr. Kangjae

299
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:47,078
I didn't mail this

300
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:51,678
because I wasn't sure that you'd receive it

301
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:58,894
If you see this, the you've come to see me

302
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,922
Thank you

303
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:09,503
But I am dying

304
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:24,078
Thank you for your kindness though for
a short while

305
00:42:24,987 --> 00:42:28,423
I know a lot about you

306
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:43,403
While I saw your picture not to forget you,
I came to like you

307
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,537
And after that, it became even harder for me

308
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:57,479
Being alone made it so difficult to bear

309
00:42:58,086 --> 00:42:59,781
I'm sorry

310
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:12,563
You're always smiling in the picture

311
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:19,903
Everyone here is kind but
you are the kindest of all

312
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:27,975
Because you've married me

313
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:34,386
I have a favor to ask you

314
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:46,929
Would you come to see me when I am dead?

315
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:55,133
Would it be all right to die as your wife?

316
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,476
Sorry for asking this

317
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:03,015
But it is the only favor I have to ask of you

318
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:12,617
I am sorry I have nothing to give you

319
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:19,459
I love you more than anyone else in the world

320
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:25,202
Mr. Kangjae, good bye

321
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:26,884
The police is investigating gangsters over
the dead body

322
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:33,695
which was found at the harbor on the 18th

323
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:37,665
Inchon Bus Terminal

324
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:48,725
It's cold!

325
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:51,337
Now, you are back!

326
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:56,436
What a gambling! Look at the bet!

327
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,408
I'm happy to see you!

328
00:47:02,217 --> 00:47:05,653
You idiots! Don't eat Chinese food
in the office!

329
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,002
Have a seat

330
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:46,520
The investigation is narrowing down

331
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:51,260
Let's finish our deal now

332
00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:58,137
I kept my promise

333
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:00,035
Now it's your turn

334
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:11,110
Sorry

335
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:14,346
Don't be, it's me who should be sorry

336
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:22,156
I'm not going in

337
00:48:23,898 --> 00:48:29,837
I'm going back home

338
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,510
Thank you for everything

339
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:04,370
Are you really going back?

340
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:14,747
I don't know whether it's better for you or not

341
00:49:18,052 --> 00:49:22,989
Hey, how about a last wrestle?

342
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,983
You never beat me!

343
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,631
Why are you standing there like that?

344
00:49:35,937 --> 00:49:38,701
Did you say that I never beat you?

345
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:40,841
Come on, for the last time, huh?

346
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:46,009
Wear it! You'll get a bruise

347
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,114
Whatever!

348
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,550
Let's do it!

349
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,317
Are you ready? Go!

350
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,490
Idiot, I was joking

351
00:50:13,408 --> 00:50:15,933
Don't go before I come back

352
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:16,633
Where are you going?

353
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:18,574
Just wait! Okay?

354
00:51:44,632 --> 00:51:47,760
Failan at the spring beach

355
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:16,395
Hello? Yeah? Yes, sir

356
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:24,036
Fucking Yongsik always send me
on errands when I'm busy!

357
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:42,520
Wonderful sea, what an art!

358
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:48,890
Say something to your husband

359
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:53,733
Mr. Kangjae, thank you

360
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:58,497
No, say something else

361
00:52:58,673 --> 00:53:00,436
Say you love him

362
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:06,639
Okay, how about some singing?

363
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,311
I can't sing

364
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:15,386
Just try

365
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:25,731
Hey, once again

366
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,367
No!

367
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:30,504
Just once

368
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:42,782
Hey, come here, will you?

369
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:53,758
I'm gonna show it to your husband

370
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:55,953
Ready, go!

371
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:37,186
Hey Failan! You sing great!

372
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:39,918
Your husband will love it
