1
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,779
Hey, Mister

2
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,528
Get up if you're not playing

3
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,442
What the hell you hit me for?

4
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,240
How dare you wake me up?

5
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,474
Have you no fear, you little twit?

6
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:18,282
Don't you know who I am? Well, do you or not?

7
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,489
How could I?

8
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,495
Oh, you don't! Great!

9
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,959
Give me a cigarette

10
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,202
Lighter!

11
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,214
You're dead if you sit here

12
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,512
What?

13
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,235
Are you deaf?

14
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,069
You want me to make this place like before?

15
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,370
Okay, okay

16
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,846
I will put these coins over there

17
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,732
Hope Employment Agency

18
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:54,017
Please meet me.Sir.....

19
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,580
That fucking cop hung up on me! Fuck!

20
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,828
Open the window when I smoke, you idiot!

21
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,897
They are all fucking idiots

22
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,069
Huh? Stop the car

23
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:33,791
Bite! Bite! Bite, fuck!

24
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,389
Good afternoon, sir!

25
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,428
When did you get out?

26
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,103
ln... in the morning, sir

27
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,569
Then why are you showing up now?

28
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,801
What's that?

29
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,744
This? A toaster, sir

30
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,062
So you go to a Game Room after such a fuss?

31
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,461
You idiot don't know the situation

32
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,828
Kangjae! Kangjae! You fucking idiot!

33
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,972
You should think

34
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,039
Think, I said!

35
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,089
Why the fuck is it closed so early?

36
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,162
Shitheads! And how they work!

37
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,707
Oh my god!

38
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,587
You fucked?

39
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,321
Oh, no

40
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,462
Don't give me shit

41
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,666
You think this is a hotel?
In my store of all places...

42
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,466
Now, I manage this shop

43
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,199
What? You manage what?

44
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:35,177
Who authorized it?

45
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,213
Who authorized it?

46
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,709
Yongsik did

47
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,854
He ordered me to manage this place

48
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,047
And never to let you, Mr. ldiot, come near here

49
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,496
What did you just call me?

50
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,566
Mr. ldiot?

51
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,362
What a fucking bastard!

52
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,510
Have you no respect for your senior?

53
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,708
Leave it there, you bitch!

54
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,441
When you were suckling on your mama,

55
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:16,452
I made the foundations to this gang with
a knife in my bloody mouth

56
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,056
Don't you have any respect, you bastard?

57
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,453
Fuck you!

58
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,958
Don't shout at me

59
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,895
Go complain to Yongsik

60
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,466
Stop it!

61
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,095
All right, you mother fucker!

62
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm gonna ask Yongsik right away

63
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:41,878
If he says otherwise, it'll be your last day

64
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,144
You fuckin' shit!

65
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,118
Is it okay to treat him like that?

66
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,856
He's not worth my respect

67
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,694
You bastard, take this!

68
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,867
Hey, Kyungsu! The cops are here!

69
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,604
Hide those things, quick!

70
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:17,877
Fuck you! Fuck you!

71
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,178
Thought you could fool me again?

72
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,978
What? Fuck me?

73
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:29,526
Is that how you treat me when
I just got out of prison?

74
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:35,223
Is that how you treat me when
I just got out of prison?

75
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:41,435
You are a real son of a bitch, you know that?

76
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,734
Hey, mongrel!

77
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,873
Shame on you!

78
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,912
10 days imprisonment for selling
porn tapes to teenagers!

79
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,984
You'd already be dead cold without me

80
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,412
See whose clothes you're wearing

81
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,819
So what?

82
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,891
Shit, these really stink like hell!

83
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,528
Shut up and bring me some beer

84
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,856
There's no beer left

85
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,998
Then go and buy some

86
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,100
No way! It's damn cold so you go!

87
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,259
Besides, looks like you've already drunk

88
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,040
What? I'm gonna break your neck

89
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,982
Okay, okay, I do have some

90
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,019
Where?

91
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,417
Just wait

92
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,026
That's better

93
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,020
Here you go! Take this!

94
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,260
By the way, I met Yongsik today

95
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,406
He was mad as hell

96
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,505
Is he PMS-ing or what?

97
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,305
Tell me about it! It's red alert

98
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,909
While you were in prison,

99
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,412
caught for illegally immigrating Chinese

100
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,783
The whole city was a mess!

101
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:10,259
Even our agency was shut down

102
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:16,762
Besides, the D's kids are trying
to eat up our club now

103
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,599
So Yongsik's in the pits, I bet

104
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,673
And they call this a gang

105
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:27,176
Wouldn't take it even if they call me boss!

106
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,879
When you met Yongsik,
didn't he tell you anything?

107
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,215
Tell me what?

108
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,378
He wants you to be a bouncer at the club

109
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,524
You know what a bouncer is, right?

110
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,126
Humiliating, huh?

111
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,329
Tell him you want to be a waiter

112
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,825
Unless you want to get frostbitten

113
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,829
Put it away, you bastard!

114
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,398
That bastard!

115
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,498
Nothing's left

116
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,307
What a rat!

117
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,050
U-hm! The latest version

118
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,726
That dirty bastard! Never washes the dishes!

119
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,075
This bastard tries real hard to bait chicks

120
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,496
You bitch! Do you think with your tits?

121
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,809
You should've worked harder
when the sales dropped in half

122
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,810
How dare you take two days off work

123
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:50,016
just to hang around D's club?

124
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,280
Honey...

125
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,222
You guys heard her bitching, right?

126
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,932
This is why we're in the shits right now

127
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:14,572
There are reasons why D's kids eat
into our area

128
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,612
You idiots!

129
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,614
Now look!

130
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,951
Look, I said!

131
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,289
Look at it, shitheads!

132
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:48,705
Can any of you put these pieces back together?

133
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:58,413
No one can! When it's broken, it's too late

134
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,159
You understand?

135
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:14,161
While I'm gone to piss, think about it hard!

136
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,305
And you, bitch!

137
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,410
Today's your last day of your life

138
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,942
Where is Yongsik?

139
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,088
I've got something to tell you, sir

140
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,197
What is it?

141
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:47,704
I'd do better as a waiter than a bouncer

142
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:53,675
Kangjae, you bastard! That's exactly you

143
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,613
You know nothing but to talk

144
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:08,350
When I tell you something, do as you're told

145
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,438
What an idiot...

146
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,699
What a parasite

147
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,810
Who put that idiot in?

148
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,842
They should get rid of him

149
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,276
Because of that bastard

150
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,041
Just eat your noodles

151
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,921
If Cha Bum-gun was young again,
he would never play like that!

152
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,287
You are a real noodles!
Cha is a coach, not a player

153
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,927
You fool! You don't know a thing

154
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:52,128
When Cha was young, he scored three goals
in the last 5 minutes

155
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:58,504
Oh, yeah? Then do you know Bae Dong-sung
in short tracks?

156
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,572
Then, do you know Pro wrestler Kim l1?

157
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,044
How about Yeo Gun-bu?

158
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,115
Who?

159
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,252
The legendary Yeo!

160
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,747
You'll never know

161
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,448
Pro wrestling is only for show!

162
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,992
As for wrestling, Shim Kwon-ho is the best!

163
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,754
Here's the uniform!

164
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,798
Wow, yours is fucking big!

165
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,999
Are you talking about wrestling?

166
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,536
Give me a parterre position

167
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,571
Parterre? Okay, parterre!

168
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,470
Don't hold it, you idiot

169
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,234
Okay

170
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,605
Take this!

171
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,642
Fuck!

172
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,178
Hey, it's rotting?

173
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,815
Shit! No more!

174
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,348
Do it again!

175
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,542
Parterre!

176
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,346
You idiot, are you ready?

177
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,281
A whistle! You bastard

178
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,514
How's this

179
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,182
Oh, you're tough

180
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,854
You can't beat me! No!

181
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,378
You bastards, freeze there! You don't bow to me?

182
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,914
Who's in the offices?

183
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,644
Go check yourself

184
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,955
Hey, if you have any problem, ask me for help

185
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,427
ey, Kangjae! We've got a real problem

186
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,928
Can you help us?

187
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,495
This is too much

188
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,603
The interest has doubled the original sum

189
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,500
I can't give you any more

190
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,439
So you're saying you won't pay us back?

191
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,044
Auntie, this is Kangjae

192
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,206
Look at me, You should listen to me

193
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:50,048
Don't make excuses

194
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,814
Do whatever you want!

195
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,890
You shouldn't do this to me

196
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,289
Remember what I've done for you
when you were hungry

197
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,259
I fed you noodles and bought you drinks

198
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,228
I don't remember anything

199
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,664
Stop babbling and get to the point

200
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,700
Are you going to give it or not?

201
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,136
You ungrateful bastard!

202
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,210
Is she a Yakuza or what?

203
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:20,184
Are you paying back with violence?

204
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,515
Give me few more days, I beg you!

205
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,088
What the fuck!

206
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,747
What?

207
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,688
Hey, sit down!

208
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,518
Watch your mouth to your auntie

209
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,689
We should respect the elders

210
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,493
Auntie, please come over there

211
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,192
Please give me a break, will you?

212
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,736
So you're saying you want a couple
more days, right?

213
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,396
Yes, yes

214
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,202
But how can we?

215
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,777
We'll be going to the States tomorrow for good

216
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,710
you motherfucking bitch

217
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,543
How can you call me like that?

218
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,185
Don't you have parents to teach you manners?

219
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,344
No, I don't! I'm an orphan!

220
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,988
So what you gonna do about it, you bitch?

221
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,919
Hey! Hey! Get out and wait

222
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,855
Get out of my way

223
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,760
Pour it around

224
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,229
I like it!

225
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,406
Hey, auntie

226
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,975
Your last chance

227
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,170
You want me to drop this

228
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,941
Just do it, huh?

229
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,354
Bye! Thanks for the noodle

230
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,824
How humiliating is!

231
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,261
Be careful not to become like him

232
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,134
What are you talking about?

233
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,240
You seem to have a fun life

234
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,343
You can't even handle that old bitch

235
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,308
Are you going out with her?

236
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,472
Why are you so soft on her?

237
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,677
If you have no guts,
just shut your fucking mouth

238
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,716
What did you say, you bastard?

239
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,289
Fuck! How can I call this scum my senior?

240
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,694
Go away, just go

241
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,692
Let's go

242
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,134
What did he say?

243
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,898
I don't know

244
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,442
He can do nothing but talk

245
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,585
Stop it!

246
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,282
Little shitheads, how dare...

247
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,336
Stand upright! Upright!

248
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,237
Upright! Upright!

249
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,671
I did nothing, sir

250
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,906
Don't make excuses

251
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,448
Come closer, closer!

252
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,586
Stand up!

253
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,279
Sir!

254
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,491
Stand up, idiot! Up, up!

255
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,821
I'm sorry, sir

256
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,770
Get out of my sight!

257
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,430
Right now!

258
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,554
Why are you still here?

259
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,388
Get lost! I don't want to see you

260
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,329
You're not even a human

261
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:03,372
Even if I was born four-legged,
I wouldn't live like you

262
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,472
You should mind your own business

263
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,810
Why did you go with the kids and fuck up?

264
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:19,881
But the auntie treated us...

265
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,590
I told you not to talk about the past, didn't l?

266
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,254
But...

267
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:42,140
You're shit! I'll finish you today

268
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:51,087
Just take it with one hand

269
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,950
That's all right, sir

270
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,895
Hey, call me by my name when we're alone

271
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:03,365
I'm your friend

272
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,133
Bottoms up! At one go!

273
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,982
Have some more

274
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:28,521
Kangjae, isn't it a fucking world?

275
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:34,460
I know how you feel

276
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,263
We started out together

277
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,635
And I became the boss and you're still a minion

278
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,738
You know why?

279
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,983
That's because you're not made for this

280
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:57,914
You have the tiniest guts and
you're so weak at heart

281
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:04,619
And you're not responsible enough to
carry out your duties

282
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:15,231
fishing with your brother

283
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,073
You talked big about going back with a boat?

284
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,045
You that you talked big about
going back with a boat?

285
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,652
Please take my glass, sir

286
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,959
You bastard...

287
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,241
Drink it

288
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,990
What the hell are those bastards doing here?

289
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,758
Think this is their home or what?

290
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,303
Call the kids... No, I'll take care of it myself

291
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,991
Hey, you son of a bitch

292
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,555
How dare you come into my area?

293
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,400
So what? You fucker...

294
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,036
What? You're dead!

295
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,205
So the bastard wants to die!

296
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,767
Die you fucking bastard! Die!

297
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,875
Die! Die!

298
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,854
Yo... Yongsik

299
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,928
Hey, get up! Hey, you!

300
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,430
Get up, you bastard!

301
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,202
Yongsik!

302
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,749
Have you heard the news?

303
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,186
That bastard rose to the surface

304
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,151
We should've hung something heavier on him

305
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,060
What should we do now?

306
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,363
There's got to be a way out, surely

307
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:51,781
If we work together, there's nothing we can't do

308
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,723
Kangjae...

309
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,055
Would you save me, I mean, us?

310
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,859
I'm not trying to put the blame on you

311
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:20,004
But if I go in now, it'll be the end of everything

312
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,639
You know what I mean?

313
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,664
I'm begging you now on my knees

314
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,961
If only you would do this for me, then...

315
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,540
You said you want to go home with a fishing boat

316
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,235
I'll buy it for you

317
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:59,549
This is the first and last favor I ask of you
as a friend, Kangjae!

318
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:09,455
I need some time to think about it

319
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,530
Actually, you're partly responsible, too

320
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,739
Since you're cleaner than me...

321
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,138
If you turn yourself in, it won't be longer
than 10 years

322
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,678
But for me, it'll be at least 20 years

323
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,610
and then my life's over

324
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,480
I can't die alone

325
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:15,787
My hometown must be bustling with squid
and shrimp fishing now

326
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,123
Driving me crazy..

327
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,597
Why? You want to go back?

328
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,069
Every time you get drunk...

329
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,004
Go back if you have the nerve

330
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,212
I'll definitely go

331
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:47,382
With a small fishing boat...

332
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,354
Yeah... a hundred years later

333
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,594
What?

334
00:33:56,067 --> 00:34:00,936
You think I can't do it?

335
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:07,175
Buying a boat is a piece of cake to me

336
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:13,841
This shithead thinks I can't afford it

337
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,020
Hey, give it to me!

338
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,652
Give it to me! I'm gonna show you that I can!

339
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,661
Give you what?

340
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,833
Your cell phone, you idiot!

341
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,569
Then what?

342
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,519
Yongsik?

343
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,051
It's me, Kangjae

344
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:06,998
Yeah, it's Kangjae who you beat up
real bad yesterday

345
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,267
Yeah, I'm drunk

346
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,775
How can I not drink after getting beaten
up like that?

347
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,507
I'll get to the point

348
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:28,521
Were you serious about what you said
the other day?

349
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:37,458
Yeah, I will go in, yeah!

350
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,762
lnstead of you...

351
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:45,136
lnstead of you...

352
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,876
Only on one condition

353
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,046
Give me the money first

354
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:07,790
Yeah, send it to my bank account

355
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,358
If not, you will be fucked up

356
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,263
You think I'm nothing

357
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,603
Hey, Yongsik! Keep your promise

358
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,712
Give me the money first

359
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,438
Will you?

360
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:46,394
10 years for a boat isn't that bad, shit!

361
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,842
Are you Mr. Lee Kangjae?

362
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,749
Well, I was just about to...

363
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:08,483
Ms. Kang Failan is your wife, right?

364
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,691
I'm sorry but she died yesterday

365
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,200
It's been over a year since they moved to Canada

366
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:33,275
Haven't you contacted them before coming here?

367
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,504
They're my only relatives

368
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,048
Do you have their phone number?

369
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,778
No, I am sorry about that

370
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,351
Go back to China

371
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:52,929
It's hard to live here without any connections

372
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,299
There's no one there, either

373
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,226
Hope...?

374
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,371
Come on in! Relax!

375
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,239
That's too bad

376
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,278
How can I help you?

377
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,221
I'd like to earn some money

378
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,453
But how?

379
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,932
I studied Korean in China

380
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,568
I'm confident that I can do anything

381
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,065
But there is a problem

382
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,702
You can't stay here longer than allowed

383
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:22,211
If you don't get a visa, you'd get arrested

384
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,702
There is a way

385
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,073
Could you untie your hair, please?

386
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,569
It's okay

387
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,736
What style!

388
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:25,204
Look at this red scarf, how embarrassing!

389
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,542
Shut your mouth and give me the money

390
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,709
Okay, okay!

391
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,192
Here it is... deducting my fee

392
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,159
Are you ripping me off?

393
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,697
Am I crazy to do this for nothing?

394
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,528
Give me your documents

395
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,760
Is there all that we need?

396
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,062
Sure, Sayonara!

397
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,707
Your wife is inside, Wanna see her?

398
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,035
No!

399
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,769
Come on, just have a look at her

400
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,547
That's your wife, there

401
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,513
Where?

402
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,949
Over there, wanna do her?

403
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,284
That little chick?

404
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,753
Yeah

405
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,217
Shit

406
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,151
Why, not your taste?

407
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,319
You do her yourself

408
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,324
Where are you going?

409
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,659
To the turf

410
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,461
Going there again?

411
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,264
What is it?

412
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,408
Give it to the little chick

413
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,371
Caring for your wife already?

414
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,337
You said red looks embarrassing, didn't you?

415
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,488
Don't worry

416
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,756
I'm not gonna hurt you

417
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,160
Thank you!

418
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:55,906
We have his picture here,
would you like to have a look?

419
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,694
Maybe it's all for the better

420
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,421
Why don't you go cool off your head

421
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,629
Let's finish our deal when you're back

422
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,577
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

423
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,346
Give it to Kyungsu

424
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,955
He's at the station

425
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,526
He first took the girl there

426
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,429
Have some fun with this

427
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,967
No, I have money

428
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,195
Take it with you

429
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,361
No, thanks

430
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,699
Just take it

431
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,407
Yongsik

432
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,839
Why?

433
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,177
You'll keep the promise?

434
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,441
Of course I will

435
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,929
Hey, you don't bow to your senior?

436
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:39,635
You don't bow to me, you asshole?

437
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:03,893
Kang Failan, 781 01 1 245431 1

438
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,592
Kang Fai, right? Fai?

439
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:12,402
Kang Failan, 781 01 1 2454...

440
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:24,619
22454... 2454... Hey, look at the snow there

441
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,884
22454... 2454... I don't know

442
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,163
You really hate using your brain

443
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,597
Her hometown?

444
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,137
How can you smile when your wife's dead?

445
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,036
Should I cry then?

446
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,039
Why did that bitch die to hassle me like this?

447
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:54,111
And when was it that you were overjoyed
at getting money for it

448
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,386
You have to memorize this

449
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,022
What if the cops ask you about her?

450
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,124
What kind of a husband doesn't know
about his wife, huh?

451
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,989
How many guys memorize their wife's
social security number?

452
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,489
I just think that's over the line

453
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,110
Did you see her at the agency?

454
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,805
You didn't, right?

455
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,416
Here is her picture

456
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,846
I don't want to see it

457
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:36,482
You should know her face not to be suspicious

458
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,068
lsn't she pretty? Even better in person

459
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,743
Why?

460
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,350
Does she get to you?

461
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,349
Moron...

462
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,162
Hey!

463
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,691
She's pretty

464
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,967
Hey, hurry up! Hurry!

465
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,608
Come on in

466
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,268
It stinks... Come on in

467
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,472
Just relax, it's all right

468
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,378
Sit down

469
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,488
What the hell is this? Hey, isn't she great?

470
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,681
Shut up and give me a minute

471
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,655
She's perfect

472
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,260
Have a seat

473
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,102
Not bad, quite good

474
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,209
Yeah? You should pay a lot

475
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,570
Bullshit!

476
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,646
Oh, that bastard! Whenever he gets drunk...

477
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,022
Come here, you bitch

478
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,861
What is it?

479
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,621
Leave me alone, you bastard!

480
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,568
What the fuck is that?

481
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,801
Just sit down

482
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,639
You bitch, you...

483
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,072
Let me go, shit!

484
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,232
Who's the guy?

485
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,303
I don't know

486
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,908
Whenever he gets drunk, he's crazy like that

487
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,377
It runs in his family to be like that

488
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
What's taking her so long in the bathroom?

489
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,140
What if she took off?

490
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,044
Here she comes

491
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:35,993
Say hello to your boss

492
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,602
Hey, what the fuck is that?

493
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,767
Is this how you do your business?

494
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,205
No, it's not like that

495
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,276
I almost got fucked up

496
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,880
Do you think this is a blood donation center?

497
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,540
No, please have a seat

498
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,084
Don't give me shit!

499
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,578
Hey, hey, please!

500
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,986
What do you want me to do now?

501
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,561
She's sick!

502
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,259
She coughed up blood

503
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,531
I don't know... Looks like some
contagious disease

504
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,170
Shit, I'm really out of luck

505
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:23,073
It wouldn't have mattered if she coughed it
up after the deal

506
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:27,181
But she did it right in front of him

507
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,444
How could I cheat on him right then?

508
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,181
What? Which agency?

509
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:37,656
Okay, give them a call first, all right?

510
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,590
You don't know how hard laundry is

511
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:53,073
How such a fragile girl can do the work?

512
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,336
I guarantee it

513
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,276
You can't find anyone like this girl

514
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,539
You're really lucky, lady

515
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,478
In the past I washed many clothes,
I am good at riding bicycle

516
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:05,983
What did she say?

517
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:10,115
See? She says she was a pro laundress in China

518
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,022
She can ride a bicycle, too

519
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:17,499
But we can't even communicate

520
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,263
You don't need much talk

521
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,241
After I left home, I will work very hard

522
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,878
She'll do whatever you order.You are so lucky!

523
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,144
Work hard, don't slack off

524
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,876
Lady, don't give her a break

525
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,283
Don't say that

526
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,946
Good bye

527
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,022
Good bye

528
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,386
It's cold, come on in

529
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,863
Thank you for your present

530
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,901
What did she say?

531
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,303
Thank you for the scarf

532
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:05,770
Hey, tell her that it's a wedding present
from her husband

533
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:14,116
This scarf is given by your husband,
you should thank him

534
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,152
You speak Chinese well

535
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,728
When I was young, I had a business there

536
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:21,795
She has a disease or something, right?

537
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,557
Nonsense!

538
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,473
It's small but good for one person

539
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:43,248
And tell me if you need anything

540
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:49,088
What can I tell her? This is frustrating

541
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,616
Good morning

542
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,373
Hi

543
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,707
Uh, Hi!

544
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:58,711
Oh my god! You're a walking washing machine

545
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,051
How could you wash all these with
such a thin body?

546
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:20,267
Laundry...!

547
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,038
Good.Welcome!

548
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,679
"Welcome

549
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,013
Haha..Thankyou!

550
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,154
"Thankyou!

551
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,750
Haha... Did you have dinner?

552
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,190
Did yi o dinor?

553
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,287
Hahaha... I can't help it!

554
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,697
