1
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,000
Sue, don't misunderstand me.

2
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:40,834
I'm not complaining about your work.
I have your latest piece here, it's great.

3
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,168
But you were due back yesterday.

4
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,744
But Richard, there's one more story
I just have to do.

5
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,849
- There's always one more story.
- But listen to this.

6
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,885
Last month this guy in the Northern
Territory was attacked by a crocodile.

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,788
It bit his leg right off, left him there
to die a hundred miles from nowhere.

8
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,520
A week later he crawls out of the bush,
gets patched up and disappears.

9
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,632
No interviews, no pictures, nothing.
I tracked him down.

10
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,033
He runs a safari business out
of somewhere called Walkabout Creek.

11
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,873
And his name... get this.

12
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,577
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,207
Even if this is for real,
it could take weeks to nail him down.

14
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,877
I've made arrangements to meet him,
I got a chopper meeting me,

15
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,489
I'll be there tonight.

16
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,491
Yeah... OK...

17
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,654
- I really miss you, darling.
- I miss you, too.

18
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,461
- Take care now.
- Don't worry, I'm a New Yorker!

19
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:38,043
Walter Reilly, Never-Never Safaris.
I'm Mr Dundee's business partner.

20
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,585
- Nice to meet you, Mr Reilly.
- Please, call me Walter.

21
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,723
We're pretty informal in the bush.

22
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,727
No... let me.

23
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,171
There you go.

24
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,664
- You all right?
- Yes.

25
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,042
I'm sorry that Mr Dundee isn't here
himself to meet you, but...

26
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,984
...he is here in town... somewhere.

27
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,154
Welcome to Walkabout Creek.

28
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,968
I took the liberty of booking you
into our hotel. I trust that's in order?

29
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,873
- Sounds just fine.
- There's just one other thing...

30
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:16,709
You did say that you were prepared
to pay the 2,500 dollars?

31
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:22,412
Absolutely. And I'll see where
he was attacked and how he survived?

32
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:27,116
Miss, I assure you you're gonna spend
a few wonderful days here.

33
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,482
Five bucks, anyone
who can make Donk spill it.

34
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,313
What's the sideshow all about?

35
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,680
Just the boys having fun and games.

36
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,724
Donk's never spilled a drop.
We're a pretty tough breed up here.

37
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,501
- And your Mr Dundee, does he...
- No, he's very reserved.

38
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,104
He's a legend up here.

39
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:18,005
There he was doing a quiet spot
of fishing when all of a sudden... bang!

40
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:23,979
This giant crocodile came up,
turned him over, bit half his leg off,

41
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,380
dragged him down under.

42
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,317
Killed it, of course.

43
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:34,449
I mean, any normal man would have
just turned up his toes and died.

44
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,326
But not our Mick. No.

45
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,161
Hundreds of miles...

46
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,496
Snake-infested swamps...

47
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:52,444
On his hands and knees
he crawled right into Katherine.

48
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:57,515
Straight past the hospital
and into the first pub for a beer!

49
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,944
That story's getting better
every time you tell it, Wally!

50
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:12,530
We handle ourselves pretty well here.
But if you're talking legend...

51
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,775
Oh, my God!

52
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,985
Two beers, Ide... one for me,
one for me mate.

53
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,462
"One for your mate", you mad bugger!

54
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,123
Oh, hang on...

55
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:57,473
I'm sorry if that frightened you, Miss.
You see, it's stuffed.

56
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,237
Him and me both, Wal.

57
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,455
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

58
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,490
- Never-Never Safaris.
- Yes.

59
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,428
Never go out with us, if you do,
you'll never come back. Right, Wal?

60
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,468
Sue Charlton, Newsday.

61
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah, I thought you might be.

62
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:38,774
Here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me while
I dance with this charming young lady.

63
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,226
Legend has it
a crocodile took half your leg off.

64
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,598
A slight exaggeration.

65
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,803
More like a love bite, really.

66
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,309
There you are, enough about me leg.
Let me tell you about the rest of me.

67
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,249
Up north in the Never-Never,
where the land is harsh and bare,

68
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,982
lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee

69
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,251
who can dance like Fred Astaire.

70
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,826
Smooth, Shag, eh?

71
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,025
- What was the name of this clown?
- Mick Dundee.

72
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,969
The bloke that was grabbed
by a croc on the Rapid River.

73
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:36,473
- What was he doing up there?
- It's full of crocs! What do you think?

74
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,701
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

75
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,946
I want you to take me
where you were attacked.

76
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,778
Show me how you survived.

77
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,514
Just the two of us out there alone?
I got my reputation to think about.

78
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,854
Hey, Dundee! Where can a man shoot
a few crocs around here?

79
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,564
How would I know, Shit-For-Brains?

80
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,800
Just relax.

81
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,877
Every man and his dog in the joint
know you're nothing but a croc poacher.

82
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,026
Sorry, but I won't have anyone
using bad language in front of a lady.

83
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,792
Bad language?

84
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,969
Don't come back!

85
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,302
What was he saying
about you being a poacher?

86
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,207
He was just trying to get a bite.

87
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,613
- Donk, tonight's me lucky night.
- You want to have a hit at my guts?

88
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,345
Put your money on me, guys!

89
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,257
Come on, Mick.

90
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,740
Give him one of your kicks, Donk!

91
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,878
I'm sorry, he's not normally like this.

92
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,958
I do apologise, it's just the drink.

93
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,755
You mean,
there's a serious side to him?

94
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,091
I can hardly wait.

95
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,841
Comfortable, Miss?

96
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,383
- Wonderful country out here.
- We think so.

97
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,265
I hope you're not gonna be
the strong, silent type.

98
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,369
- Reluctant to talk about yourself?
- Nah, favourite subject.

99
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,438
- Why 'Crocodile'?
- Wal's idea.

100
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,338
He reckons it makes me more
colourful for the tourist business.

101
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,742
- How old are you?
- Dunno.

102
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,909
- What year is this?
- You don't know?

103
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:40,150
Time doesn't mean much up here.
The Aborigines don't have calendars.

104
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,590
I was raised by the local tribe.

105
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,528
I asked one of the tribal elders
when I was born, and he said,

106
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,927
"In the summertime."

107
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,856
And is there a Mrs Crocodile Dundee?

108
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:15,756
I was sort of married once.
Nice girl, good cook. Big...

109
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:24,232
I went off on a Walkabout,
and when I came back, she'd gone.

110
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,499
- A 'Walkabout'?
- That's an Aboriginal habit.

111
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:33,702
It means to wander around
and discover new places.

112
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,144
- How long were you gone?
- Couple of months.

113
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,613
Try eighteen.

114
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,579
And she didn't wait? Strange girl.

115
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,986
Yeah.

116
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,137
Out of the way, dopey!

117
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,161
Jesus...

118
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,674
- That was amazing.
- Mind over matter.

119
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,742
Old bushman's trick.

120
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,302
All right, Miss, all ashore.

121
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,640
Now I'm gonna leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

122
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,181
and I'll meet you
at the Echo Billabong on Wednesday.

123
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,334
2.20. We'd better get started.

124
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,836
- 2.20?
- That's the way we do it in the bush.

125
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,777
Don't worry, he's the best bushman
in the territory. Best pupil I ever had.

126
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,016
- You ready, lady?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

127
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,919
- Right, well, till Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

128
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,191
- What's today, Wal?
- Monday.

129
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,033
Doesn't know... doesn't care.

130
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,072
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,888
- You OK, lady?
- I'm fine.

132
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:46,389
It's only about another hour
to the river, but you being a sheila...

133
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,829
...it'll probably take two.

134
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:54,029
- Well, I'll just do the best I can.
- Yeah.

135
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,471
The water was running twenty foot
up the bank during the wet season.

136
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,993
Here's what's left of me boat.

137
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,139
Now you can see
where he sunk his teeth in.

138
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:37,439
- How big was it?
- Oh, sixteen, eighteen foot, maybe.

139
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,386
And you were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

140
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,922
Nah, that's illegal. I was just fishing.

141
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,132
- How did you get away?
- Crocs don't like fresh meat.

142
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:02,240
He wasn't trying to eat me. He wanted
to take me down for a death roll.

143
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:07,868
See, a croc will grab you and take you
down to the bottom of the water

144
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,914
and roll you over and over
till you stop kicking.

145
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,247
Then he'll take you away
to his meat safe,

146
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,551
a rock ledge or log down
under the water and jam you under it,

147
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,524
tenderise you a bit, good eating.

148
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,958
He wasn't happy with his grip on me,
so he let go to get a better one.

149
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,036
- I talked him out of it.
- Talked?

150
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,482
And you were just out here fishing?

151
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,054
Well, barramundi is a bloody big fish.

152
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,420
It'll be getting dark soon.

153
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,031
I'll take you
to where I camped the first night.

154
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:27,321
- You married?
- Was once... to the original rebel.

155
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:31,428
- What happened?
- You name it, we marched.

156
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,157
Anti-nuke, Women's Lib,
Save the Whales...

157
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,565
He's probably marching right now
for the gay Nazis.

158
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,332
- Sounds like a prize ratbag.
- He meant well.

159
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,569
Haven't you ever
protested anything?

160
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,178
Sure, every time
I get thrown out of the pub.

161
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:55,150
I'm serious. Where would you stand
on, say, the nuclear debate?

162
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,483
- What about the arms race?
- None of my business.

163
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,384
None of your business?
How can you say that?

164
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,995
It's everybody's business.

165
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,030
Got to have an opinion,
got to have a voice.

166
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,864
Who's gonna hear it out here?

167
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,706
OK, something closer to home.

168
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,942
The Aborigines, what about
their claims to get the land back?

169
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,455
Well, you see,
Aborigines don't own the land.

170
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,655
They belong to it.
It's like their mother.

171
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:42,800
See those rocks? Been standing there
for 600 million years.

172
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,596
Still be there when you and I are gone.

173
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,467
So arguing over who owns them...

174
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:55,036
...is like two fleas arguing over
who owns the dog they live on.

175
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:01,249
You see, Aborigines,
like all God's creatures,

176
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,323
they just want the right to roam
across the Earth and be left in peace.

177
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,595
It's that...

178
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,372
- Oh, it's a King Brown.
- Poisonous?

179
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,068
Oh, yeah, deadly. Not bad eating,
but they always give me gas.

180
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,313
Listen, are there any more
of those around?

181
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:36,446
Maybe the odd one late at night, but
stick close to me, you'll be all right.

182
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:03,077
You're probably right,
a man should have an opinion...

183
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,738
What?

184
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,349
Thought I heard something.

185
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,046
No, it's nothing. Goodnight.

186
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,250
Mick?

187
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,983
It's only me.

188
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:22,083
Dangerous bastards.
It's those city cowboys.

189
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,665
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing, why?

190
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,633
Why? They're shooting
these poor kangaroos for fun!

191
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,998
Well, there's no law against that.

192
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,415
Keep your head down. Stay here.

193
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,223
I need a piss!

194
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,594
- I need a piss!
- And a straighter rifle.

195
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,863
You're as useless
as tits on a bull, Duffy!

196
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:16,272
Shut up, you guys! Hey, Trevor!
Get the spotlight over here, man!

197
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,645
- The spotlight!
- Can't you see where you're aiming?

198
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,547
Shut up!

199
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:29,049
Not on me, you silly bugger,
on the bushes!

200
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,058
Look at this big, cheeky bugger.

201
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,035
Hey! It's got a gun!

202
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,766
Shit!

203
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,331
Good one, Skippy.

204
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,049
Despite the rugged beauty of this land,

205
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,061
there's a sort
of strange emptiness about it.

206
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,192
A feeling of being so alone.

207
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,565
Yeah, but you're not alone.
I'm here, aren't I?

208
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,064
Yeah, but I think I know
how you must have felt.

209
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,701
Or, how I'd feel
if I were out here alone.

210
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,405
You? Out here alone?

211
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:37,180
That's a joke. A city girl like you.
You wouldn't last five minutes, love.

212
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,982
This is a man's country out here.

213
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,091
That's right, I'm only a sheila.

214
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,337
We're heading for
that escarpment today, right?

215
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,742
OK, see you there this afternoon.

216
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:09,946
Hey! If you're gonna go,
take the gun with you.

217
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,954
If you get into trouble,
fire a couple of shots in the air.

218
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,564
That's the dangerous end.

219
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,379
So it is.

220
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,528
It's all right, it's over.

221
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,742
I got you, I got you.

222
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,781
Is it dead?

223
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,567
If it isn't, I'll have a job
skinning the bastard.

224
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:14,014
You were right.
Definitely no place for a city girl.

225
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:19,721
From what Wal's told me, living
in the city can be just as dangerous.

226
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,594
- Haven't you ever lived in a city?
- Never been to a city.

227
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,759
- You're kidding?
- No.

228
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:31,569
Cities are crowded, right? If I went and
lived in a city, I'd only make it worse.

229
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,540
Here, try this.

230
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,015
- Do you want me to have a look?
- It's just a scratch.

231
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,589
A scratch can turn septic out here.
Give us a look. No, it's all right.

232
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,554
Now what?

233
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,466
Oh, Christ! It's like living
with Davy Crockett.

234
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,969
Mick?

235
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,011
Mick?

236
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,494
Oh, Mick! You frightened shit
out of me!

237
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:34,331
So I ought to. Sneaking up on a man
when he's rendering first aid to a lady!

238
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,474
Is that what you were doing?

239
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,645
It's all right, it's a mate of mine,
Neville Bell. Sue Charlton.

240
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,312
What are you doing
wandering round here?

241
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,256
I'm on my way to a corroboree
at the Jabba. A bloody drag.

242
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,557
But still, my dad'll get angry
if I don't show up.

243
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,929
Nev's a real city boy,
but his dad's a tribal elder.

244
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,402
Oh, no, you can't take my photograph.

245
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,441
I'm sorry, you believe
it'll take your spirit away?

246
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,635
No, you got a lens cap on!

247
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,777
Crikey! Mick, I'd better get going.

248
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,053
- Nice to meet you, Sue.
- Bye, Nev.

249
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:31,958
- I'll catch up with you, Nev.
- What's happening?

250
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,156
I'd better go with Nev
and see the Pintinjarra.

251
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,664
Can I come?

252
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,565
No way. Women are
strictly taboo at these turnouts.

253
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,742
How does he find his way in the dark?

254
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:51,780
He thinks his way. A lot of people
believe that they're telepathic.

255
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,718
Oh, I hate the bush!

256
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,503
How did you know?

257
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,080
Are you telepathic?

258
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,882
Nah. Common sense.

259
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,419
You're a woman, a reporter,

260
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,854
that makes you
the biggest busybody in the world.

261
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,788
I can live with that.

262
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,258
That croc was gonna eat me alive.

263
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,803
I wouldn't hold that against him.

264
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,966
Same thought crossed my mind
once or twice.

265
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,078
Goodnight, Mick.

266
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,115
It took me a week to crawl this far.

267
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,194
I thought I was a goner.
I said to myself,

268
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:23,265
"Old son, find yourself a comfortable
spot and lay down and die."

269
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,403
- Weren't you afraid?
- Of dying? Nah!

270
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,769
I read the Bible once. You know
God and Jesus and all them apostles?

271
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,706
They were all fishermen, just like me.

272
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,110
Yeah, straight to heaven
for Mick Dundee.

273
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:46,123
Yep... Me and God, we'd be mates.

274
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,197
This is Echo Lake.

275
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,969
I reckon this place saved my life.

276
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,078
That's mineral water.
It means no crocs.

277
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,843
- Plenty of tucker here.
- Tucker?

278
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,455
- Food. You hungry?
- Starving.

279
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,021
I'll get lunch.

280
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,965
How do you like your goanna?
Medium? Well done?

281
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,335
- You don't expect me to eat that?
- It's great. Try some yams.

282
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:42,844
Try the grubs and the sugar ants.
Bite the end off, they're really sweet.

283
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,148
- Aren't you having any?
- Me?

284
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,252
Oh, well, you can live on it...

285
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,557
...but it tastes like shit.

286
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,963
Mick? Why don't you
come back with me?

287
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,536
What for?

288
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:21,237
It would make a great wrap
to the story. You in New York City.

289
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:27,177
Oh. For a minute I thought
you were making a pass at me.

290
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,444
Well, I might have been.

291
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,851
Would you mind?

292
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,615
Bloody Wally.

293
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,814
He's only been here a dozen times.
He's probably lost.

294
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,836
Did you...?

295
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,483
You got wind or something, Wal?

296
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,018
I want Mick to come back
to New York with me.

297
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,857
Mick? In a big city? No chance.

298
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,000
The paper would pay.

299
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:55,369
Well... A man should
broaden his horizons.

300
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,242
Everything OK?

301
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,248
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no worries.

302
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,670
Jesus Christ!

303
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,058
Sue!

304
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,593
Sue! Sue...

305
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,862
G'day, mate!

306
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:08,275
You look absolutely stunning.

307
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,813
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

308
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,110
Let me get this.

309
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,449
Where's the man
from the backwoods?

310
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,182
We got separated at customs.

311
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,022
He almost started a riot when they
wanted to look through his suitcase.

312
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,664
There he is!

313
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,960
So that's Jungle Jim?

314
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,829
New York City, Mr Dundee.
Home to seven million people.

315
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:14,137
Incredible. Imagine seven million
people all wanting to live together.

316
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,537
Yeah, New York must be
the friendliest place on Earth.

317
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,125
G'day!

318
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,033
Mick Dundee from Australia.
How are you?

319
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,366
- I'm fine, how are you?
- Good.

320
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,508
I'm in town for a couple of days.
Probably see you around.

321
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,537
Bye.

322
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,697
Thank you, Gus.

323
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,302
You'll take care of the luggage?

324
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,915
That's it.

325
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:32,215
- Thanks for the lift, mate.
- No problem.

326
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:37,224
- What tribe are you, Gus?
- Tribe? Man, I ain't from no tribe.

327
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:41,125
- You're a black fella, aren't you?
- Last time I looked.

328
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,669
No one in our tribe's got a flash car
like this. You must be doing all right.

329
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,841
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

330
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:02,384
- I thought Tacano's would be nice.
- Tacano's? 7.30?

331
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,855
- Bye.
- OK. Table for three.

332
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,550
Sir?

333
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,559
No worries.

334
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,310
Well, what do you think?

335
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,075
It's a bit rough, but I'll manage.

336
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:09,045
Hey, how many of us
are staying here?

337
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,053
Just you. I've got
my own apartment downtown.

338
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,068
Sorry, Mick Dundee.
I didn't catch the name.

339
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,636
- Angelo.
- Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

340
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,968
I got it. Here you go.

341
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:41,016
- Got to pay for the room in advance?
- You're in my town now, trust me.

342
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,656
Can I get the direct
dialling code for Australia?

343
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,731
You should be comfortable.
There's a TV if you get bored.

344
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:06,103
Ah, TV. Yeah, I saw that
at Darkie Johnson's place years ago.

345
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,713
Yep, that's what I saw.

346
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,380
Right. OK, thanks.

347
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,820
I'm writing down Wally's number
and my office number.

348
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,591
Hey, Sue, come here, look at this!

349
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,942
Some nitwit's put two dunnies in here.

350
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,077
One dunny, one bidet.

351
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,313
Bidday?

352
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,815
It's for... after you... you know...

353
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,584
You figure it out.

354
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,260
See you at seven.

355
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,563
For washing your backside, right?

356
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,321
G'day.

357
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,631
G'day.

358
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,740
G'day. G'day.

359
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,842
- G'day.
- Hello.

360
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,549
G'day.

361
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,735
I'm sorry.

362
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,637
G'day.

363
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,080
Shit!

364
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,610
- Take it easy, Mick.
- Thanks, mate.

365
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,824
- G'day.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,273
Good evening, follow me, please.

367
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,745
Hello.

368
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,043
Sorry we're late. Been waiting long?

369
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,882
I arrived early,
eager to spend time with my girl.

370
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:51,084
So, what are we drinking? Two vodka
martinis, and what's yours, Crocodile?

371
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,025
Yeah, I'll have two of those,
and a beer, thanks.

372
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,590
Could you send them through
to our table, ma'am?

373
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,064
- You have been here a while.
- Let's eat.

374
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,513
This'll be quite a novelty for you, eating
something without having to kill it first.

375
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:19,052
Shall we?
Ah, Roberto!

376
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:23,852
Good evening, Mr Mason, I can see
you've got some friends. Follow me.

377
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,956
Thank you.

378
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:43,035
I had almost forgotten
what a sexy-Iooking lady you are.

379
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:48,480
I'm gonna have to find a way
of keeping you in town.

380
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:57,284
- You two should really be alone.
- Sorry, it's been six weeks.

381
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,760
- That's all the more reason...
- It's your first night in New York.

382
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:06,891
- Richard and I want you with us.
- Right, absolutely.

383
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,631
New York is no place
for a... country gent.

384
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,775
Ain't no crocodiles out there, but a fast
movin' Chevy sure make a mess of you.

385
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,284
What's your game?

386
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,750
Great. I'm starving.

387
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:37,958
Grazie, Roberto.
E stato piacere un rivederti.

388
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,069
Bravissimo, lei parla
molto bene Italiano.

389
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,905
Thank you. Perhaps I should order
for all of us, all right?

390
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:51,771
I don't imagine that they have any...
kangaroo steak or possum crits!

391
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:56,476
Don't worry, Mick can make
a gourmet meal out of anything.

392
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,622
Even medium rare goanna.

393
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:04,089
It was great, wasn't it?
And what about the yams?

394
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,626
They were great.

395
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:10,630
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

396
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:17,035
So, as he's our guest, perhaps
he'd like to order for all of us.

397
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,335
Wait a minute, I'll do that.

398
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,412
No, it's all right. I'll have a lash.

399
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,577
- Italian, eh?
- Yes.

400
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:45,699
I dunno what you call it, but I like
the look of what that fat sheila's eating.

401
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,364
Richard!

402
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,536
He OK?

403
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,342
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

404
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,892
He said you hit him. You're not
in the pub in Walkabout Creek now.

405
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,829
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

406
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,131
- You're not serious about this lemon?
- Butt out, Dundee!

407
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:27,902
He had too much to drink.
Richard is warm, caring and I love him.

408
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,478
Excuse me.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

409
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,138
God!

410
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,366
- You want a hand?
- No, I can handle it.

411
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,302
I'm fine.

412
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:05,409
We've got a busy day tomorrow,
so get some sleep. I'll pick you up early.

413
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,072
- Goodnight.
- Night.

414
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,784
- Take me to the boozer.
- Boozer? Don't know that one.

415
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,030
Pub, somewhere to get a drink.
Want to join me?

416
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,466
- I just finished my shift, why not?
- Fancy a drink, do you?

417
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:33,507
You kiddin'? I'm Italian,
I'd drink you under the table any day.

418
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,841
That could be interesting.

419
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,586
I'm not putting down
your black widow spider.

420
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:53,286
But the funnel web spider can kill in
eight seconds, just by looking at you.

421
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,231
But the real danger down there is
the sharks, the big ones, like 'Jaws'.

422
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:06,103
I caught one 3 weeks ago, opened it,
you know what we found inside it?

423
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:10,076
Three Philippino fishermen...
still in their boat!

424
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,511
Buzzy! Come on over,
meet this guy from Australia!

425
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,586
Hey, my man, what's happening?

426
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,917
- Where?
- What's going down, bro?

427
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:25,222
Going down?
Just blowing the froth off a couple.

428
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,959
All right! Hang loose, my man!

429
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,327
- Flat out like a lizard drinking.
- Say what?

430
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,830
What?

431
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,443
- He's cool!
- Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

432
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,452
- All right!
- All right!

433
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,391
He's a nice fella.
Here's my little Italian mate Danny!

434
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,526
Just in time to buy another round.
What are you drinking, Gwendoline?

435
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:13,233
No more for me, thanks, Mick,
I must be getting on home.

436
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,207
Where's home, sweetie?

437
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:20,315
Just around the corner. I have a little
place where I live all by my Ionesome.

438
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:24,249
- Not now.
- Most of the time, that is.

439
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,821
Must get a bit Ionely?

440
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:31,427
- Hanker for a bit of male company?
- Do I ever.

441
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,095
Excuse me, Gwendoline.
Don't go away, love.

442
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:46,041
I've been trying to tell you all night,
that girl... she's a guy!

443
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,645
A man dressed up as a girl!

444
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,612
- Nah, nah...
- A fag, for Chrissakes!

445
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,517
I swear.

446
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,830
Hey! That was a guy!
A guy dressed up like a sheila!

447
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,739
Look at that! Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

448
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,688
- Where the hell did I leave the cab?
- Dunno.

449
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,124
You wait here
till I go look for it, Mick.

450
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,557
G'day, girls.
Mick Dundee from Australia.

451
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:15,030
- Lookin' for a good time, honey?
- Always lookin' for a good time.

452
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:25,396
Either of you ladies attached
or married or anything?

453
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,777
No, we're both single ladies.

454
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,511
This is Karla, I'm Simone.
Where you from, honey?

455
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,387
From Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

456
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,686
You probably don't know where that is.

457
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:51,027
Hey! I do. You're the guy
I've been reading about in the paper.

458
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,169
The crocodile man,
I've been reading about him.

459
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:59,832
He's like a regular Tarzan...
wrestles crocodiles, eats snakes...

460
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,876
Is this your first trip to New York?

461
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,118
- First trip anywhere.
- Well, hell!

462
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,415
We might just have
to give you one for free.

463
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,322
Yeah...

464
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,755
One what?

465
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:34,467
We could take in a movie
or go to a dance or...

466
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:39,980
Hey, girls, girls! Are we working tonight
or are we socialising?

467
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,379
Hey, pal!

468
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:46,613
I was just talking to the ladies,
and making a bit of progress.

469
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:51,021
Are you gonna talk all night
or are you gonna screw one of them?

470
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,033
Sorry, but if you stand around
out the front of a place like this,

471
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:06,903
you're gonna hear
that kind of bad language.

472
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,306
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

473
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:14,108
Danny, you're in no condition
to drive. Hop in, mate!

474
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,876
That's why you have
so many accidents here.

475
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,580
The steering wheel's
on the wrong side of the car!

476
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,463
Get out of the way, dopey!

477
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,406
Get on the right side of the road,
you pelican!

478
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,451
If I give my heart to you

479
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,358
Then I'll have none
And you'll have two

480
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,747
Senor Mick?

481
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,885
The towels for senor Mick.

482
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,492
Is that you, Rosita?

483
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,357
Leave the spare towels on the bed.

484
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,657
Mucho gracias, love!

485
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,628
Si, senor Mick.

486
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,976
Strewth!

487
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,316
Listen, Rosita...

488
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,156
I was only being friendly.
You know, I didn't mean...

489
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,126
Your towels, senor Mick.

490
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:21,034
For a minute there, room service
took on a whole new meaning.

491
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,638
One dog, please.

492
01:06:56,879 --> 01:07:01,282
With chilli, onions,
sauerkraut and some peppers.

493
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:10,081
- There you go.
- You eat that?

494
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:14,286
Well, you know, you can live on it.
But it tastes like shit!

495
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:45,992
My bag!

496
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,564
Thief! Thief!

497
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,074
Hey, Mick! How you doin', baby?

498
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,614
- It's me, Simone!
- Oh, yeah, Simone...

499
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,378
- Having a good time?
- As always.

500
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,485
Nice girl.

501
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,653
Thoughtful, too,
dancing with her father.

502
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,128
We're gonna have to overcome
this country boy shyness, Dundee.

503
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:01,328
There's someone I want you to meet.

504
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,572
Sue, darling, you're back,
how wonderful!

505
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:12,612
- Fran, how are you?
- Couldn't be better.

506
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,978
Tell me, who's the new man?

507
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,612
This is the man I'm writing about,
Mick Dundee.

508
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,757
Something the matter, darling?

509
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,253
Pleased to meet you.

510
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:34,096
- It's OK, he's Australian.
- Maybe I'd better go there someday.

511
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,800
Darling, I'm so glad you could come!
Excuse me.

512
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,508
Just making sure.

513
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,311
Right. I'll get us a drink.

514
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,992
It's good shit.

515
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:32,015
- What's up, pal? Got a blocked nose?
- Blocked nose, right.

516
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,884
- There's a better way of doing it.
- Better way?

517
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,350
Yep.

518
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:45,058
It's the way we do it back home.
It really fixes us up.

519
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:58,536
Now, boiling water...

520
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,942
Get the steam going...
Get your face right over that.

521
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,513
The old tea towel over your skull...

522
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,285
Put your head down onto that.
Breathe it in real deep.

523
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:15,693
Ten minutes of that,
you'll be clear as a bell, no worries.

524
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,290
Get into it.

525
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,307
Get into it!

526
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:37,775
You know, that was probably a couple
of hundred dollars worth of cocaine.

527
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:42,856
- What's that?
- It's a drug. You sniff it.

528
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,688
- What for?
- Well, to get a buzz.

529
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,267
What, like shovin' a blowfly
up your nose?

530
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:09,306
Got the photo, Mick! I look great!

531
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,278
Ida sends love.

532
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,515
Wait a minute, Donk wants
to have a word with you.

533
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,388
Mick! Get stuffed!

534
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,160
How are you getting on
with the New Yorkers?

535
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:29,032
Bonzer people.
Friendly, full of beans, but a bit weird.

536
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:34,335
That's the joys of travelling.
When are you coming home?

537
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,411
If you can manage,
I'd like to stay a while.

538
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,514
Oh, yeah! No troubles at all.

539
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:44,516
Wouldn't have anything to do
with a certain lady writer, would it?

540
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,850
To start with,
she's a better kisser than Donk.

541
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:53,688
You little beauty! Keep in touch.

542
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:56,626
No worries, Wal!

543
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,728
Come on, what did he say?

544
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:05,772
He wants to stay there a while longer,
wants me to take care of things here.

545
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:20,946
- You got a light, buddy?
- Yeah, sure, kid.

546
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,821
There you go.

547
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,118
And your wallet!

548
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,020
Mick, give him your wallet.

549
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,292
- What for?
- He's got a knife.

550
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,428
That's not a knife.

551
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,104
That's a knife.

552
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,144
Shit!

553
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,752
Just kids having fun. Are you all right?

554
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:00,258
I'm always all right
when I'm with you, Dundee.

555
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:03,023
God, that sounds corny!

556
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,190
Why do you always make me feel
like Jane in the Tarzan comic?

557
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,743
That's what we ran
while you were away.

558
01:15:56,919 --> 01:16:00,355
Sorry, I can't seem
to get my mind in gear.

559
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,058
Sue...

560
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:11,088
When you were away,
I did some thinking.

561
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,698
It's time I made some concrete plans.

562
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:19,739
Are you building a freeway or proposing
to the finest catch in New York State?

563
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,843
Hello, young lady.
Been reading your articles.

564
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:27,277
Seems you've been all over the world
enjoying yourself at our expense.

565
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:30,418
I'd like to think
you're getting your money's worth.

566
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,410
Hi, Dad.

567
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,387
You got a kiss for the old man?

568
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,855
Thank God you're home safe.

569
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:47,229
- Have you told Sue about Sunday?
- I was just about to.

570
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,064
You're coming to the house
for a welcome home dinner.

571
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:55,266
But now I want Richard to explain
how he runs this paper better than I do.

572
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:59,107
By all means, bring along
this Crocodile Dundee.

573
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,112
Him I've got to meet.

574
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:39,284
Thought you said
your dad sells newspapers.

575
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,820
He sells a lot of newspapers.

576
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,042
Thank you, Gus.

577
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,786
Oh, hell, the dogs are out.

578
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,222
Mick?

579
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:06,302
Nice to see you again, Miss.
Mr Mason.

580
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:11,071
Nice to see you looking so fit and well.
Simpson, Mr Dundee.

581
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,005
Nice to meet you, Simo.

582
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:20,214
- Call me Mick.
- Mick!

583
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:24,425
Your father's expecting you.
He's waiting in the lounge.

584
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:39,432
Excuse me.

585
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,870
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi, Dad.

586
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,639
- Richard!
- Sam, good to see you.

587
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,613
And this, of course, is Mr Dundee.

588
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,186
I believe I am deeply in your debt
for saving my daughter's life.

589
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,789
Buy me a cold beer
and we'll call it quits.

590
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,419
- Nice joint you got here.
- It keeps the rain off our heads.

591
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:06,897
Come, I want you to meet
some people. A drink for Mr Dundee.

592
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,837
- My Dawn.
- How are you?

593
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,203
Dorothy and Wendell Wainwright.
From Australia.

594
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:19,713
- Nice to meet you, Wendell.
- Mike, have a drink.

595
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,873
Are you involved in cattle,
Mr Dundee?

596
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,384
- Yeah, mostly buffaloes.
- Do you breed them?

597
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:30,924
- No, I just toss 'em.
- And how are you finding New York?

598
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:35,529
A bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?
That's why I love it, 'cause I fit right in.

599
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:41,925
If you'll excuse me, I'd like Mick
to say hello to Senator Manly.

600
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:45,470
- It was nice meeting you.
- See you later.

601
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,939
- Seems like a personable fellow.
- What a strange...

602
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:50,543
Nice people.

603
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:54,614
Dorothy's fine now,
but she used to be really uptight.

604
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:58,048
- What happened?
- She found a wonderful shrink.

605
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:00,952
Psychiatrist.

606
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,960
I shouldn't have made that crack
about the lunatic asylum.

607
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:12,323
- I didn't know she was nuts.
- Of course she's not nuts!

608
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,560
People go to a psychiatrist
to talk about their problems.

609
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,730
She just needed to unload them.
Bring them out in the open.

610
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,035
Hasn't she got any mates?

611
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,010
You're right. Guess we could
all use more mates.

612
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,378
Suppose you don't have any shrinks
at Walkabout Creek?

613
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,384
Back there, if you've got a problem,
you tell Wally.

614
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:36,752
He tells everyone in town, brings it out
in the open, no more problem.

615
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:41,627
- I didn't think you could make it!
- Wendell, wonderful to see you.

616
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,755
- I don't believe I know your daughter.
- Oh, stop it!

617
01:21:56,444 --> 01:22:00,005
Ladies and gentlemen! Friends!

618
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:02,411
Welcome home, Sue!

619
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:10,220
As you can see,
we're all glad to have you back.

620
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,792
Of course, no one more than I.

621
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:15,953
I guess everyone in this room...

622
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,658
...knows how this beautiful lady and I
feel about each other.

623
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,163
Sue's come back to us.

624
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,136
Delivered literally
out of the jaws of death

625
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,971
by our new-found friend,
Mr Michael J. Dundee.

626
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:34,214
A man to whom I am doubly indebted.

627
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,215
Not only did he bring back
to me the woman that I love,

628
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:41,287
but he increased
the paper's circulation in the process!

629
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,588
Sam said to me earlier,
"You're her editor!"

630
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:50,390
"Can't you stop her from taking
these dangerous assignments?"

631
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:55,298
Obviously I have not had much
success influencing her as her editor.

632
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,098
Perhaps I'll have more success
as her husband.

633
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:02,700
- If she'll have me.
- Oh, Richard!

634
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,735
- Congratulations.
- Couldn't be happier, Senator.

635
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,475
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

636
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,491
I'll get in the back, Gus.

637
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,741
To the hotel, Mick?

638
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:20,581
Yeah, by way of a liquor store.

639
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,192
For medicinal purposes.

640
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,363
Thanks, mate.

641
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:56,752
Hey! Take care now!

642
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,312
Hey, buddy!

643
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:26,677
- Get it into you, Pop.
- God bless you. You saved my life.

644
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,763
Hey, Simone!

645
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:49,803
- You want some action?
- Thought you were somebody else.

646
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:57,583
Well, if it ain't the man who don't like
bad fuckin' language in front of ladies.

647
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:02,189
What's the matter, Aussie boy?
You gonna hop away like a kangaroo?

648
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:25,604
I think it's time for a little tap dancing.

649
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,838
You OK, Mick?

650
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:03,746
Oh, yeah, Gus, no worries.
I was just getting on top of them.

651
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,164
You sure you're not Pintinjarra tribe?

652
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,959
No, man, Harlem Warlords!

653
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:23,831
I knew you were tribal.

654
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,074
Mick Dundee's room, please.

655
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,397
Sorry, he's still not answering.

656
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,592
He called down to say
he was checking out today.

657
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:58,398
- We're gonna miss him around here.
- Thanks.

658
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,608
Thank you, sir.

659
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,827
G'day, Irving, how are you?

660
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:24,226
- I wouldn't be dead for dollars.
- Close.

661
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,663
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

662
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,896
No, I thought I'd go Walkabout.

663
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,005
Wander around
and take a look at America.

664
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:38,677
- For how long?
- Long as it takes.

665
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:44,250
- What's the quickest way out of town?
- There's a subway two blocks that way.

666
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,856
- It'll take you to Grand Central Station.
- That'll do.

667
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:54,188
- Have a nice day, Oiving.
- No worries, mate.

668
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:24,482
Morning, Miss.

669
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,650
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

670
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:30,357
No, but it'll come to me.

671
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:34,433
If you're looking for Crocodile Mick,
he's gone Walkabout.

672
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:39,770
- You don't know where?
- He's headed for the subway.

673
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,704
You'd better hurry.

674
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,969
Mind this for me.

675
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:53,847
Oh, Christ!

676
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:16,828
Hey, lady, where you goin'?

677
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,871
If you want to play,
why don't you play with me?

678
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,140
Mick! Mick Dundee!

679
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,480
What's up, lady?

680
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:37,780
I got to talk to that man
down there in the black hat.

681
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:43,959
Hey!

682
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:50,631
The lady here wants to talk
to the guy in the black hat!

683
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,106
Hey, fella!

684
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,141
You in the hat!

685
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,712
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

686
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:04,411
What does she want?

687
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,986
- What does she want?
- What do you want?

688
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:12,585
Tell him not to leave.

689
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,320
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

690
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:22,134
Tell him, don't leave.
She's not gonna marry Richard!

691
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,696
Don't leave.
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

692
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:34,514
- Why not?
- I don't know. Why not?

693
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,875
Why not?

694
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:43,690
Tell him I love him. I love you!

695
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:48,194
I love you!

696
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:51,663
I love you! I love...

697
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,926
- She loves me.
- Well?

698
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,199
Tell her I...
I'll tell her myself, I'm coming through!

699
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:04,109
- He's coming through!
- He's coming through!

700
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:11,651
It's too crowded here,
we're jammed in like sheep.

701
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,878
Up, up, up...
