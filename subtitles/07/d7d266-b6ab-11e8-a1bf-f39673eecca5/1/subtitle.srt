MY MOTHER SAYS

5
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,830
IT'S NOT HEALTHY
TO EAT SO LATE.

6
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,500
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

7
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,130
I EAT ON THE CARD TABLE
IN MY ROOM WITH MY SISTER

8
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,030
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
CHILDREN ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
CALL YOU CHILDREN, OK?

12
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,360
SO LET'S START FINISHING UP.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,530
LET'S GATHER UP
OUR THINGS, BOYS.

OH, BILLY, WHAT A PERFECTLY
WONDERFUL PIG.

24
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,030
HOW COME?
THOSE ARE VERY STRONG COLORS.

25
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,160
I CAN'T DRAW ANY PEOPLE.

26
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,060
I BET YOU CAN.

27
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,660
I BET THEY'RE
JUST IN THEIR HOUSES

28

TILL THEY'RE READY
TO COME OUT.

29
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,200

IF TOMORROW I HELP YOU
BRING THEM OUT?

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,630
OK.
OK.

ALL RIGHT,
I WANT EVERYTHING PICKED UP.

33
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,660
LET ME SEE
WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,800
I MADE A PICTURE OF THE GUY
ON THE SKATEBOARD.

35
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,660
AND I MADE MY SKATER FALL DOWN
'CAUSE HE WAS SHOWING OFF

36
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,630
AND IT MADE THIS GUY MAD,
SO HE SOCKED HIM.

37
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,060
AND BUSTED HIS HEAD.

38
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,700
OH, HE DID NOT.

I DON'T WANT TO SEE
A PAPER TOWEL.

43

I DON'T WANT TO SEE
A GUM WRAPPER.

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,630
THERE ARE PLENTY OF
PAPER TOWELS FOR EVERYBODY

53
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,260
I SAID MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO LET 'EM BLOW OFF STEAM

54
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,530
BEFORE WE PUT 'EM
BACK ON THE BUS.

MAYBE A GAME
OF FOLLOW THE LEADER?

56
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,860
YES, FOLLOW THE LEADER.

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,430
THAT WOULD BE FINE.

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,030
I'M IN A HOSPITAL.
MMM-HMM.

176
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,300
I'VE CUT MY WRIST.

177
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,730
MMM-HMM.

178
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,260
AM I THROUGH? MAY I GO?

179
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,630
WELL, I'D LIKE TO FINISH
THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM.

180
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,360
WHY IS THERE
A NEUROLOGICAL EXAM?
I'VE CUT MY WRIST.

181
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
I THINK YOU HAVE
THE CHARTS MIXED UP.
IT'S, UH...

182
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,700
NO, IT JUST SEEMS

183
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,100
THAT WHEN
THE SURGICAL RESIDENT
WAS PATCHING YOU UP

184
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,360
HE THOUGHT
YOU SEEMED KIND OF CONFUSED,
SO HE CALLED ME IN.

185
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,030
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

186
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,660
AND I ASKED YOU
HOW I COULD HELP YOU,
AND YOU TOOK MY HAND.

187
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,460
YOU CAME RIGHT ON IN HERE.

188
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,430
DON'T YOU WANT TO STAY?

189
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,930
COME ON.
LET'S FINISH IT UP, OK?

190
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,560
HERE.

191
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,360
TELL ME WHAT YOU SMELL
IN THESE LITTLE BOTTLES.

192
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,500
CLOVES.

193
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,730
MMM-HMM.

194
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,400
I...

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,760
I KNOW I SHOULD
SMELL SOMETHING--

196
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,730
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T.
IT'S WATER.

197
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OH! DISINFECTANT.

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,830
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

199
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,030
WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU SMELL
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?

200
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
YES.

201
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,330
I'M SORRY.

202
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,330
YOU ASKED ME SOMETHING?

203
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,660
NO, YOU WERE JUST TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR SYMPTOMS.

204
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,930
YOUR, UH, TUNNEL VISION
AND YOUR BUMPING INTO WALLS
AND...

205
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,230
YES. YES, I KNOW.

206
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,730
SOMETIMES,
WHEN I'M HEADING FOR THE DOOR,
BY MISTAKE, UH...

207
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,860
WHAT IS IT?

208
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,760
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE?

209
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,930
YES.

210
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,330
NO!
WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH,

211
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,260
TELL ME WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

212
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

213
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,830
YES.

214
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I SAID,

215
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
"IS THIS YOUR OFFICE?"

216
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,430
THAT WAS A HALF AN HOUR AGO.
IT'S NIGHTTIME NOW.

217
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,800
I DIDN'T...

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,130
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

219
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,830
[sighing]

220
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,200
YES, YOU DID.

221
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
NOBODY KNOWS.

222
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,560
SOMEBODY KNOWS NOW.

223
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,300
ALL RIGHT?
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?

224
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,500
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE VOCABULARY TEST

225
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,760
OR SAYING
THE NUMBERS BACKWARDS
OR ANY OF THAT?

226
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,330
[sobbing]
NO, I DON'T. I DON'T.

227
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,800
NONE OF IT?
NO.

228
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,760
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR AN HOUR

229
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,900
OR A DAY OR A WEEK, DO YOU?

230
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
I DON'T THINK
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

231
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,730
HAS IT BEEN A DAY?
NO.

232
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,560
I--I CUT MY WRIST.

233
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,700
MMM-HMM.

234
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,830
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW.

235
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,230
AND THEN I WAS HERE,
TALKING TO YOU.

236
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,600
MMM-HMM.

237
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,400
HAVE I HURT SOMEBODY?

238
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,830
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING BAD?
NO.

239
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,800
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

240
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,200
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
LOST TIME LIKE THAT?

241
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,600
I'M SO AWFULLY
ASHAMED, DOCTOR.

242
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,300
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

243
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,300
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.

244
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,660
ALWAYS.

245
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,830
AND I USED TO THINK
THAT EVERYBODY WAS LIKE THIS.

246
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,560
THAT THEY WOULD
JUST NATURALLY WAKE UP
AND BE SOMEPLACE ELSE

247
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,500
OR A WHOLE LOT OLDER
OR WEARING ANOTHER DRESS.

248
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,160
ONCE, I WOKE UP,

249
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,300
AND I WAS 2 YEARS OLDER.

250
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,030
AND...

251
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,830
IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME
TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE.

252
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,200
I WANT VERY MUCH
TO BE A TEACHER.

253
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,830
I WANNA GIVE
SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY.

254
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,430
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

255
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,000
SURE.

256
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,060
I SUBSTITUTE TEACH

257
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,330
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GET
MY M.A. IN ART.

258
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
IT'S IN ART.

259
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
[sobbing]

260
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,360
IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN

261
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,860
BUT THINGS HAVE BEEN GETTING
A LOT WORSE LATELY.

262
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,760
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

263
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,560
I CAN'T STUDY.

264
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
AND THEN,

265
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,560
I WOKE UP,
AND I WAS IN THE WATER.

266
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,230
AND THE CHILDREN SAW ME.

267
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,230
SYBIL.

268
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,600
[gasping]

269
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,300
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH ME.
IT HURTS ME.

270
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,130
IT HURTS TO BE TOUCHED?

271
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,200
HERE, HAVE A CRYING TOWEL.

272
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
NO, THANK YOU.
I DON'T CRY TEARS LIKE PEOPLE.

273
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
YOU MUST HAVE
CRIED LIKE PEOPLE
ONCE UPON A TIME.

274
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,600
HERE. SYBIL, COME ON,
SIT DOWN.

275
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,960
YOU KNOW,

276
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,800
I THINK THE FEAR
THAT YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM

277
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
IS VERY, VERY DEEP.

278
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,360
AND I THINK
YOUR--YOUR SYMPTOMS,

279
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,030
YOUR--YOUR TUNNEL VISION
AND YOUR BLACKOUTS

280
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,400
ARE A RESULT OF THAT FEAR.

281
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,330
IT'S A KIND OF HYSTERIA.

282
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,500
YOU SEE?

283
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,260
YES.

284
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,760
YOU UNDERSTAND,
IF YOU ARE--ARE

285
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,030
TOO SCARED TO FACE SOMETHING,

286
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,230
THEN IT JUST MAKES
PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE
TO BLACKOUT

287
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,600
AND THEN YOU NEVER HAVE TO
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SCARED OF.

288
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,330
NOTHING SCARES ME.

289
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,100
LISTEN,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK
AND SEE ME AGAIN

290
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,160
ON, UM, THURSDAY?

291
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,600
UH, MY NAME IS DR. WILBUR
BY THE WAY.

292
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,460
IS IT EXPENSIVE?

293
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,060
NO, NOT IN THE CLINIC.

294
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,860
I THINK YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

295
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,830
I HAVE TO ASK MY FATHER.

296
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,230
HE'S HERE ON HIS HONEYMOON.

297
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,730
MY MOTHER DIED A WHILE BACK.
HE REMARRIED.

298
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,860
HAVE TO SHOW HIM
THE SIGHTS TOMORROW.

299
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,130
 (Sybil)
 IF YOU CAN CALL

300
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,230
 LUNCHING AT THE MUSEUM
 CAFETERIA THE SIGHTS.

301
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,130
WELL, I MUST SAY
THIS IS SURE
A DELIGHTFUL NOTION.

302
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,530
EATING BY A REAL ROMAN POOL
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NEW YORK CITY.

303
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,200
I BETTER NOT SAY
"ROMAN" OUT LOUD.

304
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,630
THE POPE MIGHT
JUMP OUT AND EAT DAD.

305
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,300
NOW, YOU QUIT THAT.

306
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,130
WELL,
WHAT'S THE NATIVE CUSTOM?

307
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,230
DO WE STACK OUR TRAYS
OR EAT RIGHT OFF 'EM?

308
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,660
WELL, I'M SETTING
MY PLACE PROPER.

309
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,460
WAIT, WILLARD,

310
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,030
TILL I SLIDE A NAPKIN
UNDER YOUR PLATE.

311
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
THERE, NOW,
ISN'T THAT MORE HOMEY?

312
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,460
HERE, YOU SEE
HOW SHE BABIES ME?

313
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,930
WELL, HE IS A BABY.

314
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,800
JUST A BIG, STRONG,
SWEET OLD BABY.

315
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,860
BUT HE'S JUST WHAT
THE DOCTOR ORDERED.

316
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,600
AREN'T YOU, LOVEY?

317
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,900
HOW DO YOU
LIKE CHICAGO, DAD?

318
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,960
OH, FINE.
UM, PLENTY TO DO.

319
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,430
OH, MY SPAGHETTI
LOOKS YUMMY.

320
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,600
NICE AND CRUSTY
AND TOMATOEY.

321
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,760
WHAT DID YOU TAKE, SYBIL?

322
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
JUST CHICKEN SALAD?

323
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,760
NO, IT'S TUNA.
OH.

324
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,030
THAT'S A PUNY KIND OF LUNCH
FOR A GROWING GIRL.

325
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,060
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SKIMP ON YOUR FOOD.

326
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,360
WELL, I STOPPED GROWING
A LONG TIME AGO, DAD.

327
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
IT'S FINE,
A GRACIOUS SUFFICIENCY.

328
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,930
THANK YOU.

329
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,300
WE, UH, THANK THEE LORD

330
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,800
FOR ALL THY BOUNTIFUL
BLESSINGS. AMEN.

331
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,100
AMEN.
AMEN.

332
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,060
BUT, OH, THE PRICES
OF EVERYTHING HERE.

333
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,930
I NEARLY DIE EVERY TIME
A WAITER BRINGS THE CHECK.

334
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,160
(Willard)
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR LOOKING, HUH?

335
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,630
(Frieda)
OF COURSE, THINGS
ARE DEAR IN CHICAGO, TOO.

336
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,800
IT'S HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
HMM.

337
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,530
WHEN WE LIVED
IN WILLOW CORNERS,

338
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,500
YOU COULD EAT
A MEAL LIKE THIS.

339
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,760
OH, I USED TO GET
YOUR MOTHER TO...

340
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,060
GOD REST HER SOUL.

341
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,230
TO GO DOWN TO
THE GREEN--GREEN COMET CAFE

342
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,660
AND ORDERED
A WHOLE COVERED DINNER
ON A SABBATH

343
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,430
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COOK.
YES.

344
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,560
AND WHY,
WHAT WITH THE ROASTED CHICKEN

345
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,100
AND YELLOW GRAVY
AND THE FIXINGS
IT DIDN'T COME TO $1.50.

346
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,830
DAD,

347
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,100
I--I HAVE AN ILLNESS.

348
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,060
IT'S WHAT YOU AND MOTHER
CALLED MY MOODINESS.

349
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,060
AND IT'S GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE.

350
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,460
IT WILL BE
THE END OF EVERYTHING

351
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,300
UNLESS I CAN DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

352
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,530
I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU
IN ON THIS, FRIEDA,

353
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,700
BUT YOU'RE NOT BLOOD FAMILY

354
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,400
AND I DON'T SEEM
TO BE ABLE TO GET DAD ALONE.

355
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,460
WELL, UH, I FEEL LIKE FAMILY.

356
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,630
GOODNESS.

357
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,700
DAD, THERE'S A LADY,

358
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,600
A DOCTOR,

359
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,900
AND I-- I'VE TALKED TO HER.

360
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,730
SHE CAN HELP ME
IN THE PURSUIT OF ME

361
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,100
AND SHE THINKS THAT
THAT'S A USEFUL PURSUIT.

362
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,930
WILLARD, YOU SAID YOURSELF

363
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,560
WE HAVE A PERFECTLY
GOOD SPARE ROOM

364
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,360
AND ALL HER THINGS WOULD FIT
IN THERE JUST PERFECT.

365
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,860
NOTHING WILL FIT PERFECT
ANYWHERE UNTIL I FIT PERFECT.

366
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,700
I'M SORRY.

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,130
I'M GOING TO THE RESTROOM.

368
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,000
I DON'T WANT IT SAID
THAT I INFLUENCED ANYTHING.

369
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,460
BETWEEN A ROCK
AND A HARD PLACE, SYBIL.

370
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,930
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW THE CHURCH VIEWS

371
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,500
THE PRACTITIONERS
OF THE MIND.

372
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
I'M VERY FRUGAL.

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,400
IF I GIVE UP
MY LUXURIES, TELEVISION,

374
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,260
AND I DON'T READ AFTER SUNSET

375
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,460
AND I-- AND I USE
THE STOVE ONLY OCCASIONALLY
TO COOK 3 DAYS AT A TIME,

376
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,400
I COULD-- I COULD GET BY
ON WHAT YOU SEND ME.

377
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,730
THE DEVIL HATH POWER
TO ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE.

378
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,130
SHE'S NOT THE DEVIL, DAD.
NOW, I--I KNOW THAT.

379
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,700
I DON'T KNOW THAT ABOUT ANYONE

380
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,230
EXCEPT THE PEOPLE
IN OUR OWN CONGREGATION.

381
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,660
SHE'S A REPUTABLE DOCTOR.

382
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,930
FIRST THING
YOU KNOW IT'S DRUGS,

383
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,900
THEN A HOSPITAL
FULL OF LOST SOULS.

384
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,200
THAT'S THE WAY
THEY BEGIN IT, SYBIL.
OH, LORD,

385
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
I THINK I'M TRAPPED.

386
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,430
THE FINAL PREPARATION
FOR THE HOLOCAUST.

387
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,930
IT'S ARMAGEDDON, SYBIL.

388
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,830
[groaning]
"AND IT SHALL RISE UP
IN THE EAST

389
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,100
AND THE RIVERS
SHALL FLOW AS BLOOD."

390
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,130
[grunting]

391
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,060
SYBIL!

392
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,060
I'M SORRY. OH, DAD,

393
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,760
I'M--I'M SORRY.

394
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,030
I CAN PAY FOR IT. IT--IT--IT
SURELY IS--IS ABOUT $2.

395
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,760
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

396
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,330
[groaning]

397
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,930
[Sybil groaning]

398
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,630
(Willard)
SYBIL. SYBIL.

399
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,400
SYBIL! SYBIL!

400
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,900
SYBIL!

401
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,030
 [voices chattering]

402
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,260
[clock ticking]

403
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,430
 [voices continue chattering]

404
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,730
 [voices chattering]

405
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,900
[sobbing]

406
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,560
[children shouting]

407
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
NOW, TELL ME WHEN YOU SEE
MY FINGERS WIGGLE.

408
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,900
THE DEVIL HATH POWER
TO ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE.

409
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,760
[children shouting]

410
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,860
I'VE CUT MY WRIST.

411
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,930
YOU KNOW HOW OUR CHURCH FEELS

412
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,160
ABOUT THE PRACTITIONERS
OF THE MIND.

413
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,130
[children shouting]

414
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,430
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MY WHITE COAT BOTHER YOU?

415
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,830
[sobbing]
ALWAYS. ALWAYS.
I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

416
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,830
FIRST THING
YOU KNOW IT'S DRUGS,

417
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,260
THEN A HOSPITAL
FULL OF LOST SOULS.

418
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,160
[children shouting]

419
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,130
[groaning]

420
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,960
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST DISINFECTANT.

421
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,560
THE FINAL PREPARATION
FOR THE HOLOCAUST,

422
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,030
THE ARMAGEDDON, SYBIL.

423
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,700
[sobbing]
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

424
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,400
THAT PEOPLE WOULD JUST
NATURALLY BE SOMEPLACE ELSE

425
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,560
OR WEARING ANOTHER DRESS
OR BE A WHOLE LOT OLDER,

426
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,360
LIKE WHEN I WAS
IN THE 3RD GRADE
AND MY GRANDMOTHER DIED

427
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,400
AND--AND I WASN'T ANYPLACE
FOR 2 YEARS.

428
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,830
I JUST WASN'T ANYPLACE,
NOT ANYPLACE AT ALL.

429
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,830
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK
AND SEE ME ON THURSDAY?

430
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,600
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH--

431
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,360
[telephone ringing]

432
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,400
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT IT.

433
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,600
YEAH.

434
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,330
WHO?

435
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,660
VICKY WHO?

436
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,200
IT BETTER BE AN EMERGENCY
FOR "JUST VICKY"
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

437
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,200
OK, PUT HER ON.

438
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,960
 (Sybil as Vicky)
 DR. WILBUR?

439
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,730
YEAH.

440
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,260
 THAT WINDOW IS BEGINNING
 TO LOOK AWFULLY GOOD TO SYBIL.

441
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,430
WHAT WINDOW? WHO ARE YOU?

442
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,830
 I'M SYBIL'S FRIEND.

443
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,860
 IT'S VERY HIGH, DR. WILBUR.

444
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,400
 IT'S UP 4 FLOORS.

445
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,630
 YOU'D BETTER COME QUICK
 TO THE STATON HOTEL--

446
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,900
HOLD ON A SECOND.
HOLD ON, OK?

447
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,160
 STATON HOTEL--

448
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,300
HOLD ON. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON. YEAH.

449
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,660
 ALL RIGHT,
 IT'S THE STATON HOTEL,

450
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,360
 136 WEST 125TH STREET.

451
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,100
 OPPOSITE THE ROSLYN.

452
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,130
OK.

453
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,060
WHAT IS SHE DOING IN HARLEM?

454
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,530
[cars honking]

455
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,230
[door rattling]

456
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,060
(Dr. Wilbur)
VICKY?

457
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,860
(as Marcia)
LEAVE ME ALONE.

458
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,600
VICKY, LET ME IN.
IT'S DR. WILBUR.

459
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,860
THANK YOU.

460
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,730
SYBIL?

461
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,130
[gasping]

462
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,900
(Sybil)
OH, NO.

463
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,560
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS
IN FRONT OF YOU AGAIN.

464
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,230
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

465
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,530
LISTEN, WOULD YOU
JUST WAIT DOWNSTAIRS, OK?

466
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,960
[window closing]

467
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,700
WHERE IS THIS?

468
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,930
HAVE I MISSED THURSDAY?
DID I MISS THURSDAY?

469
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,730
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

470
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,460
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND VICKY?

471
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,360
I DON'T HAVE A FRIEND VICKY.

472
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,030
SHE HAS A FRIEND SYBIL.

473
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,600
WHAT KICKED IT OFF THIS TIME?

474
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,500
I LOST MY JOB.

475
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,800
AND I--I TRIED TO ASK...

476
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,230
MY... MY...

477
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,630
YEAH? YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER
ABOUT SEEING ME.

478
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,630
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

479
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,830
SYBIL?

480
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,430
[sobbing]

481
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,730
(as Peggy)
THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE.
THE PEOPLE.

482
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,430
THE PEOPLE,
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

483
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,630
THERE, THERE, THERE.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

484
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,560
NO, YOU KEEP THEM
AWAY FROM ME.

485
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,530
I WILL, I WILL,
I WILL DO IT. I WILL DO IT.

HE DOESN'T CARE.
HE DOESN'T CARE.

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,100
I HATE SYBIL. I HATE HER.

489
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,300
WHO ARE YOU?

490
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,530
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

491
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,360
I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO.

492
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,760
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

493
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,330
I CAN WALK ON THE FURNITURE
IF I TAKE MY SHOES OFF

00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,530
LIKE THAT AND LIKE THAT
AND LIKE THAT.

495

AND I CAN WALK ON THE CHAIR
LIKE THAT AND LIKE THAT
AND LIKE THAT.

496
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,430
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
I PROMISE YOU, SYBIL,
I WOULDN'T STOP YOU.

497
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,530
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
I WON'T STOP YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

[sobbing]
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

499
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,360
IT HURTS ME!

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,530
WHAT HURTS? WHAT HURTS YOU?
WHERE DOES IT HURT?

501
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,130
I HAVE TO GET OUT.
I HAVE TO GET OUT.

502
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,330
NO, WAIT!

503
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,930
I HAVE TO BREAK THE GLASS.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

504
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,530
NO, WE DON'T--DON'T
BREAK GLASS.

505
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,500
YOU WON'T LET ME OUT,
AND YOU WON'T LET ME
HAVE ANY PEACE

506
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
AND YOU LEAVE ME ALONE
AND IT HURTS,

507
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,230
AND YOU DON'T
LEAVE ME ALONE, IT HURTS.

508
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,630
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
WHO AM I?

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,400
WHO HURT YOU?
OH, PLEASE, I HAVE TO GET OUT.
GET OUT.

510
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,360
I HAVE TO GET OUT.
WE'LL JUST GO DOWNSTAIRS,
WE'LL GET IN THE TAXI

511
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,030
AND THEN YOU'LL BE OUT,
ALL RIGHT?
NO, NO, NO, SHE'S THERE.

512
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,660
WHEN SHE'S THERE,
THE PEOPLE ARE THERE.

513
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,700
WHO'S THERE? WHO IS THERE?
THE PEOPLE.
I DON'T WANNA SEE THEM.

WHERE IS SYBIL? TELL ME.
I HAVE TO GET OUT.

517
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,960
I HAVE TO FEEL THE GLASS.

518
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,560
I HAVE TO FEEL THE GLASS.
NO, NO. NO,

519
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,930
[sobbing]
NO. NO, NO.

520
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,300
I HAVE TO FEEL THE--
DON'T BREAK IT.

521
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,530
I SEE THE KNOB.

522
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,800
I SEE THE KNOB
ON THE WHITE HOUSE.

523
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,830
ON THE WHITE HOUSE,
I SEE THE KNOB.

524
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,530
AND THE SHADES
ARE PULLED DOWN.

525
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,130
I LIVE RIGHT THERE.
I LIVE RIGHT THERE.

526
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,800
RIGHT THERE.
201 WEST 4TH STREET.

527
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,600
WILLOW CORNERS, WISCONSIN.

528
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,360
I LIVE RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE.

529
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,300
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 THAT'S HARLEM.

530
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,430
 (Sybil as Peggy)
 I DON'T KNOW
 WHERE THE OTHER GLASS IS.

531
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,430
 [sobbing]
 IT'S IN DR. QUINONESS'
 INSTRUMENT CASE,

532
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,330
 AND IT'S ALL WHITE
 AND SHINY KNIVES.

533
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,800
 AND MY MOMMA SAYS,
 "I WILL TAKE YOU

534
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,500
 "TO PLAY WITH MONICA
 AND CHERYL

535
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,260
 "BECAUSE YOU LIKE MONICA
 AND CHERYL."

536
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,000
 AND MY GRANDMA SAYS...
 MY GRANDMA SAYS...

537
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,300
 MY GRANDMA SAYS,
 "YOU--YOU GO
 LIKE MOMMA SAYS."

538
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,100
 MY GRANDMA'S GOOD.
 SHE'S GOOD.

539
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,560
 SHE LOVES ME.
 SHE LOVES ME.

540
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,760
 I'M AFRAID! I'M AFRAID!

541
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,060
 [gasping]

542
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,430
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 THERE'S NOTHING
 TO BE AFRAID OF HERE.

543
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,000
 (Sybil as Peggy)
 THEY NEVER FORGET ANYTHING,

544
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,300
 AND THEY LISTEN
 TO EVERY SOUND.

545
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
AND THEY'RE EVERYWHERE,
AND THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

546
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,830
THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM
AND THAT ROOM

547
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,630
AND EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,
AND EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,

548
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,760
WHO?
AND EVERYWHERE--

549
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,730
THE PEOPLE.
THE PEOPLE. NO! NO!

550
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,200
NO, DON'T MAKE ME GO THERE.

551
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,900
[shushing]
I DON'T WANNA GO
UP THERE, PLEASE.

552
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,360
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GO UP THERE.

553
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,400
[sobbing]
I WON'T GO UP THERE. PLEASE.

554
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,700
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GO UP THERE.

555
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,230
GO WHERE? GO WHERE?
PLEASE.

556
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,200
IT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW.
PLEASE.

557
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
IT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

558
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,860
(Hattie)
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

559
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,800
OH, LOOK, WHO ELSE GOT HERE.

560
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,660
DADDY'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS,
WON'T YOU, DADDY?

561
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,460
WHERE'S CHERYL AND MONICA?
THEY'LL BE HERE LATER, SYBIL.

562
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,300
YOUR MOMMY'LL BRING YOU
SOME ICE CREAM,
WON'T YOU, MOMMY?

563
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,200
(Dr. Quinoness)
YOU'RE JUST GOING UPSTAIRS
FOR A LITTLE NAP.

564
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,300
WHAT KIND DO YOU LIKE?
YOU CAN HAVE
ANY KIND YOU LIKE.

565
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,700
NOW, HUSH NOW.
DOUBLE, DOUBLE.

566
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,400
EASY DOES IT. DOUBLE DIP.
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

567
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,660
COME ALONG.

568
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,960
(Sybil)
NO!

569
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,560
NO!

570
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,430
NO! NO!

571
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,060
NO!

572
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,160
NO!

573
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,730
NOW, NOW, BIG BREATH,

574
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,200
BIG DEEP BREATH.
NO!

575
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,930
NOW, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
IF YOU'RE GONNA TO FIGHT ME.

576
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,800
NO!

577
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,400
[gasping]

578
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,500
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 ALL RIGHT,
 THERE'S PLENTY OF AIR.

579
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,160
 NOW, THERE JUST SEEMED
 TO BE NO AIR

580
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,460
BECAUSE YOU WERE BREATHING
AIR MIXED WITH ETHER.

581
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,300
(as Peggy)
THEY HAVE TO USE 2 CANS OF
ETHER TO TAKE HER TONSILS OUT

582
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,360
BECAUSE SHE'S A REAL
STRONG LITTLE GIRL.

583
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,830
RIGHT, RIGHT,
AND A MAD LITTLE GIRL, TOO.

584
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,600
THEY LIED TO YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

585
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,860
YEAH, THEY GOT YOU THERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

586
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,130
[sobbing]

587
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,830
THEY'RE GONNA KILL HER.

588
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,560
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.

589
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,430
NO, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO KILL YOU.

590
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,030
AND WHY DO YOU KEEP
REFERRING TO YOURSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON, HMM?

591
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,360
BECAUSE SHE'S SYBIL.

592
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,100
[sobbing]
BUT MY THROAT HURTS, TOO.

593
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,200
AND WHO ARE YOU, SWEETIE?

594
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
WILL YOU TELL
DR. WILBUR NOW?

595
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,700
DR. WILBUR'S TOO FAR AWAY.

596
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,260
NO, NO.
DR. WILBUR'S RIGHT HERE.

597
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,430
DR. WILBUR JUST SEEMED
VERY FAR AWAY

598
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,330
BECAUSE ALL GOOD
AND SAFE THINGS

599
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,060
MUST HAVE SEEMED
VERY, VERY FAR AWAY.

600
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,260
DR. WILBUR, A WHITE COAT?

601
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,200
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT I'M NOT WEARING IT NOW.

602
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,730
[sobbing]

603
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,460
HI. EVERYTHING'S OK NOW.

604
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,930
YOU JUST TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP, OK?

605
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,460
I WANNA BE YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

606
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,460
PLEASE, TAKE ME TO YOUR HOUSE.

607
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,900
OH, HONEY,
YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

608
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,530
THEY'D MISS YOU.

609
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,900
JUST TRY
AND GET SOME SLEEP, OK?

610
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,830
YOU TAKE ME, PLEASE.

611
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:08,600
HONEY. HONEY, PLEASE,
JUST--JUST TRY TO SLEEP, OK?

612
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,700
HELLO.
HERE'S YOUR MOMMY, SYBIL.

613
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,900
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW.
HELLO.

614
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,200
HOW'S MY LITTLE GIRL?

615
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,860
LOOK WHAT I BROUGHT YOU,
SYBIL.

616
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,800
SYBIL?

617
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,560
SYBIL.

618
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,100
SYBIL.

619
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,300
(Hattie)
DON'T YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME.

620
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,200
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

621
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,630
SYBIL. SYBIL.

622
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,500
[groaning]

623
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,130
YOU'RE...
NO CUTS. NO BRUISES.

624
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,960
I BUSTED IT ALL TO PIECES.
YOU'RE ALL IN ONE PIECE.

625
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,730
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S EASIER
TO FIX WINDOWS

626
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,300
THAN LITTLE GIRLS.

627
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,500
(as Peggy)
LITTLE GIRLS ARE MORE
IMPORTANT THAN WINDOWS?

628
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
THIS LITTLE GIRL
CERTAINLY IS. SURE.

629
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,500
I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

630
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,330
IT'S ABOUT SYBIL.

631
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,700
SHE PUTS GUCK
ALL OVER HER HAIR

632
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,460
'CAUSE SHE HAS GRAY HAIR.

633
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,200
[laughing]

634
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,060
I DON'T. I'M NATURAL.

635
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,430
YOU LIKE THE WAY I LOOK?

636
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,530
I HAVE A REAL PRETTY FACE.

637
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,330
SEE ME IN THE MIRROR?
AND A LITTLE NOSE

638
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,960
AND ALL MY FRECKLES
AND MY BANGS.

639
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,300
I'M ONLY 9.

640
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,130
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

641
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,760
YES, I BELIEVE YOU.

642
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,360
MY NAME'S PEGGY,

643
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,300
AND YOU'RE MY DR. WILBUR.

644
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
 (Dr. Lazarus)
 TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.

645
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,100
 YOU THINK SHE'S REALLY
 A MULTIPLE PERSONALITY?

646
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,460
ERNA, I KNOW SHE IS.

647
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,200
I'VE--I'VE MET
ONE ALTERNATE, I KNOW.

648
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,400
AND I'VE TALKED TO
ANOTHER ONE ON THE TELEPHONE.

649
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,830
SUCH A COMPLIMENT
THAT THEY SHOULD REVEAL
THEMSELVES SO QUICKLY.

650
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,900
ERNA, THE--THE WAKING SELF,

651
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,260
THE SYBIL PART,

652
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,160
IS VERY REPRESSED
AND--AND--AND VERY TROUBLED.

653
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,260
A GRIM--GRIM PERSON,

654
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,400
BUT THE--THE OTHER ONE,

655
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,930
THE--THE LITTLE PEGGY,
IS JUST ENCHANTING.

656
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,160
SHE'S--SHE'S, UH,

657
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,100
SHE'S JUST ADRIFT IN TIME.

658
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,900
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT SHE'S IN NEW YORK

659
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,830
AND SHE'S--SHE'S ABSOLUTELY
FULL OF MISCONCEPTIONS
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

660
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,300
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO TREAT HER?

661
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,430
PSYCHOANALYSIS.

662
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,500
WHICH ONE?

663
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,630
ALL 3.

664
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,200
THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED.

665
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,860
WHY ARE YOU
THE BIG PIONEER?

666
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,930
WELL, WHY DID YOU
TEACH ME TO BE?

667
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,160
[both laughing]

668
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,600
BE CAREFUL.

669
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,500
CONNIE, BE CAREFUL.

670
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,130
DON'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH HER ILLNESS.

671
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,660
OR SHE COULD BE OBLIGATED

672
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,800
TO SEEM JUST MORE COMPLEX
THAN SHE IS

673
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,500
JUST TO KEEP YOUR APPROVAL.

674
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,830
YOU KNOW,
THEY ARE NOT LITTLE GIRLS.

675
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,900
THEY'RE DEFENSES
THAT BELONG TO SOMEBODY ELSE,

676
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,060
PIECES, FRAGMENTS,
ONLY ILLUSIONS.

677
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,900
AND THEY ARE ACTING OUT
A DRAMA

678
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,460
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

679
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,100
WELL, I KNOW THAT.

680
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,600
SO YOU MUSTN'T ACT OUT ONE
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THEM.

681
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,900
OH, FOR INSTANCE?

682
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,660
FOR INSTANCE,

683
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,600
YOU ARE NOT THEIR MOTHER.

684
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,760
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 IT WASN'T EASY TO HEED
 MY FRIEND'S WARNING.

685
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,760
 EVERY TIME PEGGY
 LEAVES MY OFFICE
 TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE CITY,

686
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,960
 I HAVE THE MOST AWFUL URGE
 TO CALL HER BACK

687
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,100
 BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NEW YORK
 DOESN'T EXIST FOR HER.

688
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,130
 SHE LIVES
 IN THE SMALL MIDWESTERN TOWN
 OF HER MEMORY 20 YEARS AGO

689
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,860
 WHERE THERE WEREN'T
 ANY TAXIS OR BUSES
 OR STRANGERS TO HARM HER.

690
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,700
 AND WHENEVER
 THE CITY SWALLOWS HER UP,

691
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,000
 I WONDER IF I'LL EVER
 SEE HER AGAIN

692
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,700
 UNTIL, BY SOME MIRACLE,
 SHE OR SYBIL
 APPEAR ON MY DOORSTEP.

693
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,760
 I WONDER WHAT SHE DOES
 AND HOW SHE LIVES

694
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,100
 OR WHO SHE SEES.

695
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,560
(Richard)
* HUSH-A-BYE *

696
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,630
* DON'T YOU CRY *

697
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,330
* GO TO SLEEP-Y *

698
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,700
* LITTLE BABY *

699
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,060
* WHEN YOU WAKE *

700
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,730
* YOU WILL HAVE *

701
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,360
* ALL THE PRETTY
LITTLE PONIES *

702
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,900
* BLACKS AND BAYS *

703
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,100
* DAPPLES AND GRAYS *

704
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,560
* COACH *

705
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,730
* AND 6 A-LITTLE HORSES *

706
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,500
* HUSH-A-BYE *

707
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,360
* DON'T YOU CRY *

708
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,530
* GO TO SLEEP-Y *

709
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,030
* LITTLE BABY **

711
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,660
[snorting]

712
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
HEY, SYBIL DORSETT!

713
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,930
WANNA PET MY HORSE?

714
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,460
COME ON, MA'AM.
NOW, HAVE NO FEAR
OR TREPIDATION.

715
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,200
WE'VE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES,
HIM AND ME,

716
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,360
SINCE WE WERE
THE FINEST ROPING TEAM
IN ALL THE WEST

717
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,960
AND IT KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
THE DOG-FOOD FACTORY

718
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,630
UNLESS SOME KIND SOUL
BELIEVES IN US ENOUGH
TO TAKE A RIDE.

719
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,860
HOW ABOUT YOU?

720
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,360
WOULD YOU TAKE
YOUR HAT OFF FOR A SECOND?

721
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,030
THINK YOU'VE SEEN ME
IN THE PICTURES?

722
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,930
OH.

723
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,930
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID THIS.

724
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,360
I KNEW YOU DID THAT.

725
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,560
WHAT?

726
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,260
PAINT. THAT'S AN ART BOOK,
ISN'T IT?

727
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,100
"TURNER." YEAH, I KNEW
YOU WERE AN ARTIST.

728
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,200
I'VE SEEN YOU PAINTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

729
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,860
I DON'T DO THAT.
I HAVEN'T PAINTED
IN A LONG TIME.

730
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,630
YEAH, YOU DO. I WATCH YOU.

731
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,000
FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW,
RIGHT ACROSS OUR BACKYARDS.

732
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,860
EACH WINDOW A STAGE
IN THIS THEATER OF THE ABSURD

733
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,960
WHICH WE CALL LIFE.

734
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,530
YOU NEVER HAVE COMPANY.

735
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,400
YOU EAT BY YOURSELF.

736
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,630
YOU STILL PLAY WITH DOLLS.

737
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,860
AND YOU WATCH ME, TOO.

738
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,030
I'VE SEEN YOU OVER THERE
WITH THE LIGHTS OUT

739
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,060
SEETHING WITH PASSION
ON THOSE HOT SUMMER NIGHTS.

740
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,500
I DON'T HAPPEN
TO BE SEETHING WITH ANYTHING.

741
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,530
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
MY ELECTRICAL BILL DOWN.

742
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,730
I HAVE TO GO.

743
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,730
WELL, WAIT.
WHY?

744
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,400
SAY, "W-A-T-E-R,"
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE YOU COME FROM.

745
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,930
DO I HAVE TO?

746
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,700
YOU WANT YOUR BOOK BACK?

747
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,000
[sighing]

748
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,560
WATER.

749
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,260
ILLINOIS. IOWA.

750
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,760
IT'S WISCONSIN.
I--I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

751
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,760
OH, COME ON, SYBIL.
GET IN, I'LL GIVE YOU
A FREE RIDE.

752
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,400
OH, EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY.

753
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,630
WELL.

754
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,760
WELL, THAT'S THE 2ND TIME
YOU'VE SAID IT,

755
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,130
SO I GUESS
YOU WANT ME TO ASK.

756
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,500
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

757
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,360
MY LITTLE BOY MATTHEW
IS IN LOVE WITH YOU,

758
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,860
AND HE WANTED
TO WRITE YOU A LETTER.

759
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,230
SO I WALKED AROUND THE CORNER,

760
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,760
LOOKED AT ALL THE NAMES
ON THE BELLS

761
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,460
AND YOU'RE
THE ONLY SINGLE ON 5.

762
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,260
I NEVER GOT A LETTER.

763
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,800
NO, WE NEVER SENT IT.

764
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,000
WE BOTH FORGOT
HE HASN'T LEARNED TO WRITE.

765
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,300
[chuckling]

766
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,530
LOOK, I GOT
AN ITALIAN SAUSAGE SANDWICH.

767
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,660
IT'S REALLY TOO BIG FOR ME,
AND HE WON'T EVEN TOUCH IT.

768
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,700
WHO ARE YOU?

769
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,900
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE

770
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,630
BUT IT'S CALLED
RICHARD J. LOOMIS.

771
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,830
AND JUST LIKE MY HORSE HERE,
I CANNOT INFLICT HARM.

772
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,160
OH.

773
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,560
[speaking in French]

774
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,000
HEY, YOU'RE A LINGUIST.

775
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,500
I ONLY KNOW PIG LATIN.

776
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,760
[sighing]
YES, I WAS BILINGUAL
AS A CHILD. FRENCH.

777
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,730
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER,
AND I'M SORRY TO SAY
IT'S ALL WRONG.

778
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,660
RAISED IN PARIS.
COME ON, PONY.

779
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,030
PARIS? OOH-LA-LA!

780
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,660
YES.

781
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,860
 C'EST BIEN.

782
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,560
WE PLAYED HOPSCOTCH
IN THE  BOIS.

783
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,330
WE HAD CAFE AU LAIT
FOR BREAKFAST

784
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,930
AND PORRIDGE,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

785
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,530
OF COURSE, WE HAD
AN ENGLISH NANNY.

786
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,860
YEAH?
YES.

787
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,030
DID SHE SAY,  "BOIS," TOO?

788
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,660
YOU GOT ME THERE.

789
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,930
HELLO...

790
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,300
[speaking in French]

791
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,460
OH, OH, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

792
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,060
OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE.

793
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,300
I'M VICKY.
VICTORIA, SYBIL'S FRIEND.

794
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,700
VICTORIA ANTOINETTE SCHARLEAU.

795
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,060
 ALLO. ALLO.
HELLO.

796
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,730
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

797
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,160
 ALLO A VOUS, TOO.

798
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,660
WELL.

799
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,260
WELL, COME.
COME, RIGHT IN.

800
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,800
 MERCI. MERCI.

801
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,800
OH!

802
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,430
 QUEL JOLI BUREAU!

803
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,730
OH, THANK YOU.

804
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,800
UM...

805
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,530
 ASSEYEZ-VOUS.

806
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,300
 OU? SUR THIS COUCH

807
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,160
 OU SUR THAT COUCH?

808
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,930
 COMME VOUS VOULEZ.

809
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,330
 JE CHOOSE THIS COUCH.

810
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,600
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR NOT REMEMBERING.

811
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,030
IT WAS MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO
SINCE I CALLED YOU

812
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,260
FROM THAT DREARY
LITTLE HARLEM HOTEL.

813
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,730
MMM-HMM.

814
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,260
WELL, TELL ME, UM,

815
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,500
WHERE'S SYBIL?

816
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,200
SYBIL IS A BIT EMBARRASSED

817
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,860
ABOUT THE FINANCIAL
ARRANGEMENTS.

818
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,360
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HER
IN YOUR PRACTICE  PRIVEE,

819
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,360
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW SHE WILL EVER REPAY YOU.

820
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
SHE'LL REPAY ME
WHEN SHE GETS
HERSELF TOGETHER

821
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,500
[laughs]

822
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,400
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE THE PUN.

823
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,830
[both chuckling]

824
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,730
YES?

825
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,500
DR. WILBUR,
MMM-HMM.

826
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,430
PEGGY IS VERY WORRIED.

827
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,230
SHE THINKS THAT PERHAPS
YOU THINK
SHE WANTS TO HURT YOU

828
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,730
BECAUSE SHE BREAKS
THE WINDOWS.

829
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,200
(Dr. Wilbur)
WELL, I DON'T.

830
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
NO, SHE WOULDN'T HURT ANYONE.

831
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,400
SHE'D BEEN SO HURT HERSELF.

832
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,730
I WOULDN'T HURT ANYONE EITHER,
NOT BY WORD NOR DEED.

833
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,130
I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO HURT
SOMEONE'S FEELINGS.

834
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,800
DO YOU KNOW?

835
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,830
IF SOMEONE CALLS ME SYBIL
BY MISTAKE,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?

836
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,630
I LOOK IN THEIR FACE
AND I SAY, "YES. YES."

837
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:27,230
OR,  "OUI. OUI.
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO ME?"

838
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,400
BECAUSE IT HURTS
TO BE EMBARRASSED,
DO YOU KNOW?

839
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,530
MMM-HMM.

840
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,400
[sighing]

841
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,260
SYBIL IS SUCH
A LAMENTABLE CREATURE.

842
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,700
(Dr. Wilbur)
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

843
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,530
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

844
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,200
SHE STARTS TO PAINT,
SHE CAN'T PAINT.

845
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,960
SHE WANTS TO PLAY THE PIANO,
SHE CAN'T PLAY THE PIANO.

846
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,230
SHE WON'T HAVE FUN.

847
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,000
THE WOMAN REFUSES TO HAVE FUN.

848
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,460
SHE'S AFRAID OF PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW.

849
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,430
I'M NOT. NO.

850
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,230
I SIMPLY ADORE PEOPLE.

851
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,300
DO YOU KNOW,

852
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,830
THE OTHER DAY,
SHE WANTED TO TAKE A RIDE
IN THE PARK

853
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,630
WITH THAT ATTRACTIVE
YOUNG MAN, UH, RICHARD LOOMIS

854
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,000
WHO LIVES ACROSS THE YARD?

855
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,430
SHE WAS AFRAID
TO TAKE HIS HAND.

856
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,330
SHE'S AFRAID OF HANDS.
SO IS PEGGY.

857
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,600
I HAD TO GO.

858
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,200
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HANDS.

859
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,800
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.
NO, SIR.

860
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,860
WHOSE HANDS ARE SYBIL
AND PEGGY AFRAID OF?

861
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,800
[in Hattie's voice]
DON'T YOU DARE TELL.

862
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,260
NEXT WORSE THING
TO BEING A FIBBER
IS BEING A TALEBEARER.

863
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,230
YOU TELL, AND I'LL FIX IT
SO YOU AIN'T GOT
NOTHING TO TELL WITH.

864
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,400
VICKY,
DID YOUR MOTHER EVER HIT YOU?

865
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,630
OH.

866
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,130
MINE? NO.

867
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,700
MY MOTHER
IS AN ABSOLUTE ANGEL.

868
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,330
SHE LIVES IN PARIS,
YOU KNOW.

869
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,030
SHE'LL BE COMING FOR ME SOON.

870
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,230
WE'LL BE TOGETHER,
ALL MY BROTHERS AND--

871
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,560
IS SYBIL'S MOTHER
NOT AN ANGEL?

872
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,730
DO YOU LIKE MY HAIR?

873
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,700
IT'S CALLED A FRENCH TWIST.
I DO IT MYSELF.

874
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,800
I LOOK A GREAT DEAL
OLDER THAN 13, DON'T I?

875
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,830
THAT'S BECAUSE
EUROPEAN CHILDREN
MATURE SO MUCH SOONER.

876
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:26,730
BUT I'M SO THIN.
THIS SUIT JUST HANGS ON ME.

877
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,900
MAYBE SYBIL
ISN'T FEEDING YOU ENOUGH.

878
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,900
I NEVER COMPLAIN EXACTLY.

879
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,760
BUT ALL SHE EATS
IS ROTTEN FRUIT.

880
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,460
THAT'S ALL SHE'S EATEN
ALL MONTH LONG.

881
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,500
HER DADDY FORGETS
TO SEND HER THE CHECK.

882
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,760
LOTS OF TIMES, HER DADDY
FORGETS TO SEND A CHECK

883
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,500
AND THAT MAKES PEGGY
VERY, VERY MAD,

884
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,960
AND SHE BARGES INTO THE STORES

885
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,830
AND SMASHES ALL THE CRYSTAL,
AND SYBIL HAS TO PAY FOR IT.

886
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,430
BUT I DON'T CARE.

887
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,030
(Dr. Wilbur)
DID YOU HAVE BREAKFAST
THIS MORNING, HMM?

888
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,460
SWEETIE, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

889
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,160
IF I STAND VERY, VERY ERECT

890
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,800
WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF DIGNITY

891
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,500
YOU CAN'T TELL
HOW THIN I AM, CAN YOU?

892
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,900
COME ON. I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU A SANDWICH.

893
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,730
I SEE THE WHEELS
GOING ROUND AND ROUND.

894
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,100
WHY DO THEY DO THAT?

895
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,960
WHY DO THEY GO
ROUND AND ROUND
AGAINST ME?

896
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,930
THEY'RE NOT GOING AROUND
AGAINST YOU.

897
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,160
THEY'RE JUST
MAKING A RECORDING.

898
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,960
REMEMBER PEGGY SAID
I COULD WHEN SHE WAS HERE?

899
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,560
YES, I KNOW,
TO HELP SYBIL.

900
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,330
MMM-HMM.

901
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,060
BECAUSE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE
SO MUCH MORE INFORMATION
THAN SYBIL DOES.

902
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,960
OH, I HAVE MORE.

903
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,460
I HAVE MORE THAN PEGGY.
I HAVE MORE THAN ANYBODY.

904
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,900
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

905
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,160
EVERY THOUGHT SHE THINKS,
EVERYTHING SHE DOES,
I REMEMBER.

906
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,600
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER.

907
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,630
SHE MUSTN'T REMEMBER.

908
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,800
THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY,
VERY IMPORTANT

909
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,900
THAT YOU DON'T TELL HER
ABOUT US.

910
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,560
IT WOULD BE TOO BIG
A SHOCK FOR HER.

911
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,760
SHE'S NOT READY TO TAKE IT.

912
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,460
HERE.

913
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,930
I HAVE A PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY SANDWICH FOR YOU
AND SOME BANANA BREAD

914
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,160
AND A BIG GLASS OF MILK.

915
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,360
NOW, I WANT TO SEE YOU
JUST EAT AND EAT AND EAT,
ALL RIGHT?

916
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,600
THANK YOU.

917
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,060
MMM-HMM.

918
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,560
MILK IS GOOD
FOR GROWING GIRLS.

919
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,100
THAT'S RIGHT.

920
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,560
LOTS OF MUMMIES
AREN'T LIKE YOU.

921
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,630
LOTS OF MUMMIES
ARE REAL TRICKY.

922
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,000
VICKY,

923
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,660
DO YOU REMEMBER
SYBIL'S TONSILLECTOMY, HMM?

924
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,600
I SAW. I WAS THERE.

925
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,730
IT MADE, UH, SYBIL'S
THROAT HURT, DIDN'T IT?

926
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,130
YES, VERY MUCH.

927
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,300
MMM, HURT SO BAD
SHE HAD TO WHISPER
AND SHE COULDN'T TALK.

928
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,300
TALKED LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME.

929
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,130
FUNNY THING IS,
IT MADE PEGGY'S THROAT
HURT, TOO.

930
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,230
NOW HOW COME
BOTH THEIR THROATS HURT

931
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,560
IF, IF ALL OF YOU ARE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

932
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,300
VICKY?
I KNOW. I'M THINKING.

933
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,660
DON'T I HAVE
LOVELY TABLE MANNERS?

934
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,930
NOTICE HOW DELICATE
MY HANDS ARE.

935
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,130
THE PINKIES,
IT'S CALLED CONTINENTAL.

936
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,160
HMM, YES, IT'S LOVELY.

937
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,960
TELL ME,
ARE YOU RELATED IN SOME WAY,
ALL OF YOU?

938
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,160
I KNOW WHERE I AM.
I'M IN NEW YORK.
LOTS TO DO IN NEW YORK.

939
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,700
MUSEUMS TO GO TO,
CONCERTS--

940
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,400
DO YOU THINK THAT
SYBIL AND PEGGY

941
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,130
SHARE THE SAME MOTHER
AND FATHER?

942
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,200
NOW HOW ARE THEY RELATED?

943
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,000
HMM?

944
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,960
ARE THEY SISTERS?

945
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,700
OR ARE YOU ALL PARTS
OF THE SAME PERSON?

946
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,000
DON'T BE SILLY.
IT CAN'T BE THAT.

947
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,800
NO, IT CAN BE THAT.

948
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,130
YOU CAN ALL BE ASPECTS
OF THE SAME PERSON.

949
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,700
ALL PIECES OF SYBIL.

950
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,560
NO, NO.

951
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,030
WE'RE ALL PEOPLE.
YOU CAN SEE US.

952
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,100
LOOK AROUND.

953
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,560
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE HERE,
JUST YOU AND ME

954
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,760
AND THE SINK
AND THE DISHES AND THE DOOR.

955
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,560
NOBODY ELSE HERE.

956
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,930
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

957
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,060
SWEETIE,
I BELIEVE THAT YOU BELIEVE.

958
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,730
COME ON,
YOU HAVE YOUR SANDWICH.

959
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,730
QUESTIONS,
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS.
MY GOODNESS, SO MANY.

960
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:16,100
LOOK, YOU EVEN HAVE
QUESTIONS IN YOUR EYES
RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

961
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,100
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

962
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,900
ASK ME.

963
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,130
WHAT'S LOVE?

964
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,730
SWEETIE, DON'T YOU KNOW?

965
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,000
NO, I DON'T.

966
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,030
PLEASE TELL.
WE ALL WANT TO KNOW,
ALL OF US.

967
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,800
WHO'S ALL OF US?

968
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,230
EVERYBODY
THAT LIVES WITH SYBIL.

969
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,430
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 WHO ARE THE OTHERS, VICKY?

970
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,330
 ARE THERE MORE BESIDES YOU
 AND--AND--AND SYBIL AND PEGGY?

971
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,200
 VICKY?

972
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,430
 (Sybil as Vicky)
 I HEAR YOU.

973
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,460
 ARE YOU SEEING THEM NOW?

974
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,500
 YES.

975
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,030
 I DON'T WANT TO,
 BUT I CAN.

976
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,560
[creaking]

977
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,460
 IT WAS SO NICE A MOMENT AGO
 WHEN THEY WEREN'T HERE.

978
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,430
 I NEED TO KNOW
 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING,
 SWEETIE.

979
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,500
 IF I DON'T KNOW
 WHO YOU ALL ARE
 AND WHAT YOU WANT,

980
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,260
 I CAN'T HELP YOU
 AS EASILY AS I'D LIKE.

981
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
 VICKY?

982
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,960
HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP.

983
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,760
 WE ALL KEEP HOPING
 THINGS WILL GET BETTER

984
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,830
 BUT I, I DON'T THINK
 SYBIL'S GOING TO LIVE
 THAT LONG.

985
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,930
 WHY, SWEETIE?

986
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,200
 WHY DO YOU HAVE
 THIS AWFUL FEELING OF DOOM?

987
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,530
 BECAUSE OF MARCIA.

988
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:40,100
 MARCIA'S GOING TO
 KILL SYBIL SOMEDAY.

989
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,630
LET IT COME. LET IT COME.

990
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,600
WE'RE WALKING CORPSES.

991
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,860
WE START DYING
THE MOMENT WE'RE BORN.

992
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,330
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 WHO'S MARCIA?

993
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,560
 WHY DOES SYBIL NEED MARCIA?

994
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,800
 VICKY?

995
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,900
 ONE OF THEM
 PLAYS THE PIANO.

996
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,530
 SHE'S THE PRETTIEST.

997
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,660
 SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
 WITH ANY JOIE DE VIVRE.

998
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,330
 WHAT'S HER NAME?

999
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,400
 NO.

1000
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,330
 MUSTN'T TELL YOU.
 MUSTN'T TELL ANY MORE.

1001
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,860
 I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN
 TOLD YOU ABOUT MARCIA.

1002
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,630
 WHY NOT?

1003
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,660
 WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID
 TO TELL ABOUT THE OTHERS,
 VICKY?

1004
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,360
 WHO TOLD YOU IT WAS WRONG
 TO TELL PEOPLE THINGS?

1005
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,860
 WHO SAID IT WAS DANGEROUS
 TO TELL?

1006
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,460
 VICKY?

1007
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,730
 VICKY?

1008
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,360
MUSTN'T TELL.

1009
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,560
CAN'T TELL.

1010
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,260
THERE ARE GUARDS
AROUND THE PALACE.

1011
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,760
SWEETIE, EVEN THE GUARDS
AROUND THE PALACE

1012
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,700
WILL TELL
IF THE QUEEN'S IN DANGER.

1013
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,500
 (Dr. Wilbur)
 MARCIA APPEARED
 FOR THE FIRST TIME

1014
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,800
 AT THE SESSION
 THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY.

1015
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,760
 SHE ADMITTED
 TRYING TO KILL SYBIL
 IN THE HARLEM HOTEL

1016
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
 AND WAS SORRY
 THAT VICKY STOPPED HER.

1017
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,230
 SHE ALLOWED ME
 TO PHOTOGRAPH HER,
 AS THE OTHER'S HAVE

1018
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,730
 SAYING THAT SHE WANTED
 THIS PICTURE
 PUBLISHED WITH HER OBITUARY.

1019
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,630
 WHEN I ASKED HER
 WHY SHE THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE
 SO OBSESSIVELY

1020
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,560
 SHE PRETENDED
 TO LOCK HER LIPS
 AND THROW THE KEY AWAY,

1021
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,630
 THEN PROCEEDED TO DRAW SCENES
 FROM A RECURRENT NIGHTMARE,

1022
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,660
 AS THOUGH
 THIS WERE A SECRET WAY
 OF REVEALING INFORMATION

1023
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
 SHE COULDN'T GIVE ME OPENLY.

1024
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,260
 BY DRAWING
 HER DREAMS IN SILENCE,

1025
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,230
 NOBODY COULD EAVESDROPS
 ON HER,

1026
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,460
 AND THAT SEEMED TO BE
 A CONSTANT DREAD

1027
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,000
 THAT SOMEONE WOULD FIND OUT
 THAT SHE'D CONFIDED IN ME.

1028
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,460
 IN THE DREAM,

1029
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,560
 A CHILD COMES UPON,
 UH, A LOST KITTEN

1030
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,700
 IN THE TUNNEL OF A GREAT PARK

1031
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,430
 AND THEN SHE DISCOVERS, UH,

1032
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:42,000
 A BOX WHERE OTHER KITTENS
 HAVE BEEN ABANDONED.

1033
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,160
 THE CHILD IS--IS OVERWHELMED
 WITH--WITH LOVE AND PITY

1034
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,660
 AND--AND RUNS OFF WITH THE BOX
 IN ORDER TO SAVE THE KITTENS.

1035
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,760
 SUDDENLY,
 SHE SEES A DEAD CAT,

1036
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,130
 WHICH HORRIFIES HER

1037
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,200
 BECAUSE IT'S BEEN BEHEADED.

1038
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,100
 BOTH THE HEAD AND BODY
 COME TO LIFE AND PURSUE HER.

1039
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,860
 MARCIA SAID THEY ALL SHARED
 THE SAME NIGHTMARES

1040
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,560
 BUT THAT SYBIL
 DOESN'T REMEMBER ANY OF THEM.

1041
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,930
 THE DREAMS
 ARE ALL OF ENTRAPMENT

1042
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,530
 AND RELENTLESS PURSUIT.

1043
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,360
 LARGE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN

1044
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,030
 AWAITING SOME
 TERRIBLE RETALIATION.

1045
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:20,200
 LONELINESS,
 THE HOPELESSNESS OF RESCUE.

1046
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,160
 PARALYZING FEAR
 PERVADE EVERYTHING.

1047
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,330
 WHEN I SUGGESTED
 THAT THE KITTENS

1048
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,600
 MIGHT BE
 THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SYBIL,

1049
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,630
 THAT SHE'S TRYING TO
 BRING ME FOR PROTECTION

1050
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,960
 AND THAT THE CAT
 MIGHT BE HER DESIRE
 TO DESTROY AGAIN AND AGAIN

1051
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,100
 SOME UNSPEAKABLE TORMENTOR
 WHO WON'T STAY DEAD,

1052
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,930
 MARCIA BECAME SO FEARFUL,
 SHE DISSOCIATED INTO PEGGY,

1053
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,960
 WHO WANTED TO ESCAPE WITH ME
 TO AMSTERDAM TO GET AWAY

1054
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,600
 FROM WHAT SHE CALLS
 "THE PEOPLE."

1055
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,130
 I LOOK AT ALL THE FACES,
 FURIOUS, TERRIFIED PEGGY,

1056
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,860
 SEPULCHRAL LITTLE MARCIA,

1057
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,030
 VICKY WITH HER SOCIAL EASE
 AND UNINTERRUPTED MEMORY,

1058
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,460
 AND SYBIL,

1059
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,030
 AND I WONDER,
 WHAT THERE WAS BACK THERE

1060
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,460
 THAT COULD'VE CAUSED
 SUCH A SHATTERING.

1061
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,830
 WHAT COULD'VE FORCED HER

1062
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:14,830
 TO THRUST ONTO CREATURES
 SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW EXIST

1063
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,700
 ALL THOSE CAPACITIES
 IN HERSELF SHE MUST DENY?

1064
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,600
 AND WHY IS IT SO VITAL
 THAT SHE DENY THEM?

1065
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,530
 WHAT WAS THE TORMENT?

1066
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,500
 WHO WAS THE TORMENTOR?

1067
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,360
(Richard)
HEY, SYBIL.

1068
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,400
HEY, SYBIL.

1069
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,030
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

1070
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,400
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER?

1071
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,630
WE CAN GO DOWNTOWN.

1072
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,760
YOU CAN, UH,
SEE ME IN ACTION, OK?

1073
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,560
I'LL BUY YOU A HOTDOG,
SAUERKRAUT, PICKLES.

1074
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,230
YOU LIKE PICKLES?

1075
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,800
I DON'T GO OUT AT NIGHT,
BUT THANK YOU ANYWAY.

1076
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,200
OH, COME ON. LOOK, UH,
IT'S JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1077
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,300
I ONLY GOTTA GO DOWN
AND PLAY THE INTERMISSION

1078
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,830
AND IF IT DOESN'T RAIN,
UH, YOU KNOW,
I'LL CATCH THEM GOING OUT.

1079
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,960
CATCH THEM FOR WHAT?

1080
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,900
BY DAY,
I'M A CENTRAL PARK COWBOY

1081
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,300
BUT BY NIGHT, A TONE-DEAF
WANDERING MINSTREL.

1082
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,000
STREET MUSICIAN.

1083
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,300
SAY YES.

1084
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,900
(as Vicky)
SYBIL CAN'T SAY YES.

1085
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,800
VANESSA, YOU GO.
YOU LIKE MUSIC.

1086
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,730
YOU MAY GO, VANESSA.

1087
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,100
RICHARD?

1088
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,060
RICHARD?

1089
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:37,030
RICHARD.

1090
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,300
RICHARD!

1091
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,960
HEY.

1092
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,730
OK, BUT LOOK,
I'M NOT ANY GOOD
AT JUMPING OVER FENCES,

1093
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,360
SO WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

1094
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,800
UH, THE GRAY HOUSE,
APARTMENT 5C.

1095
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,330
OK.

1096
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,000
HI.

1097
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,630
GUESS WHAT I AM.

1098
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,630
UH, A KUMQUAT.

1099
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,960
NO.

1100
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,400
A DONUT WITH EARS.

1101
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,600
NO.

1102
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,100
UM...

1103
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,600
A SMILE THAT WENT
LOOKING FOR A BOY,
AND FOUND ONE.

1104
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,030
NO.
NO.

1105
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,360
I'M A CLOWN.

1106
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,130
A CLOWN.

1107
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,900
SYBIL, THIS IS MATTHEW.

1108
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,500
MATTHEW, SAY HELLO TO SYBIL.

1109
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,000
I KNOW SYBIL.

1110
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,300
I WATCH HER
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

1111
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,330
HE'S A LITTLE WOUND UP
AT THE IDEA OF COMPANY.

1112
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:13,000
I REALLY LOVE YOUR APARTMENT.
IT'S, IT'S ALL LIT UP.

1113
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,530
SYBIL BIBBLE DRIBBLE.

1114
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:17,660
MATTHEW, SIMMER DOWN.
SIT!

1115
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,800
MATTHEW.

1116
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,130
NOW, DON'T LET APPEARANCES
DECEIVE YOU.

1117
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,600
I AM REALLY NOT COMPANY.

1118
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,130
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?

1119
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,960
I'M A PRINCESS
WHO'S BEEN ASLEEP
FOR 1,000 YEARS

1120
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,200
IN A FOREST
CALLED SIMMER DOWN.

1121
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,000
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

1122
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,460
THAT'S BECAUSE A WICKED WITCH
PUT AN EVIL SPELL
ON MY ICE-CREAM CONE

1123
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,330
THE VERY DAY I WAS BORN,
AND IF A PRINCE
DOESN'T COME ALONG SOON

1124
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,730
AND BREAK
THE SPELL WITH A KISS,

1125
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,960
I GUESS I HAVE TO
GO ON FOREVER
LOOKING LIKE SYBIL BIBBLE,

1126
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,760
AND I WOULDN'T WISH THAT
ON A DRAGON, WOULD YOU?

1127
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,530
[yawning]
OH, I'M GETTING SO SLEEPY.

1128
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,960
[snoring]

1129
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,630
[laughs]

1130
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,300
SEE YOU BLINKING.

1131
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,530
THAT'S BECAUSE
PRINCESSES ALWAYS BLINK
IN THEIR SLEEP.

1132
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,500
THEY HAVE TO STAY ALERT
FOR THE PALACE REVOLUTION

1133
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,160
WHICH IS LIABLE
TO TAKE PLACE ANY MOMENT.

1134
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,630
[snoring]

1135
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:07,100
(Matthew)
IF YOU WAKE UP,
I'LL SHOW YOU MY TOYS.

1136
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.

1137
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,730
[snoring]

1138
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,900
[kisses]

1139
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,500
OK. ENCHANTMENT'S BROKEN.

1140
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,130
[Richard sighing]

1141
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,830
(Richard)
SAY GOODNIGHT TO SYBIL.

1142
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,160
THAT'S NOT SYBIL.
SYBIL STAYED HOME.

1143
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,160
OK, BUT WE STILL
GOTTA GET YOU NEXT DOOR.

1144
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,530
SO HERE'S BEAR-BEAR.

1145
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,030
AND HOW ABOUT NIGHT-NIGHT.

1146
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,960
AND DOODY.

1147
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,530
AND DOODY.
CAN'T FORGET DOODY, OK?

1148
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,800
(Richard)
AND WASH YOU FACE,

1149
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,300
OR THERE'LL BE SMILES
ALL OVER YOUR PILLOW.

1150
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,430
THAT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD THING

1151
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,300
TO WAKE UP TO SOMETIMES,
WOULD IT?

1152
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,460
WHAT?

1153
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,100
SMILES.

1154
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,230
ALL OVER YOUR PILLOW.

1155
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,230
[trumpet blowing]

1156
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,860
(as Vanessa)
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHY YOU WEAR

1157
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,000
THAT OUTRAGEOUS SMILE
ALL THE TIME.

1158
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,300
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE SMILING,
THEY SMILE BACK

1159
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,860
AND THAT MAKES THEM
FEEL GOOD.

1160
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,130
SO THEY PUT
MORE MONEY IN THE KITTY.

1161
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,030
SEE HOW CRASS.

1162
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,930
CLEVER, CLEVER MAN.

1163
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:23,500
OF COURSE,
MY FACE DOESN'T GET TIRED

1164
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,360
SO I CAN KEEP
GRINNING AWAY ALL NIGHT

1165
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,300
AND NEVER HAVE TO SMILE
AT ALL.

1166
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,000
DO YOU MAKE
FABULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY?

1167
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,130
I MEAN,
JUST TONS AND TONS OF MONEY?

1168
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,760
WELL, OVER $5,000
LAST YEAR, TAX FREE.

1169
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,230
AND THAT WAS JUST
ON THE SIDEWALK
IN FRONT OF CARNEGIE HALL.

1170
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,330
THAT'S FABULOUS.

1171
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,830
PLUS I GET COMPLIMENTS,
YOU KNOW,

1172
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,560
FROM THE GREAT
AND NEAR GREAT.

1173
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,300
I HAVE AN AUTOGRAPHED PICTURE
FROM LAWRENCE WELK THAT SAYS

1174
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,860
"GOOD LUCK AND SUCCESS,
ALWAYS."

1175
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,400
NOW, THAT REALLY
MAKES ME FEEL NEAT,
YOU KNOW?

1176
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,560
LIKE ALL MY YEARS AT JULLIARD
WERE REALLY WORTHWHILE.

1177
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,660
ONCE, I YEARNED TO BE
A CONCERT PIANIST.

1178
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,830
WHAT STOPPED YOU?

1179
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,260
I COULDN'T FIND
THE RIGHT PIANO.

1180
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,960
I MEAN,
SHOULD IT BE A STEINWAY

1181
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,430
OR A BECHSTEIN GRAND?
I DIDN'T KNOW.

1182
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:02,730
YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD
AT THE MOST,
AND I GOTTA KISS YOU.

1183
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,760
2 GENTLEMEN IN ONE NIGHT.
FANCY THAT.

1184
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,530
I GOT BLUE PAINT
ALL OVER YOUR LIP.

1185
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,830
OH.

1186
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,860
GOT IT. GOT IT.

1187
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,000
OK.

1188
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,860
(Sybil as Vanessa)
MY MOTHER WANTED TO BE
A CONCERT PIANIST, TOO.

1189
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,500
YEAH?
YEAH.

1190
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,200
THE BIGGEST
DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER LIFE

1191
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,100
WAS WHEN HER SISTER FAYE
GOT MARRIED FIRST

1192
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,500
AND LEFT HER BEHIND
TO DEMONSTRATE PIANOS
IN THE FAMILY MUSIC STORE

1193
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,030
INSTEAD OF BEING
ALLOWED TO PURSUE

1194
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,430
HER DREAMS
LIKE SHE'D BEEN PROMISED.

1195
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,400
THAT WAS IN WILLOW CORNERS,
WISCONSIN.

1196
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,830
THAT'S MY NATURAL HABITAT,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

1197
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:40,060
WILLOW CORNERS, WISCONSIN.
YEAH.

1198
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,830
MY GOODNESS.

1199
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,630
AFTER THAT, MOTHER WOULD JUST
PUNISH THE MUSIC, YOU KNOW.

1200
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,560
SHE'D JUST SIT THERE
AND BANG ON THAT PIANO

1201
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,360
AND CALL OUT
THE TIME OUT LOUD

1202
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,460
AND CALL OUT THOSE NOTES
LIKE SHE HATED THEM.

1203
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,560
YOU KNOW,
JUST BANG ON THE PIANO.

1204
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,760
YEAH, LOVE AND HATE.

1205
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,360
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

1206
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,600
I USED TO HATE
MY LATE WIFE

1207
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,260
WHO I SPEAK OF
WITH A CERTAIN IRONY

1208
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,960
SO AS TO KEEP A TOTAL
COLLAPSE AT A DISTANCE.

1209
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:11,000
I WISH
YOU WOULDN'T MOCK YOURSELF.

1210
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,100
YOU WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT?

1211
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,430
'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU.

1212
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,800
YOU WOULD?
I'D LIKE TO HEAR.

1213
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,100
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
I SHOULD ASK.

1214
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,960
BEEP-BEEP WITH THE HORN.

1215
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,430
CHOO-CHOO WITH THE TRAIN.

1216
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,400
CRASH-CRASH WITH THE CAR.

1217
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,130
ALL BROKEN.

1218
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,530
AS MATTHEW SAYS
WHEN I DROP A DISH.

1219
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,430
ANYWAY, UH,

1220
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,730
HER NAME

1221
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,230
WAS JANIE.

1222
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,330
AND SHE WAS 19.

1223
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,260
AND, UH, I NEVER THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE ABLE

1224
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,830
TO COPE WITH ANYTHING
AFTER SHE GOT KILLED.

1225
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,960
AND I HATED HER
FOR FINKING OUT.

1226
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,760
BUT ONE THING IT TAUGHT ME.

1227
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,760
YOU'RE NEVER READY
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

1228
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,360
YOU JUST DO IT.

1229
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,600
THAT MAKES YOU READY.

01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:23,430
WHAT DID THE HANDS DO
TO MAKE THAT HURT.

1536
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:24,930
[groaning]

1537
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,500
OH, COME ON, PEGGY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

1538
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,100
OH, MY GOD.

1539
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,760
KEEP AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.

1540
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,160
REMEMBER, YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T BREAK GLASS
IN MY OFFICE.

1541
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,160
HANDS AND THE PEOPLE
AND YOU COULD SEE THEM

1542
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,200
AND THEY WALK AND THEY TALK
AND YOU CAN HEAR THEM

1543
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,860
AND, AND "A" SHARP AND "C".

1544
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,400
OH, OH, IT HURTS ME.

1545
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,830
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE, SWEETIE?
WHAT HURTS? WHAT HURTS?

1546
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,960
I WILL. I GOTTA GET OUT.
I GOTTA GET OUT.
PEGGY!

1547
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,030
I WILL. I WILL. GLASS BREAK.

1548
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,100
WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU, PEGGY?
TELL ME.

1549
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,860
THE KITCHEN,
THE KITCHEN, THE KITCHEN.

1550
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,600
IT'S ALL GREEN.
IT'S ALL GREEN.

1551
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,560
AND THE SINK AND THE TABLE
AND THE LIGHT,
YOU CAN SEE IT.

1552
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,630
AND THE SHADE, AND THE SHADE,
AND THE PIANO
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

1553
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,200
AND THE PIANO
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

1554
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,400
AND THE PEOPLE,
AND YOU CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM THE MUSIC,

1555
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,230
AND IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

1556
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:12,630
OH, DON'T HOOK ME.
DON'T HOOK ME.

1557
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,900
HOOK YOU WITH WHAT?

1558
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,260
DON'T HOOK ME. DON'T HOOK ME.

1559
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,060
I KNOW. YOU GOT A BIG HOOK.
YOU GOT A BUTTON HOOK.

1560
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,230
YOU'RE GONNA HOOK ME.
YOU'RE GONNA HOOK ME.
NO. NO. NO.

1561
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,500
PEGGY,
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
NO, YOU WON'T LET ME OUT.

1562
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,560
YOU WON'T LET ME BREAK GLASS.
YOU WON'T LET ME DRAW.

1563
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,530
AND YOU WON'T LET ME DRAW.
YES, I'LL LET YOU DRAW.

1564
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,030
YOU WON'T LET ME DRAW.
I'LL LET YOU DRAW.

1565
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,430
YOU WON'T LET ME DRAW.

1566
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,330
YOU WON'T LET ME DRAW
BECAUSE I'LL DRAW MY WAY OUT.

1567
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:31,430
I'LL DRAW MY WAY OUT.

1568
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,760
AND ALL THE PEOPLE
AND THE COLORS.

1569
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,600
AND THE PEOPLE
AND THE COLORS.

1570
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,400
YOU WON'T BE MAD.
YOU WON'T BE MAD.

1571
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,060
NO, NO. DRAW.
I'LL DRAW MY WAY OUT.

1572
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,000
YOU WATCH. YOU COULD WATCH.

1573
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,300
VICKY WOULD SAY "MAY,"
BUT I CAN SAY "CAN"
IF I WANT TO.

1574
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,730
I CAN SAY "CAN" IF I WANT TO.

1575
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:46,830
THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE,
THE PEOPLE.

1576
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:49,830
IT'S ALL PURPLE. AND IT MOVES
AND YOU WATCH THEM

1577
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,960
AND YOU SEE THEIR FEET.
AND YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY.

1578
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,900
AND THERE'S ANOTHER
AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER.

1579
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,100
AND THE MUSIC,
IT GOES AROUND AND AROUND
AND AROUND AND AROUND

1580
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,360
AND OVER AND DOWN LIKE THAT,
AND THEN LIKE THAT.

1581
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,130
AND YOU COULD SEE,
YOU COULD SEE,

1582
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:03,030
YOU COULD SEE,
AND THE PEOPLE HAVE HANDS.

1583
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:04,360
PEGGY, WHO ARE THE PEOPLE?

1584
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,630
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

1585
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,560
THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.
THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.

1586
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,430
AND IT'S LIKE THAT
AND LIKE THAT AND OVER

1587
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,700
AND AROUND AND LIKE THAT
AND LIKE THAT.

1588
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,500
AND YOU CAN HEAR IT,
AND YOU CAN HEAR.

1589
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,360
AND IT GOES SHARP, SHARP.
IT GOES SHARP. "A" SHARP.

1590
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,800
"A" SHARP AND "F" AND "F"
AND--AND--AND "B" AND "D"

1591
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,800
AND--AND--AND--AND--AND
BRAHMS AND BEETHOVEN.

1592
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,060
AND--AND--AND--AND--AND--AND

1593
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:28,400
BRAHMS AND--AND--AND
THE  NEW WORLD SYMPHONY
AND DVORAK.

1594
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,960
AND DVORAK, YOU CAN HEAR IT.

1595
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,800
YOU CAN HEAR IT.
YOU CAN HEAR IT.

1596
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,930
OH, OH, MUSTN'T WASTE PAPER.

1597
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:35,160
MUSTN'T WASTE PAPER.

1598
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,500
PAPER IS VALUABLE.
PAPER IS VALUABLE.

1599
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,500
YES, IT IS. YES, IT IS.

1600
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,300
IT'S VALUABLE. IT'S VALUABLE.

1601
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,800
[Sybil sobbing]

1602
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,500
YOU CAN SEE NOW.

1603
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,730
YOU CAN SEE THE PEOPLE.

1604
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,630
YOU CAN SEE THE PEOPLE NOW.

1605
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:52,260
YOU CAN SEE THEM.

1606
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,700
YOU CAN SEE.

1607
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,960
OH.

1608
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,060
(as Sybil)
OH.

1609
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:07,430
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1610
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,760
OH, GOD,
HOW DID I GET UNDER HERE?

1611
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,800
HOW DID I GET UNDER THERE?

1612
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,060
YOU HAVE TO STOP ME
FROM DOING THIS.

1613
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:22,500
I CAN'T GO ON.

1614
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,760
SYBIL, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1615
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,130
RELIEVED, A LITTLE.

1616
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,430
HMM, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

1617
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:38,800
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
A GREAT DEAL.

1618
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,530
SYBIL, COME AND SIT DOWN.

1619
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:44,800
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

1620
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,500
COME ON. SIT DOWN.

1621
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,560
NOW, YOU TOLD ME THAT

1622
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,060
THIS WAS A PICTURE
OF THE PEOPLE.

1623
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,960
WHO DREW THAT?
THAT'S MY MOTHER.

1624
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,460
THAT'S A PICTURE
OF MY MOTHER.

1625
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,500
LOOK, THE LITTLE WISPS
OF HAIR THERE AND,

1626
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,460
AND YOU CAN'T SEE HER EYES.

1627
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,200
HER EYES ALWAYS SCARED ME.

1628
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,560
DID YOU DO THAT?

1629
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,700
NO. NO, I DIDN'T DO IT.

1630
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:21,000
LOOK. LOOK,
THE LITTLE BOW AND HAIRPINS
SHE ALWAYS WORE IN HER HAIR.

1631
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,460
AND--AND THERE'S
THE BUTTON HOOK.

1632
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,400
I--I DON'T REMEMBER.

1633
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,130
BUTTON HOOKS SCARE ME.

1634
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,960
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA GET ME.

1635
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,930
BUTTON HOOKS ARE GOOD THINGS.

1636
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,330
WHAT ABOUT DISH TOWELS?

1637
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,100
DO DISH TOWELS SCARE YOU?

1638
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,500
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DISH TOWELS?

1639
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,600
DO THEY SCARE YOU?

1640
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,130
YES.

1641
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:47,530
BUT NOW DISH TOWELS ARE GOOD
AND USEFUL THINGS, RIGHT?

1642
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,800
SYBIL,
LOVE IS A NECESSARY THING.

1643
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,830
BUT NOW IF A VOICE SAYS,
"C-COME HERE, I LOVE YOU"

1644
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:01,000
AND THEN A HAND REACHES OUT
AND PINCHES YOU
LIKE THAT, HARD,

1645
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,060
THEN--THEN LOVE IS SPOILED
BY THAT HAND, ISN'T IT?

1646
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,960
AND--AND--AND MUSIC,
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT--THAT YOU LOVE VERY MUCH

1647
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,630
AND YOU MISS VERY MUCH

1648
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:13,500
BECAUSE SOMEHOW
THAT WAS SPOILED FOR YOU,
TOO, BY THE HAND.

1649
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,630
WE DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT--BUT WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

1650
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,760
AND THAT HAND
BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE

1651
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,360
AND THE PEOPLE
WAS YOUR MOTHER.

1652
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,800
(as Peggy)
THE PEOPLE,
I CANNOT SEE THE PEOPLE.

1653
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,030
OH, PEGGY, STOP THAT!

1654
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:24,400
(as Sybil)
WHAT?

1655
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,100
OH, DR. WILBUR,
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

1656
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:36,100
THIS IS GETTING A LOT WORSE,
ISN'T IT?

1657
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,430
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THOSE THINGS?

1658
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,860
I DON'T TELL YOU THEM.

1659
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:45,300
AND WHO DOES THOSE DRAWINGS?

1660
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,330
YOU DO.

1661
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,300
OH, BUT YOU DO THEM
AS OTHER PEOPLE.

1662
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
MMM-MMM, MMM-MMM.

1663
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,500
YOU DO THEM AS OTHER
PARTS OF YOURSELF
NO, I DON'T.

1664
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,160
...WHO ARE STILL CHILDREN.
NO, I DON'T.

1665
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,930
IT'S TRUE.
NO, IT'S NOT. IT IS NOT

1666
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:04,030
SYBIL, YOU'VE GOT TO
UNDERSTAND. IT IS TRUE.
THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

1667
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:05,200
IT'S POSSIBLE.
MMM-MMM.

1668
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,930
IN FACT,
THROUGH MOST OF THE ANALYSIS,

1669
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:08,630
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU
THROUGH THEM.

1670
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:11,200
THEY ALL HAVE NAMES
AND THEY COME HERE
AND THEY PROTECT YOU.

1671
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,160
THEY KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENTS
AND THEY'RE THE ONES

1672
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,460
WHO POUR OUT THIS INFORMATION
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID TO FACE.
OH, NO.

1673
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,700
YOU'VE GOT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, SYBIL.
NO, IT'S NOT TRUE.

1674
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:22,100
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S NOT TRUE. NO, IT'S NOT.
NO. IT'S NOT TRUE.

1675
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,360
SYBIL.

1676
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,500
SYBIL.

1677
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,830
EVERYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT
SURVIVES IN THOSE PARTS OF YOU

1678
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:32,230
THAT YOUR MOTHER
WASN'T ABLE TO REACH.

1679
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:35,030
YOUR MUSIC, YOUR PAINTING,

1680
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:38,130
EVEN YOUR ABILITY TO LOVE,
THEY SURVIVE THERE.

1681
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,960
SYBIL, I WANT YOU
TO HEAR SOMETHING.

1682
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,800
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

1683
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,860
I'M GOING TO LET YOU
HEAR YOURSELF
PLAY THE PIANO.

1684
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,900
I--I CAN'T PLAY
THE PIANO ANYMORE.

1685
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,000
I USED TO PLAY IT.
I--I CAN'T PLAY IT ANYMORE.

1686
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,300
WELL, THIS IS A PART OF YOU
WHO CALLS HERSELF VANESSA,
AND SHE CAN.

1687
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,100
SHE PLAYS BEAUTIFULLY.

1688
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,800
I DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT HER.

1689
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,900
SYBIL.

1690
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,600
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
THIS REAL FOR YOU.

1691
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,960
[crying]

1692
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,330
DOCTOR, I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN TAKE IT.

1693
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,260
MY HANDS ARE GOING NUMB.

1694
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,560
THERE'S NO DANGER FOR YOU.
THERE IS NO DANGER.

1695
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:18,400
THERE ARE NO DISH TOWELS
TYING YOUR WRISTS NOW.

1696
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,430
MY HEART. MY HEART.

1697
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:24,430
THAT'S ONLY ADRENALIN.

1698
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:27,000
THERE IS NOBODY HERE
TO HURT YOU,
I PROMISE.

1699
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,430
NOTHING BAD
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT BETTER.

1700
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,700
PLEASE, SYBIL,
JUST RELAX AND LISTEN.

1701
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:38,800
 **[piano playing]

1702
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,900
THAT'S VANESSA.

1703
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,600
AND SHE'S GOT ALL YOUR MUSIC
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

1704
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:03,530
 **[piano playing]

1705
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,400
THAT'S ME?

1706
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,700
PLAYING MOZART?

1707
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,760
MMM-HMM.

1708
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:18,360
AND YOU PLAYED SIBELIUS, TOO.

1709
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,900
YOU PLAYED  FINLANDIA.

1710
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,900
[clicking]

1711
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,960
 [Sybil in Hattie's voice]
 DON'T YOU DARE TELL.

1712
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,230
 NEXT WORSE THING
 TO BEING A FIBBER
 IS BEING A TALEBEARER.

1713
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,700
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S VOICE.
THAT'S MY--
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S...

1714
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:31,760
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S VOICE.
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S VOICE.

1715
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,960
SWEETIE, THAT'S NOT
YOUR MOTHER'S VOICE.

1716
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,900
THAT'S YOU IMITATING YOUR...

1717
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,560
SYBIL?

1718
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,800
SYBIL!

1719
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,800
[moaning]

1720
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,860
WHAT THE HELL
DID THAT MONSTER DO TO YOU?

1721
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,130
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE GREEN KITCHEN?
