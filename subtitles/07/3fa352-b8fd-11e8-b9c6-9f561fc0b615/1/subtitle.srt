1
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,524
"In the beginning,
God created beast and man...

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:18,165
.. so that both might live in friendship
and share dominion over a world of peace."

3
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:24,293
"But in the fullness of time,
evil men betrayed God's trust,...

4
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:29,125
..and in disobedience to His holy word
waged bloody wars,...

5
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:32,250
..not only against their own kind,...

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,645
..but against the apes,
whom they reduced to slavery."

7
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:42,964
"Then God in His wrath
sent the world a saviour,...

8
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:49,526
..miraculously born of two apes, who
descended on Earth from Earth's own future."

9
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:55,806
"And man was afraid, for both parent apes
possessed the power of speech."

10
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,244
Come on!

11
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,605
(gunfire)

12
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:52,128
"So both were brutally murdered."

13
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:58,722
"But the child ape survived, and grew up
to set his fellow creatures free...

14
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,407
..from the yoke of human slavery."

15
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:11,884
No!

16
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,530
"Yet, in the aftermath of this victory,...

17
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:58,290
..the surface ofthe world was ravaged
by the vilest war in human history."

18
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:03,445
"The great cities ofthe world
split asunder and were flattened,...

19
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:09,608
..and out of one such city our saviour
led a remnant ofthose who survived...

20
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:16,371
..in search of greener pastures, where ape
and human might forever live in friendship,...

21
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:19,013
..according to divine will."

22
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:23,289
"His name was Caesar,...

23
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:27,571
..and this is his story in those far-off days."

24
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:59,324
- You're not gonna make it, Jake.
- Ah, we'll make it.

25
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:03,567
I'll show you how.

26
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:25,010
- Thanks, Aldo.
- You will call me by my proper rank.

27
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:27,084
General!

28
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,844
Yes, General.

29
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:34,761
Don't put him in the corral. I won't be long.

30
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,282
"Ape shall never kill ape."

31
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:40,166
"Ape shall never kill ape."

32
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,643
"Ape shall never kill ape."

33
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,248
"Ape shall never kill ape."

34
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,847
Shall ape ever kill man?

35
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:52,886
You're late, General Aldo.
Come and read this to the class.

36
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,610
- I won't.
- You won't because you can't.

37
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:01,403
And you can't
because you don't want to learn.

38
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:03,609
And it is my duty to report this to Caesar.

39
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,732
- (grunts)
- If my father were a gorilla,...

40
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,044
..we'd all be learning riding instead of writing.

41
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,689
Silence!

42
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,128
Silence.

43
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:21,204
Cornelius...

44
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,453
Remember - you are Caesar's son and heir.

45
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,889
Being a good rider isn't enough
for being a good ruler.

46
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:33,725
Though in human history, quite a number of
military dictators seem to have thought so.

47
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:39,092
Now, all of you, take your charcoal sticks and
parchments and copy down what I've written.

48
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:42,085
The best shall be hung from these hooks.

49
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:46,326
I can think of better things
to hang from those hooks.

50
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,405
- But, Virgil, can we tamper with time?
- Accept my premise.

51
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:53,088
- What premise?
- Man learned to travel faster than sound.

52
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,926
He could have learned
to travel faster than light.

53
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,322
- We accept.
- Then imagine a musician...

54
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:03,043
..giving a live broadcast
from London to New York on a Wednesday.

55
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:06,570
He then travels faster than light
from London to New York,...

56
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:10,931
..where he arrives, as physicists
would confirm, on the previous Tuesday.

57
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:15,484
Listens to his own broadcast
on the Wednesday, dislikes its quality,...

58
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,007
..then travels faster than light to London,...

59
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:21,449
..in time for him to decide
not to give his broadcast.

60
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,445
- (laughter)
- Come. I'll prove it to you logically.

61
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,524
Good, Cornelius.

62
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:37,368
Oh, but you've made a mistake here.
You have put a b in place ofthe second p.

63
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,331
Teacher, have you forgotten your own name?

64
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:47,202
Everyone has always called me "Teacher" -
I had forgotten. "Ape shall never kill Abe."

65
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,603
Thank you, Cornelius.
That was a very kind thought.

66
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:55,401
Gorillas? All right, Aldo,
let's start with you.

67
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,928
General Aldo.

68
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:11,962
With respect, General Aldo, this is barely
legible and will have to be written again.

69
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:16,205
Your capital A leans over
like a tent in a high wind!

70
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,122
And your capital K...

71
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:28,647
"Ape shall never kill Abe."

72
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,852
No, Aldo, no!

73
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:39,846
Teacher! Teacher!
You have spoken the unspeakable!

74
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,848
In all our years of slavery, "no" was
the one word we were conditioned to fear.

75
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,926
Caesar has forbidden you
its utterance in perpetuity.

76
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:52,564
An ape may say no to a human, but
a human may never again say no to an ape.

77
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:58,327
Tell him you're sorry, Abe, and go home.
I'll put in a good word for you with Caesar.

78
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:09,810
General Aldo, I'm... I'm sorry. The writing
you destroyed was by Caesar's son!

79
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:13,886
- I did not want you to suffer Caesar's anger.
- What do I care for Caesar's anger?

80
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,964
Let me give you a taste of mine!

81
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:40,081
Stop him!

82
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:52,602
Get him! Get the teacher!

83
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,961
Stop! Stop!

84
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,123
We'll teach the teacher a lesson.

85
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:11,888
Throw him in the corral,
where all humans belong.

86
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,563
I said stop, Aldo!

87
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:22,043
He broke the law. With his own mouth,
he broke the First Law.

88
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,045
- Iam the law. What has he done?
- Caesar!

89
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,169
Um... I, um...

90
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:30,844
I was there. Teacher only
reverted to type under provocation.

91
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:34,846
He... he spoke like a slavemaster
in the old days of our servitude,...

92
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:38,369
..when we were conditioned
to mechanical obedience.

93
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:41,047
He uttered a negative, uh, imperative.

94
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,567
Could you put that into words
which even Caesar could understand?

95
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:49,328
Uh... He said "No, Aldo, no."

96
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,926
(grunts)

97
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,846
- The schoolroom was wrecked.
- The class is ended.

98
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,130
The schoolroom is closed.
Now we go back to riding horses!

99
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:01,002
Aldo!

100
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:05,208
You and your friends
will return to the schoolroom...

101
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,247
..and put it back in order.

102
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,485
Abe, no gorilla is to be dismissed
until everything is back in its place.

103
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,564
- Yes, Caesar.
- Father?

104
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:20,612
Since there won't be any more
school today, may I go out and play?

105
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,562
- Hm. Well, can't you study in the house?
- I could, Father, but...

106
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:29,613
Run along and play.

107
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:35,607
Where are my students? I was in the midst
of explaining my theory of time relativity.

108
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,684
- If Caesar permits, I would like to...
- Caesar permits.

109
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,493
- You look concerned, MacDonald.
- I am, Caesar.

110
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:48,043
I think that Aldo's hatred
is not confined to humans.

111
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:55,092
Look out!

112
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,730
I think Aldo may be riding for a fall.

113
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:11,562
Oh, if only my mother and father,
whom I was too young to remember,...

114
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:13,484
..if only they'd lived.

115
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:18,249
Perhaps they would have taught me
if it was right to kill evil...

116
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,642
..so that good should prevail.

117
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,167
But you know, Caesar, history shows...

118
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:28,247
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Now that is
human history, not ape history.

119
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,608
Ape never kills ape.

120
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:37,723
Oh, uh, here's the list
of our winter supplies... so far.

121
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,408
Well, I've gotta be getting along.
I'm starving. I could eat a horse.

122
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:44,485
- A horse?
- Oh! You remember Lisa. (laughs)

123
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:48,532
They used to eat lots ofthings.
Dead cattle, dead chickens, dead pigs.

124
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,685
Now we live and chew nuts...

125
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:54,845
..at our masters' command.

126
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,242
- That will be all, Julie.
- Thank you.

127
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,922
We are not your masters.

128
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,842
We're not your equals.

129
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,724
MacDonald,...

130
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:13,204
..l believe that when you truly
grow to know and trust a person,...

131
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,284
..you cannot help but like him.

132
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:20,128
When we grow to know and trust your
people, then we shall all be equals -

133
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,205
and remain so until the end ofthe world.

134
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,524
- Which may be sooner than you think.
- You are such a pessimist!

135
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:31,129
- Or a prophet?
- Well, now that apes are at the helm,...

136
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:34,603
..Earth will sail safely through space
until the end of time.

137
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,763
And Virgil says "Time has no end."

138
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:38,889
So you see, I cannot believe you.

139
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,849
Would you believe it if you heard it
from the lips of your own parents?

140
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,852
- Are my parents alive?
- No.

141
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,970
But their images and their voices are.

142
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,410
MacDonald! When you talk about my parents,
please do not speak in riddles.

143
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:02,806
I cannot see or hear them. They came out of
the future. They cannot give me knowledge.

144
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:08,650
Caesar... You can see them.
You can hear them.

145
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:12,282
- And they can give you knowledge.
- How?

146
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:15,288
Under the dead city where we once lived,...

147
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:21,050
..in the archives near the old command post,
there are tapes - sealed tapes -

148
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:25,445
of Cornelius and Zira being examined
by officials ofthe American government.

149
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:29,242
When my brother was Governor Breck's
assistant, he told me about them.

150
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,565
I know where they are. And I know
that they concern Earth's future,...

151
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,769
..from which your parents came.

152
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,811
Pah! But the city was flattened.
The bomb left nothing.

153
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,283
Except, I suspect,...

154
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:46,332
..the archives section - indeed,
many sections ofthe underground city...

155
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:50,565
..were designed to survive
the impact of a ten-megaton overblast.

156
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,726
- Then the tapes and pictures of my parents...
- Are still down there.

157
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,647
Oh...

158
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,849
Oh, MacDonald.

159
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,163
I want to see what they look like.

160
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,813
I... I suppose every orphan does.

161
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:10,052
I want to hear... what they thought and knew.

162
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,367
The city's radioactive.

163
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,284
Oh... Yeah, well, uh...

164
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:22,002
Let me see, who...
who is there among your people...

165
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:25,051
..who knows something about radioactivity?

166
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:28,250
- No one.
- Hm. Among mine?

167
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:35,404
Who knows everything about everything?

168
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,769
Oh... Oh.

169
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,321
Virgil. (chuckles)

170
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,643
Go and find him.

171
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,410
Lisa... you remember your parents.

172
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,610
I was too young when they died
to remember mine.

173
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:55,652
But I don't want to have to remember
my husband. I want to love him now.

174
00:18:55,733 --> 00:19:00,011
Mm-hm. Look, Virgil will be with us.
Now, we'll take good care.

175
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:06,011
Say goodbye to Cornelius.
I don't want him to know I'm afraid.

176
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,601
Cornelius?

177
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,444
Cornelius.

178
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,204
(whispers) Cornelius!

179
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,804
Father.

180
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:31,766
- I'm going on a journey.
- Mm... What will you bring me back?

181
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,487
What would you like?

182
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:40,169
Oh... More nuts for my squirrel.
He's growing fast.

183
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,884
So are you.

184
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,968
One day you will be as tall as a king.

185
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,690
Mandemus?

186
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:59,812
- He's asleep.
- Not eternally, I trust?

187
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:01,884
Mandemus!

188
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,883
- Who's there?
- Caesar.

189
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:16,763
- What does Caesar want?
- Weapons.

190
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:21,165
- For what purpose?
- Self-protection in the pursuit of knowledge.

191
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:26,084
- Self-protection against whom or what?
- We don't know.

192
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:30,724
Why protect yourself against a danger
of which you have no knowledge,...

193
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,281
..in pursuit of a knowledge
you do not possess?

194
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,364
Oh, God!

195
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,606
- Is it a knowledge for good or evil?
- All knowledge is for good.

196
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:45,049
Only the use to which you put it
can be good or evil.

197
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,528
- Well put.
- Thank you.

198
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:52,762
Uh, the sun is rising. I should like to
get this matter settled before it sets.

199
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:56,808
Caesar has appointed me
not only as the keeper ofthis armoury,...

200
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:58,963
..but as the keeper of his own conscience.

201
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:04,650
That is why I have asked six boring
questions, and propose to ask a seventh...

202
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:08,885
..before issuing or not issuing
the weapons you require.

203
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:13,125
What is the nature ofthe knowledge
you cannot seek without weapons?

204
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:18,128
The knowledge of Earth's ultimate fate,
recorded on tapes in the forbidden city.

205
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:22,604
Which is contaminated,
but still may be inhabited by humans.

206
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:25,366
Hm... Come in.

207
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:34,246
- Name your protective pick.
- (Caesar) Three sub-machine-guns.

208
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,086
- For?
- The removal of obstacles.

209
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,044
Hm.

210
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,684
One,...

211
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,324
..two,...

212
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,289
- ..and three. Now what?
- Uh, ammunition.

213
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,728
Oh.

214
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:56,284
I really don't hold with knowing the future -
even my own, which is short.

215
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:58,364
Uh, a Geiger counter.

216
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:03,368
If we knew for a fact there was an afterlife,
and that the afterlife was bliss eternal,...

217
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:07,765
..we'd all commit suicide
in order to be able to enjoy it.

218
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,563
Pistols.

219
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:15,532
- To remove smaller obstacles?
- It's a three-day journey.

220
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:20,368
With Caesar's permission, MacDonald
may want to shoot, cook and eat a rabbit.

221
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,843
But who needs three pistols
to shoot one rabbit?

222
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:29,285
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

223
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,808
He may be old,
but he's got a mind like a razor.

224
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,123
When I was a boy, he was my teacher.

225
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:40,205
Let's collect our stores
and be on our way, huh?

226
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,806
There it is... or was.

227
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,204
Like a storm at sea, but solidified.

228
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:48,922
By a bomb from an armoury
1,000 times the size of ours.

229
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,732
And nobody to keep its owner's conscience.

230
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,568
This is the hell
my forefathers used to speak about.

231
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,047
(Geiger counter clicking)

232
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,407
Do you know where we are, MacDonald?

233
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:16,647
Yes. Now, this is...
I mean was, 11th Avenue.

234
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:20,085
Ape Management was
two blocks east from here.

235
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:25,283
Uh, the archive section, two blocks west -
corner of Breck and Ackerman.

236
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,728
Get us there quickly.

237
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,484
The Governor's very irritable lately.

238
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:08,009
Who wouldn't be, living in this
hell of radiation all these years?

239
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:13,208
If the bomb hadn't killed the old governor,
boredom certainly would have.

240
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:16,205
Alma, I just want
somebody to talk to. Anybody.

241
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,725
We are at best brave
and at worst mad to be here.

242
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:27,721
This background radiation alone
will give us 300 roentgens per hour.

243
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:29,246
Meaning?

244
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:34,566
That unless we leave this place
within two hours, we shall become... inmates.

245
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:37,929
Oh, this is a ghost city.
I want to put some flesh on it.

246
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,288
Radioactive flesh?

247
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:46,932
Well, we're all radiated,
but at least we're active.

248
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:52,610
(rapid clicking)

249
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:55,253
Getting stronger. We must hurry.

250
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,404
- (bleeping)
- Oh! Governor, look!

251
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:07,485
- F6! F6!
- What now?

252
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:13,442
Alert Mendez.

253
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:17,446
Men... Oh! Mendez to Control Room!
Mendez to Control Room!

254
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:19,967
Mendez to ControIRoom!

255
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,562
Somebody's breached
the warning system at F6.

256
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:27,929
- One of our scavengers.
- No. It's been locked for years.

257
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,722
- It must have been someone else.
- Impossible. There is no one else.

258
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:34,122
Mendez, we have to act, and act quickly!

259
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:35,972
- Alma?
- Yes, sir?

260
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,362
Work the B console.

261
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:41,365
Quick, Mendez, quick! Quick!

262
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:44,486
No, quicker! Faster!

263
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:54,369
Keep going... No, no. Back. Back.

264
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,084
This is the place.

265
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:06,604
That's Caesar,...

266
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:10,446
..come back to reconquer his kingdom.

267
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,445
Doesn't he know that the bomb did that?

268
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:27,928
We're still all right.

269
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,004
This way.

270
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:34,367
Quicker! Quicker!

271
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:37,924
There! Hold it!

272
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:41,412
Can anything live down here?
I mean, for long?

273
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:45,202
Oh, yes. But in the end, not recognisably.

274
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:50,930
The black man is the brother
of my predecessor's personal assistant.

275
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:54,371
He supervised the archives.

276
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:57,971
I don't think I know the orangutan.

277
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,723
- Look!
- It's been there for years.

278
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,204
The late governor had this whole place
equipped with cameras.

279
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,046
To forestall ape conspiracies, as I remember.

280
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:20,570
Hm. Archives.
We haven't been in there since, uh...

281
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:24,725
I wonder what the devil they want in there!

282
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:31,570
We'll find the tape we're looking for under
the heading of "Presidential Commission".

283
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:50,522
"Proceedings ofthe Presidential
Commission on Alien Visitors, 1973."

284
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:55,281
- Is this it?
- Let's see.

285
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,522
Yes, that's it. Now, if this thing works,...

286
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:02,401
..the picture should come out
on that screen over there.

287
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:12,606
All security forces, alert.
All security forces, alert.

288
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:16,129
Check outallsections in areas M5.

289
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:18,852
Apprehend three strangers you will fiind there.

290
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:23,927
One human and two apes.
But caution. Irepeat, caution.

291
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:28,169
If they resist, you may shoot.
But shoot to maim.

292
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:31,051
We want them alive for interrogation.

293
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,523
If we shoot, we break 12 years of peace.

294
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,522
Yes, it has been rather boring, hasn't it?

295
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:46,770
My mother!

296
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:52,246
- Who won your war?
- It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas' war.

297
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:57,130
The date meter on the spaceship.
What diditreadafterEarth's destruction?

298
00:30:57,213 --> 00:31:00,046
39... 50.

299
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,964
And you talk to your pupils about eternity.

300
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:09,164
There are only three.

301
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:11,528
There must be more. But how many?

302
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:14,491
That's the question we'll have answered
when we get them.

303
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,324
My father!

304
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,329
That's my father.

305
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,326
- How did apes acquire the power of speech?
- Theylearned to refuse.

306
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:27,132
On a historic day,
there came an ape who spoke a word...

307
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:30,683
..which had been spoken to him
time withoutnumberbyhumans.

308
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,764
He said "No!"

309
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:43,524
No wonder all mankind thirsted for my blood
and wanted my birth aborted.

310
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:46,446
In the year 3950, apes will destroy the Earth!

311
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:49,047
Uh, not apes. Gorillas.

312
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:53,285
- Besides, that's only one future.
- How can there be more than one?

313
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:55,603
You remember the old motorways?

314
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:58,526
I believe that time
is like an endless motorway,...

315
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:03,323
..with an infinite number of lanes
all running from the past into the future.

316
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:08,123
It follows that a driver would try
to change his lanes and change his future.

317
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:13,969
If you left this room right now,
you might wind up shot. Dead.

318
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:17,887
If you left a minute later, you might survive.

319
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:22,890
It's a blind choice, but you can change lanes.

320
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,971
I know what it is l want to change.

321
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:34,124
(metallic thud)

322
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:38,972
(movement)

323
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:43,843
The camera. It moved.

324
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,407
Are you sure?

325
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,645
Virgil's right.

326
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:55,524
Governor? We just lost the TV monitor.
Our 8-41 archive.

327
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:59,845
- I'm not interested in equipment failures.
- It wasn't a failure. It was destroyed.

328
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:25,611
- We have to find another way out.
- Is there another way?

329
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:34,971
They gotpastyou?! Then shoot on sight.
Never mindaboutbringing them here.

330
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:38,841
Just get them! Don't let anyone escape alive!

331
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,405
Sections M5 and R7 and 8!

332
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:46,324
Form a group here. Quick, quick!
All right, move out. Move!

333
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:48,722
Move! Move!

334
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:51,611
Hurry! Run!

335
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,684
Run!

336
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:58,528
Now you've got your guns,
we need another patrol quickly.

337
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:00,729
Quickly, men! Hurry! Hurry!

338
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:03,611
The rest of you,
take your weapons and go to M5.

339
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,923
Go! Go! What are you waiting for?

340
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,966
To R8!

341
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:20,566
All forces go to exit level 3.

342
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:22,803
They're getting away. Kill them.

343
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:25,088
Kill them! Kill them!

344
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:27,605
You knew every bolt and nut
in those corridors.

345
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,403
You have a hundred armed men.
How could you let them escape?

346
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:34,406
They were fast... and smart, Governor Kolp.

347
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:38,372
Many of my men were sick.
And the... chimp surprised us.

348
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:41,531
Yeah... He surprised me too, once.

349
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,213
But he's an animal. He's only an animal.

350
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:48,047
No, Governor, he's more than an animal.
He can speak.

351
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,132
- So can they all.
- So speech makes them human?

352
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:53,204
Speech makes them intelligent.

353
00:38:53,293 --> 00:38:56,524
And intelligence may make them
not human, but humane.

354
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,889
- Perhaps they came in peace.
- Oh, idiot. They were armed.

355
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:04,967
From what we saw on the monitor, only for
self-protection. Let them return in peace.

356
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:07,443
- To where?
- To wherever they live.

357
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:12,049
So that they can come back and exterminate
those of us the bomb has not exterminated?

358
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:15,410
- Where do they live?
- They came with few provisions.

359
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:18,053
- It can't be too far.
- Which way did they head?

360
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:21,364
- They headed north, Governor.
- Organise scout parties.

361
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:24,889
Assemble workable equipment
and follow them to their camp.

362
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,248
Yes, Governor Kolp.

363
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,604
Why, Governor?

364
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:34,051
So that we can exterminate them.

365
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:44,682
- It's Caesar!
- What a welcome.

366
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,731
- We should have stayed in the city.
- The city is forbidden.

367
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:50,771
- I know. Iforbade it.
- Then why?

368
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:55,808
If a king forbids his subjects to wear a crown,
that doesn't mean he can't wear one himself.

369
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,044
Caesar is Caesar.
He went to the city for a reason.

370
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,442
What reason?

371
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,252
I went looking for my past.

372
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,642
- But I found our future.
- (grunts)

373
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:08,856
Explain!

374
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:13,498
- You wouldn't understand.
- Aldo will make the future. With this!

375
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:18,621
Well then, Aldo may very soon be in the past.

376
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,262
(Virgil chuckles)

377
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,060
Argh!

378
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:38,902
Cornelius!

379
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:41,944
Cornelius, are you all right?

380
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:46,100
- No, Mother. I'm just dead.
- Dead?

381
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:49,656
- We were playing war.
- War?!

382
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:53,696
Cornelius, hasn't your father
explained to you that war is not a game?

383
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:54,663
Yes, Mother.

384
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:58,501
- And also forbidden you to play with guns?
- Yes, Mother.

385
00:40:58,587 --> 00:41:00,976
- Then you'll stop it.
- Yes, Mother.

386
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:05,023
Now come along. Father wants us.

387
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:28,335
My friends, I have convened this
extraordinary meeting ofthe council...

388
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:32,943
..in order that I may report
upon an action which I deemed necessary:

389
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:37,066
a reconnaissance expedition
to the forbidden city,...

390
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:40,503
..with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides.

391
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:42,782
Why MacDonald? Why not a soldier?

392
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:47,099
Because we went in peace
to what we thought would be a dead city.

393
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:50,941
But, in case there were some survivors,
we took MacDonald with us...

394
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:55,145
..so that he could parley with them
and secure permission for our search.

395
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:57,218
Survivors there are...

396
00:42:57,947 --> 00:43:00,620
Maimed,... mutated,...

397
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:04,464
...hostile... and human.

398
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,704
- Did the humans follow you here?
- We saw no sign of it.

399
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:11,816
But we must prepare for the day
when they may come out ofthe city,...

400
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:14,580
..when they may come to find us.

401
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,298
(hostile grunting)

402
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:22,097
No humans in council!
No humans in council!

403
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:25,099
(chanting) No! No! No! No!

404
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:39,145
Yes! They are here because I sent for them.

405
00:43:39,227 --> 00:43:42,185
Now that we know the danger,
we need their help and counsel.

406
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:44,462
No! No!

407
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:47,616
- Yes!
- Come.

408
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:50,858
We shall not sit in council with humans.

409
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:06,545
Now, let us reason together...

410
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:09,096
..and make plans.

411
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:14,301
Somewhere along the line of history,
this bloody chain reaction has got to stop.

412
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:20,257
A destroys B, B destroys C, C destroys A
and is destroyed by D, who destroys E.

413
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:24,465
Before anyone knows where they are,
there won't be anyone left to know anything.

414
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:27,778
Governor!
Governor, the captain has come back!

415
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,937
- We found it, Governor. We found Ape City.
- Where?

416
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:36,617
This... This is a gorilla outpost.

417
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:40,620
Below is a valley with orchards
and vineyards - enough to feed hundreds.

418
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:42,777
- Here is Ape City.
- Was it very large?

419
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:45,301
- It is of a size we can deal with.
- Were you seen?

420
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:50,620
No, sir. Caesar was busy with a council of
war. One day soon they'll be coming for us.

421
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:53,744
No, we're going after them - now.
You have your orders.

422
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,902
Caesar... On the Night ofthe Fires
you swore an oath...

423
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:05,345
..that in the future, apes and humans
would live together in kindness and peace.

424
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:09,136
Why are you now making every sort
of preparation to break that oath?

425
00:45:09,227 --> 00:45:11,741
Because, unlike the humans in our city,...

426
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:16,223
..those in the forbidden city are mad.

427
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:23,017
Mad enough not to want peace
and friendship, but enmity and war.

428
00:45:23,627 --> 00:45:25,822
- Did they tell you that?
- Oh, yes.

429
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:30,306
Yes. By opening fire on us
without giving us a chance to explain.

430
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:32,981
You were trespassing on their territory.

431
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:36,343
But Lisa, we didn't know
the city was inhabited.

432
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:40,659
But how, if you didn't speak to them,
do you know its inhabitants are mad?

433
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:44,264
Oh, Lisa, you didn't see them.

434
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:46,338
They're, um...

435
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:49,260
Oh, they're malformed.

436
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:52,896
Like the freaks in your foster father's circus?
Were they mad?

437
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:55,706
What's "malformed"?

438
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,778
Cornelius, go to bed.

439
00:45:57,867 --> 00:46:00,381
When I've given Ricky his water.

440
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:04,380
Lisa, freaks are different.

441
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:08,301
These humans are the end product
of nuclear radiation.

442
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,258
They're mutant,...

443
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:15,296
..and they're mad.

444
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:19,020
- Keep all emergency channels open.
- Yes, Governor.

445
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:21,496
All emergency channels will remain open.

446
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:24,818
If anything should miscarry,
I'll signal you as arranged.

447
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,659
Yes, sir.

448
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:29,336
Hurry, man! We need it.

449
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:40,738
The school bus will be operational, Governor.
The convoy will join us at junction C.

450
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:43,858
Get moving.

451
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:34,538
Ricky?

452
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:04,981
(Aldo) Without guns, we have no power.

453
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:10,778
We shall take the guns,
and we shall keep them.

454
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:13,778
They equal power!

455
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:16,980
Guns. Guns are power.

456
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,862
We are an elite. We are a superrace!

457
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,461
We have the right to lead!

458
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:28,981
Without us, there would be no army.

459
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:33,980
What is an army without guns?

460
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,862
We need power!

461
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:50,700
We deserve it. We deserve to have power.

462
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:55,185
We... need... power!

463
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:59,019
Guns! Guns!

464
00:48:59,107 --> 00:49:00,825
Guns are power!

465
00:49:01,707 --> 00:49:04,858
We shall get them, and we shall keep them.

466
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:08,223
With guns, we will smash the humans!

467
00:49:08,307 --> 00:49:10,298
(grunting)

468
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:12,384
All humans!

469
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:15,937
And then, we will smash Caesar!

470
00:49:16,427 --> 00:49:18,418
(twig snaps)

471
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:22,341
(grunts)

472
00:49:28,347 --> 00:49:30,019
Look!

473
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:38,865
- It's Caesar's son.
- And he overheard every word we said.

474
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:43,979
Cornelius... Come down.

475
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:49,900
Come down... or else!

476
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,257
Father...

477
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,858
Cornelius?

478
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:03,821
Father!

479
00:51:22,387 --> 00:51:24,343
(twig snaps)

480
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,498
(grunts)

481
00:51:39,547 --> 00:51:41,105
Cornelius!

482
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:20,418
I only heard about it this morning.
His squirrel is missing.

483
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:24,022
- He must have been out looking for it.
- How is Cornelius?

484
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,337
Hurt. He's badly hurt.

485
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:59,542
Speak the truth.

486
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:09,096
Even if we had a hospital...

487
00:54:13,907 --> 00:54:16,102
I'm not going to tell Caesar.

488
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:18,826
Not yet.

489
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,501
He still believes he can change the future.

490
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:39,776
Humans - going towards our city.

491
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:46,178
I'll get him.

492
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:17,423
Get ready to fire.

493
00:55:17,507 --> 00:55:19,145
Fire!

494
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:57,344
The doctor is doing her best.
I don't believe Cornelius can live.

495
00:55:57,427 --> 00:56:00,703
Caesar does. He...
he refuses to leave his side.

496
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:05,019
Oh, how can a benevolent God allow
the branch of one of His own trees to crack...

497
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,098
..and injure an innocent child?

498
00:56:07,187 --> 00:56:09,826
It didn't crack, Virgil. It was cut.

499
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,704
Order at council! Order!

500
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,665
Order! The humans are attacking!

501
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:20,946
They have killed one gorilla,
and they have wounded another.

502
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:22,380
Tell them.

503
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:26,426
We were scouting desert approaches
to the city and saw their army.

504
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:30,546
- They fired. My companion was killed.
- (gasps of disbelief)

505
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:34,381
- I have come to warn you.
- And how long before they get here?

506
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,856
Soon. So now we must prepare.

507
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:40,586
Take the humans out.
Lock them all in the corral.

508
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,181
Aldo! Aldo, you can't do this!

509
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:46,065
You're acting against Caesar's orders!

510
00:56:47,227 --> 00:56:49,616
Caesar... is not here.

511
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:06,457
Hey! What the...?

512
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:08,538
Hey!

513
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:13,460
Jake... Strong man.

514
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:17,027
Take him to the corral!

515
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:20,018
Take all humans to the corral!

516
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:25,347
Take all humans to the corral!

517
00:57:30,387 --> 00:57:32,617
All humans! Take them to the corral!

518
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:44,104
Where are you going?
Martial law has been declared.

519
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:47,623
- Everybody is to stay in their homes.
- By whose orders?

520
00:57:48,467 --> 00:57:50,185
Go home!

521
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,780
We want guns!

522
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:59,620
- Guns are power!
- (grunting)

523
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:02,267
Now we go and get guns!

524
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:05,066
- Mandemus!
- Who's there?

525
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:07,138
Aldo. GeneraIAldo.

526
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:12,097
- What do you want?
- Guns.

527
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:15,179
- Guns!
- What will you do with them?

528
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:19,624
- We shall do with them what we will.
- "Do what you will" is the Devil's law.

529
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:23,985
- And who are you, Mandemus? God?
- I am the keeper of Caesar's conscience!

530
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:28,822
- And I am the keeper of Caesar's army!
- Under allegiance to Caesar! Where is he?

531
00:58:28,907 --> 00:58:33,458
Mandemus, as I speak, our city is being
attacked by humans from without and within.

532
00:58:33,547 --> 00:58:36,345
- Who cares where Caesar is?!
- Icare!

533
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:41,103
There is a law that weapons may only be
issued under direct orders from Caesar,...

534
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:44,259
..not under threats from
a thick-headed subordinate,...

535
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:47,623
..for whom war means only personal glory!

536
00:58:47,707 --> 00:58:50,460
Now find me Caesar. I will listen to him.

537
00:58:50,787 --> 00:58:52,778
First, listen to this!

538
00:58:56,907 --> 00:58:59,262
Take every gun in the place! Everything!

539
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:02,259
Get the ammo boxes!
Get the handguns, grenades.

540
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:06,306
Stop! Stop! Caesar forbids you!

541
00:59:19,107 --> 00:59:22,099
Well, there it is. Ape City.

542
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:25,384
When we leave, I don't want to see
one tree left standing,...

543
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:29,096
..two pieces of wood nailed together,
or anything left alive.

544
00:59:29,187 --> 00:59:32,736
I want it to look like...
that city we came from.

545
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:38,346
What the devil is all that rubbish down there?

546
00:59:38,427 --> 00:59:43,547
Some sort of barricade, sir. Nothing that
a couple offlame bombs won't take care of.

547
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:02,904
Caesar, forgive me, but I couldn't
get here before now. Aldo has seized power.

548
01:00:02,987 --> 01:00:06,138
He's broken into the armoury
and imprisoned all humans.

549
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:10,220
- MacDonald?
- He was dragged away by Aldo's gorillas.

550
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:16,979
I can't leave Cornelius. He needs me.

551
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:19,740
Every ape and human in Ape City needs you.

552
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:21,818
Now.

553
01:00:21,907 --> 01:00:24,899
I, uh... I think you should go to Cornelius.

554
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:35,662
Father?

555
01:00:35,747 --> 01:00:38,944
They... hurt me.

556
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:45,665
They... want... to hurt you.

557
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:51,501
Who hurt you?

558
01:00:51,587 --> 01:00:53,782
The humans?

559
01:00:54,627 --> 01:00:56,618
No...

560
01:00:57,627 --> 01:01:00,187
Then who?

561
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,658
Shall...

562
01:01:06,187 --> 01:01:09,577
Shall I be... malformed?

563
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:15,898
No.

564
01:01:18,187 --> 01:01:20,542
One day...

565
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:23,937
..you are going to be as tall as a king.

566
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:23,581
Captain, lay the smoke screen, and when
I give the signal, start the bombardment.

567
01:02:24,427 --> 01:02:28,818
Men and equipment out ofthe bus!
Deploy your weapons, quickly!

568
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:34,502
- All is in order, sir.
- All right, let's go.

569
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,544
He said they hurt him. Who?

570
01:02:52,827 --> 01:02:55,546
Who would hurt him?

571
01:02:55,627 --> 01:02:59,381
I think you'll have your answer... and soon.

572
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:04,706
What do you know?

573
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:06,778
That's what I know.

574
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:37,465
- You did this!
- For security.

575
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,141
Did you raid the armoury
for the same reason?

576
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:43,378
- For security!
- Caesar! Caesar!

577
01:03:45,507 --> 01:03:50,501
I order you to stop this! I order you to
stop it now and release those people!

578
01:03:56,227 --> 01:03:58,582
See? Aldo was right!

579
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,306
War has come! Let's go!

580
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:34,345
Go to the barricade! To the barricade!

581
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,296
Come on! Go to the barricade!

582
01:06:10,787 --> 01:06:13,460
They're laying a smoke screen!

583
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:26,896
Here they come.

584
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:57,545
- Where's Aldo?
- Probably the other side ofthe valley.

585
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:28,942
Hurry! Fall back! Fall back!

586
01:07:30,987 --> 01:07:33,660
Fall back! Go back to the village!

587
01:07:38,227 --> 01:07:41,458
Get away from the fire! Fall back! Hurry!

588
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:45,584
Flee the barricade! Fall back! Fall back!

589
01:07:46,507 --> 01:07:48,543
Get back to the village!

590
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:46,138
(shouts orders)

591
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:51,824
You can't stay here any longer.

592
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:54,740
You must save yourself.

593
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:04,496
(groaning)

594
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:13,657
Caesar!

595
01:10:17,787 --> 01:10:22,417
Your people weakened our city
by rebelling against your human masters.

596
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:27,186
But we who survive will create a new race.

597
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:29,816
And you and yours will be brought low.

598
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:34,104
And you shall learn again...

599
01:10:34,187 --> 01:10:37,384
..what it is to have a master.

600
01:10:38,587 --> 01:10:41,385
Ha! You're learning already.

601
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,741
Clever ape! (laughs)

602
01:10:48,627 --> 01:10:51,460
Oh, no!

603
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,344
Ape!

604
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:55,782
Clever ape.

605
01:10:57,347 --> 01:11:00,305
But then you always were... clever.

606
01:11:00,827 --> 01:11:03,944
I was told how you chose your own name.

607
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:08,180
But every Caesar must have his Brutus.
Did you know that, ape?

608
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:11,016
Do you understand that, ape?

609
01:11:12,547 --> 01:11:16,176
And now Ape City is about to lose its king.

610
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:19,538
No, Kolp! No!

611
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:25,978
Now! Fight like apes!

612
01:11:59,187 --> 01:12:02,497
No! Stop! No killing! Take them captive!

613
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:13,017
Let's get moving!

614
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:18,786
No! No, no, no! Don't kill them.
Take them prisoner.

615
01:12:27,947 --> 01:12:30,302
No.

616
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,537
No, Virgil.

617
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:47,187
All right, Virgil.

618
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:49,542
Let's go home.

619
01:12:55,147 --> 01:12:58,184
No prisoners! No prisoners!

620
01:13:10,627 --> 01:13:12,618
Dismount!

621
01:13:36,227 --> 01:13:38,104
Caesar! Caesar!

622
01:13:41,787 --> 01:13:43,778
Hail Caesar!

623
01:14:04,467 --> 01:14:07,106
Let the humans go, Virgil. All ofthem.

624
01:14:07,187 --> 01:14:09,178
No!

625
01:14:23,427 --> 01:14:28,820
- They stay. Aldo says what we do now.
- They have done nothing. They shall go free.

626
01:14:28,907 --> 01:14:30,898
You like humans?

627
01:14:30,987 --> 01:14:32,978
You want them out ofthe corral?

628
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:35,183
All right. Kill them!

629
01:14:35,907 --> 01:14:37,784
Kill them.

630
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:41,538
Kill them all!

631
01:14:42,347 --> 01:14:44,497
Stop! Stop!

632
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,141
No more killing, Aldo.
Put down your weapons.

633
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:51,378
- Take them back to the armoury.
- No! We shall keep the guns!

634
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:55,585
- Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you!
- (grunting)

635
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,864
Ape has never killed ape,...

636
01:15:20,947 --> 01:15:23,063
..let alone an ape child.

637
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,098
(grunting)

638
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:36,137
Aldo has killed an ape child.

639
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:38,297
The branch did not break.

640
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:40,981
It was cut... with a sword.

641
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,658
(menacing grunts)

642
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:07,221
Aldo...

643
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:09,775
You... You killed...

644
01:16:13,627 --> 01:16:15,857
Aldo killed.

645
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,619
(gibbering)

646
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:22,345
Aldo has broken our most sacred law.

647
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:30,180
Our child... You killed our child.

648
01:16:30,347 --> 01:16:32,986
What's the matter with them?

649
01:16:33,587 --> 01:16:36,738
I guess you might say
they just joined the human race.

650
01:16:36,827 --> 01:16:41,264
(apes chanting) Ape has killed ape.
Ape has killed ape.

651
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:44,301
Ape has killed ape.

652
01:16:44,547 --> 01:16:46,777
Ape has killed ape.

653
01:16:47,027 --> 01:16:49,063
Ape has killed ape.

654
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:51,656
Ape has killed ape.

655
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,898
Ape has killed ape.

656
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:56,498
Ape has killed ape.

657
01:16:57,187 --> 01:16:59,178
Ape has killed ape!

658
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:04,338
Ape has killed ape! Ape has killed ape!

659
01:17:04,827 --> 01:17:09,218
Ape has killed ape! Ape has killed ape!

660
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:12,535
Ape has killed ape!

661
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:16,381
Ape has killed ape! Ape has killed ape!

662
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:22,103
Ape has killed ape! Ape has killed ape!

663
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:24,897
Ape has killed ape!

664
01:17:25,147 --> 01:17:27,138
Ape has killed ape!

665
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,057
Ape has killed ape!

666
01:17:30,307 --> 01:17:32,298
Ape has killed ape!

667
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:34,982
Ape has killed ape!

668
01:17:35,307 --> 01:17:37,298
Ape has killed ape!

669
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:40,462
Ape has killed ape!

670
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:42,777
Ape has killed ape!

671
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:45,058
Ape has killed ape!

672
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:35,067
You murdered my son!

673
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:37,701
You murdered my son!

674
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:40,461
You murdered my son!

675
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:46,822
No!

676
01:18:50,347 --> 01:18:52,861
(snarls)

677
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:05,021
Aaargh!

678
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:18,825
Should one murder be avenged by another?

679
01:19:18,907 --> 01:19:23,219
Only the future can tell.
So let us start building it.

680
01:19:50,227 --> 01:19:55,096
If we appear to be lacking in gratitude,
Caesar, what have we to be grateful for?

681
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:58,463
If you mean to set us free,
then free us completely.

682
01:19:59,387 --> 01:20:03,585
- What do you mean?
- We are not your children, Caesar.

683
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:06,579
We have a destiny too. As equals.

684
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:10,104
Respecting each other.
Living together, with love.

685
01:20:10,187 --> 01:20:12,417
Love?

686
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:15,340
The human way is violence and death.

687
01:20:15,787 --> 01:20:18,585
Aldo wasn't... human,...

688
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:20,658
..was he, Caesar?

689
01:20:23,147 --> 01:20:25,138
Virgil...

690
01:20:26,227 --> 01:20:29,902
You are a good and wise ape.

691
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:38,019
And you, Caesar, are a good and wise king.

692
01:20:38,387 --> 01:20:41,220
We'll rebuild what's ruined and begin again.

693
01:20:42,187 --> 01:20:46,180
Tell me something, MacDonald.
Can we make the future what we wish?

694
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:49,100
I've heard that it's possible, Caesar.

695
01:20:56,867 --> 01:21:00,257
There. Every weapon
is back in its proper place.

696
01:21:01,307 --> 01:21:03,821
Caesar, I want to ask a favour.

697
01:21:04,507 --> 01:21:06,896
This armoury's been my home for 27 years.

698
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,103
You may live in it for the rest of your days.

699
01:21:09,187 --> 01:21:12,179
But I don't want to live in it. No, no.

700
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:17,580
Now that the danger is over,
I want to see it destroyed, blown up.

701
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:21,421
The greatest danger of all
is that danger never ends.

702
01:21:22,707 --> 01:21:25,744
And so, Mandemus,...

703
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:29,103
..we must be patient... and wait.

704
01:21:30,387 --> 01:21:32,617
We still wait, my children.

705
01:21:34,147 --> 01:21:36,217
But as I look at apes and humans...

706
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:40,936
..living in friendship, harmony and at peace...

707
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:45,496
..now, some 600 years after Caesar's death,...

708
01:21:45,587 --> 01:21:48,420
..at least we wait with hope for the future.

709
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:51,783
Lawgiver, who knows about the future?

710
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:56,661
Perhaps only the dead.
