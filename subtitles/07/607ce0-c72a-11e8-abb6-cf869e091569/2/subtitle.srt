00:55:52,492 --> 00:55:54,084
from that atorm ahelter.

373
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:57,228

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,750
when Curtla geta back,
he'll need to take more tlme than that.

What doea that mean?

384
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:31,627

handa-on therapy at a real faclllty.

385
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:39,293
You mean I have to leave my famlly.
