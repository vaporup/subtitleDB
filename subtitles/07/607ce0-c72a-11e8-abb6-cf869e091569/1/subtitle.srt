So If you continue with the basic voeebulary,

111
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,081
this will allow you to communicate
with your children better.

00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,916
Between the ages of four and seven,

00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,285
the focus ls more on the sign.

114
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,593

115
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,793

116
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,333
Now, In ASL,

00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,738

That's more than I want to spend.

154
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,163
This Is all hand stltched.
It takes a really long time.

155
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,496
That's why I charge that.

156
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,228

157
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,997

We Just gotta work It like this

166
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,203

169
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,482

170

I said If he didn't do anything,
why did you have to put him outside?

172
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,466
I Just wanted him to be outside for a while.

173
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,628
He's your dog.
He's always been an Inside dog.

174
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,433
He's my dog, that's why he's outslde.

175
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,869
Look,

176
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:46,245
right now with Hannah and everything,
ljust thlnk It'd be better.

177
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,145
- Hannah loves Red.
- Hold on.

178
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,516
...the gee cloud spread across
their six-acre property.

179
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,060
The only way off their land
was across the train tracks,

180
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,292
which were blocked by wreckage.

181
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:02,094
i tried using some wet rags
and some towels to breathe through,

182
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,896
but that just seemed to make it worse.

183
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,600
While rescue workers made several attempts
to reach the family,

184
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,199
Waiter Jacobs' wife and brother-in-iaw died
in the home.

185
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:16,879
Jacobs survived despite enduring ff hours
of exposure to the gas cloud...

186
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,176
You hearing this?

187
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,649
It's awful.

188
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,220
Eleven hours.

189
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,955
No way out.

212
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,555

00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,627
Just go.

215
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,972
Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her.

216
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,928
We're going out.

217
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,308
We're going out. Okay?

218
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:26,131
It's okay. It's okay.

00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,564
You stay put, okay?

220
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,593
Let's Just start.

221
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,930
Let's all Join hands for the blessing.

222
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,579
- Where the hell have you been?
- I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an errand.

223
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,879
- You're really late.
- I know.

224
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,614
You didn't even bring your cell phone.

225
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,265
Missed you at church this morning, Curtls.

226
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,599
He knows what to do
If he wants me to stop asking.

227
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,939
Was It a good service?

228
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,634
It was. It was good work.

229
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,778
I'm thinking about cleaning up
that storm shelter out back.

230
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,980
Curtls?

231
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,621
- Curtls, how you doing, bud?
- Hey, Doc.

232
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,526
- How's my girl?
- She's good.

233
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,531
That's good to hear.
Tllt your head back for me.

234
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,590
I don't have a cold.

235
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,365
- Dld she get that down wrong?
- No, I Just told her that.

236
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,404
So what's the problem?

237
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,772
I've been having...

238
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,636
I've been having some trouble sleeping.

239
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,148
I was hoping
you could give me something for It.

240
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,447
How long's this been going on?

241
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,481
About four nights now.

242
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,215
You're not sleeping at all?

243
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,519
Well, some, but real restless.

244
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,885
Well, lthlnk four nights
Is a little too soon to tell.

245
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,593
My advice would be to not eat
or drink anything after 0:00 at night.

246
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,831
Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
tobacco, eaffelne.

247
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,741
Get some dally exercise.

248
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,002
Well, I think...

249
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,576
- I think I might need to try some medlcetlon.
- Why do you say that?

250
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,985
The reason I've been having trouble sleeping
ls these dreams I've been having.

251
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,755
I didn't think It was anything at ﬁrst,
but then the other day I woke up

252
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,628
and the bed was wet.

253
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,067
- You urlnated In your bed?
- Yeah.

254
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,907
Couple days before that,
I had a dream that my dog attacked me

255
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,411
and It took all day
for the pain In my arm to go away.

256
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,013
You been out to see your mother lately?

257
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,519
It's been about a month.

258
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,819
Okay.

259
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:08,696
Okay. This Is a prescription
for a pretty mlld sedative.

260
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,898
It's non-habit formlng,

261
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,465
but I'm only giving you enough
for a few days anyway.

262
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,478
Take It and see If It helps. In the meantime,

263
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,107
this Is the number of a good friend of mine
In Columbus. He's a psychiatrist.

264
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,647
It's a drive, but he's the best I know.

265
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,215
Okay.

266
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,550
I'll give him a sell
and let him know you'll be down to see him.

267
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,293
All right.

268
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,573
- Hey, Dewart.
- What you say, Curtls?

269
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,910
Not much.

270
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,013
They want us
to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch.

271
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,917
I ﬁgure worse comes to worse,
we een eat on the rig.

272
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,888
Yeah, we'll get It done. Weekend all right?

273
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,321

274
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:06,726
No. No, I need the name of the specialist
whose dlagnosls you'll accept.

275
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,762

Just sell and make an appointment.

Now If this doctor signs off,

284
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,857

fully covered.

285
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,465
I'm sorry It took so long.

286
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,097

288

You know, your husband's company actually
has very good Insurance when It kicks In.

289
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,175
Not a lot of Jobs offer pollcles half as good.
You're very lucky.

Green? How about a red?

297
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,446
It was like talking to a sane person for once.

298
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,617
She made one phone eell. That's It.

299

I've been trying that 000 number

Honey, look at this one.

309
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:03,106
It's a 2-1, and It sits directly on the beach.

310
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,933
Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have

You sleep well?

314
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,317
Yeah. I did.

315
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,545
You look like you're feeling better.

316
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,326
You want me to come there and do It for you?

317
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,556
Jesus.

318
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,626
Hey, how much food you think you'd need
to live on for a week?

319
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,134
- What do you mean?
- I mean to stay alive.

320
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,501
What do you think you'd need?

321
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,132
- Not a lot.
- Yeah? You think?

322
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,470
I don't know.

323
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:50,139
You hear about people living for days
all the time off bark and melted snow.

324
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,207
I've never heard of that.

325
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,015
Shit, I don't know. You asked the question.

326
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,078
It's on there.

327
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,817
It's on. Come on.

328
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,897
Damn It.

329
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,460
What?

330
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,771
It sounds like thunder.

331
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,630
What sounds like thunder?

332
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,205
What's the matter with you, Curtls?

333
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,718

I'm gonna get some water.

338
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,586
You want some?

339
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,021
Isn't she lovely?

340
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,564
- Mom?
- Yes?

341
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,767
I need to ask you something.

342
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,907
Do you remember what year
we brought you up here?

343
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,710
To the ﬁrst place.

344
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,819
It was '00.

345
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,424
Yes. Beeause Kyle was going to be a senior.

346
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,554
- l was 10.
- Yes.

347
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:09,371
Can you remember what happened
before you got diagnosed?

348
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,533
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

349
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,740
I Just want to know how It all started.

350
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,814
Before you had to leave.

351
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,178
I don't know.

352
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,624
I remember It was a real stressful tlme.

353
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,368
Your father was gone a lot,

354
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,833
and I couldn't handle things on my own.

355
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,977
Did you ever have any

356
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,278
dreams?

357
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,282
lee, bad dreams?

358
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,380
No. Nothing like that.

359
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,091
There was always...

360
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,594
There was always a panic

361
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,139
that took hold of me.

362
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,679
I thought people were watching me
and listening to me.

363
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,914
It's all right. It's ﬁne.

364
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,960
Are you okay?

365
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,022
Yeah.

366
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,324
Yeah. I'm ﬁne.

367
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,744

for Dr. George Shannan?

368
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,907

369
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,680

370
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,883

00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,787

373
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:23,865
IJust... I don't think I een make It
to Columbus to see that psychiatrist.

374
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,339
Yeah, It's Just too far.

375
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,375
Is there somewhere loeel
you could send me?

376
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,026
Hey.

377
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,964

00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,573
It's okay.

380

Where you been?

381
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,542
I went to see Mom.

382
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,384
Is she okay?

383
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,217
Yeah. I Just wanted to check up on her.

384
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,218
You should've told me,
we would have gone with you.

385
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,886
No, that's okay.

386
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,466
Come to bed.

387
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,762
lwlll In a bit.

388
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,938
Well, you've kept up with the payments
on the house.

389
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,878
We've been good about that.

390
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,045
I gotta tell you, Curtis, banks aren't
loanlng money the way they used to.

391
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,520
We've got you a loan today,
but the Interest rates are variable.

392
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,988
We have to tie It to your house.

393
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,457
That's ﬁne.

394
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,492
Curtis, I've known you a long time.

395
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,657
Financed your house for you, two vehicles.

396
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:33,032
I'm telling you,
this Is a risky loan you're taking.

397
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,671
I need the money, John.

398
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,234

404
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,879
You need another burner?

405
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,946
Yeah, If you still got yours, I could use It.

406
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,933
Hey, you think you could help me

407
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,160

I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter
In my backyard. I could use some help.

409
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,437
The hell you wanna do that for?

410
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,707
Just needs to be done.

411
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,376
What do you need?

412
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:56,879
I ﬁgure I'll do It on a Saturday,

- Yeah, ljust need a backhoe, a hauler.

414
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,387

417
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,115
I Just don't wanna see you fuck up.

418
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:34,885
I'm not.

419
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,363
Come In.

420
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,205
- Have a seat. I'm Kendra.
- Curtls.

421
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,370
Okay.

422
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,485
I'm gonna start
by asking you some questions.

423
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,080
Okay. I already answered
all the questions on the form.

424
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:11,588
Yeah, I know. I looked at them,
but I need to get a proﬁle started on you.

425
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,595
nght. Well...

426
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:21,361
Out of the ﬁve posslble symptoms
needed to be diagnosed with schizophrenia,

427
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,704
disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms,

428
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,005
I've had two.

429
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,590
So, I took this quiz In the back of the book.

430
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,991
I scored a ﬁve out of a possible 20.

431
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,056
Schlzophrenla starts at 12. So...

432
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,832
They say It might be
a brief psychotic disorder.

433
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,103
Yeah. Whatever It Is,
I need to know what to do

434
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,306
or what to get on
to get this thing under control.

435
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,817
Look. I'm a counselor.

436
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:13,580
Certlﬂed, but I'm not a psychiatrist.
I een't prescrlbe anything to you.

437
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:17,559
I een talk to you,
I een recommend where to send you,

438
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,117
but that's It.

439
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:26,828
Now, that said, If you want to talk, I'll llsten.

440
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,400
For a lot of people, that's a good start.

441
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,236
Now you said here

442
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:39,476
that your mother was diagnosed
with paranoid schlzophrenla In her 00s.

443
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,948
And you're at 05.

444
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,480
You wanna talk about that?

445
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,823
Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms.

446
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,586
lwasjust 10.

447
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,663
My brother was 11. And...

448
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,169
I don't know. She Just left me In the ear

449
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,270
In the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.

450
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,081
And she didn't come back.

451
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,421
And then they found her a week later

452
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,822
eating trash out of a dumpster
In Northern Kentucky.

453
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,791
My dad had to put her
In the State Hospital In Columbus.

454
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,696
And she's been In assisted living ever since.

455
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,465
Yep.

456
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,471
My dad raised me.

457
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,143
He died last April.

458
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,153
So tell me about these dreams.

459
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,433
I don't know what our schedule will be, but...

460
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,333
That's all right.

461
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,845
But I really do think you should
continue with the sign language.

462
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,272
And any additional therapies
that kids need for the cochlear Implant.

463
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,873
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

464
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,679
- Good night.
- Good night.
