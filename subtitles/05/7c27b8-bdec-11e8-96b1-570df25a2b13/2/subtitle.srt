1
00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:05,491
Your father must be teaching
you more than just sashimi

2
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:15,832
This kind of energy
doesn´t suit you anyway

3
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:55,011
Luckily,
your teacher likes sushi

4
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:04,586
Tell your father,

5
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:07,723
he doesn´t have to
come to school anymore

6
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,385
This teacher will share
your pain to the end

7
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:26,128
So this is what they mean by
tattered vital links

8
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,663
Whoever did this
had amazing technique

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,500
here´s no way
I can treat this

10
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,049
It was better when
there was no one to treat

11
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:53,891
Hey you!

12
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,176
You´re just muddying
the lake, catching no fish

13
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,738
The fish has transformed into a
dragon, ascended to the heavens

14
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,423
Expulsion is no fun

15
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,365
If you trash them because they´re
garbage, what will the world be like?

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,126
Expulsion,

17
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:34,030
Expulsion´s no fun?

18
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,669
That´s what incompetent
teachers with

19
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:38,104
nothing to teach
like to do

20
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,009
An "End-of-life certificate"?

21
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:50,279
Isn´t it hot?

22
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,830
Do you think they´re okay?

23
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,896
Don´t worry Surely they
won´t kill each other

24
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,310
Let´s get down to it

25
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,943
If I were at school,

26
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:23,145
I´d have blocked your vital
links before anyone else

27
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:28,087
Don´t worry!
It´s not your concern anymore

28
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,553
If you finish,
I just go

29
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,222
Kyung´- soo!

30
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,492
Your tattered links become
more and more painful

31
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:43,170
If that´s my destiny,
I´ll deal with it

32
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,470
Then let´s see how well
you deal with it

33
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,246
Leave me alone

34
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,617
If you don´t like it,
defeat me

35
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:09,358
Strength

36
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,932
It´s knowing how to gather the
energy around you, make it yours

37
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:40,891
Awakening, It is the wisdom
to merge you and your opponent

38
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,876
Get out of me!

39
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,225
Honor

40
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:55,861
Honor is---giving yourself up
Honor No opponent, no self

41
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:00,308
your vital links doesn´t
mean strengthened spiritual energy

42
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:03,305
From now on, it´s up to you

43
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,513
Don´t drag me into your fight

44
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,050
Kyung´- soo

45
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,383
Stop running away

46
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,096
Just you defy your destiny
doesn´t mean it´ll pass you by

47
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,877
From now on, you´re the best

48
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,052
Man!

49
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,020
Are we maids or students?

50
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:50,989
Why do they make us
clean all the time?

51
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,269
Hey!

52
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,988
I´m sorry

53
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:29,029
I don´t want to get
involved in your fight

54
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,232
It´s five now
but later it´ll be ten

55
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,871
This fight is meaningless

56
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,578
You have nothing to
worry about

57
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:50,386
You can run away again
"Boys, Girls"

58
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:55,046
Chae´- yi!
What are you doing?

59
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:10,228
Set your heart free,
like the flowing water

60
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:04,315
KIM Kyung´- soo,
you got a damn good friend

61
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,053
Yin´- Yang Conflux
Become water and flow

62
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,283
Yin´- Yang Repel
Thunder and lightning strike

63
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:45,953
Water and lightening are one
in nature

64
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,542
Oh, I´m thirsty

65
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,726
Tell me again
Did you see them?

66
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,226
Someone locked

67
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:29,456
Kyung´- soo
and Chae´- yi in the shower

68
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,093
If it´s a lie,

69
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,596
I´ll kill you myself

70
00:13:56,393 --> 00:14:00,386
This would make a good
training hall for the teachers

71
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:01,926
I don´t like it

72
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,236
I guess these boys are men too
Their male stench is everywhere

73
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,371
Get up

74
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,278
It´s a complete pig sty

75
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,109
What´s this smell?

76
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,912
- did someone pee in here?
- Enough!

77
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:32,253
This is not a place for teachers

78
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:36,888
The Vice Principal has banned
all extra´- curricular activities

79
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,792
Vice Principal?

80
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,632
Then there must be
a mistake

81
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:48,376
He can´t do this to me
I´m JANG Ryang

82
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:52,140
Ryang or Jang,
I don´t care

83
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:56,309
School´s no place
for this nonsense

84
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,056
It seems

85
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:08,692
excessive to ban
their club activities

86
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,445
Is it true you´re getting rid of
the weightlifting team?

87
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,944
What is this?

88
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:30,846
I´m sorry

89
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:33,749
Of course, I knew it

90
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,216
The new teachers are
going overboard

91
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,959
I thought they were under
you so I stayed back

92
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:44,323
But no more

93
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:48,534
How the hell do you
manage things

94
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,298
that you let a student
come in here?

95
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,733
See?

96
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:56,639
This is all because of
incompetent teachers like you

97
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,115
- do you understand?
- Vice Principal

98
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:03,444
it´s me, JANG Ryang
JANG Ryang

99
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,319
Right
I know your name

100
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:11,686
If you have difficulties
at school,

101
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,720
you should see the Dean
Why are you coming to me?

102
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,862
From now on,
you´re Student Dean,

103
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,605
Mr. MA, Reason with
this student

104
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:30,579
Dal´- chun may be dumb
but he´s strong

105
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:34,977
Get out

106
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,168
Silence!

107
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,513
You have all suffered

108
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:14,386
I, JANG Ryang,

109
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:19,521
with generosity as wide as
a lake, have tolerated it till now

110
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:24,993
I´m pushing morals
aside and flexing my muscles

111
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,435
Today, I´ll lift 10,000 pounds

112
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:33,704
of iron as I´ve practiced

113
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,442
Ryang,
I have to go home soon

114
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,112
That was cool, huh?

115
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:24,218
I was gonna let it go
this once,

116
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,795
but no way

117
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,299
This is far enough

118
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:50,103
I´m Ryang,

119
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,300
JANG Ryang!

120
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,988
Ah, that felt really good

121
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:51,960
So you can completely empty
someone´s head in a flash?

122
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:53,630
Is it really possible?

123
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,094
That´s the frightening power
of wave energy

124
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:59,775
Go crazy in an instant,
then blank like a piece of paper

125
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,840
In an instant, clean---

126
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:06,239
Nice! Nice!
I want to test it at once

127
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,563
How timely, an animal
is caught in our trap

128
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:34,262
Do you recognize me, sir?

129
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:39,201
It´s Ryang, JANG Ryang

130
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:47,510
This is all Hak´- rim´s fault

131
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,851
If he wasn´t such a show´- off---

132
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,919
I´m sorry I´m really sorry, sir

133
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:19,844
To strengthen your character,

134
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,811
we´ve prepared
a fun class today

135
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:27,021
If your name´s
on the bulletin board,

136
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,657
report to the auditorium

137
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,469
Kyung´- soo!

138
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:45,738
Don´t be late

139
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,616
Listen,

140
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:06,625
do you hear the sound
of Volcano High being reborn?

141
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:08,757
JANG Oh´- ja,

142
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:13,024
I bet you don´t know why your
master left you an empty box

143
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:14,893
Right!

144
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,238
A big talker like you
wouldn´t know

145
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,642
What is education anyway?

146
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,213
You´re still as tacky as ever

147
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:29,651
I´ll slowly empty
your belly too

148
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:27,402
Last night, someone tried

149
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:30,371
to steal the Secret Manuscript

150
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,075
He conspired with Hak´- rim

151
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,682
against the principal

152
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:42,289
Luckily, he was
caught at the scene

153
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:45,892
The Manuscript shouldn´t
be hidden anymore

154
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:49,155
So I made a big
decision today

155
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,699
My dear---

156
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,566
Volcano students

157
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,100
Finally,

158
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:03,977
you will see the Manuscript

159
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:23,629
Now watch carefully

160
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:28,503
See what happens to the
student who lusts after it

161
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:42,683
That´s right, empty your mind!
All of it!

162
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,548
Empty your head and get ready
to receive new education!

163
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:49,117
Empty the idle thoughts,
rebellion, and silly desires!

164
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,987
Empty, empty, your mind!

165
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:56,063
This is the great teaching
of the Secret Manuscript!

166
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:08,072
Now the new history
of education

167
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:10,074
begins under
the name of Volcano High!

168
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:13,909
New, new, new---

169
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,477
The unprecedented technique

170
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:20,950
of the Secret Manuscript
will clear people´s heads of

171
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,852
worthless thoughts and garbage

172
00:28:24,493 --> 00:28:28,554
Now you will begin again

173
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:31,632
Be reborn

174
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,344
Please stop now

175
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,615
I can´t hold back any longer

176
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:55,755
Impatient
Still, it´s not your turn yet

177
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:35,728
Now you know your turn
without being called

178
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:39,963
- Is this strengthening our
character?/- Sure!

179
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,730
It´s the class
you need most

180
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,538
Stop right there

181
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,541
Ryang needs to
go to the nurse

182
00:30:40,362 --> 00:30:43,627
Someone fixed you up,
what a worthless thing to do

183
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:51,629
Ryang needs to
go to the nurse

184
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:53,503
Come and get
permission first

185
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:06,078
It´s because of brats like you
that there is chaos

186
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:39,180
Idiot, wake up

187
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,373
Stop it
This is my problem

188
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:46,280
Don´t act like a big shot
I´m Ryang, JANG Ryang!

189
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,321
I repay my own debts

190
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:39,309
It´s most rewarding
teaching someone like you

191
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:15,109
Trash

192
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:18,709
Your arrogant attitudes
are all same

193
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,944
Let´s end it here
Better than to live like trash

194
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,811
I won´t run away any more

195
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:16,515
Your life is over now

196
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:52,105
Mr. MA! Mr. MA!

197
00:46:31,446 --> 00:46:34,677
You shouldn´t toy with
words like "death"

198
00:46:38,386 --> 00:46:43,983
Stay away! Mr. MA!
Stay away! Stay away!

199
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:51,959
Stay away! Stay away---

200
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,379
Like one sun in the sky,

201
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:24,520
two cannot be most
revered at Volcano High

202
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:27,593
Let´s have a true fight today

203
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:29,887
I thought we ended
that discussion

204
00:48:30,231 --> 00:48:33,997
Endurance Determination

205
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:36,929
I, JANG Ryang,
am not dead yet

206
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,663
I´m busy
Let´s get to the point

207
00:49:27,288 --> 00:49:28,516
Mr. Vice Principal---

208
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:33,659
As time passed, I couldn´t help
my curiosity about the box

209
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:35,395
Then one day---

210
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,793
Hey! Listen!
I´m not done yet

211
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,960
Everyone knows it was
empty from the beginning

212
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:47,635
Oh - it´s a fake

213
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:53,177
You brats This is the real thing
The Secret Manuscript II

214
00:49:54,448 --> 00:50:00,910
Vandalism Assault of male students
Assault of the Student Dean---

215
00:50:01,923 --> 00:50:03,823
What classroom is
KIM Kyung- soo in?

216
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,856
Why write letters
you´ll never send?

217
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:15,362
Love is not about showing

218
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,094
It´s about feeling

219
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:21,938
Just 200 more to
get to a thousand letters
