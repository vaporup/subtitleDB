Volcano High School

11
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,489
17 years of feuding, sparked
by the Great Teacher´s Battle,

12
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,355
have stripped the school
authorities of their power,

13
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,426
as self-indulgence, disguised as
self-control, grips the student body

14
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,198
The schools have
fallen into disarray

15
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,232
However, there is a legend

16
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,407
The one who acquires the
Secret Manuscript will end the chaos

17
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,042
It is a legend which disrupts the
Martial Court of Volcano High

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,044
In the 108th year of Volcano

This is your last chance

Today is a great day in the 5000
year history of the Martial Court

I, Ryang, Dark Ox anoint

as 2nd Ox of the Dark Oxen

25
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,371
Concho, the future of the Dark
Oxen rests on your shoulders

26
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,647
Sacrifice and broken bones will
lead you to great achievement

Dark Ox, Jang Ryang
Captain of the Weightlifting Team

28
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,383
You see that?

29
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,596
I´m sure you did, but I didn´t jump
cause someone told me to

30
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,460
I fell

31
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,168
Hey!

32
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,984
Doesn´t it hurt?

33
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,094
Yeah, it does

34
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,260
I have to go to
the nurse´s office fast

35
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,555
Did I do that?

36
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,653
Who else is there?

37
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,663

00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,422
Nice to meet you
Kyung-soo, just transferred

45
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,715
Where´s the teacher´s office?

46
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,692
Over there?

47
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,235
- What´s your problem?
- Where´d you learn that technique?

48
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,198
Identify yourself!

49
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,597
The great SONG Hak-rim
hurt by a gust of wind?

50
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,071
Must´ve been strong
to knock down

51
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,344
Concho cleaning the windows

52
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,406
Are you badly hurt?

53
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,717
Well, I´m grateful
It´s been years

54
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,681
since I´ve used mercurochrome

55
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,189
That was a fearsome power

56
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,053
What?

57
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,241
Newly roasted tea leaves

58
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,633
Please share them
with the principal

59
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh, yeah?

60
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,044
You know, that principal

61
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,841
should be a fortune teller

62
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,946
Excuse me?
Yesterday, while playing paduk,

63
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,687
he said a storm was coming

64
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,355
And that his shoulder ached

65
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,484
- And?/- And what?
I massaged his shoulder

66
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,489
two hours because of
that excuse

67
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,726
Is this good tea?

68
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,593
Expelled

69
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,170
Vandalism, assault of a principal,

70
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,875
harassing a female teacher?

71
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,537
So this school is already
your ninth?

72
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,152
Do you know my nickname?

73
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,516
A deadly snake, once
it bites, never lets go

74
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,383
"Cold-blooded Venom"

75
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,027
If you have the resolve

76
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,758
to keep out of trouble,
then stay

77
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,129
If not, you´d better start looking
for your tenth school

78
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,669
Why? Because I don´t forgive
even a single mistake

79
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,775
Do you understand me,
KIM Kyung-soo?

80
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,186
I will do my best

81
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,422
That´s what everyone says

82
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,122
Well, we´ll have to put you

83
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,927
in a class Which homeroom?

84
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,119
Oh, hot!

85
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,484
Don´t sleep in front of
the students

86
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,012
Right!

87
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,417
Put your jacket on my desk

88
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,290
I´ll have it cleaned

89
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,258
No, thank you

90
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,659
That´s alright
Never mind then

91
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,515
Looks normal enough

92
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,568
Introduce yourself!

93
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,642
KIM! Kyung! Soo!

94
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:09,245
Kyung-soo´s shy, so
he´s not good at greetings

95
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,664
By the way, is that brat
Concho playing hooky again?

96
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,866
The world´s a better place now

97
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,693
When I was young,

98
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,497
we didn´t even dream
of playing hooky

99
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,671
Oh, but look at the time

100
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,851
It´s too bad but I´ll have to
tell you that another time

101
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,916
Kyung-soo, take the empty
seat next to Concho´s

102
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,112
A little much
for your first day

103
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,201
Yo, transfer!

104
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,667
You sure took it well

105
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,735
They were just joking
so I couldn´t get angry

106
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,839
Just joking, you say?

107
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,515
Fine Shall I, Dark Ox,
JANG Ryang

108
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,248
test your endurance?

109
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,361
JANG Ryang, right?
You´re okay, man!

110
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,001
What does Dark Ox mean,
anyway?

111
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,163
Exercise restraint three times
to avoid even murder

112
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,735
Self-restraint!

113
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,799
You´ve got some
strength there, transfer

114
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:55,040
But no one yet has survived
a contest with Ryang

115
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,949
Get up

116
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,952
I´m not finished joking

117
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,536
Hey, transfer, you´re lucky

118
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,935
It´s too sacred a day
to spill more blood

119
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,912
I don´t know where
you crawled in from,

120
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,146
you´ll be in hot water, if you
look down on Volcano High

121
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,760
A brilliant scout

122
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,236
Shimma
Rugby team captain

123
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,632
My grandma brought it
from the country yesterday

124
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:35,437
Fermented bean paste soup!

125
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,908
Dal-chun, I´m sorry

126
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,222
Ryang´s real name
JANG Dal-chun

127
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,069
This cafeteria is not
for fighting, Ryang

128
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,883
When you have no appetite,
bean paste soup is the best

129
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
Writing 100 letters
she´ll never send

130
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,889
Single-hearted SOH Yo-sun

SONG Hak-rim Today
was the last time

132
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,114
You did the right thing,
transfer

133
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,052
Restraining yourself
in front of such trash

134
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,587
I was very impressed

135
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,855
You´ll find out soon enough,

136
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,901
but Ryang, no,
Dal-chun is a dumbass

137
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,207
You don´t get it yet

138
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,770
Join our rugby team
Or we´ll crush your bones

139
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,435
so you can´t join
any other team

140
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,408
Transfer, beware
This is only the beginning

141
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,433
You don´t cage a bird
if it doesn´t fly

142
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,733
I´m just doing
what you told me

143
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,305
So you do
whatever people say?

144
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,308
I helped you because
you´re blind

145
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,976
but I´m going now

146
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,518
Sit down here

147
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,928
See, you do
whatever you´re told

148
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,536
Mr Principal,

149
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,411
I brought the paduk
book you asked for

150
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,717
Oh, I´m practicing
a new technique

151
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,819
Cross-eyed technique

152
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,952
Strategy most widely
used by teachers

153
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,081
to avoid hard questions
from students

154
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,063
One who can beat deadly
heat and lightening bolts

155
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,373
I can´t lose the Secret Manuscript,
not when it´s almost in my hands

156
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,318
SONG Hak-rim is
a panting puppy

157
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,112
in front of
the Secret Manuscript

158
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:10,587
The principal is
a blind Buddha without it

159
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,274
SONG Hak-rim!

160
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:33,177
Your joking days
at the top are over now

161
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,573
That´s an excellent move

162
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,474
It´s almost as
if you read my mind

163
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,709
Is that so?

164
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,389
You seem to
know my mind better

165
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:18,389
Mr Principal, as soon as you
master the Secret Manuscript

166
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,859
you´ll be able to see through
all the things in this world

167
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,996
You´re a step away from
mastering the truth

168
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,138
Oh, the Manuscript again?

169
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,903
Who´s been spreading
such rumors?

170
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,382
Instead,

171
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,056
I´ll show you an incredible
technique I´ve been practicing

172
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,979
The Cross-eyed Technique
Quite difficult!

173
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,746
You are more difficult, sir
Open a window

174
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,416
Open the left one, right?

175
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,856
I almost lost the King Horse

176
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,331
My head automatically bows
down to you, nurse, in respect

177
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,399
Principal JANG Oh-ja

178
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,437
Avoided the Great Teachers´

179
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,637
Battle Lived in seclusion

180
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,348
Spiritually awakened

181
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,779
by crowing rooster

182
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,419
Returned as a member
of the Non-intervention Group

183
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,919
Vice Principal JANG Hak-sa

184
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,557
Struggled in the
Great Teachers´ Battle

185
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,897
Bitterly regretted being

186
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,165
slapped by a minor

187
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,097
A member of the
Cram and Rote Group

188
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,406
What are you doing?
All your horses are dying

189
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,278
Oh, Learn something
new every day

190
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,138
Be content with any place
you can avoid wind and rain

191
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,577
So what if it´s a dog house?

192
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,611
Still, I know it´s not easy

193
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,686
to find a home to your liking

194
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,885
Looks as if you
like your cage, too

195
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,832
Whew, it´s not easy

196
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,881
The bell has rung

197
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,680
Brat

198
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,405
At 7 a.m.,

199
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,572
the nurse came to the Training
Hall after the forest spells dispersed

200
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,212
He found deadly pus-fermented
grass and the principal in

201
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,472
a Debacle Trance Grass soaked
in pus from nose disease

202
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,674
due to solving
10,000 math problems

203
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,316
When exposed, a red spot forms
Use your powers, and you fall into

204
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,454
the Debacle Trance,
very dangerous

205
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,590
Be brief

206
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,291
Yes, The nurse deduced
the culprit

207
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,658
was very interested
in the Manuscript

208
00:28:56,134 --> 00:29:00,093
So the 1 suspect is SONG Hak-rim
The 2 suspect, the Vice Principal

209
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,799
Who wrote this?

210
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,736
- The nurse did
- Homicide!

211
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,344
- Louder!
- Yes!

212
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,813
He´s saying "homicide"
right now

213
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,382
He´s trying to indicate
the criminal

214
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,955
- h, h, h
- See,

215
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,356
he´s saying "h" for homicide

216
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,494
You sure it´s not "h" for help?

217
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,097
You´re also in the first stage
of exposure

218
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,468
You must not expend
your energy

219
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,805
Hurry and bring out
the Secret Manuscript!

220
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,687
From today, the
Training Hall is closed

221
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,965
While the principal is indisposed,

222
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,267
I´ll cast five spells to protect

223
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,936
the Manuscript around the clock

224
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,038
Let everyone know

225
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,034
What are you doing?

226
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,506
Hurry up and bring me
Hak-rim!

227
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,677
That´s right "H"
for Hak-rim

228
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,614
Conspiracy to harm a teacher,
attempted murder

229
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,106
Come on in

230
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,884
Sir?

231
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,916
Here

232
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,292
I gave it wings but it only flies
into the chicken coop

233
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,234
Where did you hide it? Where?

234
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,549
You tiresome old fart!
Where is it?

235
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,238
This is a conspiracy
Somebody´s conspiracy

236
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,859
It´s no use

237
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,692
This is a conspiracy

238
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,189
Stop,

239
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,133
it We all know it´s a conspiracy
without you saying it

240
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,888
JANG Dal-chun

241
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,701
I said my name is
JANG Ryang!

242
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,820
Strength in numbers is not
always enough, Shimma

243
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,581
War Breaks Out!

244
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,954
Come here!

245
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:12,244
You come here
Sure, I´ll take on any munchkin

246
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,018
I, Ryang,

247
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,980
give you two days

248
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,618
If anybody else
wants to take me on,

249
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,019
come find me

250
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,394
It´s been a while, Chae-yi

251
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,300
Wait just two days

252
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,075
Why?
You scared to fight now?

253
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,946
That´s right!
Now is not the time

254
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,286
I´ve waited this long
I can wait two more days

255
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,686
Our only chance is to form

256
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,990
an alliance led by
the rugby team

257
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,326
Why the rugby team?

258
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,935
You were beaten
just like us

259
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,593
So what?
Are you challenging me?

260
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,033
Stop it!

261
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,798
Both of you I didn´t
call you here for a fight

262
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,400
I was caught off guard
so Ryang might´ve won

263
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,904
But next time,
he has no chance

264
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,908
So all of you follow
my orders

265
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,548
No one here can beat Ryang

266
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,543
We have to combine
our strength

267
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,513
Right First, we beat Ryang
And then we save Hak-rim

268
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,224
Ha, Ryang´s easier
than Hak-rim!

269
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,891
What are you saying?

270
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,464
Hak-rim was always
the one to beat

271
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,264
Now, it´s just a bit
easier, that´s all

272
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,701
That´s right! The Manuscript is
passed down to the best anyway

273
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,506
With Hak-rim gone,

274
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,870
we can´t let the likes
of Ryang get it

275
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,538
Now it´s mine

276
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,083
Crazy asshole,
I´ll beat Ryang

277
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,480
You arrogant pig

278
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,086
Are you looking
down on the judo team?

279
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:02,818
Fine! You want a piece of me?
All of you, come on!

280
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,471
Meeting Adjourned

281
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,507
What the hell is going on?

282
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,545
With Hak-rim gone,
the students are more rowdy

283
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,378
Why do you worry so much?

284
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,644
Let the kids try to line up

285
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,720
They didn´t dare a peep
when Hak-rim was

286
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,917
around It´s odd

287
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,563
Don´t worry about
getting them under control

288
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,358
It´ll all end once
I get the Secret Manuscript

289
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,865
Right?

290
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,692
Just be patient

291
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,267
We have to keep up
appearances

292
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,874
I´ll expect the good
news soon

293
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,112
Arrogant brat

294
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,023
Soon that jerk will be after
the principal´s seat!

295
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,194
What are you looking at?

296
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,833
Cunning old man

297
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,098
Brain-wave lightening?

298
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,237
That´s just a myth

299
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,042
It´s not humanly possible

300
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,671
If a person is born with
natural power,

301
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,639
it´s possible

302
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,083
At any rate, a guy like Ryang
will never get the Manuscript

303
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,715
The problem is KIM Kyung-soo

304
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,353
If he decides to step up,

305
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,786
it becomes more serious

306
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,026
What are you talking about?

307
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,733
I´m not here about
the Manuscript

308
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,993
In the end,
he´ll want it too

309
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,237
We have to stop him
before then

310
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,903
What a stonehead

311
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,044
I´m talking about the school

312
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,878
- What´s the matter with you?
- YOO Chae-yi

313
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,078
No one can take the
Secret Manuscript from me

314
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,481
You never ended the chaos

315
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,651
You just weakened it a bit

316
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,484
Hurry back!

317
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,385
The school is full of guys

318
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,257
dying to fight you

319
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:32,169
Wow, did you really drench
Chae-yi with water?

320
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,401
That´s not it It was a mistake

321
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,012
Lancelot merely protected a lake

322
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,444
- before meeting King Arthur
- Judo?

323
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,412
Wake up!

324
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,412
Since you´re my seatmate,
I´ll give you some advice

325
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,055
Approach her the wrong way
and you´re doomed

326
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,587
You know what happened

327
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,523
to Shimma last Valentine´s?

328
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,163
He hit on her and ended
up with a chocolate wedgie

329
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,493
so bad he couldn´t come
to school for a week

330
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,933
She´s not Icy Jade for nothing

331
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,834
She can be cold
as ice Chilly

332
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,267
So cold!

333
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,906
Look here!

334
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,013
My friend, Kyung-soo!

335
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,314
It´s Orange Head Speak
of the devil

336
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,959
We still have a problem
to solve, don´t we?

337
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,096
- Nope
- Not so

338
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,434
If you and I combined forces,
our rugby team

339
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,439
I wasn´t ready Again!

340
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,341
That was so cool

341
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,220
Really something

342
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,684
Assaulting a fellow student

343
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,894
You know there´s no more
space on your school records

344
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,192
Here!
A Kendo team application

345
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,570
In these desperate times,
let´s help each other

346
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,802
I don´t usually join
delinquent clubs

347
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,581
We´re a little rough

348
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,748
but we´re not delinquent

349
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,547
Wait! Hold on!

350
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,945
Stop it

351
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,357
First, I apologize

352
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,926
The joke´s gone too far

353
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,003
You know that saying?
Frogs die because of child´s play

354
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,509
- The joke´s gone too far
- Hey!

355
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,908
Is rescuing Hak-rim a joke?

356
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,309
- Is it A joke that

357
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,845
he´s in jail?

358
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,044
- I don´t think Hak-rim Is
righteous/- Hey!

359
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,456
You think Ryang is?

360
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,656
It´s okay for him to
parade around like that?

361
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,127
Wherever you go,
there´s always a guy like that

362
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,463
Just ignore him
and let him be

363
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,567
Do what?
Not even fight back?

364
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,993
Just ignore him?

365
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,767
Coward

366
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,632
That´s right

367
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,003
I´m a coward

368
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,242
Let him go

369
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,488
We were wrong about him

370
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,965
It´s been two days,
Chae-yi

371
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,347
I, Ryang,

372
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,522
have never kneeled
before anyone

373
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,294
But Chae-yi,

374
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,493
I kneel before you,

375
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,225
to confess my heart to you

376
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,168
From the first moment
I saw you,

377
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,828
my feelings have
remained constant But

378
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,468
The best

379
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,210
I waited until I became master
the top man at Volcano High

380
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:39,514
Icy Jade, Chae-yi,

381
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,446
please accept my heart

382
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,393
This is a sign of our love

383
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:01,329
Your hand?

384
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,833
Ryang, are you ill?

385
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,840
No one can stop
my love

386
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,972
Chae-yi,

387
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,247
I´ll put the ring on

388
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,717
Stop

389
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,727
This is my business

390
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:26,956
Stand back

391
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,193
Now

392
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,747
Only the master of the court,

393
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,390
Volcano´s best is
worthy of you

394
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,052
That is me

395
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,524
Wait!

396
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,768
What is it?

397
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,484
I´m really curious
about something

398
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,558
Does the top guy
at Volcano High

399
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,465
get any girl he wants?

400
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:04,493
A man´s got to know when
to give up on a hopeless love

401
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,825
Begging and pestering

402
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,062
a girl is not manly

403
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,846
You know what kind
of day it is?

404
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,616
Do you think a pipsqueak
like you can stop me?

405
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,176
You need some
serious advice, man

406
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,442
You´ve got a long way to go

407
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,810
You!

408
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,183
Die in my hands today!

409
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,203
- Son! /- Brother!
- No!

410
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,682
You brought this on yourself

411
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,020
Stop it

412
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,084
Fine

413
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,592
I accept it now

414
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,167
You´re the best

415
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,335
Hey!
What are you doing?

416
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:58,230
No one will doubt
you anymore

417
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,635
We´ve seen enough of
your power

418
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,773
So let him go

419
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,879
Now it´s time to show
some generosity as the best

420
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,778
Thanks, Chae-yi

421
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,412
Your approval means
the most to me

422
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:16,314
Right!

423
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,052
When I get the Manuscript

424
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,160
I´ll return to you as the
true master of Volcano High

425
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,565
Till then

426
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,275
Don´t be a baby

427
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,273
Chae-yi

428
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,352
That´s my medicine
for athlete´s foot

429
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,953
Tonight

430
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,789
Let´s get wasted!

431
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,502
Dark!

432
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,794
Oxen!

433
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,843
What is this?

434
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,685
The people over there
want to buy you a drink

435
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,253
You think I can´t

436
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,721
succeed without it?

437
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,136
Now I´m going to
sweep them all away

438
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,764
Wait and see,
you old bastard

439
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,836
Welcome,

440
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,613
great cleaners!

441
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,397
Volcano High School

442
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,132
The School Five: Masters at
suppressing schools and wrongdoing

443
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,716
MA Bang-jin
means the secret,

444
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,688
logical order and
combination of numbers

445
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,020
We look at our
books only in this class

446
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,204
Are you okay?

447
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,212
Everyone who coughed,
step up

448
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,996
Can´t even do 2 octaves

449
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,425
You must smoke
3 packs a day

450
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,761
He´s a mind-reader

451
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,870
Smoker´s Wind-cut Technique

452
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:01,944
Terrifying technique that

453
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,443
blocks the windpipes

454
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,376
of heavy smokers

455
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,186
I just puff

456
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,934
It´s strange

457
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,976
I can´t feel any vibes

458
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,311
He must´ve hidden
it long ago

459
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,444
He´s a real pain in the ass

460
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,751
He must´ve buried
it somewhere

461
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,322
It´s exactly like I thought

462
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,256
What do you mean?

463
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,989
If you tell a tiger
who´s never seen

464
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,062
a mouse before
that it´s very scary

465
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,392
then the tiger may
not be able

466
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,068
to sleep because of fear

467
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,094
Of course, it´s

468
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,132
a weak mouse that
spread the rumor

469
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,839
Then it was always empty?

470
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,243
What the hell´s going on?

471
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,615
Don´t get so excited

472
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,850
The Manuscript does exist

473
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,519
Now what are you saying?

474
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,323
Mr. Ma, are you making
fun of me?

475
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,829
That´s strange

476
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,403
Isn´t the Vice Principal the only
one allowed in the Training Hall?

477
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,868
Could it be the new teachers

478
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,503
are after the Secret
Manuscript too?

479
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,206
Don´t be rash

480
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:52,144
In any case, the Vice Principal
and I are in the same boat

481
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,741
You still writing letters?

482
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,040
Arrogant brats
Give my regards to Hak-rim

483
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,183
- Get all The members together
- what?

484
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:36,959
Are you done?

485
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,130
- what?/- If The noodles
get soggy they´re no good

486
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,571
You eat it

487
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,165
Thanks

488
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,845
I´ve gone to a lot
of schools but

489
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,037
the noodles here
are the best

490
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,077
I can´t stand by any longer

491
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,983
Will you help me?

492
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,117
Here´s my share

493
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,345
I don´t have the strength
to help anyone

494
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,082
My help to you would be

495
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,122
talking you out of this

496
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,224
Chae-yi,

497
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,454
don´t do this

498
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,948
If you got a question,
ask it in school

499
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,783
What´s the meaning of this?

500
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,050
Would you answer me
if I asked in school?

501
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,388
Just look at your hair

502
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:53,925
- Don´t go out there!
- Let me go!

503
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,178
This is my business
Stay out of it!

504
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,739
Aw, you bring tears
to my eyes

505
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,406
It´s been a long time,
KIM Kyung-soo

506
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,747
Should I be thanking you?

507
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:29,316
Sure, you saved me
from being expelled

508
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,287
Happy?

509
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,992
I´m sorry about Yo- sun

510
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,466
I´m sorry about us
We were the cowards

511
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,513
I was scared

512
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,478
So scared I couldn´t move

513
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,891
If I had power like yours,

514
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,526
I wouldn´t let a friend
go like that

515
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:33,347
A guy, power makes him sad
The cruel days of youth

516
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,100
I didn´t want to fight

517
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:55,076
But guys always tried
to beat me

518
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,676
Kyung-soo

519
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,544
I beg you,
please transfer schools

520
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,686
If it weren´t for that accident,

521
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,053
that accident

522
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,601
Welcome

523
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,918
- Again?/- Mom, do We
have to transfer Again?

524
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,696
It´s alright
Let´s pack

525
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,891
I have to go now

526
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,257
Just tell them you were with me

527
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,297
I said that last time and I thought
the Math teacher was gonna kill me

528
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,433
You!

529
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,836
So you want me to kill you
or the Math teacher to?

530
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,633
This is the spot, right?
It´s very tense

531
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,240
Captain,

532
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,980
the Phys Ed teacher says
miss another class and we´re dead

533
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,719
Who´s gonna kill whom?

534
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,420
I´m Ryang JANG

535
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,960
Ryang Volcano´s best

536
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:35,003
Enticement Perfume: perfume
from the pheromone of a queen bee

537
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:45,576
I know, I wrote a lot today but

538
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:53,444
- Still, don´t kill yourself
- Kyung-soo!

539
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:58,357
Hey, move, move! What is this?
Get out of the way!

540
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:12,933
If you´re okay,
hurry back up

541
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,411
It´s

542
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:30,584
Here´s the Student Dean!

543
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:18,667
Hi, I´m Yoma

544
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:24,378
Yoma: Shimma´s fraternal twin
Attends Mystic Girls High School

545
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,851
I like guys and rugby

546
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,985
If a cool guy like you
played rugby too,

547
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,790
It´d be so heavenly

548
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,161
Will you play rugby for me?

549
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,900
Hmm, this feels so good

550
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,472
Have you kissed before?

551
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,648
Enough!

552
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,751
So this is how we meet,
Kyung - soo

553
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,260
They say she´s a nine-tailed
fox who eats the liver of boys

554
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,128
But she´s just a cat in heat

555
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:31,446
I transfer you and all you
do is make out with girls?

556
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,812
Your father would be proud

557
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,454
Is this the way to welcome
an old teacher?

558
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,595
Do my words sound
like nonsense to you?

559
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,858
Go, Kyung - soo!

560
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,394
She´s a funny one

561
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,804
You´re stronger, today!
