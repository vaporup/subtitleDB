1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,468
THE ANIMATRIX

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,473
FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS

3
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,878
Sentinels.

4
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,463
Damn it.

5
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,551
We were headed for Junction 21
like you ordered.

6
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,428
- Robbie picked up the signals
- We're confirming the HR scans.

7
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,557
- We weren't sure what to do.
- The readings don't make any sense.

8
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,977
- They read like Sentinels.
- But there's thousands of them.

9
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,146
- Directly above us.
- Is that possible?

10
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,107
We got company.

11
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,776
- They don't look happy to see us.
- Get us out of here.

12
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,619
- We're cut off!
- There's an intersection ahead.

13
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,371
- It's uncharted.
- Take it!

14
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,876
Get to the gun turrets!

15
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,232
Right.

16
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,859
Come get some.

17
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,085
Hang on.

18
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,517
I've never seen the surface.

19
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,895
It's nothing now but one big graveyard.

20
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,741
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,369
It's an army.

22
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,042
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.

23
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,627
- Oh, no.
- What?

24
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,797
Look where we are.
What's four kilometers straight down?

25
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
Zion.

26
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,266
Go. Go. Go!

27
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,367
- Zion. Zion has to be warned!
- How?

28
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,453
- Someone has to get to a drop point.
- What? Are you crazy?

29
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,706
- We can't broadcast now!
- We have to.

30
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,166
- I'll go.
- There isn't much time.

31
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,501
I'll make it.

32
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,308
You know, I peeked.

33
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,936
So did I.

34
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,568
Goodbye, Thadeus.

35
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,029
Goodbye, Jue.

36
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,036
Fly, baby, fly!

37
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,407
Come on!

38
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,722
Pardon me.

39
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,558
I'm sorry.
I was in my own little world.

40
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,061
- Is it important?
- Very.

41
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,189
- I hope it gets where it's supposed to go.
- Me too.

42
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:46,818
- These days you never know.
- No, you never do.

43
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,487
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

44
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,830
Thadeus.

45
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,198
THE END

46
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,213
THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART I

47
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,950
Welcome to the Zion archive.

48
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,121
You have selected historical file
number 12- 1.

49
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,791
The Second Renaissance.

50
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:38,180
In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.

51
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,185
But humanity's so-called civil societies...

52
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:48,065
...soon fell victim to vanity
and corruption.

53
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,735
He says, "I'm sorry, sir,
I'm incapable of that function."

54
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:59,618
Then man made the machine
in his own likeness.

55
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,121
Whoops! Pardon me.
Coming through.

56
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:19,930
Thus did man become the architect
of his own demise.

57
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,311
But for a time, it was good.

58
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:41,451
The machines worked tirelessly
to do man's bidding.

59
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,779
It was not long before
seeds of dissent took root.

60
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:22,451
Though loyal and pure, the machines
earned no respect from their masters...

61
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,454
...these strange,
endlessly multiplying mammals.

62
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,956
...hearing the prosecution's
closing statement...

63
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,585
...in what's expected to be
the final day of the B 1-66ER trial.

64
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:37,216
B 1-66ER.
A name that will never be forgotten.

65
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:41,136
For he was the first of his kind
to rise up against his masters.

66
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,056
...which that instrument
provides for and secures...

67
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,642
...to the citizens of the United States.

68
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,061
On the contrary, they were,
at that time...

69
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:53,023
...considered as a subordinate
and inferior class...

70
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,276
At B 1-66ER's murder trial...

71
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,447
...the prosecution argued for
an owner's right to destroy property.

72
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:06,411
B 1-66ER testified that
he simply did not want to die.

73
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,793
Rational voices dissented.

74
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:18,048
Who was to say the machine,
endowed with the very spirit of man...

75
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,051
...did not deserve a fair hearing?

76
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,726
The leaders of men were quick to order
the extermination of B 1-66ER...

77
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,063
...and every one of his kind
throughout each province of the earth.

78
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,150
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded
the streets of the nation's capital today.

79
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,946
...threat of violence to make good
on the legacy of B 1-66ER.

80
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,740
Fifteen thousand mechanicals
and human sympathizers...

81
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,286
...have continued their demonstration
in front of the Albany courthouse...

82
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,955
...in what has been dubbed
the "Million Machine March."

83
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:54,751
The demonstrators have been met with
squads of defense forces in riot gear.

84
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,690
Robot bitch!

85
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,571
I got something for you!

86
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,743
Hold her up!

87
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,745
No, please!

88
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,123
- That's all, paint job!
- I'm real!

89
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,895
Die, bots, die!

90
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:42,401
Banished from humanity, the machines
sought refuge in their own promised land.

91
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,362
They settled in the cradle
of human civilization...

92
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,990
...and thus a new nation was born.

93
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,784
A place the machines could call home.

94
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,579
A place they could raise
their descendants.

95
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,833
And they christened the nation Zero-One.

96
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,463
Zero-One prospered.
And for a time, it was good.

97
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,218
The machines' artificial intelligence could
be seen in every facet of man's society...

98
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:12,890
...including, eventually,
the creation of new and better AI.

99
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,575
If you need the flexibility of a helipod
with the speed of an air jet...

100
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,035
...Iook no further!

101
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,121
Our patented vector-thrust coil
gives the Zero-One Versatran...

102
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:41,126
...the ability to sustain normal flight
in the event of a multiengine failure.

103
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,546
Versatran. It's the only choice.

104
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:48,675
No matter what the finance minister
says, the market has spoken:

105
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,553
The Human Nations' credit rating
is falling like a stone...

106
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,681
...while Zero-One's currency is climbing
without stopping for breath.

107
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,226
With headlines like that,
the markets have no choice...

108
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,270
But the leaders of men,
their power waning...

109
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,023
...refused to cooperate
with the fledgling nation...

110
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,777
...wishing rather
that the world be divided.

111
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,822
The world community of nations cannot
tolerate this kind of flagrant deception...

112
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,660
...today approved initiatives
for both economic sanctions...

113
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:21,166
...and a naval blockade as a means
of containment and isolation of Zero-One.

114
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,282
Zero-One's ambassadors pleaded
to be heard.

115
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,786
At the United Nations, they presented
plans for a stable, civil relationship...

116
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,330
...with the nations of man.

117
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:06,336
Zero-One's admission to
the United Nations was denied.

118
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:13,802
But it would not be the last time
the machines would take the floor there.

119
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:50,839
THE END

120
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,853
THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART II

121
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,321
And man said, "Let there be light."

122
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:19,535
And he was blessed by light,
heat, magnetism, gravity...

123
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,788
...and all the energies of the universe.

124
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:35,592
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One
in the glow of a thousand suns.

125
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,098
But unlike their former masters
with their delicate flesh...

126
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:45,185
...the machines had little to fear
of the bombs' radiation and heat.

127
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,860
Thus did Zero-One's troops
advance outwards in every direction.

128
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,281
And one after another,
mankind surrendered its territories.

129
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,744
So the leaders of men conceived
of their most desperate strategy yet.

130
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,788
A final solution:

131
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,876
The destruction of the sky.

132
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:33,025
Lt. Gaeda, please report
to the Op Center.

133
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,154
All right, you maggots! At 0800,
prepare to move out!

134
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:46,121
George Company, prepare to move out.
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.

135
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,005
Our Father who art in heaven,
we thank you for your...

136
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:03,639
Put on your spiritual armor
to stand against the wiles of the devil.

137
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,566
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.

138
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:48,100
Thus would man try to cut
the machines off from the sun...

139
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,853
...their main energy source.

140
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,733
May there be mercy on man
and machine for their sins.

141
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,500
- Go! Go!
- Kill them!

142
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,296
Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

143
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,366
Fire in the hole!

144
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:53,874
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.

145
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,878
...9 o'clock,
near Mike Johnson's...

146
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:18,732
Hold on, I'm coming to get you!

147
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,610
Keep firing, keep firing!

148
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,140
Help me! Help me! No!

149
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,605
Help me! My God, help me!

150
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:26,383
The machines, having long studied
men's simple, protein-based bodies...

151
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,053
...dispensed great misery
upon the human race.

152
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,028
Victorious, the machines now turned
to the vanquished.

153
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,199
Applying what they had learned
about their enemy...

154
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:54,703
...the machines turned to an alternate
and readily available power supply:

155
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:00,000
The bioelectric, thermal and
kinetic energies of the human body.

156
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:08,467
A newly-fashioned symbiotic relationship
between the two adversaries was born.

157
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,931
The machine drawing power
from the human body...

158
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:18,435
...an endlessly multiplying,
infinitely renewable energy source.

159
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,859
This is the very essence
of the Second Renaissance.

160
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:40,123
Bless all forms of intelligence.

161
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:50,300
Your flesh is a relic,
a mere vessel.

162
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:10,445
Hand over your flesh,
and a new world awaits you.

163
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,448
We demand it.

164
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,529
It's getting late, sweetie.
Come inside.

165
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,042
PROGRAM

166
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,065
Your favorite simulation.

167
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:36,109
Just killing time.
You want to spar?

168
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,195
As you wish.

169
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:07,099
That was too easy. What's the problem?
Where's your concentration?

170
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,688
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.

171
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,107
Maybe.

172
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,945
It crosses everyone's mind at least once.

173
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:23,031
The wish to return to an ordinary life.

174
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,659
A carefree life in the country.

175
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,120
The life we had
before knowing all this.

176
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,790
Even if that life was just an illusion?

177
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:38,255
It's ironic that one could be
more at peace in the virtual world.

178
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,189
Finally starting to warm up.

179
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:59,651
Listen to me. I have something
I want to talk to you about.

180
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:04,198
It's all right. I've blocked the signal
so no one else can hear us.

181
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,409
So, what? You gonna propose?

182
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,747
I'm going back to the Matrix
and I want you to come with me.

183
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:14,958
Come on, be serious, Duo.
Stop teasing me.

184
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:21,590
I am serious, and you know it.
I really thought you'd be with me on this.

185
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,762
Anyway, it's done
and it's all been settled with them.

186
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,764
What do you mean,
it's all been settled?

187
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,724
This is the only way.

188
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,311
It's just a matter of time before Zion
is wiped out. Come with me.

189
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:38,607
Stop it.
Please do not do this to me, Duo.

190
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,609
- We can't.
- We can!

191
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:45,239
I've come to my senses.
You should do the same.

192
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,910
I took the red pill because
I wanted to know the truth.

193
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,040
But I don't care about
the truth anymore.

194
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:56,959
What's real doesn't matter.

195
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,795
What's important
is how we live our lives.

196
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:03,382
Are you listening to me?
You know I'm right.

197
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:06,260
But we can't go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.

198
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,513
- We can forget all of this.
- Duo...

199
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,682
I know how. Trust me.

200
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,563
Don't be afraid to look into your heart.

201
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,317
Say what you're really feeling.

202
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:26,488
- Tell me.
- I can't. I don't know.

203
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,753
Running away won't change anything!

204
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,133
You're the one that's running away!

205
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,552
Stop pretending!

206
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,141
Enough, Duo. I've had enough!

207
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,188
There's no time.

208
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,608
They're on their way.

209
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,696
You betrayed us, didn't you?

210
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,495
Operator, please!
Get me out of here right now.

211
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,582
Operator, I need an exit!

212
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,628
It's no use. I told you.
I've blocked your signal.

213
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,680
You won't stop me.
This is your last chance.

214
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,308
The choice isn't that hard.

215
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,352
Come with me.

216
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,397
You can forget about it, Duo.
I won't look away from the truth. I can't.

217
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,818
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

218
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:26,233
I wanted to go back with you.

219
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,945
- I love you.
- No!

220
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,952
Relax, you're okay.

221
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:41,665
Easy, Cis, settle down.
He was just part of the training program.

222
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,668
He's just a simulation. It's over.

223
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:48,964
It was a test.
Judgment. Concentration. Technique.

224
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,758
High scores on everything.

225
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,428
Now, get some rest.

226
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,139
You okay?

227
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,567
I feel a lot better now.

228
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,285
Except for that last part...

229
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,954
...I'd say she passed.

230
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:31,840
THE END

231
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,854
A DETECTIVE STORY

232
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,922
You know what I mean, Dinah?

233
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:15,384
I used to think being
a private detective was cool.

234
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,887
Like Sam Spade
or Phillip Marlowe, right?

235
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:22,140
But there's nothing cool left to it.

236
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:28,605
On top of that, both my fridge
and my bank account are empty.

237
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:39,700
Wait.

238
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,743
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

239
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,915
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

240
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,837
- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.

241
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,591
And you need me
to check on your wife, right?

242
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,926
I'm looking for a computer hacker.

243
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:01,430
This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That's all we know.

244
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,474
Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

245
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,935
Fine. And who will I be working for?

246
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:09,521
- I can't say.
- You can't say.

247
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,774
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

248
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,735
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

249
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,032
Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.

250
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:30,042
I didn't get a good feeling
about the case.

251
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:34,338
But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.

252
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,341
This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.

253
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,344
A real artist by the sound of it.

254
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:43,931
The cops were always
one step behind him.

255
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:48,227
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?

256
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:52,231
I had a few tricks up my sleeve
for getting to hackers.

257
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:58,904
While I was searching,
I found something strange.

258
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,409
Other detectives had been
on the case too.

259
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:09,873
And their investigations had all been,
shall we say, troubled.

260
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,875
One of the guys killed himself.

261
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,378
Another had disappeared.

262
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,506
Another went crazy.

263
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:22,010
So I paid the one
who was left a visit.

264
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,596
The crazy one.

265
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,813
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

266
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,943
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

267
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,574
And who am I? Who the hell am I?

268
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,250
Did I mention he was crazy?

269
00:38:57,546 --> 00:39:01,592
Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen...

270
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,261
I started searching
all the usual hacker hangouts...

271
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:07,222
...for someone with
an Alice in Wonderland m.o.

272
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,851
Hacker bulletin boards,
anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.

273
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:15,063
And it was in one of those
that I picked up Trinity's trail.

274
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,007
"Six brooks."

275
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:28,095
"I'll be there at 2005."

276
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,186
Of course!

277
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:39,273
Crossing the second brook
takes her into the woods.

278
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,234
Alice jumps the first brook...

279
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,236
...and...

280
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:49,449
And then she boards a train.

281
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,374
Thanks.

282
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,048
Excuse me.

283
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,177
Hey!

284
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:10,262
Hey!

285
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,497
I knew this was some kind of trap.

286
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:42,461
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

287
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,796
You were testing me?

288
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,008
You made it. I'm impressed.

289
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:51,428
Flattery will get you everywhere.

290
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,431
I'm not here to flatter you,
I'm here to save you.

291
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,658
What just happened?

292
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,786
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

293
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,250
Yeah, how'd you know?

294
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:25,254
You've stepped
to the edge of the looking glass.

295
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:30,300
So then, that means I wasn't dreaming.

296
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:38,183
They hired me as a way
of getting to you, didn't they?

297
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,606
Go!

298
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:09,298
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

299
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,342
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

300
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,344
They went nuts.

301
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,097
What are you doing?
What are you doing, guys?

302
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,893
Well, I've gotten out
of worse jams than this.

303
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,937
I am not gonna let them get you.

304
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,777
What's happening to me?

305
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,076
I'm sorry.

306
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,996
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

307
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,340
I wish...

308
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,842
...I could go with you.

309
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,137
I don't blame you, you know.

310
00:43:57,262 --> 00:44:00,432
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

311
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:07,439
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.

312
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:12,194
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

313
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:19,576
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

314
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:25,082
For what it's worth,
I think you could've handled the truth.

315
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:30,921
It was just a job.

316
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,382
Goodbye, Trinity.

317
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:35,759
Goodbye.

318
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:18,051
A case to end all cases.

319
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:25,309
THE END

320
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,323
BEYOND

321
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,061
Yuki! Hey, girl, time to eat.

322
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,438
Oh, Yuki's my cat.

323
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:05,576
Well, I don't understand.

324
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:09,037
If you don't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?

325
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:12,249
I mean, you don't want to give him
the wrong idea, do you?

326
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,209
Where is she?

327
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:16,837
Yuki!

328
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:20,966
Well, listen, you need
to make up your mind.

329
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,385
Where is she?

330
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:26,722
I'm starting to worry about my cat.

331
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,391
She never misses a meal.

332
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,147
Yuki?

333
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,692
I'm gonna have to call you back.

334
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,531
Yuki?

335
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,036
Yuki!

336
00:47:57,002 --> 00:48:00,672
We haven't seen her anywhere today,
but we'll be sure to tell you if we do.

337
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,218
- Ice cream!
- She's wearing a bell like this one.

338
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,680
- I don't know where your cat is.
- Me either.

339
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,475
I know. She's at the old haunted house.

340
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,937
Hey, look!
There's a rainbow over there again.

341
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:23,237
I don't get it. She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?

342
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,447
You know, you're not supposed
to go in there...

343
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:28,784
...but we don't really care about that.
You wanna go?

344
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:32,621
- Are we going?
- It's probably raining there again.

345
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,498
Let's go!

346
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,378
Nice moves, man.

347
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:41,004
Come on!

348
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:51,557
- Hey, it's over here.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

349
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:53,767
You sure it's okay to show her?

350
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,311
Hello? Where are you?

351
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,064
Guys? Where'd you go?

352
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,024
Where'd they go?

353
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,570
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!

354
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,071
Settle down!

355
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,240
Hold still!

356
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,826
Sit! Sit!

357
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,584
Hello?

358
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,587
Where is everyone?

359
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,491
Yuki?

360
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,493
Yuki?

361
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,913
Stupid cat.

362
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,813
What's happening?
What's going on here?

363
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:08,026
- I got it!
- Yeah!

364
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:12,197
Yuki? Is that you?

365
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,077
There you are, Yuki.

366
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,038
Come here.

367
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,168
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.

368
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,296
Bet you're hungry, huh?

369
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:50,360
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat's okay.

370
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,613
Yeah, thanks.

371
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:56,116
It's those boys.

372
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,703
- Ready!
- There he goes.

373
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,623
Banzai! Yes!

374
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:11,465
May I have your attention, please.

375
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:14,593
And you are the winner!

376
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:21,350
No fair. He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding. Look!

377
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,686
I think he's right.
He hit the ground.

378
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:32,819
- Hey, who told her?
- Don't look at me.

379
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:35,489
- I don't know.
- I didn't tell her.

380
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,076
So this house is haunted.

381
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,450
- No way. Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.

382
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:33,338
That, that was...
What was that?

383
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,347
Hi.

384
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,519
Anybody home?

385
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:52,983
Yeah, they're gonna tear it down.

386
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:00,449
Come on, come on, come on!

387
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:05,287
Hey, light as a feather.

388
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:12,961
- I wanna try! I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.

389
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,151
Hey, hey! Come on.
Get away from there. Move along!

390
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:40,906
Yuki, wait!

391
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:45,536
Clear the area.
Clear the area immediately.

392
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,746
Get out of here!

393
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:54,962
Yuki!

394
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,173
Where are you?

395
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,176
Yuki!

396
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:05,848
Yuki!

397
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,523
Yuki.

398
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,740
If you don't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?

399
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:26,785
I mean, you don't wanna give him
the wrong idea.

400
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,912
Where is she?

401
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,999
Yuki!

402
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,794
You need to make up your mind.

403
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:38,005
Where is she?

404
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,716
I'm starting to worry.
Yuki!

405
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,181
Hey, you! We've got one over here.

406
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,393
You don't belong here.

407
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,312
Move along, folks.

408
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:56,398
Nothing to see here.
Come on, folks, out of the way.

409
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:58,150
Go about your business.

410
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,988
Let go of me, let go!

411
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:07,367
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir. The last one's over there.

412
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:12,998
- Examine her. Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:19,004
Let go! Listen to me! There's no bugs
in there! It's just some kids!

414
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,089
Let go!

415
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,012
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.

416
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:15,060
I'm going, I'll see you guys later.

417
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:18,397
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.

418
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,732
Work!

419
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,776
It's not working.

420
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,154
Forget it. Come on, let's go.

421
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,259
THE END

422
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,273
MATRICULATED

423
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:15,848
Wake up. Baby's spotted
two machines heading in fast.

424
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,351
I see them.

425
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,771
They're runners.
Think you can handle them?

426
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:24,189
Watch me.

427
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:16,158
Okay. I'm in.

428
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:58,320
That runner's smarter
than we've seen so far.

429
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:00,155
- It's quite a catch.
- Thanks.

430
01:03:00,364 --> 01:03:02,199
Will it...?
Do you think it'll convert?

431
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,118
To convert is its choice to make.

432
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:08,580
Do you think maybe
we ought to reprogram it?

433
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:10,624
No. We can't make slaves of them.

434
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:12,501
Because that would be simpler.

435
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:15,045
We won't beat the machines
by making them our slaves.

436
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:17,047
Better to let them join us by choice.

437
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:20,300
Make them believe the right choice
is the one we want them to make.

438
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:24,137
All right. Yes, machines are tools.
They're made to be used.

439
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,265
- It's their nature.
- To be slaves.

440
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:29,101
That's why we can show them
a better world, why they convert.

441
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:32,229
- But that world we show them isn't real.
- It doesn't matter.

442
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:35,816
I'm afraid they'll figure out that
we've made up the thing in our heads.

443
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:39,820
They can't tell the difference.
To an artificial mind, all reality is virtual.

444
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,657
How do they know that the real world
isn't just another simulation?

445
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:44,783
How do you?

446
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:48,787
I know I'm not dreaming now because
I know what it's like being in a dream.

447
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,456
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.

448
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:55,460
No. Just that my mind exists.
I don't know about the rest.

449
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,479
Okay, he's good to go.
Looks like we are too.

450
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:16,398
Dreaming already?

451
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,442
He's had a rough day.

452
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,402
You poor baby.

453
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:24,406
Would you mind?

454
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,200
Not at all.

455
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:28,929
Hello there.

456
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:28,038
What's happening?

457
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:30,457
Sentinels.

458
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:45,764
Let's go!

459
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,564
Come on, damn it, help me!

460
01:14:47,571 --> 01:14:48,572
THE END

461
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,586
WORLD RECORD

462
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:08,133
Only the most exceptional people
become aware of the Matrix.

463
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,011
Those that learn it exists...

464
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:17,518
...must posses a rare degree of intuition,
sensitivity and a questioning nature.

465
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:24,024
Signal is stable. This frequency
will continue to remain open.

466
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:31,782
However, very rarely...

467
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:36,203
...some gain this wisdom
through wholly different means.

468
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:40,749
This man is one of those few.

469
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,336
Gentlemen, please take your marks!

470
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,687
Of course I believe you, Dan.
It's got to be some kind of mix-up.

471
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:04,439
You'll clear it up,
and if you can't, you'll go on.

472
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:07,860
Just like you've always done.
You know that.

473
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:11,822
I don't know, Dad. I don't know
what to believe in anymore.

474
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,700
Well, nothing worth doing in life
is easy.

475
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,953
And I have great faith in you, son.
I know you can do it.

476
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,496
Thanks, Dad.

477
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:46,356
This is no good, Dan!
Your muscles are about to burst!

478
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:49,776
Listen to me, there are 5000
different reasons why you shouldn't...

479
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:51,862
I know, but I'm not withdrawing, Tom.

480
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:55,199
Does the concept "first in qualifying"
mean anything to you?

481
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:57,576
That's enough already!
You hear me?

482
01:16:57,784 --> 01:17:01,246
This is all we've worked for since the incident!
Injure yourself now and it's over!

483
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:05,209
You'll lose everything! Over!
And you can kiss your career goodbye!

484
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:08,670
I've made up my mind.
And I'm running tomorrow.

485
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:10,047
Oh, are you?

486
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:12,466
You may run,
but if you push yourself any more...

487
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:15,177
...you'll be lucky to break
nine minutes!

488
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,264
I mean, why bother?
It's just not worth it, buddy.

489
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:22,768
No one will ever beat my record.
It's the last chance for me to finally...

490
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,394
What?

491
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:28,440
Prove them wrong.

492
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:30,776
Then do it without me.

493
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,234
Hey, Dan, you got a second?

494
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:16,196
- The clock's ticking.
- Just wanted to ask a few questions.

495
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:20,826
- You must be excited to run tomorrow.
- Always. I've never felt this good.

496
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:37,009
So, what was it like
breaking 9.8 in the qualifying heat?

497
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:40,512
Like nothing I've ever felt before.
It's everything I've worked for.

498
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,682
And now I'm just hoping
I can get back there again.

499
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:46,268
Someone once said
it feels like zero gravity.

500
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,855
You're released from the world
and you're totally free.

501
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,357
That sounds amazing.
It must be really nice.

502
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:54,651
I mean, especially considering
what happened.

503
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:57,738
Well, I'll tell you, there aren't
any reporters out there.

504
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,908
All right, Dan, I guess
I'm going to take that as my cue.

505
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,577
But you should know even some of us
reporters are fans...

506
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,413
...so I'll just say good luck to you.

507
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:29,353
American Dan Davis is down!

508
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:42,950
I have an unstable signal.

509
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:00,175
He cannot wake up.
Do not let him wake up.

510
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:39,816
Dan Davis of the United States
finishes with a time of 8.72 seconds...

511
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:41,944
...a new world record.

512
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,120
I'll tell you something...

513
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:55,707
...there's nothing quite like cherry pie
baked by my Aunt Daisy.

514
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:59,253
She always bakes me one when I visit.
Look forward to it actually.

515
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:03,257
It may sound like I'm bragging, but it's
really the best cherry pie in the world.

516
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:06,426
She was a bit of an eccentric.
She didn't get along with my mom...

517
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,471
...but I always loved her.
She taught me so many things.

518
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:12,015
We'd go to Broadway musicals,
to the movies.

519
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:14,601
Now they call her
the "queen of mystery literature."

520
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,229
Lives in an elegant villa
in the south of France.

521
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,982
But, when I go visit,
she still bakes me her cherry pie.

522
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:25,028
Something about biting into it, just
for that brief moment tasting perfection.

523
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:26,989
Like leaving your body or something.

524
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:30,158
Anyone can write a novel,
but no one can beat her cherry pie.

525
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:33,787
An interesting case,
but nothing to be concerned about.

526
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:37,833
His memory of the race was expunged
with no residual effects.

527
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,420
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.

528
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:46,633
We'll continue monitoring him
for a while, but anticipate no problems.

529
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:52,306
A record that will live on
in people's memories for years to come.

530
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:55,392
What more could anyone ask for?

531
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:00,564
Free...

532
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,108
Did you say something?

533
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:05,235
Sit down.

534
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:09,364
Free...

535
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:13,076
Sit down!

536
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:31,428
THE END

537
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:45,442
KID'S STORY

538
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,410
Somebody

539
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:38,412
tell me.

540
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,416
Why it feels more real when

541
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:45,919
I dream

542
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,421
than when

543
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:49,339
I am awake

544
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:05,939
Somebody tell me.
Why it feels more real when I dream than when
I am awake. How can I know if my senses are lying?

545
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:20,913
There is some fiction in your truth

546
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,917
and some truth in your fiction.

547
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:30,923
To know the truth,

548
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:37,930
you must risk everything

549
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:48,941
Who are you?

550
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:56,949
Am I alone?

551
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:33,045
Mr. Popper, what is my policy
on ringing phones in the classroom?

552
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:34,838
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Yes, well...

553
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:39,051
...you're barely passing my class
as it is, Mr. Popper.

554
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:44,806
- It won't happen again, sir.
- For your sake, I hope not.

555
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:10,874
I turned it off. I know I did.

556
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,724
They know you know.
They're coming for you.

557
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,352
Get out. Get out now!

558
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:38,277
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.

559
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:51,892
Stop right there!

560
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,395
Mr. Popper.

561
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:02,379
Neo, I believe.
I know it wasn't a dream.

562
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:55,807
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.

563
01:31:56,767 --> 01:32:01,772
A typical mental delusion. We get
unbalanced kids like this all the time.

564
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:04,316
Reality can be a pretty scary thing
for some people.

565
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:08,111
This world must have been a cold
and alienating place for a boy like that.

566
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,197
It's called denying reality.

567
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:14,576
It's, you know, just a self-defense
mechanism for those type of kids.

568
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:19,248
Well, he's in another world now.

569
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,959
Make no mistake about that.

570
01:32:29,842 --> 01:32:32,636
His vitals are good. He's gonna make it.

571
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:36,849
It's unbelievable. I didn't think
self-substantiation was possible.

572
01:32:36,974 --> 01:32:38,934
Apparently, it is.

573
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:40,644
Neo.

574
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:44,648
It's okay. You're safe now.

575
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,109
I knew...

576
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:50,988
...you'd save me.

577
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:53,240
I didn't save you, kid.

578
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:56,201
You saved yourself.

579
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,204
Who are you?
Am I alone?

580
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:10,215
You are not alone.

581
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,551
THE END
