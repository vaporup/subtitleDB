1
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,963
100%, Utah! Good job!

2
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,563
<i>Hi. Johnny Utah.</i>

3
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,641
Your 9:00 appointment is here.

4
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,804
<i>Special Agent John Utah.
Day number one in LA. Welcome aboard.</i>

5
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:30,041
- Been going over your personnel record. Very impressive.
- Thank you.

6
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:33,440
You may very well have been in the top
two percent of your class at Quantico...

7
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:37,443
but, quite frankly, son, out here you have
exactly zero hours of experience in the field.

8
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,680
You know nothing. In fact,
you know less than nothing.

9
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,442
If you even knew you knew nothing,
that'd be something, but you don't.

10
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,441
- Yes, sir.
- You eat a solid breakfast, Utah?

11
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:46,441
- Sir?
- All the food groups. Avoiding caffeine, sugar.

12
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,805
I like to make sure that all my people
maintain sound cardiovascular fitness.

13
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:51,926
We don't drink,
and we sure as hell don't smoke.

14
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,125
- Sir, I take the skin off chicken.
- Good man.

15
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,803
This is us.

16
00:03:56,877 --> 00:04:00,643
Bank Robbery. And you are now in
the bank robbery capital of the world.

17
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:04,243
<i>1,322 last year in L.A. County.
Up 26% from the year before.</i>

18
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,968
That's correct.
And we nailed over 1,000 of them.

19
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,323
Miss Deer,
take a look at that for me.

20
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,286
<i>Thank you. Do you know
how we nail the bad guys, Utah?</i>

21
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:15,007
Do you know how we nail 'em?
By crunching data.

22
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:17,443
Good crime scene work,
good lab work...

23
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,725
and most importantly,
good data-based analysis.

24
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:25,165
Special Agent Utah,
are you receiving my signal?

25
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:28,319
Zero distortion, sir.

26
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,398
I love these things.

27
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,684
You're a real blue-ﬂame
special, aren't you, son?

28
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:39,361
Young, dumb
and full of come. I know.

29
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:44,601
What I don't know is how-how you got yourself
assigned out hereto Los Angeles with us.

30
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:49,761
I mean, hell. I guess we just must have
ourselves an asshole shortage, huh?

31
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:55,040
Not so far.

32
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,960
Okay.

33
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:05,957
- Pappas.
- Yeah.

34
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:11,564
Here. Put on a blindfold. I want to see you
retrieve at least two bricks off the bottom.

35
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,841
<i>One-</i>

36
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,836
<i>Two.</i>

37
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:21,441
I been in the field for 22 years.

38
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,876
- I fired my piece over 19 times in the line of duty.
- Johnny Utah.

39
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,196
I got no idea what a blind man fetching
bricks from the bottom of the pool...

40
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,435
has got to do
with being a special agent.

41
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,436
Added to which indignity...

42
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:36,484
I have been saddled with some
blue-ﬂamer Quantico cat...

43
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:40,399
some quarterback punk,
Johnny Unitas or something.

44
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,396
- The shit they pull, huh?
- Yeah!

45
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:44,076
- Hey, Angie.
- What?

46
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,679
- Here's your guy.
- What?

47
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,643
Pappas

48
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,761
- Angelo Pappas.
- Punk. Quarterback punk.

49
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,199
Hmm. Welcome to Sea World, kid.

50
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,762
<i>Good luck, Pappas.</i>

51
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:03,438
Two bricks, comin' up.

52
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:20,596
Little hand says
it's time to rock and roll.

53
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,639
- Everybody freeze!
- Nobody move!

54
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:24,361
<i>Get your hands up
and your eyes down!</i>

55
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:28,037
All tellers, back away from the counters!
Hands on your head now!

56
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,717
Everybody out from behind your desk!
On the ﬂoor!

57
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,031
<i>Move it!</i>

58
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,431
- <i>Now! Get down!</i>
- <i>What's the matter with you people?</i>

59
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,513
You, out of the cubicle!

60
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:40,117
Get out of my way! Now back away from
the counter and get your fuckin' hands up!

61
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,397
<i>Bitch, what's the matter with you?</i>

62
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,676
You got earwax?

63
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,640
Back away! Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

64
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,791
- <i>Hands</i> up!
- Hello, hello, hello...

65
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,031
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

66
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,761
<i>We are the Ex-Presidents.</i>

67
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,116
And we need just a few
moments of your time.

68
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,717
<i>We've been screwing you for years, so a few
more seconds shouldn't matter, should it?</i>

69
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,553
On the ﬂoor, asshole.

70
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,519
<i>Your money's insured,
so it's not worth dying for.</i>

71
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,875
- How you doing, Dick?
- just implementing our own plan...

72
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,911
of deregulation, Mr. President.

73
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,158
- Time, Mr. Carter?
- Sixty!

74
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,072
- L.B.J.?
- We're stylin'.

75
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,117
- Oh, Ron, I've got Nancy on the line.
- Whoo!

76
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:26,351
<i>Eighty!</i>

77
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:30,399
- <i>Air Force One is waiting, Mr. President.</i>
- Let's <i>go! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

78
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,828
Get your hands where
I can fuckin' see 'em!

79
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:35,275
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,311
And, please, don't forget to vote.

81
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:39,913
I'm not a crook!

82
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,714
<i>Twenty-seven banks in three years.</i>

83
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:53,950
<i>God. In and out in 90 seconds.</i>

84
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,950
No one ever gets shot.

85
00:07:56,027 --> 00:08:00,748
What are we talkin' about here?
We're talkin' about solid professionals.

86
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:04,912
- Good moves.
- Yeah. They control the room well.

87
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,830
And they stick strictly to
the cash drawers.

88
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,956
- They don't go for the vault?
- No. They never go for the vault.

89
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,028
They never get greedy.

90
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:16,429
- Smart. You burn time in the vault.
- Yep. That's right.

91
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:21,353
Reagan usually does the driving. Stolen switch car.
They leave it running on the curb.

92
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,349
It looks parked from a distance.

93
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:26,236
And when they run,
they dump the vehicle and they vanish...

94
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,228
like a virgin on prom night.

95
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:31,150
I mean, they vanish. Pfft!

96
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,307
Surgical.

97
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:38,072
Look at them separate the dye pack.
Dick and Ronnie know their jobs.

98
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:41,911
Yeah, the Ex-Presidents
are the best I've ever seen. Ever.

99
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:44,716
Anytime you two are finished
jerking off watching MTV...

100
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,708
we need to get a look
at these tapes.

101
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:49,594
Hey, Pappas. You, uh, tell the kid
your theory on the Presidents?

102
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,588
Just take the tapes and go, Babbit.

103
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:57,510
Hang 10, Pappas.
Like, totally rad, dude!

104
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,430
- I tell you. The department loves it.
- What's he talking about, Angelo?

105
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:07,145
- Found the drop car on Mulholland Drive. I'd like two volunt-
- We'll go work it.

106
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,226
- Oh, no.
- Angelo.

107
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,789
- Come on.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,787
- We'll go work it.
- Good.

109
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:19,144
Excuse me.

110
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,704
I'm working a fuckin' drop car.

111
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,791
I can't believe it.
Working a drop car.

112
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,072
Pappas. What a hard-on.

113
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,265
<i>- Keep 'em away from there.
- All right.</i>

114
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,383
<i>459 called in at about 5:25.</i>

115
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,950
<i>This car doesn't have A.C.
Today was a scorcher.</i>

116
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,423
Sweat secretions in the seat backs.

117
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:45,024
Are you through, Mr. Wizard?

118
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:48,504
Let me know if you find jimmy Hoffa
under the seat while you're at it.

119
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,268
Oh, look at this. It's 7:30.

120
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:56,265
Why, the night is still so young.

121
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:59,789
The way you're going, you're gonna be able to
solve this case and start another one, huh?

122
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:02,905
Drop car, my ass. Goddamn.

123
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,346
You've been working
bank robbery, what, 22 years?

124
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,992
Yeah. Twenty-two yea rs.

125
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:12,223
Man, L.A. has changed a lot
during that time.

126
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,269
The air got dirty,
and the sex got clean.

127
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:18,062
Uh-huh. So a guy with that kind of time in
must have some theory about these guys.

128
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,109
Leave it alone, Johnny.

129
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:24,071
Okay, fine. You've given up.
Fine. It doesn't mean I have to.

130
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,623
Hey, hey! Listen.
Forget about it, kid. They are ghosts.

131
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,385
Yeah. Of course.
What am I thinking?

132
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,862
If you couldn't crack it
with all your yea rs of experience...

133
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:37,228
it's impossible to conceive that I
might have something to offer, right?

134
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,225
- Well, maybe I can do better than some over-the-hill burnout.
- Hey, watch your mouth.

135
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,349
Maybe you ought to just take
some early retirement right now...

136
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,788
and get some rent-a-cop
night security job, tell 'Nam stories.

137
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,863
Listen, you snot-nosed little shit!
I was taking shrapnel in Khe Sanh...

138
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:53,591
while you were crapping in your hands
and rubbing it on your face!

139
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,708
- You mad?
- Yeah, I'm mad!

140
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,781
- Good and mad?
- What do you want to do about it?

141
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,864
Feels good, doesn't it?
Like you're still alive, right?

142
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,510
- Yeah!
- Well, since you're still alive...

143
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,502
and you're not
in the box just yet...

144
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,867
why don't you tell me this theory of yours
and we'll go get these guys?

145
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:15,550
Okay, hotshot.

146
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:18,827
You want to nail the bank robbers
and be a big hero?

147
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,260
- Definitely.
- “Definitely.”

148
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,659
Then here it is.

149
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:28,106
The Ex-Presidents...
are surfers.

150
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:32,142
- Surfers?
- Surfers.

151
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:36,621
It's in our face.
Look at the tan line on this guy.

152
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:40,383
- Oh, well, he must be a surfer.
- Well, yeah.

153
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:45,537
So last year, Nixon scuffs the counter
when he's going over.

154
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:49,144
So, there is a soil sample.

155
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:51,225
Nonspecific mud.

156
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:53,823
<i>Traces of asphalt.
Traces of oil.</i>

157
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:57,344
Traces of sand. Carnauba wax.

158
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,340
So I become a wax expert.

159
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,738
Now there's 80-some uses
for this stuff.

160
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,296
<i>Something like 500 products.</i>

161
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,347
Candle wax. Car wax.
Mustache wax.

162
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,181
It could be anything.

163
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,942
Guy's waxing his mustache
at the beach...

164
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,939
gets sand in it...

165
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,986
takes it off with a shoe,
shoe scuffs the counter.

166
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:19,979
Would you just shut up a minute?

167
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:21,979
Just listen to me.
Maybe you'll learn something.

168
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,626
The lab gave us
three possible matches.

169
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,619
This is one of them.

170
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:29,619
- Sex Wax?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,902
You're not into kinky
shit, are you, Angelo?

172
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,297
Not yet. Surfers use this.

173
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,026
- They rub it on their boards for traction.
- Thanks for the tip.

174
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,945
You're welcome for the tip.
Well, here's another tip.

175
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:43,138
Check out... the dates
on these robberies.

176
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:45,946
It's strictly a summer job
for these idiots.

177
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:48,017
Four months.

178
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:51,497
June to October.

179
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,142
- Same the year before.
- That's right.

180
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,455
We have one more month.

181
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,536
We won't see 'em till next summer.

182
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,660
They're traveling on the money,
going where the waves are.

183
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,896
That's right.

184
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,579
The Ex-Presidents...

185
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:12,022
rip off banks to finance
their endless summer.

186
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:19,133
Hey, man. A lot of guys
your age are learning to surf.

187
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,375
It's cool.
There's nothing wrong with it.

188
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:24,855
- I'm 25.
- That's what I'm saying. It's never too late.

189
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,021
<i>Hope you stick with it.</i>

190
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,937
Surfing's the source.
It can change your life. I swear to God.

191
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:37,863
Why can't I just walk around
with this thing under my arm...

192
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,937
and act stoned, ask a few questions?

193
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,094
Well, look.

194
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:46,221
Look at 'em.

195
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:50,342
<i>They're like some kind of tribe.
They got their own language.</i>

196
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,380
You can't just walk up
to those guys.

197
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,853
You have to get out there
and learn the moves...

198
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,458
get into their head,
pick up the speech.

199
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,342
You trying to tell me the F.B.I's
going to pay me to learn to surf?

200
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:03,813
It's either you or me out there on the board.
You get my drift?

201
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:06,020
Angelo, this is for little rubber people
who don't shave yet.

202
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:09,493
Come on. You're the quarterback jock.
It's all balance, right?

203
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,494
And coordination.

204
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,495
How hard can it be?

205
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,091
Hold on.

206
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,650
Hold on.

207
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:26,897
Use your arms. Paddle. Come on!

208
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,969
Use your arms.

209
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,848
You're all right.
Come on. You're okay.

210
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,490
You crazy son of a bitch!

211
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,729
If you want to commit suicide,
you do it someplace else!

212
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,007
This pig board piece of shit.

213
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:02,011
You got no business
out here whatsoever!

214
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,007
Hey!

215
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,054
My name's Johnny Utah!

216
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,128

Female. Blue eyes.

227
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,645
Black hair.
Five foot six, 119 pounds.

228
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,964
God, Utah.

229
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:37,091
Not bad, Utah.

230
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:41,168

Hot. Very hot.

234
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:54,563
What else they got on her?

235
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:59,204
I still haven't found anything I can really use.
I gotta find an approach, a way in.

236
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:01,204
Here we go.

237
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,609
Both parents deceased.

238
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,572
Airplane crash. San Diego, '84.

239
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,690
Yeah. Definitely.

240
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,522
See you later, Wayne.

241
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,568
Next.

242
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:41,128
- What do you want?
- Shrimp and fries.

243
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,168
I mean, what do you want?

244
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,931
- Why do you keep hanging around here?
- I need you to teach me.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,321
Give me a break.
Uh, shrimp and fries.

246
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,800
To go.

247
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,803
Would you like something
to drink with that, sir?

248
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,405
- I'm serious.
- I can see that you're serious.

249
00:18:56,479 --> 00:19:00,120
Forget it. Stick to tennis.

250
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,167
I don't know.
Whatever you do good.

251
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,765
Uh, miniature golf.
Your number's 37.

252
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,764
You don't understand.
I'm gonna learn to surf or break my neck.

253
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:16,088
What is it? You all of a sudden got this
bug that you just have to go surfing?

254
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,081
This is a line, right?

255
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,402
No. No.

256
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:24,243
See...

257
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,089
my whole life I've done
things for other people.

258
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:30,321
In high school I played football
because my old man expected me to.

259
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:34,004
- Mm-hmm.
- And my parents always figured I'd go to law school.

260
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:36,803
So I did. Football scholarship.

261
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,608
- Phi Beta Kappa.
- Is this gonna take a really long time?

262
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:43,524
- Wait. So I'm a big hero to my folks, right?
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:47,044
But two yea rs ago,
they were killed in a car wreck.

264
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:51,042
You can't imagine it.
Your whole life changes.

265
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:56,043
And I suddenly realized
that all my goals had been their goals...

266
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:58,597
and I hadn't been living
my own life.

267
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,644
So I wanted something for myself.

268
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:06,002
So I come out here
from Ohio a month ago.

269
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:09,444
I've never seen the ocean before-
any ocean.

270
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,962
I never thought
it would affect me so much.

271
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,239
I'm drawn to it.

272
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,397
Or something.

273
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,478
I want to do what you do.

274
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,035
<i>It's the truth.</i>

275
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,278
All right. Okay.

276
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,518
Tomorrow, here...

277
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:35,075
6:00 a.m.

278
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,238
If you are one minute late,
I'm gone.

279
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:41,922
<i>And, stud, I didn't
take you on to raise, so...</i>

280
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:45,794
I'll teach you a few things, and after that
you're gonna be on your own, okay?

281
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,877
God.

282
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,199
Stop here.

283
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:56,198
- Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
- Sure.

284
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,722
Pop! POP-

285
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:03,037
You stand straight up, you’re just gonna
fall right over. So let's try it again.

286
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,398
Start over. Just do it again.

287
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:10,205
<i>Hey. What you doing, huh?</i>

288
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,002
just do it again. Pop up.

289
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:14,314
<i>You gotta stay low.
You're gonna bite it.</i>

290
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:17,204
You dragged a knee that time.
You'll just-You'll just wipe out.

291
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:20,004
You're dragging your foot.
You're gonna be fish food.

292
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:23,794
Both feet have to land on the board
at the same time.

293
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,843
That's it. That's it.
You're surfing.

That's a-

333
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:28,747
That's a surfboard, all right.
Looks like a '57 Chevy I used to have.

334

Uh, Tyler, come here.

335
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:39,795
<i>So, uh, who's the guy?</i>

336
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,832
You replacing me?

337
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:44,988
- Give me a break. Where you been?
- He surfs real well.

338
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:48,910
- Come on. He's from Kansas or something.
- He's from Kansas?

339
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,953
Heads UP!

340
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,264
<i>Yeah.</i>

341
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,392
Good catch.

342
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:01,705
Ready! Set!

343
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:05,584
<i>Hut! Go! Let's go! Go, go!</i>

344
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,712

345
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,465

- Yes, <i>mama!</i> Yes, <i>baby!</i>

352
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,384
Whose ball is this?
Who works here?

353
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:44,385
<i>You! You! You!</i>

363
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,708
Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you? Don't
you think that's a little out of line?

364
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,989
- Cool it, Roach. Don't you know who this is?
- No, I don't know who this is.

365
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,906
This is Johnny Utah. The Ohio State
Buckeyes, all-conference, remember?

366
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,266
Number nine, man.
How you doing? Nice to meet ya.

367
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,822
Oh, shit. Jesus Chri-Johnny fucking Utah. Sorry, man.
Didn't mean to get in your face.

368
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,221
I knew I knew you. It was the Rose Bowl
three years ago, and you beat S.C., right?

369
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,223
- You? You did this?
- It was him.

370
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,779
- That was one hell of a game.
- No shit.

371
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:57,100
Yeah. Uh, you got nuked
in the last quarter or something.

372
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,262
Yeah. I got my knee folded back
about 90 degrees the wrong way.

373
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:02,347
- <i>Whoa.</i>
- That's why you never went pro?

374
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:05,389
Two years of surgery.
Missed my window.

375
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,949
<i>Limped through law school instead.</i>

376
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,420
Law school? You're a lawyer?

377
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,467
- <i>Wow.</i>
<i>- Ouch.</i>

378
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,382
Well, life's not over yet, man.
You're surfing.

379
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,780
- Lawyers don't surf.
- This one does.

380
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,822
- <i>Let's jam!</i>
<i>- Let's play some football!</i>

381
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,186
<i>Special Agent Utah...</i>

382
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:35,547
this is not some job ﬂipping burgers
at the local drive-in.

383
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:38,826
<i>Yes, the surfboard bothers me.</i>

384
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:41,583
Yes, your approach to this whole
goddamn case bothers me...

385
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:43,659
and yes, you bother me!

386
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:46,547
And Pappas!
Oh, for the love of Christ.

387
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:48,699
Just how the hell
did I ever even let you...

388
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:51,348
talk me into this whole
boneheaded idea to begin with?

389
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:55,217
Harp, we're working undercover.
It takes time. We produced a few-

390
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:57,664
No, no, no, no, no, no!

391
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:00,182
Let me tell you what you produced.

392
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:04,341
Over the last two weeks,
you two have produced exactly squat!

393
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,339
Squat!

394
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,705
During which time, the Ex-Presidents
have robbed two more banks!

395
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,177
Now, for Christ's sake,
does either one of you...

396
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,941
have anything even remotely
interesting to tell me?

397
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,507
Caught my first tube this morning...

398
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,543
sir.

399
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:23,538
Goddamn it.

400
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:26,858
- Why didn't you leave that thing in the car?
- It sticks out. I can't lock it.

401
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:29,097
Anyway, what's his problem?

402
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,741
We're handling our caseload.
I'm surfing on my own time.

403
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,022
I know it. Just don't rub
Harp's nose in it.

404
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:36,900
Look, Angelo, you think
I joined the F.B.I. to learn to surf?

405
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,815
This was your lame-o idea in the first place.
You gotta back me up on this.

406
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:43,983
Johnny, we better
come up with something real quick.

407
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,978
- My friend-
- What?

408
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:56,218
<i>Encino Savings and Loan.
Guard grabbed L.B.J.'s ponytail.</i>

409
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:59,059
Twenty-eight robberies,
and what do we get from it?

410
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:01,057
One fucking hair.

411
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:02,943
<i>- Angelo. Pay attention.
- What?</i>

412
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:05,414
There's gonna be a test afterward.

413
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,543
Lab is showing traces
of toxins in the hair.

414
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,696
<i>Selenium, titanium and arsenic.</i>

415
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:14,015
The beaches are always being closed
because of waste spills, right?

416
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,500
- <i>Yeah.
-</i> And surfers are territorial.

417
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:18,894
They stick mostly to certain breaks.

418
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:22,574
If we can get some hair samples
and get a match at a certain beach...

419
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,497
we'd know which break
the Ex-Presidents surf.

420
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,335
You buyin' this?

421
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,493
- No.
- No.

422
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,496
But let's do it anyway.

423
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,695
It will bug the shit out of Harp.

424
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:40,694
- My man.
- Yeah.

425
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:57,854
Hey. When you two are done
making out, I need to talk to you.

426
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,332
What's this, fucking narco
entrapment or what, dude?

427
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:02,812
- Not exactly, dude.
- Oh, shit.

428
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:06,054
Making a wig for my girlfriend.
Thank you.

429
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:09,692
- What the fuck? Fucking guy's a narc, man.
- Dude cut my hair.

430
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:12,735
- So what? He didn't bust us.
- Dude, he fucking cut my hair.

431
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,495
Brah. Brah.

432
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:19,737
Don't move. You've got some huge sucker
crawling right into your ear.

433
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:21,733
- Got it!
- Hey!

434
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,541
Leave some fucking hair, man.

435
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,057
- What is it?
- I saved your life, bro.

436
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,132
Close one.

437
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,731
P.C.B.'s, selenium,
titanium, arsenic.

438
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,938
The percentages look right.

439
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,012
- Here's a match.
- There's a match?

440
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,218
Latigo Beach. Nice point break.

441
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,736
- Long, workable rides.
- Surfs up, ace.

442
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:09,131
Stay off my wave.

443
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:16,058
Goons trying to drop in.

444
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,689
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

445
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:35,527
<i>♪ One, two ♪</i>

446
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:39,134

447
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:53,249
Out of the way, you shit!

448
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,291
Hey!

449
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:09,492
<i>You dinged my board, dude!</i>

450
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,886
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going?

451
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:20,493
Politeness counts, asshole!

452
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,216
<i>Go back to the Valley, man.</i>

453
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,850
<i>Angelo, I've eaten shit 47 times...</i>

454
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:43,849
I've got my lights punched out
by some psycho local...

455
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,086
and there must be 20 guys
out here with ponytails.

456
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,406
Patience, hotshot. Patience.

457
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:50,612
It'll be subtle,
if it's here at all.

458
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:53,085
There'll be a group
within the group.

459
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:56,088
These guys are a real tight unit.
You'll see them. You'll know it.

460
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:37,613
- This the guy?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,049
Okay.

462
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:43,045
I know.

463
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,205
This is where you tell me
all about how locals rule...

464
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:48,825
and yuppie insects
like me shouldn't be

465
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,392
surfing your break
and all that, right?

466
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:54,008
Nope.

467
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:57,767
That would be a waste of time.

468
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,607
We're just gonna fuck you up.

469
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,923
<i>Oh.</i>

470
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,889
Eat that!

471
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,645
Get him! Fuck him up!

472
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,960
Johnny, you there?

473
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,486
You better not be trying
to pick up any babes.

474
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,404
Hit 'em! Yeah!

475
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Harder! Yeah!

476
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,681
- Back off! He's with me!
- Kiss my ass.

477
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,648
Back off, Warchild. Seriously.

478
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,568
Thank you.

479
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,290
- Stay out of this, Bodhi.
- What's your name?

480
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:58,930
- Bunker.
- Bunker.

481
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:02,798
Listen, Bunker.
I'm actually really glad you found me.

482
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:04,483
Yeah? Why?

483
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,724
- <i>Hey!
- Back off.</i>

484
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,480
Hey, man!

485
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,528
Shit!

486
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:17,481
Come on! Come on!

487
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,522
Come here!

488
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,086
<i>Fuck.</i>

489
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:34,526
<i>This is stimulating, but we're out of here.
Let's go, Utah.</i>

490
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,439
Just keep walking.

491
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:49,523
Hold it. Look.

492
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:52,640
You two guys seen a kid
run through here with a car stereo?

493
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,640
- He stole it from me.
- No, but, uh...

494
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,640
- there's four guys back there you
might want to check out. - Oh.

495
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,878
- Thanks, buddy.
- Hope you find him.

496
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:02,880
Don't worry. I will.

497
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:06,039
You like to start shit, don't you?

498
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:09,802
- Who are those guys?
- Nazi assholes.

499
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,799
The guy you dropped is Bunker Weiss.

500
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:15,801
The big one is Warchild,
a.k.a. Lupton Pitman.

501
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,482
The other two-
Hell, I don't know. They-They, uh-

502
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,796
They think they're some kind of
death squad around here.

503
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:21,961
What's their program?

504
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:25,025
Brains are wired wrong, and
they're into some bad shit.

505
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,203
Like what? Illegal shit?

506
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:30,324
Maybe. I don't know.
That's not what I'm talking about.

507
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:33,922
They only live to get radical. They don't
have any real understanding of the sea...

508
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,156
so they'll never get
the spiritual side of it.

509
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:40,200
Hey, you're not gonna start
chanting or anything, are you?

510
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,005
I might.

511
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,077
This is me.

512
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:48,117
So, uh...

513
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:51,444
you still haven't figured out
what riding waves is all about, have you?

514
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:54,198
It's a state of mind.

515
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,845
It's that place where you lose yourself
and you find yourself.

516
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,360
You don't know it yet,
but you got it. It's right there.

517
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,482
I saw you with those guys.
You're a pit bull.

518
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,555
You didn't hesitate, and they
didn't back you down an inch...

519
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,682
and that is very rare in this world.

520
00:37:05,794 --> 00:37:08,035
- Well, thanks for steppin' in.
- <i>De nada.</i>

521
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:10,036
Later. Oh, hey.

522
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:13,197
I'm, uh, having some people over at
my house tonight if you want to come.

523
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,719
- Sure. Where?
- Come with Tyler. She knows.

524
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:17,761
All right.

525
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,882
Next time you leave your piece and
shield in the car, you stay in sight, okay?

526
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:24,876
Okay, dad.

527
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:31,715
Yeah, I need you to
run a plate for me.

528
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,957
2-Denver-4-Sam-Niner-Five-Niner.
Late '70s jeep.

529
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:45,080
<i>The jeep belongs to
a Bunker Weiss. My buddy.</i>

530
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:47,279
Guy's got quite a sheet. Yeah?

531
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,958
<i>Yeah, slap all that.
Give me the greatest hits.</i>

532
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:52,478
<i>Felony possession of cocaine.
That's good.</i>

533
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:55,031
<i>Felony “B” and “E.”
Three months in juvie.</i>

534
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,080
Felony assault.

535
00:37:57,152 --> 00:38:00,121
Postgraduate work at Chino.
Excellent. I'm loving it.

536
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:02,718
<i>These guys really fit the profile.</i>

537
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,073
I say we lay it on Harp.

538
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:15,400
Here comes the night shift.

539
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,675
<i>Hey, who was that girl?
No, the girl with the really big tits.</i>

540
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,154
<i>This is bullshit. This is a bullshit lead.
This is totally bullshit.</i>

541
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,040
Harp must be fuckin' desperate
if he's listening to you two ﬂakes.

542
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,238
See you bright and early, guys.

543
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,472
Yeah, right.

544
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,473
Here you go.

545
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:38,598
Cold pizza for you.
It's good for breakfast.

546
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,672
See ya.

547
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,877
When did Harp say
we'd get the warrant?

548
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,430
He's gonna push it through first thing.
You better get some sleep.

549
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,432

We drop down into the pit.
It's 25 feet straight down.

572
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:04,316
And your balls-
Man, your balls are about this big.

573
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,071
<i>And the whole thing's

<i>Yeah, and if you lose it...</i>

577
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,513
the fish will be
picking you out of the coral.

578
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:21,475
Big-wave riding's for macho
assholes with a death wish.

579
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,947
<i>No, it's not. It's the ultimate rush.</i>

580
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,875
<i>There's nothing
that comes close to it.</i>

581
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:28,649
Not even sex.

582
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:31,332
Maybe that's 'cause you're
not doing it right, Roach.

583
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:36,906
Just paddling out into big surf
is a total commitment.

584
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,749
You can't just call time out
and stroll on into the beach...

585
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,748
if you don't like
the way things are goin'.

586
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:44,395
So what's the biggest? Waimea?

587
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:45,954
- Ridden?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

588
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:48,027
- Makaha.
- Dana Point.

589
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,425
Bells Beach, Australia.

590
00:40:50,504 --> 00:40:53,906
Whoa, whoa. No way Bells is bigger
than Waimea, bro.

591
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:55,554
Will be next year.

592
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:58,673
Bodhi believes the 50-year
storm is coming next year.

593
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:01,269
The 50-year storm? What's that?

594
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:05,109
- That's kind of a legend.
- No, it's real. It's absolutely real.

595
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:07,504
<i>Everything moves in cycles.</i>

596
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:12,032
So twice a century, the ocean lets us
know just how small we really are.

597
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,825
A winter storm comes out of Antarctica
tearing up the Pacific...

598
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:20,864
<i>and it sends a huge
swell north 2,000 miles.</i>

599
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,946
And when it hits Bells Beach...

600
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,827
it'll turn into the
biggest surf this

601
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,893
planet has ever seen,
and I will be there.

602
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,626
- <i>So</i> will <i>I.</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

603
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:37,230
If you want the ultimate, you gotta
be willing to pay the ultimate price.

604
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,943
It's not tragic to die
doing what you love.

605
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:45,185
- That's how I wanna go.
- Hell, I ain't gonna live to see 30.

606
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:51,793
- There's too much testosterone here.

<i>Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.</i>

Hope you're not buying
into this banzai

614
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,449
bullshit like the rest
of Bodhi's Moonies.

615
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,987
What are you talkin' about?

616
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,782
You got the kamikaze look, Johnny.
I've seen it.

617
00:42:50,899 --> 00:42:52,822
Bodhi can smell it a mile away.

618
00:42:54,259 --> 00:42:56,466
He'll take you to the edge.

619
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,462
Past it.

620
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:01,064
- <i>Hey, Bodhi.</i>
- Johnny has his own demons.

621
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:02,948
Don't you, Johnny?

622
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:09,342
What's going on?

623
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:11,421
<i>- Whoo!
- Go!</i>

624
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:16,581
Here. Time for a little stealth mission.
You up for it?

625
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:22,501
<i>- Let's do it.</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

626
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,585
I can barely do this
in broad daylight.

627
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:38,787
Come on. At least nobody's
gonna see how bad you are.

628
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,616
Whoo!

629
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:05,457
- I don't think he's ready for this.
- Nah, he'll be fine.

630
00:44:09,696 --> 00:44:12,426
Shit!

631
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:15,659
Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck!

632
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:32,223
- I gotta be fuckin' crazy.
- But are you crazy enough?

633
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,105
Whoo-hoo!

634
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:43,066
Whoo! Tyler!

635
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,857
Whoo!

636
00:44:48,934 --> 00:44:52,063
I can't see shit out here.
I'm gonna die.

637
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,785
Just feel what the wave is doing.
Then accept its energy...

638
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:57,174
get in sync, then charge with it.

639
00:44:57,254 --> 00:45:00,337
- <i>You don't need to see.</i>
- Yeah, right. Vision is highly overrated.

640
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:05,577
Okay, Johnny. This one's got your number
on it. Let's jam. Now paddle!

641
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:08,577
- Go, <i>boy!</i> jam!
- Shit. I'm gonna die now.

642
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,894
Gonna fuckin' die now.

643
00:45:13,773 --> 00:45:17,255
Fuck! Shit!

644
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:22,424
Whoo! You're surf in', man!

645
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:27,418
Whoa!

646
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:38,853
Whoo!

647
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:42,175
I'm fuckin' surfing!

648
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,414
Yeah!

649
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,463
- Check it out!
- Is this not the best feeling on earth?

650
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:51,899
Yeah! Whoo!

651
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:55,340
Whoo-hoo!

652
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:58,779
- Good break, Johnny.
- All right!

653
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:01,854
<i>Yeah!</i>

654
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:03,973
<i>Whoa!</i>

655
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,372
<i>Looks like we lost somebody.</i>

656
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:18,851
- Yeah. Leave the fire for them.
- You hungry?

657
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,853
- <i>Wanna get something to eat?</i>
- Whoo!

658
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,332
- <i>You wanna get something to eat?</i>
- <i>I'm dying.</i> Yeah.

659
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:25,418
<i>I'm starving.</i>

660
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,498
You had enough?

661
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,255
Yeah.

662
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,730
I just want to sit out here
for a minute.

663
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,577
Look at you.

664
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,380
What?

665
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:48,420
Well, usually you have
this intense sort of scowl...

666
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:51,361
of concentration on your
face, like you're doing

667
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:53,964
all this for a school
project or something.

668
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:57,410
Or, like, you've got
something driving you.

669
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:03,296
Look at it. It's gone.

670
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:08,698
If I didn't know better...

671
00:47:08,768 --> 00:47:11,453
I'd say you looked almost happy.

672
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:15,571
I can't describe what I'm feeling.

673
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,209
You don't have to.

674
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,656
Goose bumps.

675
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:29,890
Yeah. It's cold.

676
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:31,969
Yeah.

677
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:37,489
Come here.

678
00:48:23,765 --> 00:48:26,530
Oh.

679
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:28,607
Shit.

680
00:48:33,405 --> 00:48:35,567
- <i>Holy</i> shit.
- <i>What?</i>

681
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,646
Shit!

682
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:42,004
I'm really late.

683
00:48:42,124 --> 00:48:45,446
I mean, I'm really late.
Holy shit.

684
00:48:45,524 --> 00:48:47,492
Shit!

685
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:49,566
Oh, shit!

686
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:59,005
Oh-

687
00:49:15,923 --> 00:49:18,210
I'm really late.

688
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:54,236
You guys need any help?

689
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:57,476
I can't believe you're late
to your own raid. What a ﬂake.

690
00:49:57,522 --> 00:50:00,206
Has that worthless quarterback punk
partner of mine shown up yet?

691
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,018
Right here.

692
00:50:01,044 --> 00:50:03,991
Oh, well, very good of
you to show up, hotshot.

693
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,931
Ow! Watch it.
God, you're gonna tear my skin. Goddamn it.

694
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,203
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.
Where you want me?

695
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:12,842
Okay. Here's how it is. Babbit and Alvarez
are gonna go in the back door.

696
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:16,931
Cullen's gonna back me up. I want you
at the side window by the hedge.

697
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,618
Now you're strictly backup.
I don't wanna

698
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,030
burn your cover.
Have you got that?

699
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:20,760
Got it.

700
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:23,507
Good. Now take your position.
it's showtime.

701
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,887
- Go.
- Asshole.

702
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:35,721
Scooby? Come on, Scooby.

703
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,683
Scooby, where are ya?
You seen a little dog?

704
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:58,046
- No, man.
- No dog? Scooby, come on.

705
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,207
Here, here, Scooby. Scooby.

706
00:52:01,316 --> 00:52:03,239
- What the fuck?
- Get up, man. Get the gun.

707
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:06,286
There's someone
at the front door. Now! Move!

708
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,279
<i>Go, go. Get the guns now.
Get 'em.</i>

709
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:10,596
- Oh.
- Yeah, what?

710
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:12,837
Hi. Oh. Have you seen my dog?
I got a little

711
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,025
dog I'm missing. It's a
cockapoo-like thing.

712
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:16,846
I don't know a thing
about your fuckin' dog.

713
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:17,501
Wait, wait.

714
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:20,161
<i>Your next-door neighbor
said he saw it.</i>

715
00:52:22,315 --> 00:52:24,417
Cullen, this is Utah. Get
Angelo out of there.

716
00:52:24,443 --> 00:52:26,186
They're pulling out
a fuckin' arsenal.

717
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:30,398
Utah, repeat. Say again.

718
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:38,920
Cullen, you copy? Cullen!

719
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:41,281
Alvarez!

720
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:43,362
Don't let him pull his badge!

721
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:46,961
Fuck! I can't hear jack shit
over the lawn mower. Christ!

722
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:51,282
Front door.

723
00:52:51,354 --> 00:52:53,356
Somethings goin' down, man.
This ain't right.

724
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:55,834
Chill the fuck out, man.
It's nothin'.

725
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:59,635
Will you shut the fuck up?
Check the windows, bro. Do it.

726
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:03,957
Shit.

727
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:06,604
<i>...little bastard, right?</i>

728
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:08,954
<i>Before he goes, he lifts his leg.
He was under my house.</i>

729
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:10,178
<i>I don't know anything
about a fucking dog!</i>

730
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:11,186
Hide the shit!

731
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,804
<i>Wait. Wait, wait.
Are you sure it's not in the backyard?</i>

732
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:15,155
I ain't got time for this.

733
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:17,744
There's two guys out the back, man.
Duck down.

734
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:20,319
Oh, shit! Shit! We're fucked!

735
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:22,174
When that fuck comes
through the door, I'm

736
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,859
gonna pump him up, man.
Swear to Christ.

737
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,439
- <i>Are you sure it's not in the back?</i>
- It ain't back there.

738
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,350
Is there anybody else
around who has seen him?

739
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:29,666
Get the fuck out of my face.

740
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:31,840
F.B.I., gorgeous.

741
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:36,839
- F.B.I.! Drop it!
- Fuck you!

742
00:53:42,192 --> 00:53:44,114
<i>Fuckin' pigs!</i>

743
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,512
No, wait! Hey!

744
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:02,122
Goddamn! Oh, fuck!

745
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:04,114
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up!

746
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:06,841
- You motherfuckers! Motherfuckers!
- I said shut up!

747
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,517
<i>Hey, motherfucker, back up!</i>

748
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,877
Back up, or I blow her fuckin' head off!

749
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,952
Back up, or <i>I'll</i> take her with me.
Back up!

750
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,637
I'm coming out right now!
Back off! Back off!

751
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,721
<i>Let me go! Let me go!</i>

752
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,758
<i>Cullen!</i>

753
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,956
Bastard!

754
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,669
Fuck!

755
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,077
You bastard!

756
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:46,399
<i>Go!</i>

757
00:54:57,228 --> 00:54:59,675
- Babbit?
- You fuckers!

758
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:14,830
Hey, hey!

759
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:04,748
<i>Fuck you up, man!</i>

760
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:14,149
Speak into the microphone,
squid-brain.

761
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:20,632
<i>Fuck.</i>

762
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:23,310
- <i>Give me your hand</i>
- Fuck you.

763
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:27,071
- Give me your other hand.
<i>- Fuck.</i>

764
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:29,670
- Fucker.
- This'll feel good to ya.

765
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:32,271
There you go. You okay?

766
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,226
Fuck!

767
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:39,036
<i>Oh, God!</i>

768
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,994
No! Aaah!

769
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:45,466
<i>Don't touch it!</i>

770
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:55,588
it's been pa per targets
up until today, huh?

771
00:56:58,423 --> 00:57:01,553
It's no different, Johnny.
just a little more to clean up.

772
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,551
You did all right today.

773
00:57:04,623 --> 00:57:06,626
You did real good.

774
00:57:06,704 --> 00:57:10,071
<i>Goddamn son of a bitch!</i>

775
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:14,193
Ah, you're the cowboys. You're the real
cowboys, right? Batman and Robin.

776
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:16,231
You know what this is, huh?

777
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,146
You know what this is, punk?

778
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:22,306
This is two keys.
Uncut. Crystal meth.

779
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:24,305
Oh, shit.

780
00:57:24,382 --> 00:57:26,862
<i>Special Agent Utah,
I'd like you to meet Agent Dietz.</i>

781
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:30,503
Works for the D.E.A.
He was working deep cover until you-

782
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:33,392
You think I like
this hair, man? Huh?

783
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:35,385
You think I like these clothes?

784
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:37,385
My wife wants me to stay at Ramada.

785
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:42,023
I've been working on these fuckers
for three months! Three months!

786
00:57:42,142 --> 00:57:44,952
Now I finally got 'em wanting to play
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i> with me...

787
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:48,668
so I can find out who their suppliers is
and you fuckin' cowboys show up.

788
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:52,143
- Nice tattoo, Dietz.
- Oh, you like that, Pappas, huh? Fuck you.

789
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:53,839
He has a record of your
suspects' movements

790
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:55,409
for every day over the
last three months.

791
00:57:55,461 --> 00:57:57,463
All I want to know, smart guy-Okay?

792
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,543
All I want to know is,
how are these guys...

793
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:01,828
robbing Tarzana City
National Bank on August 2...

794
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,949
when they were in
Fort fuckin' Lauderdale August 2?

795
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:05,344
Why don't you figure that out?

796
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,573
That's not an easy thing
to do, is it, Utah?

797
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:08,826
You fuckin' jerks.

798
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,062
Oh, shit.

799
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,702
Shit.

800
00:59:00,939 --> 00:59:03,066
Mmm.

801
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:18,413
...believes it.

802
00:59:18,439 --> 00:59:21,930
Hey. Five-foot walls at Zero's.
Let's go.

803
00:59:21,977 --> 00:59:24,299
<i>Hey, Tyler.</i>

804
00:59:24,378 --> 00:59:26,300
Hey, Bodhi.

805
00:59:26,377 --> 00:59:28,744
So let's go. Time's a-wastin'.

806
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,388
- Now.
- He does this.

807
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:17,096
Yeah!

808
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,940
No!

809
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:30,096
You all right?
You look like you saw a ghost.

810
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:33,303
<i>Forget about it, kid.
They're ghosts.</i>

811
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,022
- I gotta go.
- You gotta what?

812
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:45,257
Listen, I forgot all about a meeting
I have this morning. A new client.

813
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:47,335
<i>I gotta jam. Sorry. Really.</i>

814
01:00:47,413 --> 01:00:49,382
I'll call you later.

815
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:54,858
- So I started trailing him.
- Who, the Zen surf master?

816
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:57,619
Bodhi, yeah.
I'm on him all day, right?

817
01:00:57,694 --> 01:01:00,742
He goes here, he goes there.
He goes to Tower Records, buys some CDs.

818
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:02,862
He has lunch
at Patrick's Road House.

819
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:05,539
He goes into the Assured Trust
Savings and Loan.

820
01:01:05,613 --> 01:01:07,615
- Did he rob it?
- Cute.

821
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:10,981
He's inside 20 minutes.
The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.

822
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:13,414
They were scoping it out, right?

823
01:01:13,493 --> 01:01:16,576
Well, they were scoping it out, or
they were cashing a check. - Wait, wait.

824
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:18,576
Then they go back
to their beach house...

825
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,654
- and they box up all their shit.
- Yeah?

826
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:22,700
See, summer's over.

827
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:26,862
They load it in Bodhi's truck,
and they take it to a public storage unit.

828
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:29,333
And I lost 'em after that,
but the house is empty.

829
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:32,018
- They're definitely out of here.
- Goddamn it.

830
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,823
Why didn't you call me?
They're probably halfway to Maui.

831
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:39,181
Uh-uh. No. They've gotta pick up
some traveling money first.

832
01:01:39,252 --> 01:01:42,858
Assured Trust tomorrow.
Next day outside at the latest.

833
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,854
I definitely got a feeling on this.

834
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:48,094
Oh, you got a feeling. Last time
you had a feeling I had to kill a guy.

835
01:01:48,211 --> 01:01:50,373
And I hate that.
It looks bad on my report.

836
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:54,572
Angelo, I'm right this time.

837
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:56,653
We can still win this one.

838
01:01:57,571 --> 01:01:59,539
Okay.

839
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,380
Tomorrow morning first thing
we'll be at the bank, like stink on shit.

840
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:08,335
<i>This Calvin and Hobbes is funny.</i>

841
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:10,333
<i>Oranges, sir?
Would you like some oranges?</i>

842
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,378
- You want some oranges?
- A dollar, sir. - No.

843
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,374
- Nice and big, sir.
- No. We got a lot. We got a lot.

844
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:17,056
- Dollar, sir.
- No, thanks. Good luck.

845
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,371
God.

846
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:23,211
“For his turkey cemetery.”

847
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,896
Oh.

848
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,052
It's time for lunch.

849
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,053
Angelo, it's 10:30.

850
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,775
Right around that corner,
there is a sandwich shop.

851
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:36,330
They sell meatball sandwiches.

852
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,413
Best I've ever tasted.
Would you go get me two?

853
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,015
Come on, partner. Two.

854
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:46,092
Thank you.

855
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:51,856
Utah! Get me two.

856
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:58,538
- <i>Hi. How ya doin'?</i>
- Hi.

857
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,690
Can I have two meatball sandwiches,
a tuna on wheat...

858
01:03:00,768 --> 01:03:03,248
and two lemonades, please?

859
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,577
<i>Okay, that's two meatballs,
one tuna on wheat, two lemonades.</i>

860
01:03:13,648 --> 01:03:15,809
<i>That's 7.84.</i>

861
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,779
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

862
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:34,218
Oh, boy.

863
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:36,733
Aaah! God. You scared me.

864
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:38,888
Here. Yours is the one
that looks like a roadkill.

865
01:03:38,966 --> 01:03:40,890
- A roadkill?
- Enjoy.

866
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:43,173
- Thank you very much.
- Here's your lemonade.

867
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:46,649
- Thanks. Oh, whoa, whoa.
- Did you see that Lincoln pull up?

868
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:49,047
I'm so hungry I could eat
the ass end out of a dead rhino.

869
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:51,413
I should have had you get me
three of these things.

870
01:03:51,486 --> 01:03:54,013
What Lincoln?

871
01:03:55,846 --> 01:03:59,055
- Goddamn!
- F.B.I.! Freeze!

872
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:00,729
'Got him! 'Got him!

873
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:03,457
- No! Go! Go!
- Freeze!

874
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:08,295
Fuck!

875
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:15,252
<i>Get in! Get in! Jesus Christ.</i>

876
01:04:15,326 --> 01:04:17,327
- Go! Go!
- Fuck!

877
01:04:26,805 --> 01:04:29,410
- Go!
- Gimme a fuckin' break. I <i>am</i> going.

878
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:34,448
I don't see 'em.
Where'd they go?

879
01:04:34,524 --> 01:04:37,449
- I don't fuckin' believe this.
- I think we're losin' 'em.

880
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,526
- You're losing 'em.
- We're not losing 'em.

881
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,572
Over to the right.
Over to the right. Over to the right.

882
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:48,090
Go, go! He's coming up.

883
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,972
Punch it, punch it, punch it.

884
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:51,614
Whoo!

885
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:54,335
- <i>Where is he, Dick?</i>
- He's still behind us.

886
01:04:55,923 --> 01:04:59,053
<i>Hang on, you guys.</i>

887
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:01,603
- We're fucked.
- This car's a piece of shit.

888
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:05,489
Oh, shit.

889
01:05:05,563 --> 01:05:07,611
It's okay. They're on the left.

890
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:26,044
- I think we lost 'em. I can't see 'em.
- Tell me where he is.

891
01:05:26,683 --> 01:05:29,526
Oh, fuck. Watch out.

892
01:05:30,642 --> 01:05:33,212
- We got ya.
- You ain't got shit.

893
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:35,364
<i>Oh, fuck. Hang on!</i>

894
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:43,651
- Goddamn it.
- Come on, come on.

895
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:56,047
Okay, guys,
Time for emergency sanitation.

896
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:07,321
Back off, buddy.
Try it, man.just try it.

897
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,368
- <i>What about the old Chevy?</i>
- This guy down here.

898
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,489
<i>- Come on.
- I got him. I got the guy.</i>

899
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,562
- Get away from the car. Move it!
- Come on, get in.

900
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,325
Wait. Wait, wait.

901
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,088
Don't do it, man. Don't do it.
Don't be stupid.

902
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,003
<i>Run!</i>

903
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,525
Why's he takin' so long?

904
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,005
Come on!

905
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:45,843
- We gotta go now!
- Wait a minute.

906
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,047
- <i>Go! Go!
- Come on!</i>

907
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:57,362
Down! Get down!

908
01:06:57,438 --> 01:06:58,803
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go! Go!

909
01:07:04,118 --> 01:07:06,359
<i>What the fuck!</i>

910
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:55,727
Aaah!

911
01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:03,797
Look out!

912
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,844
Hey!

913
01:08:46,593 --> 01:08:48,995
<i>Get the fuck out of this house! Hey!</i>

914
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:51,684
What do you think you're doing?

915
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,325
'Hey! Hey! Hey!

916
01:09:32,192 --> 01:09:34,877
<i>Oh, no!</i>

917
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,873
<i>Stop or I'll shoot!</i>

918
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:08,201
Damn!

919
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,359
Say again, 41.

920
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:25,990
Roger that, 41.
Cal plate 562, Sam, Ida, Xray.

921
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:28,038
Base out.

922
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:32,715
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

923
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,680
Johnny, I wanna see you
in my office right now.

924
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:41,912
Unit 23, Unit 23.

925
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:44,390
See the manager, 4650 Wilshire.

926
01:10:44,469 --> 01:10:46,392
<i>Roger, 23.</i>

927
01:10:46,468 --> 01:10:49,552
<i>Unit 41, further information
on suspect's vehicle-</i>

928
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:51,552
I want you to know something.

929
01:10:51,629 --> 01:10:54,393
When you shoot, you don't miss.

930
01:10:54,468 --> 01:10:57,075
- I missed.
- No.

931
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:59,150
I believe you're either scared...

932
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:01,151
or you're getting
too goddamn close...

933
01:11:01,228 --> 01:11:04,311
to this surfing guru buddy of yours.

934
01:11:04,388 --> 01:11:06,356
I don't believe you're scared.

935
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:12,266
Hey. I want you to go
home and get some rest.

936
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,054
You look like hammered shit.

937
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:16,633
And if I get anything
that resembles your boy...

938
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,631
I'll beep ya.

939
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,630
Now go home.

940
01:11:20,707 --> 01:11:22,516
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

941
01:11:22,587 --> 01:11:24,556
<i>So what's the other guy look like?</i>

942
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:27,910
Never saw him.

943
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:30,354
It was your basic hit-and-run.

944
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:34,914
You look like you got
in a train wreck.

945
01:11:34,987 --> 01:11:37,751
Stupid jerk just kept driving?

946
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:40,068
Ouch. Baby, I'm sorry.

947
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:46,588
Johnny, what is it with you?

948
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:50,154
You've got that look again.

949
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,793
Like you-

950
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:58,746
You're about to tell me something,
and then... you don't.

951
01:11:58,825 --> 01:12:01,511
Or you can't.

952
01:12:01,586 --> 01:12:03,792
There's something
I've wanted to tell you.

953
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:05,788
It's important.

954
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:08,472
It could really affect things
between you and me.

955
01:12:12,385 --> 01:12:16,231
Man. This is harder than I thought.

956
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:26,308
God. Men are so bad at this.

957
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:31,866
Shh.

958
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:34,231
Some other time.

959
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:50,390
- <i>You act like nothin' happened.</i>
- Relax, Nathanial.

960
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:53,831
Don't tell me to relax, Bodhi.
He's a fuckin' federal agent.

961
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,031
I should have shot him
when I had the chance.

962
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:58,272
I'll deal with that fuckin' cop.

963
01:12:58,344 --> 01:13:01,745
No, Rosie.

964
01:13:01,823 --> 01:13:04,190
Do you realize that we have hit
30 banks in three years...

965
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,664
and they haven't been
able to touch us?

966
01:13:06,743 --> 01:13:09,223
All this does is up
the stakes of the game.

967
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:11,271
Fuck the stakes, Bodhi.

968
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:14,586
I mean, the only person this is
a game to is you, man. This is real.

969
01:13:14,703 --> 01:13:17,148
<i>I mean, this is serious shit...</i>

970
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:19,146
and I am scared, okay?

971
01:13:19,223 --> 01:13:22,704
So I say we get the fuck out of here,
now, tonight. Okay?

972
01:13:22,782 --> 01:13:26,184
- <i>Run, you</i> die.
<i>- Come on. Think about it.</i>

973
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:30,825
This was never about money for us.

974
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:32,904
It was about us
against the system-

975
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:36,225
That system that kills
the human spirit.

976
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:38,224
<i>We stand for something.</i>

977
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:42,068
To those dead souls inching along
the freeways in their metal coffins...

978
01:13:42,142 --> 01:13:45,862
we show them
that the human spirit is still alive.

979
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,583
So you trust me?

980
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,226
Okay.

981
01:14:01,301 --> 01:14:04,782
Then don't worry about this guy.
I know exactly what to do with him.

982
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:25,626
<i>A liar! You lied to me.</i>

983
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,225
Tyler, put the gun down.

984
01:14:28,299 --> 01:14:31,031
I'll bet you lied about everything.

985
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:34,787
I'll bet you lied
about your parents.

986
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:39,304
You just tell me the truth, Johnny.

987
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:43,779
Did your parents die
in a car accident?

988
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:46,260
Did they?

989
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,701
They live in Columbus, Ohio.
I work Bank Robbery.

990
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,702
The guys I'm after are surfers.

991
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:56,668
<i>- I needed you at first, but after that I-
- Fuck you'.!</i>

992
01:14:56,738 --> 01:14:59,310
Don't you have a soul?

993
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,269
<i>Goddamn you</i> to hell.

994
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,420
Tyler.

995
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:08,899
Tyler, wait!

996
01:15:09,018 --> 01:15:10,985
Tyler!

997
01:15:12,457 --> 01:15:14,460
<i>Leave a message.</i>

998
01:15:14,538 --> 01:15:17,381
<i>Tyler, look, I fucked up, okay?</i>

999
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:19,619
I know I fucked up.

1000
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:22,058
I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

1001
01:15:22,137 --> 01:15:24,185
I was afraid you'd leave.

1002
01:15:24,257 --> 01:15:26,180
Good guess, huh?

1003
01:15:26,257 --> 01:15:29,022
Fuck! Why can't I ever say
what I really mean?

1004
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:34,179
<i>I lied to you. I'm an asshole.</i>

1005
01:15:34,257 --> 01:15:36,180
<i>But I need you, Tyler.</i>

1006
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:39,823
<i>I want you to know that I've never known
anyone like you before in my life...</i>

1007
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:42,821
<i>and I hope you change your mind.</i>

1008
01:15:45,256 --> 01:15:47,827
<i>Tyler,</i> wait. <i>I'm coming.</i>

1009
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:53,101
Howdy, brah.

1010
01:15:53,176 --> 01:15:55,143
So come on. We're rollin'.

1011
01:15:55,215 --> 01:15:57,662
What's goin' on, Bodhi?

1012
01:15:57,736 --> 01:15:59,738
Whoa, what happened?
You cut yourself shaving?

1013
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:02,341
I don't think I wanna
surf right now.

1014
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:05,022
Surf? No, this is different, Johnny.

1015
01:16:05,096 --> 01:16:07,701
This is really different.
You are gonna love it.

1016
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:10,017
So we gotta get your stuff
and get out of here.

1017
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:14,256
Okay, uh-Socks.

1018
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:18,703
Shirt.

1019
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:21,823
There you go, man.
Uh-Boots. Here we go.

1020
01:16:23,734 --> 01:16:25,737
<i>Okay. Get your stuff on the truck.</i>

1021
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,896
We gotta go. Life is short.

1022
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:31,023
You are gonna love this.

1023
01:16:46,854 --> 01:16:48,822
- Whoo!
- Yo.

1024
01:16:48,894 --> 01:16:51,373
- All right. Here.
- All right.

1025
01:16:51,493 --> 01:16:54,623
Take this bag, Grommet.
Come on.

1026
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:56,616
<i>Nathanial, wait a minute.</i>

1027
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:59,344
- <i>Take this too.</i>
- Thank <i>you, sir.</i>

1028
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,939
Here you go.
Ever done this before?

1029
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:04,254
No, but I've seen it on TV.

1030
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,255
It's 100% pure adrenaline.

1031
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:10,497
Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it-
All you gotta do is jump.

1032
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:14,099
I'm sure it's a blast, but I sort of
screwed my knee up yesterday.

1033
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:16,574
Oh, yeah, yeah. I noticed you limping,
but hey, don't worry about it.

1034
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:19,053
Don't worry at all,
because we're not gonna land on land.

1035
01:17:19,132 --> 01:17:22,534
Oh, well, fine then.
I feel so much better.

1036
01:17:22,612 --> 01:17:24,774
Okay, let's ﬂy.

1037
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,893
<i>- Three minutes.
- This is a little ceremony...</i>

1038
01:17:37,972 --> 01:17:40,781
<i>we always do
at the end of the summer.</i>

1039
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:43,458
- One last speed star.
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1040
01:17:43,532 --> 01:17:46,262
By the way, you might want to pull
that little orange thing sometime.

1041
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:48,811
<i>The life you save may be your own.</i>

1042
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:51,735
So, uh...

1043
01:17:51,811 --> 01:17:53,779
who packed my chute?

1044
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:56,012
I did. Why? You don't trust me?

1045
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,412
You gotta earn trust.

1046
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:00,619
Okay, we'll earn it together.
Here.

1047
01:18:00,691 --> 01:18:02,613
Take mine.

1048
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:06,812
Hey, Johnny, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

1049
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,019
Bodhi's pack jobs are pretty shitty.
They only open about half the time.

1050
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,899
- Less.
- Bullshit.

1051
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:15,292
Why don't you take young
Grommet's here? How'd that be?

1052
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:19,853
Nah, you don't want this one.
This one's set for a neck-breaker.

1053
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:24,014
You're probably better off
with something like this.

1054
01:18:24,089 --> 01:18:26,775
We gonna jump or jerk off?

1055
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,090
That's my man.

1056
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:31,576
- Here we go!
- Yeah, let's do it.

1057
01:18:34,569 --> 01:18:36,856
Johnny, you're about to jump
out of a perfectly good airplane.

1058
01:18:36,969 --> 01:18:39,335
How do you feel about that?

1059
01:18:43,049 --> 01:18:46,018
Geronimo!

1060
01:19:02,808 --> 01:19:05,891
Shit! Whoa, shit!

1061
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:15,218
Whoa, ho, ho!

1062
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:28,490
Sex with the gods!

1063
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:33,289
You can't beat this! Whoo-hoo!

1064
01:19:33,367 --> 01:19:38,214
Whoo!
This is fucking beautiful.

1065
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:49,568
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1066
01:20:12,165 --> 01:20:17,046
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1067
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,092
Hah!

1068
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:27,928
Come on, Johnny. Whoo!

1069
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,807
That's it, Johnny. Go for it.

1070
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:56,649
Come on, Johnny!

1071
01:20:57,883 --> 01:21:01,683
<i>You can do it! Come on!</i>

1072
01:21:03,563 --> 01:21:06,214
Use your arms.
Fly like an eagle, baby.

1073
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:08,330
<i>Whoo!</i>

1074
01:21:10,883 --> 01:21:13,124
Keep comin'!

1075
01:21:15,562 --> 01:21:17,531
All right! Johnny, you did it.

1076
01:21:17,603 --> 01:21:22,324
<i>You're a speed star!
We're goin' like a bat out of hell.</i>

1077
01:21:24,482 --> 01:21:27,406
Righteous speed star.

1078
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,690
- How do you like it, Johnny?
- Amazing!

1079
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:33,408
<i>Fucking amazing!</i>

1080
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:43,923
This is so beautiful.

1081
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:47,847
I love this ground rush shit.

1082
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:52,125
<i>Okay, break.</i>

1083
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,769
Great, isn't it?

1084
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:04,525
You're doin' good.

1085
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,364
A thousand feet-Pull.

1086
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,886
After you, Alphonse. I insist.

1087
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:30,840
- Pull the rip cord now.
- You first.

1088
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:33,206
- Okay.
- Son of a bitch.

1089
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:23,608
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:23:23,677 --> 01:23:25,599
I gotta be losing it.

1091
01:23:32,356 --> 01:23:35,281
That's the closest you'll ever get to God.

1092
01:23:35,357 --> 01:23:38,246
it's like the palm of your hand, man-

1093
01:23:38,316 --> 01:23:40,239
Zoom! Comin' right at you.

1094
01:23:40,317 --> 01:23:42,239
- It's ineffable.
- Totally indescribable.

1095
01:23:42,316 --> 01:23:46,116
- Significant experience to share, I'll tell you that.
- We did pull pretty low.

1096
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:48,802
- I tell you Johnny'd be just fine?
- Yeah! Damn first.

1097
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,959
Johnny, just drop
your chute right there.

1098
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:55,165
Good job.
Pack off your shoulders.

1099
01:23:55,236 --> 01:23:57,762
Kick it back, step out of it.

1100
01:23:57,836 --> 01:23:59,837
- I'll pack that for you, Bodhi.
- Okay, thanks.

1101
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:02,965
Johnny, come here.
There's something you need to see.

1102
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,798
Hop in.

1103
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,879
Okay. If I can-

1104
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:21,315
- What's this?
- This is an insurance policy.

1105
01:24:21,394 --> 01:24:25,161
It will sting a bit, but, uh,
it's for your own growth, brah.

1106
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:27,157
Press play.

1107
01:24:37,554 --> 01:24:39,522
<i>Fuck you'!</i>

1108
01:24:56,393 --> 01:24:58,999
<i>Fuck you'!</i>

1109
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:13,154
She is a wild one, isn't she,
Special Agent Utah?

1110
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,843
Fuckin' dead man!

1111
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:19,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, man.
Think. Think it through, man.

1112
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:21,994
I'm the only one
that knows where she is.

1113
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:24,643
I'm the only one, so let me talk.

1114
01:25:24,712 --> 01:25:27,317
Let me talk.

1115
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:31,158
- Talk.
- She'll be fine.

1116
01:25:31,232 --> 01:25:34,714
Rosie won't do anything as long as
I meet him at a certain place and time-

1117
01:25:34,792 --> 01:25:37,556
- Six hours from now.
- You call him right now...

1118
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:39,918
and tell him to let her go!

1119
01:25:39,991 --> 01:25:42,074
Sorry. I can't do it, brah.

1120
01:25:42,152 --> 01:25:45,234
They're on the road, and where
they're goin', there are no phones...

1121
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,393
so you are shit out of luck.

1122
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,479
Oh, man.

1123
01:25:58,551 --> 01:26:00,518
I hate this, Johnny.

1124
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:03,754
I really do. I hate violence.

1125
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:05,753
Don't you see
that's why I need Rosie?

1126
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:08,436
I could never do that, man. I could
never hold a knife to Tyler's throat.

1127
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,957
She was my woman.
We shared time.

1128
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:16,279
But Rosie is a...
mechanism, you know?

1129
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:19,718
Once you set him in motion,
he will not stop.

1130
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:23,430
He's, like, got this gift
of blankness.

1131
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,593
But when 3:00 comes...

1132
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:30,111
he will gut her like a pig
and try not to get any on his shoes...

1133
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:32,840
<i>and there is nothing
I can do about it unless I get there.</i>

1134
01:26:32,909 --> 01:26:35,594
So I guess that makes us partners...

1135
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:37,592
because we both have
the same goal:

1136
01:26:37,668 --> 01:26:39,637
to get me where I need to go, right?

1137
01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:44,197
We're wastin' time.

1138
01:26:47,629 --> 01:26:49,630
Oh, that's what I love
about you, Johnny.

1139
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,996
You are just as sharp as a razor.

1140
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:57,115
Murphy, take the plane down to
Santa Monica. Top off the tanks.

1141
01:26:57,188 --> 01:26:59,997
- All right.
- Okay, you guys, party time. Let's move it.

1142
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:02,150
All right, we're on it.

1143
01:27:13,947 --> 01:27:18,669
<i>All I'm asking for is 90 seconds
of your life, Johnny. That's it.</i>

1144
01:27:21,507 --> 01:27:25,671
See, it's basic dog psychology.

1145
01:27:25,747 --> 01:27:27,794
<i>If you scare them and get them
peeing down their leg...</i>

1146
01:27:27,866 --> 01:27:30,313
they submit.

1147
01:27:30,387 --> 01:27:32,435
<i>If you project weakness,
you draw aggression.</i>

1148
01:27:32,507 --> 01:27:35,237
That's how people get hurt.

1149
01:27:35,306 --> 01:27:38,867
<i>You see, fear causes hesitation...</i>

1150
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:43,515
and hesitation will cause
your worst fears to come true.

1151
01:27:43,587 --> 01:27:45,315
<i>So it's simple.</i>

1152
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:48,356
You project strength
to avoid conﬂict.

1153
01:27:48,426 --> 01:27:50,997
<i>Peace through superior firepower.</i>

1154
01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,706
Oh.

1155
01:27:59,186 --> 01:28:00,914
<i>There you go.</i>

1156
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,386
<i>Can't have you walking through those
doors with your dick in your hand.</i>

1157
01:28:06,425 --> 01:28:09,156
- I can't do this.
- Sure, you can.

1158
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:12,633
Who knows? You might like it.
It's a killer rush.

1159
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:15,390
Bodhi, this is your
fuckin' wake-up call, man.

1160
01:28:15,465 --> 01:28:18,593
I am an F.B.I. agent.

1161
01:28:18,664 --> 01:28:20,747
I know, man. Isn't it wild?

1162
01:28:20,825 --> 01:28:22,952
But, you know, that's what
makes it great, Johnny.

1163
01:28:23,024 --> 01:28:26,073
<i>We can exist on a different plane.
We can make our own rules.</i>

1164
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:29,193
Why be a servant to the law
when you can be its master?

1165
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:32,666
- Fuckin'-A.
- I love this fuckin' job.

1166
01:28:32,744 --> 01:28:37,033
Okay, 90 seconds, door to door.

1167
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,424
It's a small price to pay
for someone who loves you.

1168
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:42,150
<i>She does, you know.</i>

1169
01:28:42,224 --> 01:28:44,988
It's not her style to fall so hard.

1170
01:28:45,063 --> 01:28:47,031
I don't think she did with me.

1171
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:54,551
Okay. Mr. Carter.

1172
01:28:54,623 --> 01:28:56,864
<i>LBJ-</i>

1173
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:00,589
Mr. Nixon.

1174
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:11,628
Well, sorry, Johnny.

1175
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:14,143
Looks like you don't get
to be president.

1176
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:19,743
I'm ready.

1177
01:29:32,422 --> 01:29:36,506
<i>Rock and</i> roll.

1178
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:43,148
Everybody freeze!

1179
01:29:43,221 --> 01:29:45,144
Okay! On the ﬂoor! Now!

1180
01:29:45,221 --> 01:29:47,428
Get on the ﬂoor! Right now! Hold it.
Where you going?

1181
01:29:49,821 --> 01:29:52,028
Everybody down! Get down!

1182
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:57,188
<i>on the ﬂoor, asshole.</i>

1183
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:01,185
What's your problem? I blow out your
fuckin' kneecaps, you'll be on the ﬂoor.

1184
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,342
Kick in the ass, ain't it, man?

1185
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:06,981
Hey, look. We're on TV. Smile.

1186
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,142
Gonna be a little hard to play
F.B.I. now though, huh?

1187
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,826
Can we just get the goddamn money
and get out of here?

1188
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,380
Nobody move!

1189
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,462
Heads down, eyes down.

1190
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,861
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

1191
01:30:19,939 --> 01:30:21,863
<i>We are the Ex-Presidents.</i>

1192
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:25,182
<i>And as you can see, we are, in fact,
robbing your bank.</i>

1193
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:28,503
So with a little cooperation,
I won't have to blow your heads off.

1194
01:30:28,579 --> 01:30:31,867
<i>So I need just a couple of minutes
of your lives, and we're gone.</i>

1195
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:35,710
Dick. Dick, go to the vault.

1196
01:30:37,339 --> 01:30:39,467
Uh, you, Miss Jennings.

1197
01:30:39,538 --> 01:30:43,339
Would you be a dear and open the gate
for my associate now?

1198
01:30:43,419 --> 01:30:44,518
Mr. Duggan's got the keys.

1199
01:30:44,544 --> 01:30:47,164
Why are we going to the vault?
We never go to the vault.

1200
01:30:47,218 --> 01:30:49,460
Just do it!
Lyndon, go with him.

1201
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:52,018
<i>We're hittin' the vault, man.
Go! Go!</i>

1202
01:30:52,098 --> 01:30:54,066
Who's Mr. fuckin' Duggan?

1203
01:30:54,138 --> 01:30:58,029
<i>Mr. Duggan, do you want to open the vault,
or do you want me to do it?</i>

1204
01:30:58,098 --> 01:31:00,749
Do whatever they want, Terry.

1205
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:03,503
Take the fuckin' keys!
Take 'em!

1206
01:31:05,578 --> 01:31:08,228
Move it!

1207
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:10,949
Open the damn door!

1208
01:31:11,018 --> 01:31:14,066
I'll fuckin' blow your
fuckin' head off. Move it!

1209
01:31:18,977 --> 01:31:20,900
Come on! Now!

1210
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:23,344
- Get out of the way.
- Okay. All right.

1211
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:25,340
Go for the back-The big bills.

1212
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:27,340
Fuck it. We're goin'
in the fuckin' vault.

1213
01:31:27,457 --> 01:31:29,936
This is a bad idea.

1214
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:34,817
Put your head on the ground.
Don't look at me.

1215
01:31:34,896 --> 01:31:37,585
You're blowin' it, man. You're
breakin' your own rules.

1216
01:31:37,611 --> 01:31:39,051
You're pulling too much time.

1217
01:31:39,096 --> 01:31:41,497
- Jimmy, how we doin'?
- Sixty-five.

1218
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:42,306
<i>What's happening?</i>

1219
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:44,445
Don't worry, man. It's fine.
It's fine. It's great.

1220
01:31:45,496 --> 01:31:47,578
Fuck! Fuck!

1221
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:53,497
Hey. I'm a cop.

1222
01:31:53,576 --> 01:31:55,544
SQ?

1223
01:31:57,455 --> 01:31:59,423
- <i>Oh, fuck.
- I'm</i> a <i>cop.</i>

1224
01:31:59,495 --> 01:32:01,578
Oh, no. Don't.

1225
01:32:01,696 --> 01:32:05,097
- You got a gun on your ankle?
- Yeah.

1226
01:32:05,175 --> 01:32:07,654
When I make a move, you back me up.

1227
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:09,624
Please don't. Don't.
You don't have to.

1228
01:32:09,695 --> 01:32:12,380
- You back me up.
- <i>Don't do it.</i>

1229
01:32:12,455 --> 01:32:15,379
<i>Don't do anything.
Don't. Don't.</i>

1230
01:32:15,455 --> 01:32:17,742
<i>Please put it away.</i>

1231
01:32:17,815 --> 01:32:20,465
<i>Please put it away.
Put it away.</i>

1232
01:32:24,494 --> 01:32:28,055
<i>Come on, hurry up!
Let's go! We gotta go! Let's go!</i>

1233
01:32:28,134 --> 01:32:30,102
Fuckin' move.

1234
01:32:32,334 --> 01:32:35,655
Federal agent. Undercover.

1235
01:33:27,252 --> 01:33:29,858
Nobody fuckin' move!

1236
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:36,814
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on, little brother.

1237
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:39,292
Come on. We're out of here.
We are out of here.

1238
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:41,772
<i>Hang on.
I'll get you out of here.</i>

1239
01:33:41,851 --> 01:33:43,933
Hang on, little brother. Just hang on, man.

1240
01:33:46,051 --> 01:33:49,214
No, man. No.

1241
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:10,615
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

1242
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:12,658
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

1243
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,539
<i>You got what you want? Did you get
what you wanted? Come on!</i>

1244
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:17,897
You can't take him with.
Let's go.

1245
01:34:40,169 --> 01:34:42,648
Oh, goddamn it.
Who's in charge of this camera crew?

1246
01:34:42,768 --> 01:34:44,213
This is a crime scene area,
for Christ's sake.

1247
01:34:44,288 --> 01:34:46,337
- Get 'em the fuck out of here.
- Come on, out.

1248
01:34:46,409 --> 01:34:48,172
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

1249
01:34:48,248 --> 01:34:51,013
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1250
01:34:51,088 --> 01:34:55,776
If you so desire, an attorney
will be provided for you free of cost.

1251
01:34:55,848 --> 01:34:58,930
Now, do you understand these rights
I’ve just given to you, Utah?

1252
01:34:59,007 --> 01:35:02,535
Do you understand? You understand
the rights I’ve just read you, Utah?

1253
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:04,689
Hey! He understands
his goddamn rights.

1254
01:35:04,767 --> 01:35:06,736
Jesus Christ, kid.
Are you okay? Here, stand up.

1255
01:35:06,808 --> 01:35:08,333
- Get these cuffs off him.
- <i>Leave the cuff's on.</i>

1256
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:09,852
- <i>Get 'em off</i>
- Leave 'em on!

1257
01:35:09,927 --> 01:35:10,368
Oh, boy.

1258
01:35:10,394 --> 01:35:12,159
Your partner's an accessory
to murder, Pappas.

1259
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:15,336
Utah, there are three dead people.
One of 'em's a police officer.

1260
01:35:15,407 --> 01:35:18,775
Let me show you something, pal.
How does that sit in your stomach, huh?

1261
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:21,771
Take your hands off me right now.

1262
01:35:21,887 --> 01:35:23,810
Harp. Harp.

1263
01:35:23,887 --> 01:35:25,888
Listen. Look at me. Look at me.

1264
01:35:25,966 --> 01:35:28,254
Don't send him in with
the black-and-whites like some punk.

1265
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:30,250
Let me ride him in.

1266
01:35:30,327 --> 01:35:32,249
Yeah, sure, Angelo. Why not?

1267
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:34,249
That's why I put you two screwups
together to begin with.

1268
01:35:34,326 --> 01:35:36,250
You deserve each other, don't you?

1269
01:35:36,327 --> 01:35:38,249
You’re just as bad as he is,
only you're a little fatter...

1270
01:35:38,326 --> 01:35:40,249
a little slower
and a little more pathetic.

1271
01:35:40,326 --> 01:35:42,249
Christ's sake. It's like the blind
leading the blind with you.

1272
01:35:42,366 --> 01:35:45,131
Harp, I wanna tell you something.

1273
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:49,495
I was in this bureau when you were
still poppin' zits on your funny face...

1274
01:35:49,566 --> 01:35:52,809
and jackin' off to the lingerie section
of the Sears catalog.

1275
01:35:52,886 --> 01:35:53,847
Is that right, Pappas?

1276
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:56,278
Yes, that's right, Harp,
and there's one thing...

1277
01:35:56,325 --> 01:35:59,374
that I learned out of all these years
that you still haven't got.

1278
01:35:59,445 --> 01:36:01,527
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
astonish me, shit-face?

1279
01:36:06,445 --> 01:36:08,368
Respect for my elders.

1280
01:36:08,445 --> 01:36:11,528
- Plain and simple. Come on, kid, let's go.
- Holy <i>shit.</i>

1281
01:36:11,645 --> 01:36:14,615
- Let's get out of here.
- Up, please.

1282
01:36:21,244 --> 01:36:23,850
I know where they're going.

1283
01:36:23,924 --> 01:36:26,575
I figured you did.

1284
01:36:27,644 --> 01:36:29,806
Santa Monica Airport, fast.

1285
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:32,045
- But we got one minor problem.
- What?

1286
01:36:32,163 --> 01:36:34,212
We can't arrest them.

1287
01:36:34,284 --> 01:36:36,968
- Or shoot them.
- What?

1288
01:36:56,283 --> 01:36:58,365
- Did you set the altimeter?
- One thousand.

1289
01:36:58,443 --> 01:37:01,049
- What?
- One thousand.

1290
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,688
Check the rigging, okay?

1291
01:37:13,442 --> 01:37:15,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1292
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:19,765
Fuckin' F.B.I.

1293
01:37:19,842 --> 01:37:21,889
I'm not armed.

1294
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:30,288
- But you're not alone.
- Good guess.

1295
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:35,882
<i>There's a gun on you right now.</i>

1296
01:37:39,841 --> 01:37:42,367
Where's Roach?

1297
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,768
He's around somewhere.

1298
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:48,758
<i>So listen, Johnny, we
are in kind of a hurry.</i>

1299
01:37:48,784 --> 01:37:49,752
<i>What do you need?</i>

1300
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,247
<i>You gotta tell me where she is.</i>

1301
01:37:52,321 --> 01:37:55,210
Oh, and let my policy expire.
Good idea.

1302
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,931
Look, Bodhi, man, people are dead.
The ride is over.

1303
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,162
Oh, no, no.
I say when it's over.

1304
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,561
The guy you killed
was an off-duty cop.

1305
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,688
They'll nail you wherever you land.

1306
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,683
There's a new thing called radar.

1307
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,688
- Maybe you've heard of it.
- What is your-

1308
01:38:11,799 --> 01:38:13,768
Nathanial, get in there.

1309
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,281
Get back in the cockpit. Move!

1310
01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:27,930
I know you, man. When they fall on you,
you won't back down.

1311
01:38:27,999 --> 01:38:30,001
They'll have to burn your ass
to the ground.

1312
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:32,161
Uh-huh. And shit happens.

1313
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:34,202
Look, you've got a death wish.

1314
01:38:34,279 --> 01:38:37,362
You wanna ride to glory, fine.
But don't take Tyler with you.

1315
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:39,679
I'm begging you.

1316
01:38:39,758 --> 01:38:42,603
Tell me where she is,
and I walk away.

1317
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:45,921
- You walk away?
- I walk away.

1318
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:48,320
That is beautiful, Johnny.

1319
01:39:04,478 --> 01:39:06,798
Angelo! Don't fire!

1320
01:39:06,877 --> 01:39:09,039
They'll kill her! No!

1321
01:39:09,117 --> 01:39:11,723
Get out of the way, kid.
Goddamn it!

1322
01:39:13,877 --> 01:39:16,039
<i>Damn.</i>

1323
01:39:21,197 --> 01:39:24,041
No!

1324
01:39:27,197 --> 01:39:29,881
Oh, Jesus.

1325
01:39:29,956 --> 01:39:32,324
Jesus Christ.

1326
01:39:40,356 --> 01:39:45,043
Angelo.

1327
01:40:00,475 --> 01:40:02,557
- Fuck.
- They're comin', man.

1328
01:40:02,635 --> 01:40:04,558
- Just hang on, man.
- I'm really fucked up.

1329
01:40:04,635 --> 01:40:06,763
Just hang on.
<i>It'll</i> be all right.

1330
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:08,758
Jesus Christ.

1331
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:13,958
Come on.

1332
01:40:14,035 --> 01:40:17,004
I'm not ﬂyin' you guys
to San Felipe, man.

1333
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:19,202
Get in the fuckin' plane.
Start those engines.

1334
01:40:19,274 --> 01:40:22,517
Oh, good. Tell him where we're going.

1335
01:40:24,634 --> 01:40:26,921
Let's go, man.

1336
01:40:26,994 --> 01:40:30,840
We are gonna ride this all the way,
Johnny, you and me, so let's go.

1337
01:40:32,834 --> 01:40:34,961
Get the fuck up!
Tyler's waiting.

1338
01:40:35,033 --> 01:40:36,957
Go, go, go!

1339
01:40:38,754 --> 01:40:40,721
Start the engines now.

1340
01:40:42,514 --> 01:40:44,515
Go!

1341
01:40:54,353 --> 01:40:57,482
Go! Go, go, go, go!

1342
01:41:27,232 --> 01:41:29,632
Rosie. Yo, Rosie.
This is Air Force One.

1343
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:31,713
Do you read me?
Do you read me? Over.

1344
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:34,476
Look, man, we've been over Mexico
for the last half hour.

1345
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:36,838
<i>Can I quit mowin' the lawn here?</i>

1346
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:39,198
<i>Gettin' more bushes
in the wheels than I usually like.</i>

1347
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:42,878
Shut your mouth, and take it
to 4,000 feet on this heading, all right?

1348
01:41:42,951 --> 01:41:43,552
All right.

1349
01:41:43,578 --> 01:41:45,979
I don't think that's
such a good idea, man.

1350
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:49,722
We'll-We'll pop up on their screens.

1351
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,758
Doesn't matter.
We're almost there.

1352
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:54,311
Just gotta get you
to a safe jump altitude.

1353
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:57,195
Okay, let's get your rig on.

1354
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:03,190
Hey, man, I'm cold. I'm really cold.

1355
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:05,272
I got your jacket.
Here's your jacket.

1356
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:07,351
Easy.

1357
01:42:07,429 --> 01:42:09,432
Oh, fuck!

1358
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,512
<i>I know, I know, I know. Easy.</i>

1359
01:42:12,589 --> 01:42:14,717
<i>Easy. One arm at a time.</i>

1360
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:19,351
No, man. No, no, no, no.

1361
01:42:21,829 --> 01:42:24,070
Johnny.

1362
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:25,913
Throw me that money bag.

1363
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:27,957
<i>Now!</i>

1364
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:35,952
You're cold because all the blood
is running out of your body, Roach.

1365
01:42:36,028 --> 01:42:37,997
You're going to be dead soon.

1366
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:39,991
I hope it was worth it.

1367
01:42:40,068 --> 01:42:43,311
Don't listen to him.
He’s just scared.

1368
01:42:43,388 --> 01:42:47,359
You just keep thinkin' about all
those senoritas and margaritas, gonna be...

1369
01:42:47,428 --> 01:42:49,192
<i>nursing you back to health.</i>

1370
01:42:49,268 --> 01:42:51,839
- Okay?
- What the fuck are you lookin' at?

1371
01:42:53,428 --> 01:42:56,954
<i>Man. Fuck.</i>

1372
01:42:57,027 --> 01:42:59,235
Okay, there you go.

1373
01:42:59,308 --> 01:43:01,390
Okay.

1374
01:43:11,827 --> 01:43:14,353
Rosie? Rosie, this is Air Force One.

1375
01:43:14,467 --> 01:43:16,469
Do you copy? Do you copy? Over.

1376
01:43:16,547 --> 01:43:18,674
Copy. We have a visual on you.

1377
01:43:18,746 --> 01:43:20,715
Tell him to release Tyler.

1378
01:43:24,386 --> 01:43:26,309
Do it! Do it now!

1379
01:43:26,386 --> 01:43:28,674
You won.
You got what you wanted.

1380
01:43:28,747 --> 01:43:31,955
What if your chute fails?
Cancel the order.

1381
01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:36,794
She served her purpose. Do it, man.
You owe me that much.

1382
01:43:44,826 --> 01:43:46,315
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

1383
01:43:46,385 --> 01:43:49,117
On three. One, two, three.

1384
01:43:49,186 --> 01:43:51,870
Whoa, easy, easy. Little more. Little more.

1385
01:43:51,945 --> 01:43:55,428
<i>Keep your chute clear. Okay?</i>

1386
01:43:55,546 --> 01:43:57,627
Easy. Easy.

1387
01:43:59,705 --> 01:44:02,389
Okay. See you on the ground,
all right?

1388
01:44:02,464 --> 01:44:05,912
All right. I'll see you
in hell, Johnny.

1389
01:44:08,304 --> 01:44:11,036
Whoa!

1390
01:44:11,145 --> 01:44:14,068
<i>I know it's hard for you, Johnny.</i>

1391
01:44:14,144 --> 01:44:16,624
I know you want me so bad
it's like acid in your mouth.

1392
01:44:16,704 --> 01:44:19,025
But not this time.

1393
01:44:24,344 --> 01:44:26,472
Adios, amigo.

1394
01:44:39,824 --> 01:44:42,508
Fuck it!

1395
01:45:31,861 --> 01:45:34,751
- What-
- Pull the chute, Bodhi.

1396
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:37,791
- You are crazy.
- Pull the fuckin' chute.

1397
01:45:37,861 --> 01:45:40,546
- <i>Why don't you pull it?</i>
- No games, Bodhi.

1398
01:45:40,621 --> 01:45:44,148
- Pull the cord now.
- Nah, you pull it.

1399
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:47,986
Go ahead, Johnny. Pull it.
You gotta drop the gun, right?

1400
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:50,632
If you use your other hand,
what are you gonna hold on with?

1401
01:45:50,741 --> 01:45:52,629
Pull it right now...

1402
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,742
or I blow your fuckin' head off
and pull it myself.

1403
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:57,267
That's the only way it's gonna happen,
my friend. Do it!

1404
01:45:57,341 --> 01:45:59,581
- I swear to God I will.
- Do it, man.

1405
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:02,470
Do it or you’re gonna die, Johnny.

1406
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:05,384
<i>Six seconds.
We're gonna be meat wafﬂes.</i>

1407
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,509
- Five, four-
- You fucking crazy?

1408
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:12,141
- Three, two-
- Pull it! Pull it!

1409
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,421
- <i>One!</i>
- Shit! Shit!

1410
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:30,467
Shit!

1411
01:47:00,537 --> 01:47:03,064
Jesus Christ, Bodhi.

1412
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,541
Goddamn, you are
one radical son of a bitch.

1413
01:47:30,137 --> 01:47:32,025
I'm out of here, Johnny.

1414
01:47:41,376 --> 01:47:43,742
That knee again, huh?

1415
01:47:43,815 --> 01:47:47,025
Too bad. Looks like this time
you won't be gettin' your man.

1416
01:47:49,895 --> 01:47:52,467
This game we both lose.

1417
01:48:08,695 --> 01:48:10,662
Let her go.

1418
01:48:13,775 --> 01:48:15,344
Let her go!

1419
01:48:40,253 --> 01:48:42,222
- Johnny, I-
- Shh.

1420
01:48:43,773 --> 01:48:45,901
Some other time.

1421
01:48:47,533 --> 01:48:49,456
Oh.

1422
01:48:54,452 --> 01:48:56,694
Come on. We're out of here.

1423
01:49:01,612 --> 01:49:03,581
Yo, Johnny!

1424
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:08,215
<i>I'll</i> see you in the next life.

1425
01:49:32,172 --> 01:49:34,412
We can't leave him here.
We gotta bury him.

1426
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:36,493
There's no time, man.

1427
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:02,332
<i>The cyclone warning is now current...</i>

1428
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:05,419
<i>for coastal areas
between Torquay and Cape Otway.</i>

1429
01:50:05,489 --> 01:50:07,548
<i>Experts are saying this
is potentially one</i>

1430
01:50:07,574 --> 01:50:09,679
<i>of the worst storms in
Australia's history.</i>

1431
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:13,529
<i>Heavy rains will continue into the night,
with destructive winds...</i>

1432
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:15,772
<i>reaching up to 150 kilometers per hour.</i>

1433
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,817
<i>The center of the cyclone
is now expected...</i>

1434
01:50:17,889 --> 01:50:21,735
<i>to cross the coast between Bells Beach
and Fairhaven early tomorrow morning.</i>

1435
01:50:21,809 --> 01:50:24,619
<i>Residents are advised
to prepare for evacuation.</i>

1436
01:50:45,568 --> 01:50:47,491
<i>What do you wanna do now?</i>

1437
01:50:47,608 --> 01:50:49,689
<i>Get home and get out of this mess.</i>

1438
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:51,691
I'm freezing.

1439
01:50:57,408 --> 01:51:00,059
- Sorry, mate.
- Anybody been out there?

1440
01:51:00,128 --> 01:51:02,334
No one's been out.
No one's goin' out.

1441
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:04,456
You gotta be fuckin' crazy, man.

1442
01:51:04,528 --> 01:51:07,178
Death on a stick out there, mate.

1443
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,935
Lose something, brah?

1444
01:51:58,285 --> 01:52:00,333
Special Agent Utah.

1445
01:52:00,405 --> 01:52:03,409
I knew I could count on you.

1446
01:52:03,485 --> 01:52:05,931
I've been to every city in Mexico.

1447
01:52:06,005 --> 01:52:10,090
Came across an unclaimed
piece of meat in Baja.

1448
01:52:10,165 --> 01:52:12,485
Turned out to be Rosie.

1449
01:52:12,604 --> 01:52:14,686
Guess he picked a knife fight
with somebody better.

1450
01:52:14,764 --> 01:52:17,927
Found a passport of yours
in Sumatra.

1451
01:52:18,004 --> 01:52:20,575
Missed you by about a week in Fiji.

1452
01:52:22,364 --> 01:52:24,970
But I knew you wouldn't miss
the 50-year storm, Bodhi.

1453
01:52:25,044 --> 01:52:26,967
Yeah.

1454
01:52:32,844 --> 01:52:38,135
Too bad. You finally get your waves
and it's totally closed out.

1455
01:52:38,204 --> 01:52:40,171
Just waitin' for my set.

1456
01:52:43,043 --> 01:52:45,091
You gotta go down.

1457
01:52:45,163 --> 01:52:49,293
You crossed the line,
and people trusted you, and they died.

1458
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:52,253
Yeah, it went bad.
Went real bad.

1459
01:52:54,283 --> 01:52:57,092
Life sure has a sick sense of humor,
doesn't it?

1460
01:52:58,883 --> 01:53:00,806
Still surfing?

1461
01:53:00,883 --> 01:53:02,805
Every day.

1462
01:53:06,563 --> 01:53:09,805
Come on, Bodhi.
It's time to go.

1463
01:53:09,882 --> 01:53:13,329
You know you gotta go back with me.

1464
01:53:17,002 --> 01:53:19,572
Sorry, my friend.

1465
01:53:23,641 --> 01:53:25,689
Come on.

1466
01:54:41,318 --> 01:54:44,242
No! No!

1467
01:54:45,238 --> 01:54:47,764
I told them...

1468
01:54:47,878 --> 01:54:50,199
you'd go quietly.

1469
01:54:54,838 --> 01:54:57,841
No!

1470
01:54:57,917 --> 01:55:00,603
You know there's no way
I can handle a cage, man.

1471
01:55:00,678 --> 01:55:03,806
I don't care.
You gotta go down.

1472
01:55:03,877 --> 01:55:06,244
It's gotta be that way.

1473
01:55:27,356 --> 01:55:30,087
Okay, man. Okay.

1474
01:55:31,596 --> 01:55:33,598
I'm screwed.

1475
01:55:33,716 --> 01:55:35,717
I'm gonna go to jail and I'll pay...

1476
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:38,197
and Johnny Utah gets his guy.

1477
01:55:38,276 --> 01:55:42,041
Right? Good for you.
That's real good.

1478
01:55:42,115 --> 01:55:44,881
Gonna be a big hero now.

1479
01:55:46,355 --> 01:55:49,040
Look at it, Johnny. Look at it!

1480
01:55:49,115 --> 01:55:52,198
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, man.

1481
01:55:52,315 --> 01:55:55,319
Just let me go out there. Let me get
one wave before you take me.

1482
01:55:55,395 --> 01:55:57,875
One wave.

1483
01:55:57,955 --> 01:55:59,957
I mean, where am I gonna go, man?

1484
01:56:00,035 --> 01:56:04,039
Cliffs on both sides.
I'm not gonna paddle to New Zealand.

1485
01:56:06,915 --> 01:56:10,635
My whole life has been
about this moment, Johnny.

1486
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:12,922
Come on, compadre.

1487
01:56:16,314 --> 01:56:18,316
Come on.

1488
01:56:23,674 --> 01:56:25,596
All of you, this way.

1489
01:56:25,673 --> 01:56:27,802
Come on!

1490
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:03,519
<i>Va ya con Dios.</i>

1491
01:57:16,432 --> 01:57:20,231
What the fuck, Utah!
What do you think you're doing?

1492
01:57:20,311 --> 01:57:22,313
You let him go.

1493
01:57:22,391 --> 01:57:24,360
No, I didn't.

1494
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:37,553
<i>No way.</i>

1495
01:57:37,631 --> 01:57:39,872
<i>Hey, the guy's nuts.</i>

1496
01:57:46,751 --> 01:57:49,071
We'll get him when he comes back in.

1497
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:52,432
He's not coming back.
