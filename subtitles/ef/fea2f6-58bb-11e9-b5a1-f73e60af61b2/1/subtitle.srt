1
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,648
Don't-Don't... Damn.

2
00:00:57,527 --> 00:01:00,239
Destiny's a pretty big concept
when you think about it...

3
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:05,120
where you are in life,
how you got there...

4
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,831
what would have happened if one thing
or another had been different.

5
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:14,965
To be honest, I never gave it
much thought myself...

6
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,136
until today, June 14...

7
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,555
my 35th birthday...

8
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:24,393
and, without a doubt,
the strangest day of my life.

9
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:33,905
You remember
the old story that starts...

10
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:36,283
"This guy goes into a bar"?

11
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,537
Well, I'm the guy...

12
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,707
and here's the story.

13
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,460
But wait a minute.
I'm gettin' way ahead of myself.

14
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,174
To tell this story right...

15
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:53,137
I should start where it really begins...
20 years ago.

16
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,349
Twenty years ago today,
as a matter of fact.

17
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:59,645
June 14, 1970...
my 15th birthday...

18
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,191
and also a very strange day.

19
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,490
It was the all-state
high school championship game...

20
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:11,493
bottom of the ninth, two outs.

21
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:15,456
Our school hadn't made it
to the finals in 25 years...

22
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,627
so out of a town
of 30,000 people...

23
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,880
38,000 showed up
for the game.

24
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:26,553
Fillmore High had us by a run,
and it was a three-two count.

25
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,806
Fenwick was standing on third
like the bag was getting ready...

26
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,101
to explode under his feet.

27
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,188
The championship had
come down to one batter.

28
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:39,402
Yeah, you guessed it-
yours truly, Larry Burrows.

29
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,243
Haskins was throwing fastballs because
that was the only pitch he ever threw.

30
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,998
So I was ready
for the next one.

31
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,460
Paste it, Lar! You can do it.
Have an eye! Have an eye!

32
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:55,630
Swing, babe! It's all yours!

33
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,218
Then something weird happened.

34
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,141
Don't ask me what it was, 'cause it only
happened for a split second...

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,899
but that was enough
to change my life forever.

36
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,909
Strike three!

37
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,788
Why is it when you do
something terrific...

38
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:24,541
nine times out of ten,
you're all alone...

39
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,920
but when you
screw up really big...

40
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,339
the whole world is watching?

41
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:34,303
I wanted to crawl under home plate
and never come out.

42
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:40,603
As usual, my best friend, Clip metzler,
tried to cheer me up.

43
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,355
Clip's very big on novelty gags.

44
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:48,237
Hey, aren't they cool?
I scared the crap out of my baby sister.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,407
- Wanna try 'em on?
- Thanks, Clipper...

46
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,952
but I'd kinda
like to be alone for a while.

47
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,121
Sure, Lar.
Whatever you say.

48
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:03,840
Look, I'll call you later, okay?
We'll go see a movie or something.

49
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,258
<i>We could see
Bonnie and Clyde again.</i>

50
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,970
- What do you say?
- Sure, Clip.

51
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,556
Great! Great!
I'll see you later then, okay?

52
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:18,734
It was the worst moment
of my life.

53
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:22,988
God, I felt bad.

54
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,012
Looks like you could use
one of these.

55
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh, yeah, yeah. I must've gotten
some dust in my eyes.

56
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,894
Yeah. Yeah, there was a lot
of dust out there.

57
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,938
- Thanks.
- Oh, it's okay. You can keep it.

58
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:55,153
my aunt sends me
two dozen every Christmas.

59
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,989
What's "EJR" stand for?

60
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:01,994
Ellen Jane Ripley.
What's your name?

61
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:05,165
Larry. Larry Joseph Burrows.

62
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,375
Nice to meet you, Larry.

63
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,298
I thought that was really sweet,
her giving me the handkerchief...

64
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,094
and not saying anything
about me crying like a big baby.

65
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,471
- Really sweet.
- Larry?

66
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:21,352
- So I married her.
- I've been calling you for the last five minutes.

67
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:26,191
Not right then, of course. Several years
later, when we were grownups.

68
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:30,404
Oh, honey, were you thinking about
that silly baseball game again?

69
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:36,954
No. No. Not at all. I was working
on my, uh, '55 Porsche Spyder.

70
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,709
I was, really.
Look. Ain't it a beaut?

71
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,255
You know James Dean
used to drive one of these?

72
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,549
I mean, his was much bigger.

73
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:49,678
Ellen and I have
a pretty regular life.

74
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,433
We have a little two-bedroom house in
the suburbs that isn't quite finished...

75
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:57,563
and a contractor named Guzelman
who doesn't wanna quite finish it.

76
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:02,193
Hey, mr Guzelman.
How are ya?

77
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:05,072
Geez, I haven't seen you
in the past six weeks.

78
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,701
I thought you were captured
by some aliens or something.

79
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:11,705
I got your message.
Uh, problem with something?

80
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,334
Uh, yeah,
it's the, uh, driveway.

81
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,923
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, you think maybe we could pave it?

82
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,095
Oh, you can't, uh, pave
until the mud is all gone.

83
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,143
Well, then we just have to get
rid of the mud then, right?

84
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:31,313
I don't do mud.

85
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:35,150
- You need a mud guy for that.
- A mud guy?

86
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:38,070
- Yes. - They have that?
- Yes. A mud guy, yes.

87
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,495
- Anything else?
- Well, now that you mention it...

88
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:47,040
- it would be nice to have a front lawn.
- I must need a cheque for that.

89
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:50,169
- How much this time?
- A thousand.

90
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:53,882
- Don't you guys know any another number?
- Two thousand.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,262
We have a dog named Sammy.

92
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:01,808
I found him rooting through some garbage
in an alley, so I brought him home.

93
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:07,440
- Sammy peed on the rug again.
- Way to go, Sammy.

94
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:10,653
He has a nervous bladder
but a good heart.

95
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:13,656
Honey, uh, we're out of Wheaties.
Do we have another box?

96
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,369
No. I forgot to buy any.
Sorry.

97
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,747
Oh, sweetheart, I-I've only had
Wheaties for breakfast...

98
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,417
every morning of my life
since I was six years old.

99
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,129
Is it too much to ask
that we keep an extra box on hand...

100
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,464
in the event of a crisis like this?

101
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,636
You gave Guzelman
another cheque.

102
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,391
Come on. I did not give Guzelman
another cheque!

103
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:39,229
And you're pissed off,
so you're taking it out on me.

104
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:43,025
Okay, okay. So I gave
Guzelman another cheque.

105
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:47,823
Don't you hate it when somebody
knows you that well?

106
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:50,577
You can't get away
with anything.

107
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,747
But I guess
that's just part of marriage.

108
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,500
So's the occasional argument.

109
00:07:56,584 --> 00:08:01,006
Oh, look. They're tearing down "The Golf of mexico."

110
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,553
- That's where we went on our first date, remember?
- No. That was our second date.

111
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,014
No. It was our first date.
I remember because...

112
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:11,101
you tripped over the grinning "bandito"
and split your pants.

113
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,521
No. Our first date
was at mr Pizza.

114
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:17,276
I remember because you ate anchovies
and belched all night.

115
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:22,282
That was our third date, and I just
burped a few times, thank you very much.

116
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:24,994
But we never argue
about anything important...

117
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:27,163
and we always make up.

118
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:33,629
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.
All right. See you after work.

119
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,174
- Oh, I forgot.
- What?

120
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:38,552
I'm gonna be late tonight.
There's a union meeting.

121
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,846
Another one? What for?

122
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,767
They're electing a strike committee.
They want me to be chairman.

123
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,521
Somebody has to stop these management
creeps from laying everybody off.

124
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:53,111
But it's my birthday.

125
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:56,950
- What'd you say?
- Never mind. Forget it.

126
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,372
She forgot.

127
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,751
I need some coffee.

128
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,383
So far, nothing had happened to make me
think that this was going to be...

129
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,596
anything more than just another
routine day at the office.

130
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,685
As usual, by the time I arrived,
there was no coffee left...

131
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:24,942
and no water.

132
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:27,112
Great.

133
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:33,996
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

134
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,087
Gotta have my coffee.

135
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:45,301
Why is it every time you have a mouthful
of freeze-dried, your boss walks in on you?

136
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,097
Hey, how they hangin', Lar?
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

137
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,808
No, no, mr Bumpers.
I'm just having my morning coffee.

138
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,812
Hey, lay off
the "Mr Bumpers" crap, Lar.

139
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:56,982
Huh? How many times
do I gotta tell you?

140
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,318
We're both on the same team here.

141
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,114
Jackie's a real sweet guy,
but kinda dumb for a company president.

142
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:05,992
When I played for the Bears,
they used to call me "Cement Head"...

143
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,162
but you can call me Jackie.

144
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:12,167
- Yes, sir, Jackie.
- I was just goin' over the quarterly reports, Lar.

145
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,838
Damn fine work.
It's a real touchdown.

146
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:19,718
- Thank you, sir. I'm just trying to do my job.
- And don't think I don't appreciate it.

147
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:23,389
A quarterback's only as good
as his linemen. Am I right?

148
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:26,393
- Yep.
- Hell, I'm just some old big, dumb jock...

149
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,229
who got lucky
and married the boss's daughter.

150
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:38,324
It's guys like you
make me look like a hotshot.

151
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:40,077
I appreciate it, sir. Thank you.

152
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,329
Well, Lar...

153
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:45,165
just, uh, keep up
the good work, huh?

154
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,043
I just came by to see
how you were doin'.

155
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,886
Now, that's funny.

156
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,810
Toilet paper in the nose.
Now, why didn't I think of that?

157
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,273
Aw, Clip, thanks a lot. I'm trying to get
a promotion! All you do is goof around?

158
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:08,236
Will you relax?
Your suck points are safe.

159
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,197
Believe me, old Cement Head
didn't notice a thing.

160
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:14,201
Oh, Clip, you kill me.

161
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,372
Happy 35th, buddy.

162
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:21,210
Well, thanks, Clip. You know, I honestly
didn't think anybody remembered.

163
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,632
Oh, this is great.

164
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:29,429
- Artificial puke.
- That's the stuff we used to throw...

165
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:32,516
into the girls' locker room to scare 'em
into runnin' out in their underwear.

166
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,896
- This is it, the actual stuff?
- I thought mr Green confiscated this.

167
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:41,694
He did, but I broke into his office
the next day. I confiscated it back.

168
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:44,071
Oh, man, we had fun in those days,
didn't we?

169
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,283
We sure did.

170
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:50,037
Well, where's
my "thank you" kiss?

171
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,791
- Oh, no, Clip. No kiss. - Come
on. Just one. - Oh, no. No kisses.

172
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,338
- We're in the office. Now stop it! Stop it!
- Larry, come on. - Get away from me, you jerk!

173
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:00,550
Why is it every time your best friend's
kissing you on the head...

174
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:04,054
a beautiful woman
comes along and catches you?

175
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,268
Hi, Cindy Jo. Hi. How are you?
How have you been?

176
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,147
Uh-Oh, you know, what a coincidence.
You know, Jackie Earle was just here.

177
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,359
We-We were talkin'.
Jackie Earle, you know, your husband.

178
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,986
Boy, he looks good. How you been,
anyway? We've been fine.

179
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,573
Uh, Clip and I are pretty good.
You know, busy and all.

180
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,785
Work, work, work.
That's what we do, you know.

181
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,413
- How you been?
- I've been fine, Larry.

182
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:27,166
Thank you for asking...
three times.

183
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:33,842
Oh. Well, I just wanted to,
you know, make absolutely sure.

184
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:38,097
Cindy Jo's father owns the company,
and she's married to Jackie.

185
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,183
That's how a guy named Cement Head
gets to be president.

186
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:44,396
- Did Jackie go back to his office?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:48,109
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he did.
He had lots of work to do.

188
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:51,697
Uh, you know,
touchdowns and all that stuff.

189
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,534
Well, it was nice seeing you again,
Larry. Bye, Clip.

190
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:03,336
Always nice seeing you too, Cindy.

191
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,505
maybe it was because
it was my birthday.

192
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,801
maybe it was seeing Cindy Jo.
I don't know.

193
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:13,473
But all morning, I'd been thinking about
what it would have been like...

194
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:16,018
if my life
had turned out differently.

195
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,230
You ever have
any regrets, Clip...

196
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,357
you know, about how your life
has turned out...

197
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,069
or about choices you made?

198
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,909
No. Oh.

199
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:31,454
- No.
- Oh.

200
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,748
But I figure I didn't make
all that many choices.

201
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:37,169
You know what my policy is?
You do nothing. You see what happens.

202
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:41,341
- And you know what? Things always seem to turn out fine.
- Yeah, for you, Clip.

203
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:45,095
Well, you know what your problem is?
Nothin's ever good enough for you.

204
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,431
The way I see it,
you've got the perfect life.

205
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:51,520
You've got a wonderful home,
a terrific wife, a good job...

206
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:55,233
and the best friend
money can buy.

207
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:57,402
What else could a guy want?

208
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,030
A little excitement
would be nice.

209
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:03,826
I am so mad,
I could scream.

210
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,581
maddie and Heather were both laid off due
to slow sales or some bullshit like that.

211
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,751
Do you believe it?
It's not fair.

212
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,337
They are laying people off and making
the rest of us work double shifts...

213
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,591
- to keep production levels up.
- She's got a point, you know.

214
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,636
I just did an inventory check,
and there's a surplus.

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,642
So, technically, we should be cutting back
on production levels, not keeping them up.

216
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:25,228
Can you check into it, please, Larry?

217
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:28,022
The next person to be laid off
could be me.

218
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,484
Looking back,
I should have said no...

219
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,654
but I didn't...

220
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,199
Yeah, well, uh, I'll look into it.

221
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:38,160
- because I'm an idiot.
- Honey, come on.

222
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,751
- What? She always kisses me.
- I'm eating.

223
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:48,131
And sure enough, when the head
of my department, Niles Pender...

224
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,301
announced he was raising
production levels...

225
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,554
I couldn't keep
my big idiot mouth shut.

226
00:14:55,515 --> 00:15:00,187
A comment, Burrows,
or merely phlegm rising in your throat?

227
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:04,318
Um, well...

228
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,361
well, just a thought here, Niles.

229
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:10,366
Why do we need more product when
we already have a surplus inventory?

230
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,787
And on what are you basing
this so-called surplus?

231
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,249
Well, on the fact that...

232
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,633
that I recently counted
every box in the warehouse.

233
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:27,304
Well, then I would say we have a problem
with our mutual perception of reality.

234
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:33,102
Sorry to barge in, Niles. Do Jackie
and I need to be here for anything?

235
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:37,149
Not at all, mr Hansen.
Just boring production details.

236
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,445
Leo Hansen owns the company.
He's a very sweet man...

237
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,949
but I don't think he has a clue
about what's going on.

238
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:44,659
Then it's off
to the golf course.

239
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,746
my son-in-law's gonna show me
how to get rid of my slice.

240
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:52,752
I think I speak for all of us, sir,
when I say that is wonderful news.

241
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:56,507
Oh, by the way. What time
is that meeting with mr Nakamura?

242
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,677
- 8:00, sir.
- Won't be a long one, will it?

243
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,680
We have a dinner reservation
at 9:00.

244
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:05,434
Well, we do have some pretty important
business to finalize, sir.

245
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:07,938
Oh, well...

246
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:12,526
- maybe I'd better cancel the reservation.
- I think that's an excellent idea.

247
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,863
That's what I'll do then.
Goodbye, all.

248
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:20,412
Touchdowns, everyone.

249
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,707
Incredible.

250
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,963
All right, Burrows. Since we seem to
have a disagreement over the inventory...

251
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,091
I suggest you check it again.

252
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,055
Well, that would take about
three or four days.

253
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,724
Well, I don't see
a problem with that.

254
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,312
Do you see a problem
with that, Burrows?

255
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:45,817
Well, do you, Burrows?

256
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,656
No. No, sir.

257
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,037
I-I should have told Niles
about the inventory surplus myself...

258
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,958
but, I mean, the guy scares
the shit out of me, you know?

259
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,128
Ah, don't worry about it.
He's just an asshole.

260
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,213
Well, listen, I'll-I'll make it up
to you somehow.

261
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:07,469
<i>Oh, I know. Hey, guess what's playing at the Rialto
on a double bill with In the Heat of the Night.</i>

262
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:10,932
<i>- Yeah? What's that?
- Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

263
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,976
Come on. We haven't seen it
in about 20 years.

264
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,855
- What do you say? You wanna go?
- Of course I want to go.

265
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,944
Great. Okay, I'll see you
later then.

266
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:23,113
All right, Clip.

267
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:27,202
Oh, and, Larry? You shouldn't
be talking to me anyway.

268
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:30,330
I mean, after all, you've got
a lot of boxes to count.

269
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:34,043
Thanks for reminding me, Clip.

270
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:37,297
Get outta here. Go to work.
What a jerk.

271
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,263
Excuse me.
Would you mind stepping back?

272
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,516
You wouldn't want me
to fork ya to death, would you?

273
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,646
No. No.

274
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,816
I mean, we couldn't have that.
I mean-

275
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:57,321
After all, you know,
we hardly know each other.

276
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,158
Since when does that matter?

277
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:07,543
All right, you,
get back to work.

278
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,753
I know what you're thinking.

279
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:13,425
Sometimes, I get the distinct feeling
I'm missin' out on something.

280
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:19,016
Well, what she's got,
she's got plenty you don't need.

281
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,143
You sure?

282
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,189
Not absolutely...

283
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:28,110
but if I ever tried to find out,
your mother would kill me.

284
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,157
You're the dad every kid dreams of.
You know that?

285
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,451
Ah, don't be such a wise guy.

286
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:37,495
Listen, Petey Fleckman
just got canned.

287
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,874
That's three guys since yesterday.

288
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:42,044
Something stinks around here, kiddo...

289
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:44,714
and I don't mean the meat loaf special
in the cafeteria.

290
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,257
Ah, yeah, I know.

291
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:49,427
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, look at this.

292
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,098
That's the same bunch
he had down here last week.

293
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,727
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

294
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,064
Niles "Asshole" Pender's
trying to pass them off...

295
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:01,525
as some championship
baseball team from Osaka.

296
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,906
When I talked to one of'em, he thinks mickey
mantle's something over a mouse's fireplace.

297
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:10,161
You're in management.
Check around a little bit, will ya?

298
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:12,915
Yeah. Okay, Pop, I'll see
what I can find out.

299
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,209
Ah, you're aces, kid.

300
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:23,552
Looking back, I should have
said no to Dad too, but I didn't.

301
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,807
I was beginning to think that
maybe something was going on.

302
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:35,025
I decided to look around Niles's office
to see if I could find anything.

303
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,488
I'd been an idiot
all morning anyway...

304
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,657
so I figured,
why stop now?

305
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:18,329
Shit.

306
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:35,182
"Leveraged buyout
via metasport."

307
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,352
What the hell's metasport?

308
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,401
Shit.

309
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:49,116
Why is it every time you
break into your boss's office...

310
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,327
he always walks in on you?

311
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:55,917
Lose something, Burrows?

312
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,755
Something tells me I have.

313
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:08,557
Well, that brings me back
to where I began-

314
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:11,477
in the middle of nowhere
with a car that won't start.

315
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,317
All things considered, it had
turned into a pretty rotten birthday.

316
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,036
But nothing
in my wildest imagination...

317
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,748
could have prepared me
for what came next.

318
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:48,440
- Evening.
- Hi.

319
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:52,027
- You got a pay phone?
- Right there.

320
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,488
Thanks.

321
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:10,090
Yeah, hi.
It's me again.

322
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:12,927
Yeah, I'm gonna need
another tow.

323
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,098
Yeah. I'm on the corner
of Cross and Third...

324
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:18,225
right next to a bar.

325
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:21,605
Yeah, the station wagon-
the big blue piece of shit.

326
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,402
I'll get a new car.

327
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,614
All right.

328
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:32,868
"Get a new car."
Gotta get a new life.

329
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,580
- Car trouble, huh?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:38,042
Tow truck will be here
in 20 minutes.

331
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,004
- Get you something while you wait?
- I could sure use it.

332
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:44,341
Light beer, no glass. Right?

333
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,843
Yeah. How did you know?

334
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:48,972
Just a guess.

335
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:56,690
Say, don't I know you
from somewhere?

336
00:22:56,815 --> 00:23:00,236
- You know, you seem familiar to me too.
- Name's mike.

337
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,034
- Larry.
- Burrows. Larry Burrows, right?

338
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:10,373
You're the kid who lost the high school
championship in 1970.

339
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,586
Jesus Henry Christ.

340
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,134
Sorry. If I'd known it was a sore point,
I wouldn't have brought it up.

341
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,058
Forget it.
I'm getting used to it.

342
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:28,270
Ah, this whole day's
been a nightmare.

343
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:32,567
- Care to talk about it? - Well,
it's- You know, it's lots of things.

344
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,488
I didn't have
my cereal this morning.

345
00:23:36,572 --> 00:23:39,325
Didn't have my coffee at work.

346
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,579
I got fired.

347
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:46,251
It's my 35th birthday,
and everyone forgot.

348
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,629
Well, almost everyone.
I mean, I got vomit from Clip.

349
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:52,717
Well, happy birthday.

350
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,264
Thanks, mike. Yeah, 35 years old,
and my life is shit.

351
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:00,727
- It can't be all that bad.
- Ah, it's not that it's bad, you know?

352
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,937
It's just that it's ordinary.

353
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:07,443
You know, I do
the same thing every day-

354
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:10,989
go to work, come home...

355
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:14,202
build some model cars
or go bowling...

356
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,663
fall asleep in front of the TV
every night.

357
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,754
I don't know. If I'd just
hit that goddam ball...

358
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,258
my life would have turned out
a whole helluva lot better.

359
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:31,514
Some people believe that things are
the way they are for a reason.

360
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,642
Well, the reason eludes me, mike.

361
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,482
Can I have another one?

362
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:40,234
Listen...

363
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:44,989
I've got just the thing
for a sober cynic like yourself.

364
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:49,495
It's a little something
of my own design.

365
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,584
I call it...

366
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:58,798
"The Spilt milk."

367
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:09,477
It's the one drink
there's no use crying over.

368
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:12,481
Oh. Very clever, mike.

369
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:15,610
It does the job. Try it.

370
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:27,792
So you really think your life
would have been better...

371
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,545
if you'd hit the ball, huh?

372
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,424
Yeah. A lot better.

373
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,471
I swung too late.
That's all.

374
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,477
Yeah.

375
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,318
If I'd just started
a half a second sooner.

376
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:27,323
I did it!
I did it!

377
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:31,787
Yeah!

378
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:40,798
Half a second sooner,
and I would've been king.

379
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:46,556
A lousy half a second.

380
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:56,151
Well, I think I'll go outside
and wait for the tow truck.

381
00:26:57,694 --> 00:27:00,322
Thanks for
the sympathetic ear, mike.

382
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:03,910
Any time, Larry.
That's what I'm here for.

383
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,923
Oh, great.
They towed my car already.

384
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,304
You'd think they could've
at least come in and told me.

385
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,979
Is he closed already?

386
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:30,068
Ah, damn. Hey, mike!

387
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,987
mike, I need to call a cab!

388
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:51,551
It's paved.

389
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,308
Well, what do you know?

390
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,894
Old Guzelman
came through after all.

391
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,063
must've found a mud guy.

392
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,696
Hey, Ellen?

393
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:11,076
Let me in, will ya?
I gotta use the can.

394
00:28:12,285 --> 00:28:15,164
Come on, honey.
my key won't work. Let me in.

395
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:21,464
What the hell are ya doin'
banging on my door like that?

396
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:23,925
Hey, who are you?
What's goin' on here?

397
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,220
- What have you done with my wife?
- What are you talkin' about?

398
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:32,018
Hey, look, man, just take
whatever you need and leave.

399
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,898
If you don't hurt anybody,
I won't call the cops, okay?

400
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:39,110
Cops? man, I am a cop.

401
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,321
Now, just what's
your problem, huh?

402
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,826
Well, I-I don't have a problem.
I-I live here.

403
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:47,036
Oh, what are you doing in my house?
Is something wrong?

404
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,875
Your house? You better show me
some ID, pal, right now.

405
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,043
Yeah, yeah. O-Okay.

406
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:58,217
Boy, you're gonna feel like a fool though.
I mean, I've lived here for over a year.

407
00:28:58,342 --> 00:28:59,969
"Lawrence J Burrows.

408
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:04,224
11653 Bonny meadow Lane,
Forest Hills."

409
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:09,898
- Where did I get this licence?
- Probably from the DmV, where everybody gets their licence.

410
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,736
Look, man, I don't care what this thing says.
This is my house, and I wanna see my wife.

411
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:18,492
- Now, step outta my way. - You try and come in my house,
and I'll kick your ass all the way down the block.

412
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:22,580
I don't care.
I'm coming in.

413
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,958
- No, you're not! - Yes, I am!
- No, you're not! - Yes, I am!

414
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:27,921
- No, you're not! - Yes, I am!
- No, you're not! - Yes, I am!

415
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:30,715
- No, you're not!
- Larry?

416
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,096
- mike. What are you doin' here?
- We need to talk.

417
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,682
Yeah, yeah. In a minute.
I gotta get in my house.

418
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:40,603
Uh, that's one of the things
we need to talk about.

419
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:44,857
- You don't live there any more.
- What?

420
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,236
See? Even the cab driver
knows you don't live here.

421
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,363
Now beat it!

422
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,914
It's all very simple really.

423
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,336
You know that, uh, little incident
you didn't like about your life?

424
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,506
You mean the baseball game?

425
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,883
- It's been changed.
- Changed?

426
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,137
What do you mean "changed"?

427
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,851
You hit the three-two pitch
right out of the park.

428
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:15,019
And that's why I don't
live in my house any more?

429
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:18,315
Exactly.
When that moment changed...

430
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,111
everything else in your life
changed along with it.

431
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,034
I get it. I get it now.

432
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,788
Aw, this is great.
This is just great.

433
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,709
Wh-What did they
pay you for this, huh?

434
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:36,504
- What does who pay me, Larry?
- Ellen and Clipster.

435
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:40,176
They set this up, right? I mean, this is
some kind of birthday gag, right?

436
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,972
This is really great.

437
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:46,309
Hey, who was that big guy
at the house?

438
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:49,270
Is that another actor?
Boy, he was great.

439
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:51,397
Scared the shit outta me.

440
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:54,777
I-I don't think
you understand.

441
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:57,572
No. No, no, no. Shh, shh.
I don't wanna hear a thing.

442
00:30:57,697 --> 00:30:59,742
I just wanna
play along with it, okay?

443
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:04,038
Oh, this is great.
So, mike, you do this a lot?

444
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,917
I mean, you know,
change people's lives and stuff.

445
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,088
I've been known to make
a few adjustments now and again.

446
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:28,735
This is it?
I live in a hotel, huh?

447
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,404
It's a private home,
and it's all yours.

448
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:34,534
Yeah, right, mike.
Hey, listen...

449
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:36,662
why don't you wait here
till I get to the door.

450
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:40,875
- You wouldn't wanna miss the expression on my face, would ya?
- Not for all the world.

451
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,586
Here. I assume you're taken care of,
but there's another five for ya.

452
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:45,840
You were really great.

453
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,222
Wow. This must've
cost them a fortune.

454
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:05,781
I'm here at the door
to my new home.

455
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:13,248
Hi. I'm Larry Burrows, but you
probably already know that, right?

456
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,376
Y-Yes, of course, sir.

457
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,880
Yeah. Is my wife here?

458
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:20,966
- As if I didn't know.
- Yes, of course she is.

459
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:28,642
Wow. Nice set-up.

460
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:32,647
I didn't know you could rent
places like this for parties.

461
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:36,109
- Hey, what's your name?
- Why, it's Boswell, sir.

462
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,071
Hey, good name.
You pick that yourself?

463
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:42,910
Here, here.
Here's a fin.

464
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,246
Get yourself
something nice. Go on.

465
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,712
- A "fin"?
- Hey, Boswell...

466
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,924
watch how surprised
I'm gonna be.

467
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,259
Get ready
with the Academy Award.

468
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,598
Honey, I'm here!

469
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:02,517
It's me!

470
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:06,773
Darling, you're home.
I was so worried.

471
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:11,737
- Daddy, Daddy! Did you bring us something?
- What did you bring us?

472
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:14,532
Where have you been?
Ludwig went to pick you up...

473
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:17,410
- but they said you'd already left.
- Cindy Jo.

474
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:22,458
What are you doing here? Uh, are you in on this too?
- Where's Clip and Ellen?

475
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,839
Who are Clip and Ellen? What are you
talking about, sweetheart? In on what?

476
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,969
- m-my surprise birthday party. - The
party isn't for another two hours, dear...

477
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,014
and you told me you didn't want it to be
a surprise because you hate surprises.

478
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,153
Darling, what's wrong?

479
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,948
Nothing is wrong.

480
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,706
Will you excuse me a minute?

481
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,226
Mike! Mike.

482
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:14,105
Okay, Mike,
what the hell is goin' on?

483
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,653
Why is Cindy Jo calling me "sweetheart", who are those kids and
- and what is this place?

484
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:22,115
This is your house.
Those are your children.

485
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,284
Cindy Jo's your wife.

486
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:29,666
No!

487
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,668
Yes.

488
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:40,930
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

489
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:44,142
I mean, this kind of thing
doesn't happen every day, you know?

490
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,895
Yes, it is quite remarkable,
if I do say so myself.

491
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,065
Wait. I don't understand
any of this.

492
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,904
How can my life change so much just
because I hit one stinkin' baseball?

493
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,784
Well, you see, Larry, one's destiny
is a very complicated thing.

494
00:34:59,452 --> 00:35:02,206
Every incident in a person's life...

495
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:04,876
affects everything else
that follows it.

496
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:09,132
Instead of missing the baseball,
however, you hit it.

497
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,343
Then you became a hero,
married the prom queen...

498
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:15,097
and so on and so forth...

499
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:19,936
until you find yourself
exactly where you are.

500
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:23,774
So you see,
hitting that baseball...

501
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:28,572
has spun your life off
in an entirely new direction.

502
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,411
Are you an angel
or something?

503
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:36,540
Not exactly, no.

504
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,042
Th-Then what are you?

505
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,964
Have you ever been
faced with a decision...

506
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,802
- and you weren't sure what to do?
- Yeah. Sure, plenty of times.

507
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:51,641
And then something inside you made you
choose one direction over another?

508
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:55,605
- Yeah. So?
- So that's me.

509
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,610
I make the suggestions,
and you make the choices.

510
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:05,158
That's how destiny works, Larry-
very subtly.

511
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:07,328
Welcome to your new life, Larry.

512
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:10,957
I hope you like it.

513
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:17,173
mike.
Hey, wait a second.

514
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,133
mike. mike, hey!

515
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:22,095
mike! mike!

516
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,144
What am I supposed
to do now?

517
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:50,798
Hi. It's me again. Larry Burrows.

518
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:53,009
Why did you run
out of the house, sweetheart?

519
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:01,853
I forgot to, uh,
tip the cabbie.

520
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:06,025
You took a cab?
Why didn't you wait for Ludwig?

521
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,236
Ludwig?

522
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:13,450
Oh, Ludwig.
Oh, good old Ludwig.

523
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:17,289
I didn't wait
for Ludwig because...

524
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:22,003
I can't remember his...

525
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:24,672
face.

526
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:29,012
You must be very tired,
sweetheart.

527
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:31,222
Yes.

528
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:35,603
Why don't you go into the library and
have yourself a nice drink before dinner.

529
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,688
Okay.

530
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,700
Uh, by the way,
where's the library?

531
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,205
It's over there.

532
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:56,420
Great. Yeah. Thanks.

533
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:06,098
So, I'll just
be in the library...

534
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:08,894
having a drink.

535
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:10,938
Thanks again.

536
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,152
Geez.

537
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:26,123
I must belong
to the Book-of-the-month Club.

538
00:38:49,986 --> 00:38:52,114
Oh, Boswell!
How you doin'?

539
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,450
Am I glad to see you.
How are you?

540
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:59,497
- Your evening drink, sir.
- Oh, good.

541
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:03,377
- What is it?
- Armagnac. 1953.

542
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,884
Whoa. I think I'm gonna
pass on that, Bos.

543
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,345
But you know what I could use is
a nice cold brewski.

544
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,725
- I'm parched.
- A "brewski," sir?

545
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,435
Yeah, a light if you've got it.
No glass.

546
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,480
And listen, Boswell, can you tell me
where the can is in this place?

547
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:22,525
I had a couple of drinks after work.
You know what I mean?

548
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,362
- The "can," sir?
- Yeah, yeah. The bathroom.

549
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:28,909
Well, sir,
there are 15 bathrooms.

550
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,329
Fifteen bathrooms?

551
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:34,373
Did you have
any particular one in mind, sir?

552
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:37,377
No. No, I don't need
nothin' special.

553
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:41,257
Just, you know,
the nearest one will do.

554
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:45,638
Through that door, sir,
down the hall.

555
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,932
Thank you.

556
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,103
Brewski.

557
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:00,614
A closet.

558
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:05,036
Another closet.

559
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:11,169
It's a closet. There's 15 bathrooms in
this place. You'd think I could find one.

560
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,430
maybe this is it.

561
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,206
my God, I've died
and gone to heaven.

562
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:47,380
Excuse me. Sir?

563
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:50,134
Would you like to go for a ride
before dinner?

564
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:55,974
Oh, no, no. No. Thanks.
Thanks, anyway.

565
00:40:57,434 --> 00:41:01,188
Hey, tell me somethin'.
Who do these cars belong to?

566
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,192
Well, they-they belong
to you, sir.

567
00:41:04,276 --> 00:41:07,195
- Get the hell outta here!
- As you wish, sir.

568
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,725
Hey.

569
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,519
A big hunk of cheese.

570
00:41:33,645 --> 00:41:37,316
It's just what I wanted.

571
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:41,489
- It's, uh, it's Stilton, LJ.
- Well, thank you, mr Stilton.

572
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:45,159
I'm sure it goes great with, uh, tomato
and mayonnaise and pumpernickel.

573
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:50,499
Thank you, everyone, so much
for remembering my birthday.

574
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:54,421
The gifts are terrific, really.
Thank you again, mr Stilton.

575
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:58,425
- And you, too, mr Steuben, for the big hunk of glass there.
- my pleasure, LJ.

576
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,140
Hey, LJ.

577
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:07,604
- LJ. LJ.
- Dad, you're here.

578
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:11,358
many happy returns, kid.
Swell shindig!

579
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:14,320
Say hello to Gina.
Gina, my kid.

580
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:16,322
Very nice to make
your acquaintance.

581
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,535
We made our acquaintance in morocco
at the Club med...

582
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,664
if you know what I mean.

583
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:26,167
Um, will, uh, you excuse us
for a moment, please?

584
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:31,216
- Ah. Why don't you go have some more caviar, sweetie?
- Okay.

585
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,722
Very nice to have met you, LJ.

586
00:42:41,604 --> 00:42:45,442
She loves caviar.
Thinks it's salty candy.

587
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,654
I haven't told her
it's fish eggs.

588
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:52,992
Are you crazy, Dad,
bringing that girl in here?

589
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:56,038
What if mom found out?
She'd skin you alive!

590
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:59,042
Relax. We signed
the papers a week ago.

591
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,671
I'm free and clear now. Now, what do
you think of Gina? Hot stuff, huh?

592
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,423
Papers? What papers?

593
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:07,427
- The divorce papers.
- Divo-

594
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,179
You and mom are divorced?

595
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:12,725
Of course we're divorced.
Nothing lasts forever.

596
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,228
You told me so yourself.

597
00:43:15,354 --> 00:43:17,898
- I said that?
- Yeah. You were right too.

598
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:20,693
Listen, kid,
can you spot me ten grand?

599
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:24,406
Gina's been killin' me
to take her to St. Bart's, okay?

600
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:26,576
You're aces, kid.

601
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:39,174
Larry, darling. Your guests
are wondering if you're all right.

602
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,429
- What's the matter, dear?
- my parents are divorced.

603
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:48,102
Of course they are, sweetheart.
Everybody's parents are divorced.

604
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,855
Now go and be a good host.

605
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:56,529
Excuse me a moment,
will you, Cindy Jo?

606
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,831
You didn't tell me
my parents were divorced.

607
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:07,167
This is quite good caviar.

608
00:44:07,293 --> 00:44:09,461
mike, my parents are divorced,
for Christ's sake!

609
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:13,425
- Yes, I know.
- Well, I didn't expect that.

610
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:18,472
Is there anything else
that's gonna come as a shock?

611
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:21,852
It all will, to some degree.

612
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,563
- To what degree?
- You'll see.

613
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:28,986
Things have changed, Larry. You have
to take the bad with the good.

614
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,324
You didn't think everything
was gonna be perfect, did you?

615
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:35,285
Well, I-

616
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:37,621
I-I suppose not.

617
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:42,044
This is your life, Larry.

618
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:45,465
Learn to enjoy
what you've got.

619
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:01,359
A brewski, sir?

620
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:03,110
Good night.

621
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:06,156
- Bye-bye. -
Good night.

622
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:08,451
I've got some great friends,
don't you think?

623
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:11,246
They give terrific gifts!

624
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,749
You still have
one more present coming.

625
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,135
I'll see you upstairs.

626
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:36,193
Cindy Jo?

627
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,240
Are you in here?

628
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,705
Larry, I'm over here.

629
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:09,859
Happy birthday, darling.

630
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:11,820
God help me.

631
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:33,221
morning, Bos.
Sleep well?

632
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:35,390
I didn't,
if you know what I mean.

633
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:38,519
I know exactly
what you mean, sir.

634
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:41,690
Oh, this house has
a lot of big rooms.

635
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:45,779
Oh.

636
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:49,366
Isn't this a little drab
for such a happy guy?

637
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:53,121
Oh, you always wear your blue pinstripe
to board meetings, sir.

638
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:55,040
Board meetings?

639
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:58,878
Son of a bitch. That's right.
I'm married to Cindy Jo.

640
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:03,175
That means I'm the president
of Liberty Republic.

641
00:47:03,258 --> 00:47:06,012
Indeed, sir.
For some time now.

642
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:11,060
Oh, yeah.
I mean, uh, I knew that.

643
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:15,983
I'm just so happy about it that I like
to remind myself every so often, Bos.

644
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:28,038
Yeah. Oh.

645
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,507
- Good morning, kids. - morning,
Father. - morning, Father.

646
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,387
Ah, crescent rolls.

647
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:43,266
Very nice.

648
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:45,477
Very nice indeed.

649
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:51,651
Larry Burrows. How you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

650
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:59,494
- What's this, Cream of Wheat?
- It's cappuccino, Daddy.

651
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:03,124
Italian dark roast coffee
and steamed whole milk.

652
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:05,418
Right, I knew that.

653
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:11,718
Whoa! That'll keep you up
the rest of your life! Huh?

654
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:18,934
That's nice stuff. You sure you kids
should be drinking this?

655
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,271
We always do, Daddy.

656
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:26,361
Well, I guess
it's all right then.

657
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:30,115
- morning.
- Hi.

658
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,242
You were wonderful
last night.

659
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,414
So were you.

660
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,085
I had no idea you could
do that with Cool Whip.

661
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:53,560
I told you we could beat that train
through the crossing, didn't I, Ludwig?

662
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:55,980
So you did, sir.

663
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:59,484
Give yourself a raise, Ludwig.
Hundred bucks a week!

664
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:01,654
You're all right.

665
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:16,380
This is my office?

666
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,597
This will take
some getting used to.

667
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:34,695
Nice desk.

668
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:40,493
I wonder how it works.

669
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,416
There's gotta be
an "on" switch here somewhere.

670
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,760
How about that?
The desk is wired to my ass.

671
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:00,810
<i>Good morning, Mr Burrows.</i>

672
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:05,732
<i>- Oh. Hi. How are you?
- Can I get you something, sir?</i>

673
00:50:05,815 --> 00:50:09,821
No. No, I'm fine.
Oh, coffee!

674
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:12,240
You know, I-I'd really like
a cup of coffee.

675
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:16,871
<i>Yes, sir. Right away. And Mr Pender and Mr
Flick are on their way up to see you, sir.</i>

676
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:18,748
You're kidding.
Those jerks still work here?

677
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:23,338
<i>- I beg your pardon? - Uh,
nothing. Uh, nothing-nothing at all.</i>

678
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,966
Say, listen,
can you do me a favour?

679
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,971
Could you find out if Clip metzler
or Ellen Burr- Ripley-

680
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,141
Ellen Ripley work here?

681
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:36,437
<i>I know Mr Metzler works in accounting,
but I'll have to check on Ellen Ripley.</i>

682
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:39,733
Thanks. Oh, and tell Pender
and Flick that, uh-

683
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:42,152
Uh, I'm- I can't be disturbed.
I'm too busy.

684
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:46,574
<i>- You know, I got lots of buttons to push and stuff.
- Yes, sir.</i>

685
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:48,743
Over and out.

686
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,421
Let's see.

687
00:50:57,504 --> 00:51:01,467
There's a bar in here?
Where's the bar?

688
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:08,184
Wow. I'm gonna love this place.

689
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:14,900
All right, Lar.
The good stuff.

690
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:27,124
Hey. I know you.
You're the forklift girl, right?

691
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:29,502
Oh, great. Thanks.

692
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,174
I've been trying to get
a regular cup of coffee for days.

693
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,677
Then again, maybe I don't need
any coffee after all.

694
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,014
Just where the hell
were you last night?

695
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:42,643
I waited up until midnight,
and then I went to bed- alone.

696
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:46,690
I-I'm sorry.

697
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:50,027
Jewel! It's Jewel! Have you
forgotten my name already?

698
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,907
Jewel. Right, I knew that.

699
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,702
Look, I'm-I'm real, real sorry.

700
00:51:56,786 --> 00:51:58,830
I-I guess I couldn't make it.

701
00:51:58,914 --> 00:52:01,750
- I-I had this party to go to-
- You guess you couldn't make it?

702
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,379
Where were you,
out with this Ellen Ripley bitch?

703
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:06,672
Oh, Ellen. Did you find out
if she works here?

704
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,426
No, she does not
work here.

705
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,890
If she suddenly starts working here,
you're gonna live to regret it.

706
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:16,101
Say, Jewel, what do you say
we double your salary.

707
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:20,272
- How's that?
- I know what you're capable of, LJ Burrows.

708
00:52:20,356 --> 00:52:22,442
Just don't mess with me...

709
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:25,905
or you're gonna find out
what I'm capable of.

710
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:29,325
Am I making myself
perfectly clear?

711
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:37,795
- Uh... perfectly.
- Uh, LJ, we need to talk.

712
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:39,964
Oh, hi, guys.
Come on in.

713
00:52:42,174 --> 00:52:44,970
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Uh, it's about the New Jersey plan.

714
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:47,473
I gotta call Bob and let him know
one way or another.

715
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:51,895
I think it's a big mistake
to set up New Jersey, LJ. Big mistake.

716
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:54,314
LJ, we really need to talk in private
about the country club.

717
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:58,403
We have to go over a few points on the Nakamura deal
before we sign the papers tomorrow night? Are we on?

718
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:01,490
- For New Jersey?
- No, for golf.

719
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:06,496
Excuse me, LJ.
Am I disturbing you?

720
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,041
mr Hansen, come in.

721
00:53:11,044 --> 00:53:14,214
Come in. mr Hansen.

722
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:17,302
Come on in, please.

723
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:18,887
What can I do for you,
mr Hansen?

724
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:24,268
Well, I just wanted to apologize for not
appearing at your birthday party last night.

725
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,355
- my ulcer was acting up, and I
just thought- - Oh, don't mention it.

726
00:53:27,439 --> 00:53:31,027
You didn't miss a thing.
I-I got some cheese and a glass thing.

727
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,237
- A what?
- You know, this, um-

728
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:35,406
Uh, excuse me. LJ?

729
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,704
Sir, we really should get going.
We, uh, tee off in 15 minutes.

730
00:53:39,788 --> 00:53:44,543
Oh, right. Yeah, well, uh-

731
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:47,046
Hey, mr Hansen, would you like
to come golfing with us?

732
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:49,633
- I play golf, you
know. - Really? - Yeah.

733
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:53,596
- You want to play golf with me?
- Sure, I wanna play golf with you. Come on.

734
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,768
- You know, I can help you get rid of that
slice or... - Uh-huh. - whatever you call it, uh-

735
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:03,983
Yeah.

736
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:20,129
It slipped.

737
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:24,843
Can I use yours?

738
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:27,470
- Sure.
- Thanks.

739
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:31,267
It's not like
a baseball bat, you know.

740
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,070
That was dirt.

741
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,741
- That'll grow back, right?
- We'll fix it.

742
00:54:43,824 --> 00:54:45,910
This is the real one.

743
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:58,676
- It's not supposed to go over there, is it?
- Well, no, sir.

744
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,890
Um, actually, it's supposed to go
in the hole... on the green.

745
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:06,226
Oh. All right.
Hey, Leo, come on.

746
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,688
Let's take the golf cart
and see if we can find the ball.

747
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,317
I don't get it.

748
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,070
What are you,
deaf, dumb and blind?

749
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:17,908
The Jerry Lewis routine is to lull the old
geezer into a false sense of security...

750
00:55:17,991 --> 00:55:20,577
before he sells the company
out from under him.

751
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,208
It's brilliant.
It's my idea.

752
00:55:37,098 --> 00:55:39,559
Hey, how you doin'?

753
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:41,687
Good to see ya.

754
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,232
Hey, you're doing a great job,
and I just want you to know that.

755
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,400
Keep up the good work, guys.

756
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:49,780
What's with him?

757
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:55,246
I'm the president of the company. I should
do something about this line, don't you think?

758
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,507
Oh, my God.

759
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:09,430
Ellen.

760
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:12,474
Ellen. It's me, Larry.

761
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:15,270
Oh, my God.
Am I glad to see you.

762
00:56:15,353 --> 00:56:18,816
Oh. I've been wondering
where you were.

763
00:56:18,899 --> 00:56:22,028
- I beg your pardon?
- You know, they told me you didn't work here.

764
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,907
I couldn't find you. There's no record of an Ellen
Ripley, and I knew it wouldn't be under Burrows.

765
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:30,038
Why would it be under Burrows?
my name is Robertson.

766
00:56:30,122 --> 00:56:33,376
Robertson?
What are you doin' with that name?

767
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,380
It is customary for a woman to take
her husband's name, mr Burrows.

768
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:39,549
Now, if you'll excuse me.

769
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,599
You're married?
When did that happen?

770
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:48,936
Six years ago. Don't worry.
I wasn't married on company time.

771
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,150
Wait. Wait. You just married
the first guy that came along?

772
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:56,279
Look, just because I work for you
does not give you the right...

773
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:58,448
to pry into my private life.

774
00:57:00,534 --> 00:57:03,871
Well, of course it doesn't.

775
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,541
I'm just concerned...

776
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:10,546
as I am about, you know,
all my employees, miss, uh...

777
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,716
mrs Robertson.

778
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,887
Concern for your employees has never
been your strong suit, mr Burrows.

779
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:20,058
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to eat my lunch...

780
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:22,394
by myself.

781
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:25,607
Yeah, but, uh, couldn't we just-

782
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,168
You really must
do something...

783
00:57:42,252 --> 00:57:45,339
about this meat loaf, Larry.

784
00:57:45,422 --> 00:57:48,593
It is absolutely inedible.

785
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,765
- Ellen's married.
- Yes, I know.

786
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:57,103
She's mad at me.
I can tell.

787
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,273
She's the union shop steward...

788
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:01,693
and the union's upset
over all the layoffs...

789
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:04,737
the increased workload,
pay freezes.

790
00:58:04,821 --> 00:58:10,453
- So what's that got to do with me?
- You are the president of the company, their mortal enemy.

791
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:13,540
- Yeah, but I wouldn't lay anybody off.
- But you did.

792
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:17,879
And so, Ellen hates your guts.

793
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:21,091
She hates my personal guts?

794
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:23,760
You'll find a lot of people
don't like you, Larry.

795
00:58:23,844 --> 00:58:26,556
What am I gonna do? I mean, I can't have
her hating my guts all over the place.

796
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,061
- I mean, she's my wife, for Christ's sake.
- She was your wife.

797
00:58:31,146 --> 00:58:34,232
I have to go now.
This meat loaf is making me sick.

798
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:36,818
What am I gonna do
about Ellen?

799
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:39,906
Whatever you do
will be fine.

800
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:44,329
You're a big help.

801
00:58:57,135 --> 00:58:59,722
Hey, I think it's busted, pal.

802
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:04,019
- Clip, it's you!
- Oh, my God.

803
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:07,315
- mr Burrows, sir.
- Don't call me "sir," Clip.

804
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:10,820
It's me, Lar. Aw, come here
and give me a hug.

805
00:59:10,903 --> 00:59:12,947
Come here. God, I miss you,
you know that?

806
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,324
It was an accident.
I swear I'll pay for any damages.

807
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:17,953
Oh, forget about it. Come on. I wanna
kiss you on the top of your head.

808
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:23,084
Come here. Clip! Clip!

809
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:25,212
What's the matter with you?

810
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,715
Clipster, it's me, Larry.

811
00:59:43,276 --> 00:59:45,862
Larry, we're going to be late.

812
00:59:47,114 --> 00:59:50,618
What on earth are you doing?

813
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:53,371
I don't feel like going
to the opera tonight, honey.

814
00:59:53,454 --> 00:59:56,375
I never really cared for it
that much, to tell you the truth-

815
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:59,545
all that hollering in Italian.

816
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:04,510
- What's that?
- This is a Gullwing mercedes.

817
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:07,805
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, dear.

818
01:00:07,889 --> 01:00:10,559
You have one in the garage.

819
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:14,689
Yeah, but that one's too big.
I kinda like 'em smaller.

820
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:18,068
Children, you go wait
in the car, okay? Go on.

821
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:24,201
Darling?

822
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:26,996
Are you all right?

823
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:30,584
You've been acting
very strange lately.

824
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:35,172
No. I'm fine. Really.

825
01:00:35,255 --> 01:00:38,843
Why don't you guys go ahead without me.
Have a good time.

826
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,347
I just wanna finish this up.

827
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:07,420
I can't believe
Ellen married another guy.

828
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,483
Wow. Nice house.

829
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:28,196
It's better
than the one we had.

830
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:36,165
I just wanted to borrow some cutlery,
Ellen, okay? I have no cutlery. None!

831
01:01:36,248 --> 01:01:39,334
All I'm asking for is a couple
of lousy knives and forks.

832
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:41,713
Why don't you ask your girlfriend
for a knife and fork...

833
01:01:41,796 --> 01:01:43,840
or does the little bitch
eat with her fingers?

834
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:49,514
I made a mistake,
and I'm very sorry for it.

835
01:01:49,598 --> 01:01:52,434
Now, can we try
and put all this behind us?

836
01:01:55,104 --> 01:01:57,649
Attagirl!

837
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:59,735
Guess not.

838
01:02:09,955 --> 01:02:13,960
This is good.
This is very good.

839
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:53,969
Ow!

840
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:56,805
What's the matter, Hercules?

841
01:02:56,888 --> 01:03:00,935
You wanna go out?
Okay. Okay. Come on.

842
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:05,399
Come on! Come on.

843
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:16,161
Shoo! Get away.

844
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:18,373
Go on! Scram! Beat it!

845
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:21,168
Go rescue some skiers in the Alps
or somethin'. Go! Scram!

846
01:03:27,843 --> 01:03:30,638
Well, we'll see
who falls asleep first.

847
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,897
Asshole.

848
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:54,959
Stupid dog.

849
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:57,129
Stupid tree.

850
01:04:22,244 --> 01:04:25,163
- Good morning, chief.
- What's going on here?

851
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:30,002
- Who is that? - I don't know.
Some, uh, lunatic named, uh-

852
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:32,714
- Now, what's his name, huh?
- Uh, metzbaum, metsfield. I don't know.

853
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,010
- He's in accounting.
- metzler?

854
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:38,430
- Clip metzler?
- Yeah.

855
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:42,101
- He's threatening to jump.
- Aw, Jesus, Clip!

856
01:05:02,418 --> 01:05:04,420
Clip? What are you doing?

857
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:08,800
Hey, you stay back, mr Burrows.
You get any closer, I'll jump.

858
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:11,721
Okay, Clip. I'm not-
I'm not gonna come any closer.

859
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:15,517
I just wanna talk.

860
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:19,022
You know, if there's something wrong,
maybe I can help.

861
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:22,692
Well, i-i-it's a little late
for that, mr Burrows.

862
01:05:22,775 --> 01:05:25,613
You know, my whole life's
been a disaster.

863
01:05:25,696 --> 01:05:28,491
Nothing I do ever works out.

864
01:05:29,618 --> 01:05:32,663
After what happened yesterday, well,
I know you're gonna fire me.

865
01:05:32,747 --> 01:05:36,709
Now, look, Clip.
I'm not gonna fire you.

866
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,921
All right?

867
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:42,759
In fact, you know what?
I came up here to offer you a new job.

868
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:47,097
How 'bout vice president?
Hundred twenty-five to start.

869
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,350
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

870
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:02,157
Oh, I get it.

871
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:05,286
Oh, I get it. You're just trying to
trick me. As soon as I get down there...

872
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:09,833
th- there's no job
and I'm off to the funny farm.

873
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:13,922
- Don't try to kid me, mr Burrows.
- I'm not kidding, Clip.

874
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,887
Nothing will happen. I mean it.

875
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:22,558
Why else would
I come up here myself?

876
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:26,396
I don't know.
Why did you come up here?

877
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:29,107
Because we're friends, Clip.

878
01:06:31,026 --> 01:06:34,906
Hey, remember back in the eighth grade
when we used to hang around together?

879
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,118
Remember, we used to throw rubber vomit
in the girls' locker room...

880
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,787
and they'd come runnin' out
in their underwear?

881
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,665
- You remember that?
- Yeah. Of course I do!

882
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,419
<i>Remember when we went to see
Bonnie and Clyde nine times...</i>

883
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,797
and we squirted ketchup
on ourselves and-

884
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,467
and ran all over the place
dying in slow motion?

885
01:06:52,553 --> 01:06:54,805
That was fun.

886
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:00,271
It scared the crap
out of my baby sister.

887
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,398
Yeah. And I remember how...

888
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:05,861
you used to always try
to make me laugh when I felt rotten.

889
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:14,788
Well, I-I-I didn't think that
you thought about that stuff any more.

890
01:07:14,872 --> 01:07:17,334
Aw, Clip...

891
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,671
I think about that stuff
all the time.

892
01:07:26,929 --> 01:07:31,017
All right, Clipper. I want you
to go home. I want you to relax...

893
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,854
have a nice meal,
shave, shower, get some sleep.

894
01:07:34,938 --> 01:07:39,027
All right? Tomorrow,
you start your new job, new salary.

895
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:41,863
- Thanks, mr Burrows.
- All right. Take care of yourself.

896
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:43,991
Be careful.

897
01:07:44,075 --> 01:07:46,202
Pender.

898
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:50,958
Well done, LJ.
Want me to fire him?

899
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:54,379
No. I don't want
you to fire him.

900
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:56,674
I want you
to get him a new mercedes...

901
01:07:56,757 --> 01:07:59,635
'cause a senior vice president
of East Coast sales...

902
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:02,305
can't be seen in anything less.

903
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:07,311
Mercedes? LJ,
I didn't even get a Mercedes.

904
01:08:07,395 --> 01:08:10,107
Oh, and while you're at it,
I want you to get the board together...

905
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,192
for a full meeting in ten minutes.

906
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:15,196
We're gonna put an end to this
strike bullshit once and for all.

907
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,827
- But L-L-LJ- - Hey, I don't have a problem
with that, Pender. You got a problem with that?

908
01:08:21,955 --> 01:08:25,542
Well, do you, Pender?

909
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:29,005
No, sir. No problem.

910
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:31,633
I didn't think so.

911
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:48,904
I just finished reading
the latest contract demands...

912
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:52,783
and... they seem very reasonable
to me.

913
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:57,164
- Reasonable? Um, but LJ-
- In fact-

914
01:08:57,247 --> 01:09:00,628
In fact, I'm prepared to agree to all
of them under one condition...

915
01:09:02,546 --> 01:09:04,924
that the head of the negotiating
committee meet with me alone...

916
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,552
to go over the final details.

917
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:17,105
- Perhaps over dinner tonight?
- LJ, there are a few things you seem to be forgetting about.

918
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:21,110
Dinner? I don't know why
that would be necessary.

919
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:25,074
It would be strictly business. You want
to bring this dispute to an end, don't you?

920
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:28,411
Well, yes. Of course I do.

921
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:30,914
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
How's that?

922
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:33,333
LJ, I don't think
we should be so hasty.

923
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:38,465
- Okay.
- Good. It's a date.

924
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:48,769
I'm gonna nail this bastard.

925
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,826
Oh, oh. Don't do that, mike.

926
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,288
Congratulations, Larry.

927
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:06,792
It's a brave man who takes command
of his own destiny.

928
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:10,796
Well, thanks.
I feel pretty good about it myself.

929
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:14,592
And you don't feel guilty running around
with Ellen behind Cindy Jo's back?

930
01:10:14,676 --> 01:10:17,763
Guilty? Why should I feel guilty?
I just got here, remember?

931
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:21,143
It's- It's not like I have a history
with Cindy Jo or anything.

932
01:10:21,226 --> 01:10:25,772
Well, okay. Fine.

933
01:10:25,857 --> 01:10:28,610
Wait a second.

934
01:10:30,362 --> 01:10:34,659
- What do you mean, "Well, okay. Fine"?
- Nothing, really. I-It's just that...

935
01:10:34,743 --> 01:10:38,163
Cindy Jo has been a loyal
and loving wife for the last ten years.

936
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:43,211
- What are you getting at?
- Your destiny has been changed, Larry-

937
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:46,090
by request, I might add-
and you must take responsibility...

938
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:48,635
for the circumstances
of your new life.

939
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,182
They are, after all,
of your own making.

940
01:10:53,265 --> 01:10:57,187
Well, if I made 'em,
I can unmake 'em.

941
01:11:08,033 --> 01:11:10,954
- Good evening, mr Burrows.
- Hi.

942
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:17,419
- Any trouble finding the place?
- No. No trouble at all.

943
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,298
That's good. That's good.

944
01:11:20,382 --> 01:11:23,636
These are for you.

945
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:26,348
They're lovely.

946
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:28,809
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

947
01:11:28,892 --> 01:11:32,313
I'm afraid, uh, Hercules
got dog drool all over 'em- uh-

948
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:35,109
How'd you know
his name was Hercules?

949
01:11:35,192 --> 01:11:37,277
Because it's on his tag...

950
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:41,282
that I've been staring at
for the past five minutes.

951
01:11:41,408 --> 01:11:45,579
Okay. Come here, boy.
Come here. Hercules. Hercules.

952
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,665
Ow.

953
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:57,845
Nice doggie. Good doggie.

954
01:11:59,054 --> 01:12:04,186
- I don't think he likes me.
- Well, he's an exceptional judge of character.

955
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,108
We aren't starting off
very well, are we?

956
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:13,989
There is only so far that I will go for
my union brothers and sisters, mr Burrows.

957
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:19,580
- Oh, please. Call me Lar. - We agreed to keep
this evening strictly on a business level, correct?

958
01:12:19,663 --> 01:12:25,003
Absolutely. God.
I forgot how beautiful you are.

959
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:29,425
mr Burrows, if this is your attempt
to soften me up...

960
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:31,720
so that you can win concessions
from the union, I-

961
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:33,972
I don't want concessions. Honest.

962
01:12:34,056 --> 01:12:37,185
The contracts are as good
as signed.

963
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:40,063
You could have done that
at the meeting.

964
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:43,526
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

965
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,237
Really. I just thought maybe
we'd get to know each other again-

966
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,948
uh, better.

967
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:04,843
- Wait, wait. Just wait. Wait-Wait a
minute. Wait a minute. - Oh, yes, sir.

968
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:08,473
No, no, no. I'll get it.
Oh. Wait, wait. I'll get the door.

969
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,559
my dear.

970
01:13:25,703 --> 01:13:28,789
- Hello?
- Let me talk to mrs Burrows.

971
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:30,875
This is mrs Burrows.

972
01:13:30,959 --> 01:13:33,254
This way, monsieur.

973
01:13:37,884 --> 01:13:40,429
Enjoy your meal, monsieur, madame.

974
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,849
Thank you.
This place is all right, huh?

975
01:13:42,974 --> 01:13:46,311
- You sound like you've never been here before.
- Oh, I haven't.

976
01:13:46,395 --> 01:13:50,442
my secretary made the reservations. I'm
strictly a pizza-and-burger man myself.

977
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:56,073
Pizza-and-burger man, huh?

978
01:13:57,241 --> 01:14:00,871
The chef has prepared something
very special for you this evening.

979
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:02,957
Great.

980
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:14,137
Bring two of'em.
It's food, right? Good.

981
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,516
Ah, I ordered for the both of us.
Hope you don't mind.

982
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:23,565
- may I bring for you some wine?
- Yes. Wine. Would you like some wine?

983
01:14:23,648 --> 01:14:27,695
- I understand the French make it pretty
good. - No, thank you. I think I'll just have-

984
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,699
Virgin mary. Tabasco sauce
and lime, no ground pepper. Right?

985
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:37,749
I'm impressed. You must have had
your spies working overtime.

986
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:40,920
Uh, I'll have a light beer,
no glass.

987
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:44,341
Spies? I don't have any spies.

988
01:14:44,424 --> 01:14:47,511
I just happen to
know a lot about you.

989
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:51,392
Well, I know a few things
about you.

990
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:53,936
Yeah? Like what?

991
01:14:54,061 --> 01:14:56,815
Nothing I could repeat.

992
01:14:56,898 --> 01:15:00,318
- Well, that bad, huh?
- The only thing that doesn't fit...

993
01:15:00,402 --> 01:15:02,530
is what you did
for Clip this afternoon.

994
01:15:02,655 --> 01:15:05,450
Oh, that. Well, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

995
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,496
Try me.

996
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:14,210
How well do you remember 1970?

997
01:15:24,557 --> 01:15:26,851
Bastard.

998
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,618
You bastard!

999
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,797
That's why I did what I did for Clip,
and that's how come...

1000
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:53,425
I know so much about you.

1001
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:57,264
Because we were married?

1002
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:59,933
Exactly!

1003
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:03,146
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

1004
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:08,361
Well, I didn't think
you'd believe me.

1005
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:13,116
Ah. I probably shouldn't have told you.
Forget I said anything.

1006
01:16:14,619 --> 01:16:16,829
Ah! Dinner.

1007
01:16:19,499 --> 01:16:22,044
Boy, it looks pretty good.

1008
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:25,590
Do we know what this is?

1009
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:30,221
<i>Calf brains. Bon appetit.</i>

1010
01:16:30,304 --> 01:16:34,559
<i>Wow, I feel good</i>

1011
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:37,021
<i>- I knew that I would, now
- We'd like a, uh, large pizza...</i>

1012
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:40,901
<i>- double cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and anchovies.
- I feel good</i>

1013
01:16:41,026 --> 01:16:44,947
<i>- Uh, but only on half, because, anchovies give her heartburn.
- I knew that I would, now</i>

1014
01:16:45,072 --> 01:16:48,159
<i>- So good, so good
- Right? - Right.</i>

1015
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:50,538
<i>- You got it? - I got you - Yes,
sir. That'll be about 20 minutes.</i>

1016
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:53,166
<i>- Twenty minutes. This way, my dear.
- I feel good</i>

1017
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,169
- And a couple of sodas.
- Got it.

1018
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:03,137
Come on. Tell the truth. How do you
really know so much about me?

1019
01:17:03,262 --> 01:17:07,183
- You spy on your employees, don't you?
- No, I don't.

1020
01:17:07,267 --> 01:17:10,687
- I already told you.
- Right, right. We were married.

1021
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,983
Exactly! Thank you.

1022
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:18,071
- You're not gonna give it up, are you?
- No way.

1023
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:20,700
If we weren't married,
how could I know that you sleep...

1024
01:17:20,825 --> 01:17:23,953
in an old, faded flannel shirt
your dad gave you, hmm?

1025
01:17:24,037 --> 01:17:27,082
Spies.

1026
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:32,757
How come I know that every night you brush your hair exactly 86 times
- 43 forward, 43 back?

1027
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,134
Spies.

1028
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,470
Yeah.

1029
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:40,766
I know that your favourite part
of the body is the earlobe.

1030
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:44,520
I know that your favourite actor is William
Bendix because he looks just like your Uncle Bud...

1031
01:17:44,604 --> 01:17:49,359
whose wife, Aunt Esther, used to send you two
dozen white handkerchiefs every Christmas...

1032
01:17:49,443 --> 01:17:54,115
with "EJR" embroidered
right in the corner.

1033
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:58,037
Now, that's not the kind of stuff
you get from spies, is it?

1034
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:02,709
There's got to be
some logical explanation for this.

1035
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:04,795
You couldn't possibly
know those things.

1036
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:09,927
I know everything.
Go ahead. Ask me.

1037
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,514
Ask me something
I couldn't possibly know.

1038
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:16,226
But if I get it right, will you believe
that we were married in another life?

1039
01:18:19,105 --> 01:18:22,609
- maybe.
- All right.

1040
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,948
Give me your best shot.

1041
01:18:27,073 --> 01:18:29,200
All right.

1042
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:34,499
- The day I got my driver's licence-
- October 23, 1970. Right?

1043
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:38,129
my dad let me take the car out
on my own.

1044
01:18:38,254 --> 01:18:42,675
Oldsmobile, vinyl top,
two-tone- Okay.

1045
01:18:42,758 --> 01:18:46,972
Two blocks from my house,
I got pulled over for speeding.

1046
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,186
I never told anyone.

1047
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,814
I even paid for the ticket
out of my own allowance.

1048
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:56,984
- You want to know the name of the cop?
- No.

1049
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,321
I want to know the name of the song
on the radio.

1050
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:03,910
That's it? That's your best shot?

1051
01:19:04,035 --> 01:19:07,414
Huh. Let's see here.

1052
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:10,041
It's not, Mack the Knife. No.

1053
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,962
It's not "Happy Birthday."

1054
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:16,383
It's not Mötley Crüe.
They weren't born yet.

1055
01:19:17,677 --> 01:19:22,807
Is it this one?

1056
01:19:32,695 --> 01:19:34,697
Oh, God.

1057
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:52,427
<i>Hey</i>

1058
01:19:52,511 --> 01:19:56,265
<i>Well, my temperature's rising
Got my feet on the floor</i>

1059
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,353
<i>Crazy people knocking
'cause they want to go more</i>

1060
01:19:59,436 --> 01:20:02,231
<i>Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got</i>

1061
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:05,318
<i>But you'd better take it easy
'cause this place is hot</i>

1062
01:20:05,402 --> 01:20:08,406
<i>And I'm so glad you made it</i>

1063
01:20:09,616 --> 01:20:14,579
<i>So glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin'</i>

1064
01:20:14,663 --> 01:20:21,130
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Gimme some lovin'</i>

1065
01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:23,508
<i>Every day</i>

1066
01:20:39,777 --> 01:20:42,990
<i>Hey</i>

1067
01:20:43,073 --> 01:20:46,327
<i>Well, I feel so good
Everybody's getting high</i>

1068
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:49,832
<i>You'd better take it easy
'cause the place is on fire</i>

1069
01:20:49,915 --> 01:20:53,043
<i>Been a hard day
and I don't know what to do</i>

1070
01:20:53,127 --> 01:20:55,797
<i>We made it, baby
and it had to be you</i>

1071
01:20:55,881 --> 01:21:00,011
<i>And I'm so glad you made it</i>

1072
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:04,558
<i>So glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin'</i>

1073
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:11,357
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Gimme some lovin'</i>

1074
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:15,447
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Whoo-hoo, hey, hey, hey</i>

1075
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:21,036
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

1076
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:26,543
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

1077
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,508
So, you going to invite me in
for a nightcap...

1078
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:35,387
you know, to celebrate the end
of our negotiations?

1079
01:21:35,513 --> 01:21:38,350
No. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1080
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:41,604
maybe after
the contracts are signed.

1081
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:45,024
Okay. I understand.

1082
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:48,779
We're just gonna have to get those
contracts signed really quickly then, huh?

1083
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,908
You got a pen? I could do it now.

1084
01:21:55,037 --> 01:21:58,874
- Good night, mr Burrows.
- Larry. Larry. Please.

1085
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:02,629
I had a fun evening, Larry.
Thanks.

1086
01:22:02,712 --> 01:22:06,634
I did too. Brought back
a lot of good memories.

1087
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:15,687
Well, good night.

1088
01:22:22,112 --> 01:22:24,239
- Larry?
- Yes?

1089
01:22:24,322 --> 01:22:27,618
If we had such
a great life together...

1090
01:22:27,702 --> 01:22:30,747
why'd you want it changed?

1091
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,669
I guess...

1092
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:39,090
I just didn't know what I had.

1093
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,663
Oh, honey, you didn't have
to wait up for me.

1094
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:07,793
- Larry, who is she?
- Who's who?

1095
01:23:07,876 --> 01:23:11,214
The bimbo you had dinner with
at La Scala.

1096
01:23:12,799 --> 01:23:15,135
Oh, her?

1097
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:19,431
She's a, uh-

1098
01:23:19,515 --> 01:23:23,103
detective from
the police force-

1099
01:23:23,187 --> 01:23:26,065
Larry, stop lying.

1100
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:33,074
All right. No more lies.

1101
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:43,002
How well do you remember 1970?

1102
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:46,173
Cindy? Cindy?

1103
01:23:47,299 --> 01:23:51,930
Cindy Jo? Come on, honey.
I swear to God it's the truth. Honest.

1104
01:23:52,013 --> 01:23:56,102
Come on. Let me up, Cindy.
I'm standing out here without any clo-

1105
01:23:57,228 --> 01:24:00,774
Thank you, dear. Thank you.
Could I have my sh-shoe-

1106
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:03,194
You're so kind, honey.
I really appreciate it...

1107
01:24:03,278 --> 01:24:06,157
but do you think I can
come upstairs and change?

1108
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,034
I can change in the garage, honey.
Thank you.

1109
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:24,553
Oops. I did it again.
You'd think I'd get it right just once.

1110
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:29,602
Oh, well. Hello?

1111
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:32,230
Daddy?

1112
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:34,691
Larry's fallen in love
with someone else.

1113
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:38,654
Oh, my!

1114
01:24:38,738 --> 01:24:43,035
Oh, yes, dear.
I know I own the company, but-

1115
01:24:43,118 --> 01:24:46,581
All right. I will. Yes, dear.

1116
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,584
Now, you take a Valium
and go to bed.

1117
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:52,171
Okay. Goodbye.

1118
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:59,388
Fire LJ Burrows?
How do I fire LJ Burrows?

1119
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:03,434
LJ, you're fired.

1120
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:07,857
LJ, you are fired!

1121
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:11,946
LJ, you rotten son of a bitch...

1122
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:14,573
you can't do that
to my baby girl and get away with it.

1123
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:17,201
You're fired!

1124
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,871
That's not bad.

1125
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:23,417
maybe I'll just write him a letter
and leave it in his office.

1126
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,671
Yeah. That'd be better.

1127
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:30,927
Dear LJ...

1128
01:25:32,137 --> 01:25:36,851
you rotten son of a bitch.

1129
01:25:39,855 --> 01:25:42,899
It's very simple, really.
The police will think...

1130
01:25:42,983 --> 01:25:46,612
he happened into the wrong place
at the wrong time and became...

1131
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:52,078
the poor, innocent victim
of murderous thieves.

1132
01:25:52,162 --> 01:25:54,205
The little prick!

1133
01:25:54,289 --> 01:25:56,666
With him out of the way...

1134
01:25:59,086 --> 01:26:02,799
the Nakamura deal
can proceed as planned.

1135
01:26:02,883 --> 01:26:05,720
Yeah, but what
if he doesn't show up?

1136
01:26:05,803 --> 01:26:09,682
Stop being such a geek.
Of course he'll show.

1137
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:12,644
After his wife throws him out...

1138
01:26:14,105 --> 01:26:17,234
where else would he go?

1139
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:25,785
Uh, where do you think
you're goin', big fella?

1140
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:30,375
Sorry, Niles. I-
I can't go through with it.

1141
01:26:30,459 --> 01:26:32,878
Fine. Don't need your help.

1142
01:26:34,004 --> 01:26:36,048
Nobody...

1143
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:39,010
double-crosses Niles Pender...

1144
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:44,142
out of 120 million bucks!

1145
01:26:57,408 --> 01:27:01,371
Oh. Oh, that old thing.

1146
01:27:01,454 --> 01:27:04,625
I'm not afraid of him.

1147
01:27:06,753 --> 01:27:09,131
Well, let's see.

1148
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:13,219
Hope there's nobody in here.

1149
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:21,020
Shit!

1150
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,627
Is God smiling on me or what?

1151
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,596
Oh, God. mr Hansen?

1152
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:24,974
mr Hansen?

1153
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:36,905
- mr Hansen.
- Cover him. He's got a weapon.

1154
01:28:40,785 --> 01:28:43,997
- All right. Let's go.
- Here we go.

1155
01:28:45,165 --> 01:28:48,169
I'm telling you, I didn't know
Leo was gonna fire me.

1156
01:28:48,253 --> 01:28:52,383
I didn't see any letter. And even
if I had, I wouldn't have killed him.

1157
01:28:52,466 --> 01:28:55,929
Look, Niles Pender is the one you should
be arresting, not me. I'm innocent.

1158
01:28:56,012 --> 01:28:59,850
Niles Pender set this whole thing up.
He's trying to take over the company.

1159
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:02,270
I mean, he killed Leo.
Leo's a friend of mine.

1160
01:29:02,353 --> 01:29:06,191
I was just golfing with him. I wouldn't
hurt him. I'm too nice of a guy.

1161
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:10,780
Pender was the one. Look-

1162
01:29:10,864 --> 01:29:13,324
I need a lawyer.
I don't wanna get in the car.

1163
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:23,504
- Jewel!
- Think you can just write me off like a bad debt, huh?

1164
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:27,634
Well, it's time to pay up, mister.

1165
01:29:29,469 --> 01:29:32,891
Ouch, ouch, oh, ouch, oh, oh!

1166
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:36,145
- What are we gonna do?
- Help! help!

1167
01:30:04,179 --> 01:30:09,561
Ellen!

1168
01:30:09,645 --> 01:30:12,564
Ellen.

1169
01:30:16,027 --> 01:30:18,071
Larry, what is it?

1170
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:20,324
I gotta go,
and you gotta come with me.

1171
01:30:20,407 --> 01:30:22,744
Whoa, Larry. Slow down.

1172
01:30:22,827 --> 01:30:25,580
- Tell me what's going on.
- Nothing's goin' on.

1173
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:29,877
Nothin'. I just wanna be with you
like we were before.

1174
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:32,756
I-I-I know you don't think
it's gonna work, but it will.

1175
01:30:32,839 --> 01:30:35,259
You know why?
Because we've already done it.

1176
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:38,429
Are you talking about
the "previous life" thing again, Larry?

1177
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:43,602
Yes. Yes. We'll have Thanksgiving
and-and Christmas and-and birthdays...

1178
01:30:43,686 --> 01:30:47,399
and- and breakfast together,
just like it was.

1179
01:30:47,482 --> 01:30:51,571
- I don't mean to rush you, but we gotta go.
- Wait a minute, Larry.

1180
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:54,866
That all sounds wonderful.
It really does. It's just that...

1181
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,828
after our dinner,
I started thinking about things...

1182
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:00,790
about what has
real importance to me.

1183
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,877
You know, I been thinkin' about what's
important to me too.

1184
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,381
And you know what it is?
It's us being together-

1185
01:31:06,464 --> 01:31:09,342
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Hello.

1186
01:31:09,426 --> 01:31:13,097
Uh, Tom, this is my boss,
Larry Burrows.

1187
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:16,435
Larry, this is my husband, Tom.

1188
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:21,357
- Hi, Tom.
- Nice to meet you, mr Burrows.

1189
01:31:21,441 --> 01:31:24,110
Nice to meet you.

1190
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:29,367
- So what's going on, Ellen?
- Oh, nothing's going on, uh, Tom.

1191
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:34,665
Uh, I'm going out of town, and so I
thought I'd stop by and say "so long."

1192
01:31:37,627 --> 01:31:41,549
Well, so long.

1193
01:31:53,563 --> 01:31:56,817
Uh, I-I've got to
tell him one thing.

1194
01:31:56,901 --> 01:31:59,238
Larry?

1195
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:10,501
I was wrong about you.

1196
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:13,922
I think you're
a wonderful man.

1197
01:32:14,005 --> 01:32:17,551
I wish it could have been
different between us.

1198
01:32:17,635 --> 01:32:21,348
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

1199
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,684
Sorry.

1200
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:54,972
Wait a minute. That's bullshit.
It was meant to be!

1201
01:33:42,698 --> 01:33:46,327
Jesus!

1202
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,913
Shit!

1203
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,633
Oh.

1204
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:20,869
Oh, no.

1205
01:34:28,253 --> 01:34:30,798
Oh, no. Not Sammy.

1206
01:34:31,925 --> 01:34:35,680
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

1207
01:34:35,763 --> 01:34:38,016
I'm sorry.

1208
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,113
I'm sorry.

1209
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:28,703
I give up.

1210
01:35:40,425 --> 01:35:43,471
Oh, my God! mike!

1211
01:35:46,808 --> 01:35:50,020
mike? mike, where are you?

1212
01:35:50,104 --> 01:35:52,649
mike, I need you.

1213
01:36:12,923 --> 01:36:15,635
Oh. Disgusting.

1214
01:36:26,398 --> 01:36:28,526
Oh.

1215
01:36:34,075 --> 01:36:37,287
Okay. I'm coming.

1216
01:36:38,538 --> 01:36:42,084
Don't shoot. I'm not armed.

1217
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:48,926
Somebody here
call for a tow truck?

1218
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,888
Tow truck?

1219
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:59,189
- You all right, Larry?
- I'm back.

1220
01:36:59,273 --> 01:37:01,692
Son of a bitch, I'm back!

1221
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:05,404
Back from where, Larry?
You've been here the whole time.

1222
01:37:09,952 --> 01:37:15,834
- I'm really back, aren't I?
- You've always been here, Larry.

1223
01:37:15,918 --> 01:37:19,631
Sure I have,
you old destiny-bender, you.

1224
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,179
I love this guy.
He's great, isn't he?

1225
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:27,516
I just love this guy!

1226
01:37:32,397 --> 01:37:34,774
Thanks.

1227
01:37:34,857 --> 01:37:39,280
Thanks for everything-
the good and the bad.

1228
01:37:43,576 --> 01:37:46,956
Boy, you sure do know
how to make a point.

1229
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:55,717
Oh, and listen, mike. Whatever you got
planned for the rest of my life...

1230
01:37:56,843 --> 01:37:59,680
it's perfect.

1231
01:37:59,763 --> 01:38:02,559
Happy birthday, Larry.

1232
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:04,686
Thanks, mike.

1233
01:38:10,901 --> 01:38:14,114
Hey, I haven't seen you before,
have I? You the new guy?

1234
01:38:14,197 --> 01:38:16,743
What's your name? "Duncan."

1235
01:38:16,868 --> 01:38:21,749
Well, Duncan, you're gonna become real
familiar with me and this piece of sh-

1236
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:26,129
Nakamura's gonna sign the deal at 8:00.
It gives me ten minutes.

1237
01:38:26,212 --> 01:38:28,215
- Come on. Let's go. Give me a ride!
- Yeah, but I gotta hook up the car.

1238
01:38:28,299 --> 01:38:32,888
Forget about the car. We'll come back
for it later. Come on, Duncan, will ya?

1239
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:47,113
And therefore, gentlemen, it is
the recommendation of this board...

1240
01:38:47,197 --> 01:38:52,953
that we accept mr Nakamura's very
generous, very creative buyout offer...

1241
01:38:53,037 --> 01:38:55,290
of $35 a share.

1242
01:38:55,374 --> 01:38:57,752
Now, if you'll
just sign here, mr Hansen.

1243
01:39:05,094 --> 01:39:07,764
You really think
this is a good idea, Niles?

1244
01:39:07,847 --> 01:39:10,935
Without question, sir.

1245
01:39:21,614 --> 01:39:24,868
Burrows, what do you think
you're doing?

1246
01:39:27,663 --> 01:39:31,084
Sorry, Jackie.
Sorry, mr Hansen.

1247
01:39:31,167 --> 01:39:34,964
I'm just tired of assholes getting ahead
while decent people get the shaft.

1248
01:39:35,047 --> 01:39:37,676
What's this all about, Larry?

1249
01:39:37,759 --> 01:39:40,053
Niles and Lewis here have been
buying up company stock...

1250
01:39:40,137 --> 01:39:43,015
through a dummy corporation
while encouraging the board...

1251
01:39:43,098 --> 01:39:48,105
to sell out to mr Nakamura.

1252
01:39:48,147 --> 01:39:51,151
Right here. The one
with all the mud in the driveway.

1253
01:39:52,318 --> 01:39:54,612
- Hey, listen. Thanks for the lift.
- Oh, hey, it's no problem.

1254
01:39:54,696 --> 01:39:58,492
- No. I appreciate it. - I'm gonna go back
and get your car. What do you want me to do with it?

1255
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:03,916
Uh, keep it. It's yours.
I'm gonna buy a brand new one.

1256
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,836
I'll figure out
how to pay for it later.

1257
01:40:06,919 --> 01:40:09,213
Take care.

1258
01:40:15,555 --> 01:40:19,310
Oh, damn. I forgot.
Ellen's at the strike meeting.

1259
01:40:28,905 --> 01:40:31,742
Surprise!

1260
01:40:32,951 --> 01:40:36,414
Ellen!

1261
01:40:36,498 --> 01:40:39,585
- Happy 35th, Larry!
- Look at all you.

1262
01:40:39,668 --> 01:40:42,422
Oh. Oh, mom.

1263
01:40:42,506 --> 01:40:47,761
Aw, Clip! Dad! Oh, God.
I've missed all you guys so much.

1264
01:40:47,844 --> 01:40:51,182
- You have?
- Oh, Ellen.

1265
01:40:51,265 --> 01:40:55,062
I'd forgotten
how beautiful you are.

1266
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,530
Oh, wait-wait till
I tell you guys what happened.

1267
01:41:02,613 --> 01:41:05,032
- You're not gonna believe what happened.
- Oh, honey. Clip told us.

1268
01:41:05,116 --> 01:41:07,119
It's okay. We'll manage.
I'll work overtime-

1269
01:41:07,202 --> 01:41:10,540
Oh, no. Not that.
I can get a new job anywhere.

1270
01:41:10,623 --> 01:41:15,462
I just- I'm just so glad
to see everyone.

1271
01:41:15,546 --> 01:41:18,341
Sammy! Where's Sammy? Sammy!

1272
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:22,722
Sammy! Come here! Oh, Sammy!

1273
01:41:22,805 --> 01:41:27,309
I love you too, baby. Aww.

1274
01:41:27,393 --> 01:41:29,855
We'll go driving
all weekend, okay?

1275
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:32,817
All right, honey.

1276
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:37,322
- So were you really surprised?
- Oh, this whole day has been a surprise, honey.

1277
01:41:37,406 --> 01:41:41,828
- Are you hungry?
- No, but, you know, I'd like a cup of coffee.

1278
01:41:41,911 --> 01:41:44,915
Oh, honey, I forgot to buy any.
Sorry. I'll get some more tomorrow.

1279
01:41:44,999 --> 01:41:47,001
I promise.

1280
01:41:48,128 --> 01:41:51,923
Clip! Oh, God, did I miss you!

1281
01:41:52,007 --> 01:41:56,137
- You look so- so-
- Hot?

1282
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:58,348
Thank you.

1283
01:41:58,432 --> 01:42:02,020
- Happy 35th, buddy.
- Clip.

1284
01:42:02,103 --> 01:42:06,483
This is your real present. I gave you
the vomit to throw you off suspicion.

1285
01:42:06,566 --> 01:42:10,488
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah. Like a charm.

1286
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:13,325
It's a Gullwing mercedes.
Do you like it?

1287
01:42:13,408 --> 01:42:16,704
Ah, Clip, I love it.

1288
01:42:17,872 --> 01:42:20,584
I've always wanted one of these.

1289
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:24,089
- Thanks.
- Hey, hey.

1290
01:42:24,172 --> 01:42:26,800
Check out my date.

1291
01:42:26,883 --> 01:42:29,470
Is she a killer or what?

1292
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,140
Definitely a killer.

1293
01:42:33,224 --> 01:42:35,977
Yeah.

1294
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:42,361
Hi.

1295
01:42:42,444 --> 01:42:44,822
I'll have a light beer, Clip.

1296
01:42:44,905 --> 01:42:48,493
- Jackie, Cindy Jo!
- Hey, we don't wanna interrupt.

1297
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:52,832
- No. Come on in, please. Please.
- Okay. This'll just take a minute.

1298
01:42:52,915 --> 01:42:56,753
- What's up?
- Look. After you left, Niles and Lewis confessed to everything.

1299
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,089
- That was a real touchdown, Larry.
- Well-

1300
01:42:59,172 --> 01:43:02,093
You know? Listen.
We just dropped by to say thanks.

1301
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,388
I mean,
you ran out of there so fast-

1302
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:07,308
Well, I had to get home.
I-It's my birthday.

1303
01:43:07,392 --> 01:43:09,436
Well, then,
I got a little present for you.

1304
01:43:09,519 --> 01:43:13,149
The board voted unanimously
to offer you Niles Pender's job-

1305
01:43:13,232 --> 01:43:16,068
executive vice president.

1306
01:43:18,405 --> 01:43:21,993
Well- Well, Jackie,
I-I-I don't know.

1307
01:43:22,076 --> 01:43:26,248
So much has happened today. I-
I'm gonna have to give it some thought.

1308
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:29,669
- 125,000 to start and a mercedes.
- Thought's over.

1309
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:32,547
- Wonderful!
- Oh, that's just great. Thank you, Jackie.

1310
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:35,843
- Hey, you hungry? You thirsty?
- Hey. Time out.

1311
01:43:35,926 --> 01:43:39,681
- Yeah.
- Hi, Larry.

1312
01:43:39,765 --> 01:43:42,727
Hi, Cindy Jo.

1313
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:45,521
I wish I'd known it was your birthday.
I would've gotten you something.

1314
01:43:47,024 --> 01:43:50,861
Well, Cindy Jo,
you've-you've already given me more...

1315
01:43:50,944 --> 01:43:54,491
than you could
possibly know, really.

1316
01:43:54,574 --> 01:43:56,994
Well, happy birthday, Larry.

1317
01:43:57,078 --> 01:43:59,081
Thanks.

1318
01:44:07,799 --> 01:44:10,010
Well, that's it.

1319
01:44:10,094 --> 01:44:12,389
That was my 35th birthday.

1320
01:44:12,472 --> 01:44:14,474
I told you it was weird.

1321
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:17,435
It's so weird, I probably
shouldn't tell anybody about it.

1322
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:20,022
I mean, who'd believe me?

1323
01:44:20,106 --> 01:44:22,859
I'm not even sure
I believe it myself.

1324
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,621
Way to go, Burrows!

1325
01:44:47,389 --> 01:44:51,645
Saw the game, kid.

1326
01:44:51,729 --> 01:44:55,232
- Tough break.
- You said it, mister.

1327
01:44:56,442 --> 01:45:00,488
- I blew it good.
- Don't worry too much about it.

1328
01:45:00,572 --> 01:45:04,953
Remember, you've got your whole life
to look forward to.

1329
01:45:05,036 --> 01:45:08,498
Things will work out just fine.

1330
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,754
Trust me.

1331
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,891
Old fart.
What the hell does he know?

1332
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:31,527
<i>Only you</i>

1333
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:37,200
<i>Can make a-this world seem right</i>

1334
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:43,666

1337
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:02,147
<i>Can thrill me like you do</i>

1338
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:07,947
<i>And fill my heart with love</i>

1339
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:13,787
<i>For only you</i>

1340
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:19,669
<i>Only you</i>

1341
01:46:19,752 --> 01:46:24,801
<i>Can make a-this change in me</i>

1342
01:46:26,136 --> 01:46:31,267
<i>For it's true</i>

1343
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:37,942
<i>You are my destiny</i>

1344
01:46:38,067 --> 01:46:45,033
<i>When you hold my hand
I understand</i>
