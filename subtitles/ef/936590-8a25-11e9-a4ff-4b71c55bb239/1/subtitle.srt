00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,100


3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,600


4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,766


5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,932


6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:25,099


7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,300


8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,200
Many years ago in Thailand

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,133
there is a temple that was called the temple of the Golden Buddha.

10
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:44,133
And there was a huge statue of the Golden Buddha.

11
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:47,299


12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,133
And word came to his village where the
 monastery was

13
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:59,999
that an army from neighboring country 
was about to invade.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,800
And they've got the brilliant scheme to cover the
 Golden Buddha which is quite large with

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,100
mud and concrete so better look basicly 
like a stone Buddha and the army would

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,100
perceive no value in it.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,700


18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,966
Sure enough this army rolled in with its ... arms and weapons

19
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,799
and as they passed by the monastery the
y saw nothing but a big stone Buddha

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,800
and they have no reason to plunder it

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,233


22
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:41,799
Well years went by because the army 
continued to occupy

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,733
until there was a time in the monestary and the village when no one remembered

24
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:51,033
that the Buddha was golden until one day a
 young monk was sitting on the Buddha

25
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,399
meditating on his knee

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,466
and as he got up a little piece of concrete

27
00:01:55,466 --> 00:02:01,032
happened to crack off and he saw something 
shiny. He realized there was gold under

28
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:01,399
there

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,100
and so he ran to his fellow monks and said 
"The Buddha is golden, the Buddha is golden", 

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,966
and they all came out and realized he is telling the 
truth

31
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,932
they took the pics and harass. And
 eventually they unearthed

32
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:17,933
the Golden Buddha.

33
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:23,466


34
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:28,132
So what's a metaphor here? The
 metaphor is that each of us is golden by

35
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,999
nature were born golden

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,466
we were born high, we were born knowing, were born 
connected to our bliss, were born knowing

37
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:38,066
truth, we were born knowing everything that every 
great spiritual master has ever said,

38
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,099
we were one with the Christ, the Buddha, everyone

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,566
but then we went to school and they said you had to be just like this,

40
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,832
 and they said these are sweat boys and sweat girls, white people and black people and on and on and on,

41
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,966
and so we developed the casing of stone 
over the Buddha

42
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:55,699
to ... at a young age, maybe four or 
five six or seven,

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,133
we believe that we are the stone Buddha, not the Golden one.

44
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:03,699
And then, something comes along that 
cracks that casing,

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,100
maybe it's an injury, a divorce, 
financial setbacks, our governmental change,

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,366
something that really scares us and bugs us (??HÍ)

47
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:14,432
and knocks off a piece of our armour,

48
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:18,899
and all in that moment that the armour is being 
knocked off, they get a look inside

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,200
and see the golden.
Let me tell you 
friend, that the moment you see that gold

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,333
the armour and the concrete will never 
satisfy you again.
At that point you truly

51
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,266
enter to the true heroe's adventure

52
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,666
an all you want to do for the rest of
 your life is pick away the stone because

53
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:39,666
the gold is so much more fun.

Who is Joseph Campbell and why
 should we care?
(Robert Walter - President: Joseph Campbell Foundation)

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,700
A topic that comes up a lot.

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,366


60
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:24,832
Joseph Campbell was one of the leading 
mythology experts of all time

61
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:30,866
Joseph Campbell is a philosopher. The
 man who had this ability to see the

62
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:31,499
truth

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,500
in a world where we've lost sight of
 that in many ways.

64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700


65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,333
He has studied all of these classical myth 
traditions
(Brian Johnson Philosopher/Entrepreneur, entheos.com)

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,166
and actually started by studying

67
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:49,032
Native American mythology. He fell in 
love with it when he was a kid.

68
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:52,933
This was his bliss. He went on 
studying the aboriginal cultures

69
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:59,466
he studied Greek mythology, he studied 
Arthurian legend,

70
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,099
He dissected and really diagrammed

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,266
all of our stories.

72
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,599
He compared

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,733
philosophies, mythic stories

74
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:18,666
of the whole world.
All myths, all movies all novels, 
all romances

75
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,399
He found this one story within
(Chungling Al Huang, Founder-President: Living Tao Foundation / Tai Ji Master)

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,266
all the stories, that we can relate to, no 
matter where you come from.

77
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:32,399
He recognized that in spite of all the 
different stories we seem to be telling,

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,466
there is really only one. 
And He called it the Hero's Journey.

79
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:40,732


80
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,333
There must have been thousands and 
thousands of hero's stories
(Gay Hendricks Ph.D., best selling author, The Hendricks Institute)

81
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,499
from every culture, but until Joseph Campbell
 came along

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,633
certainly I never realized how they all
 kind of fit together and how they were

83
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,299
basically the same story.

84
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,200
I was religion major in college. I was 
taking my final exam.
(Rashida Jones - Actress/Screenwriter)

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,233
I had a moment where I've just gobsmacked.

86
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:05,533
It was just like

87
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:09,499
holy crap, it's all the same thing. I mean it
 is really

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,833
all the same thing.

89
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,633


90
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:20,766
The hero's journey is a pattern. You can 
almost think of it as an algorythm,

91
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:24,499
that has three basic parts:

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,766
separation, initiation and return.

93
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:31,899
Separation: you are in one kind of a 
reality

94
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,000
in one kind of a place and you are separated
 from it.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,033
Initiation: you're put into another 
place, where you are in some manner

96
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,266
initiated.

97
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,599
Return: you come back.

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,166


99
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,132
A SIMPLE VERSION OF THE HERO'S JOURNEY

100
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:56,999
 is, someone starting out in their normal
 protected world
(Catherine Hardwicke, Director of "Twilight")

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,933
and then getting a call to adventure.A call to adventure.

102
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:05,133
There's a vision, there's a quest.
(Deepak Chopra M.D.)

103
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,966
It's the story of the hero enduring some trials,
(David L. Miller Ph.D.)

104
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:12,599
various trials and ordeals,
meeting different obstacles along the
 way.
People that hurt you.

105
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,266
People that help you.
Doors will open as 
Campbell would say

106
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:20,099
for you where there are no doors 
for others.
Dragons will appear that are your

107
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,533
your dragons alone.

108
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,399
you get to like ??? /meet?? the innermost cave where
 you're really challenged,

109
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,233
like the greatest crisis, in which you find your 
true self.

110
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:33,066
The achievement, the glory.
But then 
that's not the end of it,

111
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,066
that he has to bring that back to the 
community,

112
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,999
there's a return to tell the story.
That is 
a heroic journey.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,033
Separation, initiation, return. 
All of the 
adventures of the human story are in there.

114
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:45,799


115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,766
All the heroes, all villains, all the gods and
 goddesses and all of the nights and of all

116
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:55,432
the fantastic creatures we can conjure 
up in animation, they're all in there,

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,299
Because they're all in here in the heart,

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,733
because they're all in here in the head.
This is 
where they come from.

119
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:02,533
If you look at some of the greatest
 pieces of literature
(Robin Sharma, best selling author, Sharma Leadership International)

120
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,699
the greatest works of philosophy, they 
all have what

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,533
Joseph Campbell called The Hero's Journey.
And
 if you look with a piercing eye

122
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,733
you can recognize his outline in just about 
any move your story you would read.

123
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,233
Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter.

124
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:21,933
Wizard 
of Oz: that's a classic story of the hero's journey. 
You first see Dorothy

125
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:26,499
and our natural environment and just 
like out here in regular life

126
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,366
a person is operating in their natural
 environment every day

127
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,599
and living in their house and that kind of thing.

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,766
And then something happens to shake 
that world up,

129
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:43,766
And you go on a journey in which you have to
 face certain tests and challenges

130
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:55,132


131
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,599
Storytelling is typically about 
people

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,466
learning something.

133
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:08,766
You go to a place which is dark and 
mysterious,

134
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:12,199


135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,933
you are faced with yourself

136
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,899
there is a relationship between facing fear

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,400
and this kind of soul game.

138
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,200
You acquire a quality, a hidden strength, a value,

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,233
moments where somebody is tested

140
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,766
somebody moves to a place where

141
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:40,266
it feels like a crisis point and then
 they are

142
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:43,899
restored, redeemed, made better

143
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
through that trial.
And we call them heros.

144
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,600


145
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,600


146
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,933


147
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,899
If all of these stories boiled down into one map, ???

148
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,700
we can use that map, because all
 human beings are the same ???

149
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,666
whether they're going through

150
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,632
a war like World War II or going to a 
war inside ???

151
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:23,233
it's basically the same kind of 
process. ???

152
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:27,733
In other words we're not separate from the characters
 we see
in our movies and our novels,

153
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:33,799
they are us, this one journey.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,600


155
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,533


156
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,733
The whole idea of the hero's journey is a journey of
 life,

00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:53,233
clear patterns to guide you through. ]]]

We're all born, we die but within this short

 reason for this existence. ]]]

00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:43,866
and still go through the very similar pattern

172
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,132


173
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,133
We've grown up watching great heros' journey movie,

174
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,299
it's that impulse within us

175
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,400
that seed of potential that wants to be 
actualized.

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,266
It's being talked to during those movies 
and being whispered to: ]]]

177
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,166
"It's time for you to do that!"

178
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,232
That's the story here, that's what it's 
all about.

179
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:11,866
It is a wonderful narrative, iconography for how to live life.

180
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:15,532
The idea that "Try hard, you get", the little 
engine that "I could, I think I can,

181
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:19,499
I think can, I think I think I can, I CAN!"

182
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,533
This idea that we really can do 
better, be better

183
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:28,099
that our greatest selves are still hidden and 
that the future is the prospect

184
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:35,033
of coming to terms with that self.

185
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,933
Dorothy had to confront her inner
 barriers

186
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:42,499
and so the journey she went on was not
 just a journey to

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,566
find out how to deal with the Wicked 
Witch of the West, ]]]

188
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,499
it was how to deal with her own inner resources
,
how to claim her own inner resources ]]]

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,800
and at the end of the 
movie how did she get back home?

190
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,500
Well, she cicked her heels together, so she
 had it all the time,

191
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,300
the ability to get back home but it 
didn't get mobilized for her

192
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,300
until she went through all of those 
challenges and was able to kind of test herself.

193
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,666


194
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,532
It's kind of the ordinary moving into the
 extraordinary.

195
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:19,366
Its going through the dark to come out
 to the light.

196
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,799
Going from an

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,766
unsatisfying life to

198
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,232
a satisfying life

199
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,899
by pushing through

200
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,566
the scariest things you can imagine.

201
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:42,166
"The funcion of mythological symbols is to give you a sense of
Aha! Yes. I know what it is, it's myself" - Joseph Campbell

202
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:49,166


203
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,666


204
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:56,066
The most important thing that the myths teach us

205
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,566
is to go beyond

206
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,732
what we perceive as

207
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,299
the limits of our possibility.

208
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,733
So mythology

209
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,266
needs to be seen for what it is which is: ]]]

210
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,132
which is 
a metaphor for our human existence.

211
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:18,499
It's not a history lesson. It's a
metaphor for life

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,366
and for universal experiences.
Lot of 
people reading myths and they say

213
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,432
it refers to something historical:

214
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:29,499
the creation of the world or something like. But Joe didn't think that.

215
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,000
He thought that it's really a narrative
 about the psyche. 

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,133
What Jung called the self.

217
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:44,133
The problem is that many of us
 are metaphorically impaired.

218
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,633


219
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:49,999
We don't realize that this thing that
 they're talking about is actually a

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,833
metaphor

221
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:57,599
for a transformation process.

222
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,100
Just kind of 
like the Holy Grail, where it's not the thing, 
]]]]

223
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,200
it's not the 
actual concrete Grail, it's an intangible thing,

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,233
that the Holy Grail is a metaphor for that in
tangible (???) feeling.

225
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:13,333
And so if you look at a book and it says 
you will go to heaven,

226
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,966
and you don't realize that they're
 talking about heaven on Earth,

227
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,832
heaven in our bodies, heaven right now, in the now,  ]]]

228
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:23,499
you might fall into a trance of 
thinking that you're literally gonna go

229
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
some place else if you follow the rules.

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,500


231
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,066
Having been brought up in a mythical 
culture,

232
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,466
I was very familiar with the different
 motives,

233
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:42,032
and themes that were encapsulated

234
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:45,466
in say a mythical being.

235
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:49,632
Whether it was the Lord Shiva or Ganesh,

236
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,933
or a goddess,

237
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:56,399
just thinking the name of that person, the whole story was evoked.

238
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
Carl Jung called these archetypes.

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,600
Archetypes of primordial,

240
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,333
encapsulated stories or

241
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,699
mythologies and they are there

242
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,966
in this form of a seed in consciousness.

243
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:20,432
When you plant that seed in consciousness, 
that archetypal seed, 

244
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:24,399
that mythical journey,

245
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,700
in there the seed starts to sprout and as it sprouts,

246
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,733
the patterning forces create situation, circumstances, 

247
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:36,466
events and relationships for the unfolding
 of the story.

248
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,899


249
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,433
It's better to have a story to look
 through life ]]]

250
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,599
than an explanation. ]]]

251
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,700
The reason for
 that is the story is richer.

252
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,833


253
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,166
I say select two or three heros and heroins

254
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,166
either in mythology
 or religion

255
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:01,132
or history and then ask these

256
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:05,299
mythical beings to incarnate through you.

257
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,700
And then don't be surprised when you see
 situations ,circumstances,

258
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,766
coincidences, synchronicities, 
relationships

259
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,199
sure suddenly show up,

260
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,966
that actually are part of the story that you 
have been seeking to express.

261
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:29,599


262
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,966
Once upon a time in the forest there was 
this little tiger cub

263
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,466
amongst the flock sheep.

264
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,032


265
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,066
And he ate grass,

266
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:47,066
and he wondered around with the sheep,

267
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,766


268
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,232
and when he tried to say anything all 
that came out was a certain a little meow.

269
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,999
Not much of a roar.

270
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,533


271
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:03,099
And one day through the forest comes a 
large male tiger

272
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,466


273
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:07,332


274
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,666
And he is just about to pounce on the sheep when he sees this tiger cub.

275
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,632
He says, what are you doing here?

276
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,566
And the tiger cub goes, beeee.

277
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,266
He picks the tiger cub up by the s??? of the neck,

278
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,166
and carries him over to pond and 
he puts his face over and he says: ]]]

279
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,866
"Look, see that face?  ]]]

280
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:30,099
You're not a sheep, you're a tiger!" ]]]

281
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,100
The male tiger says, okay, we need to do 
something.

282
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,966
He slays a sheep and he grabs a big runk ??? of meet,

283
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:48,966
and he shoves it into the little tiger's mouth.

284
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:49,699


285
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,700
And the little tiger gagged on it as all do on the truth. ]]]

286
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,800
But it went down. ]]]

287
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,033
And he got a little bit of energy, and pretty soon, ]]]

288
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:06,266
he had a bigger tiger roar.

289
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:13,332
And eventually he had a full Tiger roar and he went off with the male tiger.

290
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,999
I think the moral here is self-evident: 

if you're a tiger living among sheep

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,500
you' rea a really poor specimen of a tiger
.

292
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,200
And we are all Tigers living among sheep.

293
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,700
We are all individuals with a self

294
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,400
that we don't even begin to understand
and.
And unfortunately, when you can open

295
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,333
the metaphor out,

296
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,599
the food we get from the culture around us is maybe food for sheep.

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,366
It's not food for Tigers.

298
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:50,366


299
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,099


300
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,033


301
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,399


302
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,400
"Your life is the fruit of your own doing.

303
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,533
You have no one to blame but yourself" - Joseph Campbell

304
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,766
We have to catch at least the spark

305
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:09,999
of what your life is going to be

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,233
or you may spend those dreary decades

307
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:18,066
in corporate America, climbing 
the ladder only to discover its against

308
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,632
the wrong wall.

309
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:23,299
You get to the top, who cares?

310
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,766
If this path of the hero's journey is 
fairly simple in design,

311
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:34,766
why then isn't it that everybody is a living
 it?

312
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,332


313
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,833
Well the answer is that most people on
 the planet live under a kind of a

314
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,233
mass hypnosis.

315
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:49,233


316
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,199


317
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,733
There's a tremendous pressure even in 
the media

318
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,866
on really keeping people in their place

319
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,799
in the sense of keeping them happy, 
tranced out consumers.

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,333


321
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,299
It's a trance of comfort, it's a 
trance of

322
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,133
not sticking your hand up above 
the crowd very much.

323
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,566
That keeps the enterprise going.

324
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:19,732
Most people

325
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:23,566
think it's a luxury and a great privilege

326
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:28,799
to stay home and look at their 800 inch 
television

327
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,366
you're just spaced out, not developoing.

328
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:36,966
We're stimulated by some images, by some loud noise.

329
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,466
It's about collecting things and stuff,

330
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:41,399
and making a lot of money and doing a lot of
 things and it's

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,666
impossible to enjoy that because you end up on that treadmill

332
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,566
and you can't get off.

333
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,599
And so most people, unfortunately, because
 they are

334
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,200
so victimized by the environment, they 
have no time to think,

335
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,633
or be themselves, they become bundles 
of conditioned reflexes

336
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:06,066
and nerves that are constantly being 
triggered by people and circumstance,

337
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:10,299
into very predictable outcomes and
 predictable patterns of behavior, ]]]

338
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
there's no creativity

339
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,400


340
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,466
That's the trance, that's the wasteland, 
where we're just guided toward this

341
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:24,799
weird sense of what's real on our 
lives,

342
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,000
and those ideas that are imposed on us
 from the outside

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,066
about what we should and should not do.

344
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,899
It usually starts out with something like 
you shouldn't talk to that person

345
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,833
because they're from a different tribe,

346

you certainly shouldn't marry that 
person ]]]

you should go to this school,

you should have a certain type of car
, you should live in a certain type of house,

you should have a certain number of 
kids by this type age,

the degree from this university, I 
gotta have this advanced degree from this

University preferably either

a law degree or a medical degree or 
something to that effect

some letters after my name which would
 say that I have a stamp of credibility

I can go out and make my 
six figures in society, ??? kind of deem me worthy ]]]

357
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:17,399
I have countless
 examples of young people who

358
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,300
go to college because they are expected to 
go to college

361
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,200
It's very difficult for a 
person who was brought up in this

362
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,666
environment of instant gratification with
 the media

363
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,966
and with advertising with all the promises

364
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:41,699
of instant gratification by

365
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,166
buying something, for example, or having
 a certain

it's their unique good ways of expressing 
themselves,

is their soul / song ???, which if they think,  ]]]

372

they
 could do anything.

00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:21,033


374
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:25,633
If you look at every heroic journey, the hero
 has been confronted with the fact that

375
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:31,699
the world that they thought was reality
 was nothing more than illusion.

376
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,900
I go back to The Matrix... what 
was the matrix?

377
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,366
It was just this big illusion, it 
was the dominant values and beliefs

378
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:44,299
that the world had put around this guy
 Neo, the seeker on the hero's journey,

379
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,300
and what did he do? He felt this longing 
to go beyond the illusion, to go beyond

380
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
the matrix,

381
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,433
So he took the red pill, and he woke up to
 reality.

382
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,833
And what was reality? Reality was he was full of 
potential.

383
00:24:56,833 --> 00:25:02,499


384
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,500
"The call to adventure

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,733

387
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:14,099
Separation begins with what we call "The 
call to adventure".

388
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,766
Campbell tells us there's literally 
almost a phone ringing. ]]]

389
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,332
It's like the universe,

00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:25,299
the divine, god, whatever you want to call
 it, literally dialing you up and ringing ]]]

391
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,866
and giving you a call

392
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:33,332
asking you to step out into what is your 
journey. ]]]

393
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,799
Something breaks into the ???? reality

394
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,400
and makes it impossible for you to continue.

395
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,066
Well, you can hang up the phone, you can 
run away.
But he'll ??? keep coming back,

396
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:46,766
it will keep coming back until you finally

397
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:53,099
answer the call.

398
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,100


399
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,466


400
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,966
If you're not paying attention, the wake 
up calls come in the form of a

401
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:04,766
sledge hammer.

402
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:11,766
You know if you're paying attention, they 
might come in a tical ??? feather.

403
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:15,366
So we don't always get the call as a
 choir of angels

404
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,732
with trumpets singing ??? to his??? beautifully 
warm sunny morning.

405
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:22,499
In Star Wars, Luke comes back as his house has been burnt down. 

406
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,366
He's gotta go.

407
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:31,599
Often times it comes in ??? the depth of our
 despair

408
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,500
in losing a job, getting fired, 
getting divorced,

409
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,266
having your house foreclosed on... These 
things that you would never

410
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:44,399
want to have happen are ??? often the 
exact things we need

411
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,700
to catapult us, to catalyse us into that next version of ourselves. ]]]

412
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,800
Bad
 things happen to good people

413
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,966
and when that happens to them they typically are

414
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:58,432
thrown for a loop ??? because they

415
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:02,799
frequently have felt everything's going along, 
I'm doing everything right, what happened..

416
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,133


417
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:07,699
Well, you know, the universe has just up ended you 
and it does do that.

418
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,266
The Chinese symbol for crises is too

419
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,399
symbols.

420
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,566
The first one is danger and the second one immediately is opportunity.

421
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,966
So crisis both enjoy an
opportunity

422
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:25,466
This idea that if one storyline

423
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:29,266
collapses that that's the end of the 
movie is

424
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:32,399
not true in human life and never was true in human life.

425
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,600
I know people who have prospered in the most
 extraordinary way

426
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,300
in the worst type of adversity, but actually it revealed something to them about

427
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,766
themselves that they didn't know

428
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:45,266
and that became the new journey they 
took.
Let me put this into really

429
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:49,999
practical hundred-pound terms because if
 the camera had been pointed

430
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
at me when I was 24 years old what it
 would have seen was a person who weighed

431
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,466
320 pounds

432
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,766
you would have seen me puffing on two or three 
packs of Marlboros a day,

433
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:02,599
a relationship that I didn't want to be in 
and I had a job I hated,

434
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,766
everything was wrong in my life and so

435
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:09,299
those are ripe moment for a wake-up call
 in life.

436
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,100
You know, if you haven't been paying 
attention enough so that you end up with

437
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
a job you hate,

438
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,833
a relationship you don't want to be in, a a
body you don't like,

439
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,066
and you're addicted to a bunch of things, 
you're ripe

440
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,132
for a sledgehammer blow from the 
universe and I got it.

441
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:27,866
You step over a threshold, meaning you 
move from one world into another,

442
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:31,799
sometimes you're shoved from one world 
into the other.

443
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,500
I went out for a walk and I stepped on
 the ice

444
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,066
on the road and my feet shot out from under 
me and I smacked my back of my head

445
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:45,132
on the ground, frozen ground, and it 
knocked me out just enough I wasn't

446
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,866
completely unconscious but I had a
 vision

447
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:52,766
while I was semi-knocked out, I could
 see down through all the layers of myself 

448
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,199
to this pure consciousness inside

449
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,966
and I could see how all the fat I 
had was organized around a whole ]]]

450
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:00,299
bunch of feelings I didn't want to let myself
 feel,   ]]]

451
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,666
like sadness from childhood  ]]]

452
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:08,766
and lot of old grief in 
my family and anger and things like that

453
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:12,099
and I realized that the fat was there to
 keep me from

454
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,966
feeling those feelings and so as I began
 to come back to normal consciousness

455
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,999
I made a vow that I was gonna change my
 life

456
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,566
so that I could live in that state of 
pure consciousness instead of having to

457
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:24,432
have all of that

458
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:28,799
armour around me.

459
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,433
Once you make the decisions that Joseph 
Campbell is talking about,

460
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:37,766
about really hearing the call and being 
willing to take on the challenges

461
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:42,132
of that new awakened life, once you do 
that you begin to feel a power ]]]

462
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,899
that it's like nothing else I have ever experienced.

463
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,700
And I think a lot of us are just plain very afraid of that. ????? ]]]

464
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:55,700


465
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,800


466
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,466
I tend to think that people wake up to 
the fact ]]]

467
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,199
that they're the hero of their own life

468
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,800
when they get tired of being the victim of their own life.

469
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,366
At the point that you

470
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:16,366
say "Enough", "I know", "I don't want to 
listen to my parents anymore"

471
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:17,199


472
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,266
"I have had it with my boss", "I'm really
 having problems perhaps

473
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:26,366
the sermon I'm being taught", you can 
either surrender to victimhood

474
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:31,232
and a lot of people do, ]]]

475
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,533
or you can 
surrender to a fundamentalism: you can basically give

476
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:36,799
your responsibility to someone else and 
say "Tell me what to do and I'll do it"

477
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,700
or you can say "I have a choice here and
 I'm responsible"

478
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,366
Now, what does it mean to be the hero of your own life? It means to be

479
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:51,366
responsible for your own adventure.

480
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:52,832


481
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:56,799
Campbell talks about metaphorical death
, where something dies ]]]

482
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,200
so the something can live

483
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,233
and in every hero's journey there is ]]]

484
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:05,033
some death-
moment where some old has to go on some new has to 
stay.

485
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,099
He quotes Nietzsche and he says that "The snake

487
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,866


488
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:26,899
When death is a motif in a myth

489
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,500
it doesn't refer necessarily

490
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,700
to what happens at the end of one's
 biological

491
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,900
and physical existence.

492
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:45,900
It's an indication that change has taken place.

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,566


494
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:50,999
I went through that process when I stop
ped being
[Joseph Marshall III, best selling author]

495
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,433
a travel administrator and started
 becoming a writer

496
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:58,533
I put that aspect of myself away, it was 
valuable

497
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,799
and I learned a lot and I draw on it, 
but it enabled me to go on. ]]]

498
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,600
No death, no life. No death, no transformation. 

499
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,066
No death, no change.

500
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:17,066
Than I said, okay, I don't want that anymore, I 
want this, put that away

501
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:22,999
made myself into something else. In 
essence, resurrected into being a writer.

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,033


503
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:32,399
The whole key to a blessing death is 
recognizing that it is just the death

504
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,300
of one old form that has played itself out and has no use anymore,

505
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,266
which always, as the Phoenix, rises

506
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:48,266
and gives way to some new form that has new
 intrinsic meaning and makes your life even bigger and better.

507
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,532


508
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:55,666
You want have new birth, new revelations

509
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:59,399
new insight into life as you grow as a
 human being.

510
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,700
You will learn to keep dying.

511
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,700


512
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:36,066
"We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned,
so as to have the life that is waiting for us" - Joseph Campbell

513
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:36,832
I think

514
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,933
its tricky

515
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:45,199
to afford a proof.

516
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,733
I think there are proofs in our
 lives

517
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:55,333
I think the proofs exist in our ability
 to transcend

518
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,933
the worst things that have happened to 
us.

519
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:03,999
My proof is I was abused as a little
 boy

520
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,266
not something I chat about typically but in this context,

521
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:10,399
it was the worst thing ever.

522
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,200
It went on for a very long time and... 


523
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,766


524
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:18,999


525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,933


526
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:28,033
It's who I am, in part, because I had to face that,

527
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:32,699
Because I had to wrestle with that,

528
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,800
because I had to accept that and acknowledge that and

529
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,966
forgive and all the terribly 
difficult things

530
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:45,499
that come with that.
I had to tell my 
parents... you know it's this...

531
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,100
and by the way it's one of the 
things that you work with

532
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,700
for the rest of your life. 
But from that
 most difficult thing

533
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,333
also came a kind of

534
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,766
understanding

535
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:09,732
I get high marks on compassion.

536
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:15,333
I wouldn't wish it on anybody...

537
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:19,399
But it is part of what made me me.

538
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,966
So the truth is

539
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:29,966
it's not what happens to us,
 it's what we 
do with it.

540
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:34,366


541
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,899


542
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,266
The forest represents the darkness,  the unknown, the edge of your world.

543
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,766
And it takes the courage of a 
hero

544
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:51,299
to go into that forest.

545
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,633
The people in your community don't 
understand

546
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:56,999
why you want to go into that forest.

547
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,400
In fact, they are pulling you back, asking 
"Why 
can't you be happy with what you have here?"

548
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,066


549
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,999
But there is this urge that exist within 
the hero to "Go and explore!"

550
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,266
Joseph often used the Knights of the Round Table.

551
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,866
When they behold golden chalice.

552
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:15,032
There's a story with King 
Arthur,

553
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:21,299
and his knights.

554
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,266
After the Knights have seen the grail and 
decide to go forward on a quest

555
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,732
the made a vow.

556
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:34,233
They decided the knightly thing to do, the 
noble thing to do as individuals

557
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,266
seeking their own inner collective, was 
to go in

558
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:42,499
to the force at their own points.

559
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Each knight enters the forest where it was 
darkest and there was no path.

560
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,033


561
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,433
They cannot follow other people. They 
have to go in, find their own entry into the dark forest. ]]]

562
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:56,433
Campbell makes it really clear:

563
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:57,933
If you go into the forest

564
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:04,933
where there's already a trail, that's the 
one sure sign that you're not on your path.

565
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:05,899


566
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,100
Because if you follow somebody else's 
entry, it's somebody else's path.

567
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,566
That's not going into the forest. That's 
not initiation.

568
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,399
You need to find your own path and that

569
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,033
kind of comes from that impulse within, to
 go out and really

570
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:24,633
discover who you are, beyond just the narrow
 confines of how you have been conditioned

571
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:25,999
what you have been told to do,

572
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,166
and go out and explore for yourself 
which is true if it is and how you can

573
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:36,166
go out and rock it.

574
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:36,766


575
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:40,866


576
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:45,299


577
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,133
"Follow your bliss" - Joseph Campbell

578
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:53,866


579
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:57,532
The hero's journey for me is having the
 courage to look within yourself and say

580
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,599
"What am I here to do?"

581
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,966
"What am I most passionate about in my 
life?"
"What are my greatest gifts?"

582
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:03,099
"How do I give them to the world?"

583
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,566
Joseph Campbell captured it with the 
phrase "Follow Your Bliss"

584
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:14,066


585
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:18,132
"Follow Your Bliss" - I don't think more profound teachings
 have ever been given than this one.

586
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:21,533
"Follow your bliss" means listening to 
your heart

587
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,333
and following your truth.

588
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:27,099
Just to be specific about the word "bliss", it's not ecstasy,

589
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,666
it's not happiness. There's a serenity 
in bliss.

590
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:37,532
I like to talk about your bliss as "the 
thing you can't not do".

591
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:42,166
So it's your authentic journey. I'd heard "
follow your bliss" but didn't know 

592
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,132
where it came from

593
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:46,166
and what's cool is that it's grounded in

594
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,899
deep 
Hindu spirituality and philosophy and it comes
 from the Upanishads.

595
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,666
There were three launching points into enlightenment:

596
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,932
sat, chit and ananda.

597
00:38:56,933 --> 00:39:00,799
So sat means beingness,

598
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,000
chit means consciousness and ananda means bliss or rapture.

599
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,566
Joseph Campbell said to himself "I don't
really know what my beingness is,

600
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:13,132
if I'm honest with myself, I don't really 
know what my consciousness is,

601
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,799
but I do know what my bliss is and I can 
follow my bliss."

602
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,900
And that idea of trusting ourselves and 
trusting that deep impulse within us

603
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,466
to go out and follow our bliss, do what 
makes us feel most alive:

604
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:28,499
that's the path, that's the key, that's
 the essence of the hero's journey.

605
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,966


606
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:36,466


607
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:39,266
"Follow your bliss" does not mean: get 
addicted to pleasure.

608
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:44,399
It's more than just something

609
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,666
you wish for. It doesn't mean escapism, it
 doesn't mean hedonism.
[Lynne Kaufman, award winning playwright.]

610
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:55,666
It doesn't mean selfishness.

611
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,732


612
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:01,766
It doesn't mean listening only to 
sensory pleasures

613
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,166
like having sex with anybody you look at or

614
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,799
sticking up a candy store if you want 
candy...

615
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,866


616
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,199
Don't follow what other people think is your bliss!

617
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,566
Don't follow your wallet!

618
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:21,899
Follow the thing that's presenting 
itself

619
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,933
as your most serene and fulfilling state.

620
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:30,866
Sometimes 
it's difficult to let go of that

621
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:35,532
inner resistor and just say "Okay, I accept 
the possibilities of the present,

622
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,666
I will follow my bliss, I will listen to 
the call of spirit"

623
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:43,332
Huhhh, that's a very big deal!

624
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:49,633


625
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,433


626
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:55,066
Daddy said "What do you wanna do" I said "
I need to leave school.

627
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:58,999
I'm never gonna learn anything. I'm not 
going to University. 

628
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,966
I want to 
play drums." I learned to play drums in the attic and
[Mick Fleetwood, founder: Fleetwood Mac]

629
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:09,532
That's my world and totally naive, like sshhhss...

630
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,766
So Dad sends me off to 
London.

631
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:17,199
With the drum kit. So I went to London,

632
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,900
and all of it came true.

633
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,600
Of course, I'm not saying I gotta be rich, I gotta be famous,

634
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,766
but I have to be doing something I love
 to do! And I have so much passion!

635
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:34,532
And I didn't even know what that was 
really all about.

636
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:41,066
But I do now.

637
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:48,066


638
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,066


639
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:54,832
How do we find our bliss? This is what
 everybody is asking.

640
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:58,099


641
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,833
The first thing is, ask yourself, "Where am I 
passionate about?

642
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,866
What are the things I love doing?

643
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:06,599
What are the activities, when I engage 
them,

644
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,133
it feels like hours go by in minutes?

645
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:13,599
That's one big clue about what your bliss is.

646
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,366
What I say is, find out what you most love to do!

647
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:23,366
And then do more of that thing.

648
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:24,499


649
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,866
Ask yourself right now: What was it that 
made me

650
00:42:27,866 --> 00:42:32,099
different as a child? What set me apart? What caused me to cry at night on my pillow

651
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,766
cause I didn't

652
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:36,166
fit in within the crowd? That is 
probably

653
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:39,899
precisely where the door to your bliss 
is going to open.

654
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Go back and find it.

655
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,466


656
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,432
Let's say you never had to think about
 money,

657
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:57,166
and you never had to think about dying.

658
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,032
With all the money in the world and all the time in the world

659
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:02,033
how would you express yourself and how 
would that benefit

660
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:05,566
the ecosystem, the larger web of being?

661
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:08,266
We have to find a

662
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:11,832
a way of reflecting on those experiences

663
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:16,899
that we've had that engaged us in 
where we became lost and totally absorbed in them.

664
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,366
So for some people a way to that might be to write these things down,

665
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:24,499
others don't think like that, they don't like to use words all the time, 

666
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,600
so maybe collect some images or cut some images from magazines, 

667
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,000
collect music that's always inspired you. But 
some way to

668
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,033
bypass that apt of barrier to your own sense of energy.

669
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:36,833
It's not about 
being successful,

670
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:40,799
it's not about feeding a family. Write 
some bad poetry,

671
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,166
do something that gives you that Moment.

672
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:47,166
You can write in a journal,

673
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,899
because writing a journal is a conversation you 
have with yourself.

674
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,033
You can get to know your gifts, your talents,

675
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:59,033
your weaknesses, your hopes, your dreams, 
your lessons.

676
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:06,999


677
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,033
Joseph Campbell always gave the same 
advice to his students 

678
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:11,799
graduating Sarah Lawrence.

679
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,266
Don't do what Daddy/Mommy says!

680
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:20,599
Because Daddy/Mommy 
has one interest in mind for you, and that's your 
security. 

681
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,633
And if you bargain away your life for security now, 
you will never find your bliss!

682
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:29,466


683
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,899
I started skating because my older 
brother was into it.
[Tony Hawk, professional skateboarder]

684
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,166
And I enjoyed it but

685
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:36,432
I didn't take it that seriously until the
 first time into a skatepark

686
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:43,433
and I saw these guys literally flying 
out of empty swimming pools.

687
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,033


688
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:49,799
I got so excited that that was even possible as 
a person 

689
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,133
to be flying in the air

690
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:53,933
with a skateboard in your hand. Once I saw 
what was possible

691
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:58,399
and what you could do with this 
thing that I would have come to enjoy

692
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,000
I had to keep going, I mean, I just want to fly.

693
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000


694
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,200


695
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,433
I think is really important to do things 
that make you happy and I know that

696
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,966
sounds very obvious and

697
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:25,332
you know, some reviewed viewers might
 say, Well, now let's hold hands and sing

698
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:26,099
Kumbaya

699
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,300
but when you look at every great
 inventor, every great business person,

700
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,166
every great scientist, you look at these
 people who have got

701
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:39,366
to the so called mountain top and almost 
every single one of them to a person

702
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:43,232
didn't do it for the money. They did it 
because they were chasing their bliss.

703
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:46,399
If you're following a dream, then you're doing 
what you love,

704
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,166
it's not always going to be a financial 
success but it will be a personal

705
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,132
success because

706
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,799
you're still doing this thing that you love doing
 and that's more important.

707
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,566


708
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:05,999


709
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,900
I would describe
[Laird Hamilton, professional athlete]

710
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,133
my discovery of surfing: exposure.

711
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:17,133
I was just watching surfers, watching

712
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:21,166
what they were doing and what surfing 
was all about, and the routes that they

713
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:23,399
were taking and the ways they were doing 
it.

714
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,700
I think I new subconsciously before I
 knew consciously.

715
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,166
I think I knew that I was gonna do something in
 surfing, that surfing was gonna be

716
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:38,166
a big part of my life so I wanted to 
absorb all the information I could.

717
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:46,732


718
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:50,066
Just because you don't know what a call
 on your life is right now,

719
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:55,166
doesn't mean play austrich and stick your head in the sand and

720
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:55,566
say:

721
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,932
"Well just because I don't know then
I guess I shouldn't move towards anything."

722
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:02,999
The very fact that you're 
looking for you bless

723
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,133
means that you're in the process of getting 
to your bliss.

724
00:47:07,133 --> 00:47:11,899
A part of life and a part of the whole journey is exploration.

725
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,200
Human ???? .......... is often very deep. You don't know you're there. 

726
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,333
And we don't know that we're there often because we
 don't look for them.

727
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:22,133
We don't take the journey.

728
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:25,566
Some people found them. And many people have not found
 them.

729
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,432
Because they have not found their talents they think they don't have any.

730
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:31,899
I believe passionately that we all have 
deep talents.

731
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,000
Go looking. Try things you've never done before.
With the things you wish you had done

732
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,366
but you never did, well, why didn't you? Go do it! Try!

733
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:42,866
If you always go the same route to work, 
take some different route.

734
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,232
The people you never speak to go, go and speak to them.

735
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:49,033
At least, put yourself out there, but don't 
anticipate what you'll find.

736
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:53,066
Put yourself in uncomfortable situations

737
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:57,199
at least every seven days. If 
at least every seven days people aren't

738
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,266
laughing at you or scratching their 
heads,

739
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:02,699
wondering why you're dreaming so big or 
doing what you're doing,

740
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,133
or have such a fierce resolve to
 achieving your goalsn,

741
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,133
than I don't think you're stretching enough

742
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:14,099
and ultimately we grow the most when doing the 
thing that stretches the most.

743
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:21,100


744
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,900


745
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,900
My personal journey:

746
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,033
I was bright enough I got in the best University but a part of me

747
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:34,899
needed the journey. I was interested in 
the West.

748
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,966
So I jumped at the next opportunity to
 get a scholarship

749
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:41,799
and get on the boat and then I saw my boat to 
the west.

750
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
It took 14 days.

751
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,633
I landed in Portland, Oregon

752
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:52,499
and to be a foreign student. I stretch
ed myself.

753
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,733
I arrived, I knew very little English. 

754
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,999
I went to a class called "English for foreign students", I learned English.

755
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,366
And I embraced a Western culture, I stretch my
self.

756
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:08,066
So suddenly I saw a part of me which

757
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:12,999
I never knew was there.

758
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000


759
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000


760
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,800
One of Joe's most beloved quotes about bliss 
is that 
"When you follow your bliss,

761
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,300
the Universe will open doors

762
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,400
where there were only walls."

763
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,466
What a wonderful image and in fact a lot of
 people's experiences are so like this.

764
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:49,032
You feel like you're beating your 
head against a brick wall

765
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,866


766
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:56,266
And then suddenly you shift just a tad
 ???? and low and behold,

767
00:49:56,266 --> 00:50:00,799
there's a passage that opens up.

768
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,866


769
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:09,466
when you truly forth and trust 
your bliss,

770
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:12,699
unseen forces

771
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:18,400
have the power to rearrange things to 
accommodate your

772
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,433
step of faith.

773
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:25,199


774
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:32,200
I took the Robert McKee course, I 
thought well, that's not that hard

775
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,000


776
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,766
and I wrote a screenplay and

777
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:40,332
I sent it to a friend of mine who was 
somebody's assistant

778
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:45,099
who left it on his desk and some other agent wandered by and picked it up and

779
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:45,966
read it

780
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:51,166
and said, "Oh, this is good" and so than my
 friend went "Oh, shit" and

781
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:54,799
ran to his boss and said you should read 
this because that guy over there

782
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,000
who's a junior agent, liked it and his 
boss was a senior agent and then

783
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
I got a phone call. It was fantastic.

784
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,066
It was the greatest thing ever. 
And so it seems like I sold the first screenplay I ever wrote.

785
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:11,232
But the truth is, I kept writing untill I got 
lucky.
If I stopped writing I would never got lucky.

786
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:11,866
got like

787
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:15,632
There's no luck coming to my 
house

788
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:18,699
going, "Hey, here's a book deal."

789
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,466
"Hey, we want to buy it, that screenplay 
that you haven't written."

790
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:25,999
Just keep doing it and then eventually,

791
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,400
you're likely to get lucky.

792
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,900
Why do most people not follow their bliss? One word: fear.

793
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,600
Right? We're literally 
overwhelmed by fear and primarily we're

794
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,400
overwhelmed by the of what other 
people would think of us.

795
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,866
Campbell says that "What will 
they think of me,

796
00:51:44,866 --> 00:51:48,332
must be put aside for bliss"

797
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,866
One the biggest inhibitors of following our bliss is 

798
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:52,432
"What will they think of me?"

799
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:55,866
"Am I going to look like an idiot if I
 follow my bliss and I fail?"

800
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:58,599
"Am I going to look like a fool?" 
All 
these different questions coming to our mind.

801
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,333
Your friends and family,

802
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,766
can be very well-meaning. But really,

803
00:52:03,766 --> 00:52:07,432
will collude with you to create a story

804
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:10,666
that is hard for to get out of. For 
example,

805
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:14,199
"Don't do music, you won't be a musician." 
"There's no point trying to be a dancer,

806
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,266
because you'll never make a living there."

807
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,732
I think that's the first step to the 
journey.
They're the demons, we often have to face them.

808
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:23,166


809
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:26,499
We are each our own greatest inhibitors.

810
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,100
People could say "oh yeah, this guy is holding me back" or "this situation", but really,

811
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,066
you hold yourself back.

812
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:34,166
You're deciding, hey, I don't wanna look bad in front of those guys,

813
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:38,032
or I don't want those guys to say some bad things about me so 

814
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,466
I'm not gonna do that.

815
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:43,099
Who made that decision? You! "I'm not going 
to do that."

816
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:50,100
It means you decided.

817
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,333


818
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,633
There's a poem of Rumi, the great mythical

819
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:58,133
poet from the Middle East, in the 12th 
century,

820
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:02,599
who said "I wanna sing like birds sing Not worrying who listens,

821
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,600
or what they think"
But if you can do that, then you can achieve the impossible.

822
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,633


823
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:14,866


824
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:17,266


825
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:22,099


826
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,500


827
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,866
For me, one of the most formative 
times,

828
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,032
the first, probably most formative time was when I 
dropped out of law school.

829
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:34,466
All of my friends at the time told me at least 
stay here for the first year.

830
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:36,799
I could make you the first master I was literally
 noxious
at the idea of completing this,

831
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,933
I burned my 
resume.

832
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:43,433
I had no desire to live within the
 corporate world in any sense.

833
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:47,233
and in the same 24-hour period of time 
ended my relationship of

834
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:51,399
five years and I dropped out of law school.

835
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,633
It was an incredibly gut-wrenching, soul wrenching 
time. 
Moved back in with Mom.

836
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:59,099
There were several months when I just layed in bed and slept and red.

837
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,833
It wasn't a pretty process.
But the 
only thing I knew I wanted to do

838
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:06,799
was to coach a little league baseball
 team.

839
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,033
A little bit of instinct that I had, a 
little bit of bliss I had in my life at

840
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:10,533
that time

841
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:14,499
was to work with these kids.
And I had no 
idea what would come out of it and then

842
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,166
3-6 months later I had an idea that wow 
there's an amazing opportunity to serve

843
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,399
families and sports.

844
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,666
The internet was just getting going
, it was just 1998 and I had a vision of what I

845
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,266
could do to serve these families

846
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,866
and created a company that there's no 
way I could have imagined when I dropped

847
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,466
out of law school.

848
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:34,466
No possible way. But as it turns out I 
started this business we won the

849
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:36,232
business plan competition UCLA

850
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:39,799
be raised five million dollars I hired the CEO of ???? to be our CEO

851
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,400
and we hired the law firm that I would have
 wanted to work for

852
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,433
before I graduated from law school so

853
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:51,699
this is beautiful, this sense of this is 
it, this is what happens when we follow our bliss,

854
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,233
magical things happen

855
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:56,766
that we couldn't have imagined when we were 
going through the tough

856
00:54:56,766 --> 00:55:00,732
point of making the decision to take the leap to go for it and to make the

857
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:06,533
difference in our life. ???

858
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:12,633
There are two roads in life:

859
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:18,566
the Red Road and the Black Road.

860
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:21,666
The Red Road is the tough road because it's narrow,

861
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,666
it's winding, it's full of storms, it's full of obstacles.

862
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,699
The Black Road is easy.

863
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:33,200
It's straight and it's wide. Doesn't offer 
any challenges.

864
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,433
The storyteller never says, you have to 
travel this road or you have to travel

865
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:41,066
this road.

866
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:44,266
They end up telling you the story of the red and black road by saying this:

867
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:51,266
The choice is yours. Always the choice 
is yours.

868
00:55:51,266 --> 00:56:02,332
"Find a place where there is joy
and the joy will burn out the pain" - Joseph Campbell

869
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:09,333
I was living a spontaneous life with my 
father

870
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,299


871
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,066
the bond, the passions that my father share
 with me.

872
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:18,532
We got on a plane, seven in the morning on Santa Monica Airport,

873
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:22,699
flying towards Big Bear where I had won a 
ski race the day before,

874
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,266
we were returning to Big Bear to collect my
 trophy.

875
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:31,832
On the way

876
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,966
we hit a storm, we crashed head along,

877
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:38,966
right into this rugged out a $200 fee ??? 	

878
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:42,532
its the level we crash  ???
I woke up,

879
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:46,466
our bodies were sprawled ??? in this
45-degree

880
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:50,299
icy chute. It was a blizzard was harder

881
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,566
find everybody took me about half hour
for from is peace everybody where they

882
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:54,966
were

883
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:59,332
My dad's girlfriend Sandra was still 
alive

884
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:05,499
my dad was hunched over and I was 
unclear 
whether he was dead or just so

885
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,366
knocked out

886
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:11,099
three you know through like comatose or 
something ???
I just told myself that he was

887
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,700
knocked out

888
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:17,333
At a certain point I had to admit that he 
is not gonna ??? help me any more

889
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:17,833
that I was on my own

890
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:22,299
Sandra and I took shelter under a wing.

891
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,300
Many things happened. Eventually we started 
down this

892
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,633
initial icy shoet. She slipt and was killed. ???

893
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:32,733
An hour later I came
 across her body.

894
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:36,899
I covered her with twigs and leaves and
 stuff.

895
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,700
Even though I knew she was, dead pretty much. 
But her 
eyes were open so it was a bit

896
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:46,633
confusing for me at that age I was 11 

and then I continued down in

897
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:51,333
the varied terrain in all kinds of
 
things happening got stuck in snow I

898
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:55,766
had a get through Little Creek cultures
and and

899
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:58,966
broken rocking I E San I just wanted to
go away

900
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:03,066
more than anything in the world I want
the pain to go away now had I not

901
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:07,666
had I not him gone in there and seen
that

902
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,699
that thing that that thing I fear the
most

903
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,400
I would not have learned

904
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,700
to serve find the jam in the treasure

905
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,933
pain those answers that were there for
me and had I not

906
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:27,299
face up and i not gone and stared in the
eyes and think I feared most

907
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,500
that why one run promos I would not be
here now

908
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,000
this book which is really besides having
a kid

909
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
P not satisfying experience in my life

910
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,033


911
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:47,566
home

912
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:54,566
this

913
00:58:54,566 --> 00:59:09,732


914
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:12,733
Campbell talks about the fact we go on 
the hero's journey

915
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:19,633
there's a drag in we must slay world

916
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:23,166
now a dragon is the most challenging 
fears creature they can ever be created

917
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:30,166
him mr. GV my

918
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:30,632


919
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:34,499
Joe Campbell describes the dragon as 
being a beast

920
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,733
covered with scales and on every scale

921
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:42,799
it says either that shelter but thou
 shalt not on

922
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,166
the

923
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,532
so this beach is a constructional all 
love the

924
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:56,199
rules regulations social obligations 
cultural creations that have

925
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,366
made you feel that you either have to

926
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:05,266
or can't do certain things I'm

927
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:12,266
no

928
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:13,832


929
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:17,133
slaying the dragon to me is the most 
interesting

930
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:20,299
the final moment the time when you are

931
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,866
faced with the scariest thing you've 
been faced with him

932
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:26,899
you get to take everything we've learned and

933
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,900
and not the guy I am that

934
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,200


935
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,966
no

936
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:43,332
if you were to ask you what's the one 
thing that

937
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,966
keeps people from the mountain tops 
what's the one thing

938
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:50,566
the keeps people small rather than 
allowing them to present their genius to

939
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:51,666
the world

940
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:55,566
it's it's their fears are is Joseph 
Campbell says its third reagan's

941
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:59,632
the mysterious anything that gets in you

942
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:05,133
the new it's a beast it's a monster the
 name here

943
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:09,599
yes you know let me face every day you
 know only fear that we can be

944
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,166
rejected that we're going to be you know

945
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,599
no one's gonna answer return our phone 
call that no one's gonna like

946
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,933
well we made a while we did what we said 
on

947
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:25,599
fear that isn't based om has a tendency 
to

948
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:31,033
creep it moves through your

949
01:01:31,033 --> 01:01:34,466
experiences it starts to talks if I

950
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:37,966
your perception cuba com scared

951
01:01:37,966 --> 01:01:41,532
love is what web along with and fear is
 what we learn

952
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:46,233
I think there's a great truth in that

953
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:50,199
I want to hold a player you know I had 
this idea I knew it was physically

954
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:50,933
possible

955
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:54,899
million usually do it Hot Wheels do this
 Labor Day

956
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:00,000
com and so I A presented the idea to my
 sponsor the time

957
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,433
they said adding it to do this lizard
 that sounds awesome

958
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:06,733
the around I designed around you know in
 all this is

959
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:10,499
on paper and it was my idea and I'll
 never forget driving up

960
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,066
and seeing it and this wave fears crash 
early Ly coming

961
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:18,432
what tonight are you serious like I made
 a loop

962
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:22,066
I'm really in it like and I'm the only 
one that's even volunteering to do it

963
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,999
and at that point I felt like I was so
 much at stake

964
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,533
to not do it you look at the time no was 
building

965
01:02:27,533 --> 01:02:30,866
extravagant Rams no one really had money 
to do that kind of thing

966
01:02:30,866 --> 01:02:33,966
and there was no psych and I just had
 asserted

967
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:38,499
internalize and say okay you keep
 telling yourself this is possible

968
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,766
this is the time we got to make this happen and little by little I figured

969
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:45,499
out my text heavy heavy hits that day

970
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,266
the

971
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:50,132
the

972
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:53,499
actually now we own one for Hutchins 
tour the that we could do into every

973
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,300
single night but

974
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,333
but that first time

975
01:02:56,333 --> 01:03:00,466
you know that was cells is frightening 
but I had to I had to really step back

976
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:02,099
in OK

977
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:09,100
you can use

978
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:18,033


979
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:22,333
the mail fears are very interesting fan

980
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:26,166
first but we need to realize that fear 
is an inherent part in the human

981
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:26,866
experience

982
01:03:26,866 --> 01:03:30,032
but it's not about getting rid of fear
 where's it going hours now there's

983
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:31,299
nowhere for it to go

984
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,300
the issue is to have courage to move 
forward in spite

985
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,166
a few you feel the new the courage

986
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:42,266
is not a lack of fair the courage

987
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:45,899
is is dealing with a faint and nobody

988
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,566
would have a it's not as courageous you
 didn't and from their own fair

989
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:52,732
and that's not going to tell that just
 doing

990
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:58,033
summit if I'm relatively and challenging 
Curtis when you know what to do

991
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:05,033
can you do it and lack of courage is
 when you know what to do and don't do it

992
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:05,799


993
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,800
courage is is the ability did to get up

994
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,400
after your phone gigante exploring the 
unknown

995
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,333
and and trying stuff the maybe people
 have thought was impossible

996
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:20,299
is just like a muscle if you want to get
 stronger you wanna run a triathlon to

997
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,733
run a marathon or do whatever you want 
to do

998
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:26,566
physically you know you need to train 
you need to get stronger

999
01:04:26,566 --> 01:04:30,099
current is exactly the same thank you 
think a bit like courage GM

1000
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,033
you've got a consistently go up your 
fears go one step past

1001
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:38,166
one step past you'll find your comfort 
zone expanse each time you do that

1002
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,866
things used to freak you out won't freak
you out as much

1003
01:04:40,866 --> 01:04:44,899
and now you have the tools you have the
 strength literally to lift more in your

1004
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,400
life

1005
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,800
as you face your fears one more 
authentically

1006
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,166
there is some

1007
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:58,432
power monsters get by being dark in the
 closet I'll

1008
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:01,599
and there is some diminishment

1009
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,700
arm by facing them facing them head-on

1010
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:11,500
and are

1011
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,000
are suggests Campbell talk to the 
slaying dragons

1012
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,733
and with most others do their lives 
whether it's a difficult assignment at

1013
01:05:18,733 --> 01:05:19,233
work

1014
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:22,999
when there is a difficult conversation 
we know we should have with a loved one

1015
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,433
whether something we're resisting we
 leave can run in the opposite direction

1016
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:33,299
rather than running away we should go 
closer to you because once we can see

1017
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:33,633
here

1018
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:38,599
fierce the death here you know the 
concern

1019
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,700
do the things that scare you you know 
courageous what comes after

1020
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:47,166
it is

1021
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,166
okay to be scared

1022
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,999
shouldn't stop you

1023
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:59,000
a healthy warning election stuff

1024
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:09,966


1025
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,832
the No

1026
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:18,033
of mmm

1027
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:24,466
over dragon that hordes all the stories
 talk in those terms for several reasons

1028
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:31,032
am on the one hand we could call a
 projection tennis psychological sense

1029
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:34,299
so we project out and we create

1030
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,433
and antagonised that we have to slay

1031
01:06:37,433 --> 01:06:40,666
more but what's actually happening is 
we're I'll

1032
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:43,932
dealing with the energies inside 
ourselves what he's outside is in fact a

1033
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,766
reflection what's inside that it back
 you've sorted shows n

1034
01:06:46,766 --> 01:06:51,566
your 10 the new

1035
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:55,666
of course in Star Wars which wasn't
 pretty much entirely based on

1036
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,332
camels paradigm blue sky Walker

1037
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:03,633
has to go into K where he does battle
 with Darth Vader

1038
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:08,066
the new we're finally he cuts of Darth 
Vader's head

1039
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,299
in the head rolls to his feet

1040
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,600
and Darth Vader's helmet opens up

1041
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:22,866
North Jersey City but his own face he 
thinks that is evil outside of him

1042
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:27,432
when the struggle between good and evil is understood to be going on inside of

1043
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:27,966
us

1044
01:07:27,966 --> 01:07:32,132
it can be very beneficial this is part 
is a personal transformation

1045
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:36,599
overcoming I negative aspects 
emphasizing are good ones

1046
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,800
but what often happens of course we want 
to feel that we are good

1047
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,066
so we don't find the negative within 
ourselves we're gonna find it

1048
01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:47,266
somewhere out there the great optional 
for most

1049
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:50,532
as ready as ourself you know if we can
 overcome that basic fare

1050
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:54,299
about what we might achieve and we take 
that risk

1051
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,000
I think all kinds of things open up in 
and Campbell stands now we

1052
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,000
we can all be heroes I'm

1053
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,500


1054
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,800
the hero encounters these obstacles

1055
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:15,166
and Wales and the

1056
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:20,266
and that's how we react when we find ourselves in a situation where we have

1057
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:21,932
that and cognitive dissonance

1058
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:28,533
how do I get out amid the nobel

1059
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:34,699
first thing is you have to surrender you 
have to stop fighting in the mood

1060
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,966
are

1061
01:08:37,966 --> 01:08:41,232
the new

1062
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:42,799
so slaying the dragon

1063
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,333
is really coming to terms with that
 inner part of Use

1064
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:52,233
yourself that you think is bigger than 
your and in doing that then you grow

1065
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:59,233
bigger sent to your cell go

1066
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:00,166


1067
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:03,366
however I think dad its

1068
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:06,632
loving your to hack that's the much more 
efficient thing to do

1069
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:10,433
it also feels a lot better

1070
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:17,433
theme

1071
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:18,399


1072
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,333
when you do that then frequently
 whatever the dragon was hiding

1073
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:27,966
reporting this step away and give it to
 me they give it to you because there's

1074
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:28,232
no

1075
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:33,199
began when you're fighting you find
 yourself we stop fighting yourself

1076
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,300
then you're no longer engaged in the 
fight

1077
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:42,700
in Europen to what might come true

1078
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,300
though is a gift in battling demons and
 overcoming

1079
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,466
because that's what our soul's journey 
is about its about facing fear growing

1080
01:09:51,466 --> 01:09:51,966
beyond

1081
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:58,966
and as we overcome our fears regain 
power

1082
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,266


1083
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:03,499
you look at our lives the best

1084
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:10,500
most rewarding moment com after stroke

1085
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,833


1086
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:15,166
as such what we do with our allies

1087
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:22,166
is what makes us Europe or not arm

1088
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:22,732


1089
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,599
and

1090
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,566
there's grace in knowing and there's a
TF yeah

1091
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:31,666
believing hey every minus

1092
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:36,766
mishap a plus way the first row cover 
article where Nash

1093
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:42,099
in other words on one level to make it
 here you had to deploy CA have that

1094
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,900
health challenge a got fired in a kiln 
arguing that

1095
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:49,133
has not troublesome but one awareness 
can you add to it

1096
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:52,233
see get a far bigger picture helps you
 master

1097
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:56,666
at a certain point in the hero's journey 
it's going to become a Down

1098
01:10:56,666 --> 01:11:00,399
you loving and accepting yourself
 pension why

1099
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,333
that's a powerful moment because that
 line she worked directly with the

1100
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:06,399
universe now there's no more war

1101
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:13,433
going on inside yourself and as that gap
 heels between your unlovable South

1102
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:18,133
in your ability to montana lovable self 
became an awesome power

1103
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:25,133
life

1104
01:11:25,133 --> 01:11:31,433


1105
01:11:31,433 --> 01:11:33,799
the way we think the kindness as linear

1106
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,800
I'm born I'm gonna go through these 
things I'm gonna die

1107
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,566
here's journey tells us know you're 
gonna go here you can have this

1108
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:43,266
adventure in uni come back and guess
 what you gonna be right back where you

1109
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:45,699
were now you can go over here have this 
adventure you come back

1110
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,633
you're gonna go here you can have this 
invention unit come back and guess what

1111
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:51,133
you gonna be right back where you were 
now you can go over here have this

1112
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:52,166
adventure you come back

1113
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:55,432
and guess what you right here what did 
you bring back I'm

1114
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:58,666
what the hero brings back the No

1115
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:02,632
is a story Gomes for example go 
commission a big

1116
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:05,999
he went out any look for the plan to be
 more challenging

1117
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,266
he went through all kinds it runs with 
the feminine with her

1118
01:12:10,266 --> 01:12:13,532
the monster and so on but he finally

1119
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:16,766
swam to the bottom of the sea and got
 the plant immortality

1120
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:20,532
he came up on the short put it down
 while he was bathing

1121
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:24,166
the snake serpent came and got that 
plaintiff immortality

1122
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:28,699
but he went home to o'rourke anyway and
 he had this story to tell

1123
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:32,000
for gil comish there was no concrete

1124
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
objective thing widget

1125
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,866
to give to the community no gold

1126
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:42,666
no treasure and so on the story the 
train getting the treasures

1127
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:43,499
treasure

1128
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,900
and so the giving this story

1129
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:50,966
is the invitation for other people to 
make the same journey

1130
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:56,066
that's why it's a circle and never hit 
love that idea that there's a circle

1131
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:59,699
and the circle needs to be closed and 
the way to close the circle

1132
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,133
is to come back return with

1133
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:07,333
something different than you started
 with and to share that

1134
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:10,866
not to me is like a perfect hero's 
journey deaths

1135
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:14,699
the ultimate in to the US Attorney's not 
slaying dragons

1136
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:21,700
not being the bad guy it's giving back 
the essence in that journey

1137
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,200


1138
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,366
looks like about how can I make a
 difference and who can I make a

1139
01:13:26,366 --> 01:13:26,899
difference

1140
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,933
2&4 and then it gets really easy a kind

1141
01:13:30,933 --> 01:13:34,199
get a shirt for the future taking he's
 getting more

1142
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,933
here's more only my friends star
 artistic said he's trying to make moving

1143
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:38,833
he doesn't have the money

1144
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:42,933
what can we do it visually all love said
 we're doing things

1145
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:47,166
that we are going to do anyway but down
 so we can make money for him and make

1146
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:47,966
him finish the movie

1147
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:54,966
and then all since I will let's do that 
again that was great

1148
01:13:54,966 --> 01:13:55,899


1149
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,633
when I found this success in skating and 
I never dreamed possible

1150
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:03,699
the first thing I want to do is try to 
help kids get a facility in and that was

1151
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,200
the first thing I did I start a 
foundation for public skate parks

1152
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,166
it

1153
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:13,799
today we've helped build about 500 skate 
parks

1154
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,100
it's my passion it's what I would love
 to do is provide facilities for these

1155
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,900
kids to

1156
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:23,800
deserve a chance I love talking to young 
writers about writing

1157
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,133
there's a scholarship by primed which is
 up screenwriting scholarship at Wesley

1158
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:29,133
where I went to college

1159
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:33,299
the away to up

1160
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,700
everybody who wants to be what we are 
with a crow

1161
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:41,100
this if you speak to somebody at the 
level of the mine

1162
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,800
can you speak to them if you speak to me
 a hot

1163
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,733
you will speak to the hot work if you 
speak

1164
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:51,933
through your life in your life has the 
story

1165
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:55,199
then you changed that's what mythical 
beings

1166
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,400
and it's why stories are great because
 my story

1167
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,000
right now

1168
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,333
which is my also my truth

1169
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,466
may have an effect on you

1170
01:15:06,466 --> 01:15:10,832
and therefore

1171
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:12,766
I'm picking the in trouble

1172
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:15,666
I'm making an external and through that

1173
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:22,666
I'm sharing experience

1174
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:33,266


1175
01:15:33,266 --> 01:15:36,566
no matter how long you get to live life 
is ultimately for sure

1176
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:41,932
before all the silver in the dust and
 the street sweeper gets buried next to

1177
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:42,299
see

1178
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,833
you know all that really matters at the 
end of the day is how big

1179
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:52,833
showed up and how courageous were

1180
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,299


1181
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,300
I think when we are on our debt that's
