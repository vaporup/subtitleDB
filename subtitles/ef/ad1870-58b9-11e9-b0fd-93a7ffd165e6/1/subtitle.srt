Big Bopper. Gotcha, Hare.
What's going down?

12
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,472
<i>- We've got a cop-killer.
- You're kidding!</i>

13
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,311
<i>Be warned, Sarse...</i>

14
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,062
<i>... this is non-compliance.</i>

15

17

<i>Please respond only to that code.</i>

18
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,158
<i>Code 44 indicates no requirement

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,368
<i>A Pursuit Special has been stolen.</i>

20
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,872
<i>Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee

<i>We're three minutes off the intersection.
Can you make it?</i>

26
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,474
We'll make it! Move over!

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,017
I'm driving!

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,895
Not this again! I've been assigned!

29
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,776
Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate!

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,783
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing?

31
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,535
<i>A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.</i>

32
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>A few hours ago, down in Sun City,
he goes berserk.</i>

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie
and takes off in a Pursuit Special.</i>

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>We've been on him ever since.</i>

35
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,254
<i>This one's right up the air, Roop.</i>

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,798
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.

37
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,849
What's he driving?

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.</i>

39
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!</i>

40
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:20,492
We're about half a mile off Anarchy Road.
You'll see him any minute now.

41
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,331
Rip the guts out of it. Give it the B-Jesus!

42
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,880
See him yet?

43
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,256
Got it!

44
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,010
I'm gonna blow him away!

45
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,721
I'm gonna ram him!

46
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,702
Hey, fellas, you okay?

47
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,372
<i>Acknowledge, Big Bopper.
Acknowledge, are you okay?</i>

48
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,252
Do you see me, Toecutter?

49
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,713
Do you see me, man?

50
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,552
Keep going, we're okay.

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,180
We got you, we're going.

52
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,895
Born with a steering wheel in his hand...

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,231
<i>... and lead in his foot.</i>

54
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,608
<i>He is the Nightrider...</i>

55
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,320
<i>... cruising at the speed of fright!</i>

56
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,951
<i>I am the Nightrider,
and we ain't never coming back!</i>

57
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,581
<i>I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!</i>

58
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,794
<i>I am a rocker! I am a roller!</i>

59
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,797
I think we're still mobile.

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
For Christ's sake, shove over!

61
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,801
You're blaspheming again.

62
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,387
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.

63
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,225
<i>I am the Nightrider!</i>

64
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,486
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?

65
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,196
<i>Understand this.</i>

66
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,156
That scag and his floozy...

67
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,450
...they're gonna die!

68
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:37,045
<i>Main Force to Gosling One.
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.</i>

69
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,298
<i>MFP to Gosling One.</i>

70
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,134
<i>Main Force to Gosling One.</i>

71
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,760
It was like slow motion.

72
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,305
He leaves his seat
and goes through the windscreen...

73
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,473
...headfirst straight into the tree, right?

74
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,351
And then bounces back
through the windscreen.

75
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,023
By the time we got to him,
he was just sitting there...

76
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,109
...trying to scream with his face ripped off.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,696
What's the matter?

78
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,198
Not hungry, am I?

79
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,824
Give it here.

80
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,077
- I'll tell you what"..."
- Look at that.

81
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,164
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.

82
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,750
Catch you later, Goose.

83
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,655
<i>Christ, they're heading for population!</i>

84
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,048
What's this I hear about you and Jonathan?

85
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,009
- What about him?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.

86
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,302
So what?

87
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,641
It's this way.

88
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,578
He's gone.

89
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,662
Bastards!

90
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,915
Shit!

91
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,959
You're gonna get it this time.

92
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,211
- He had his indicator on.
- Shut up!

93
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,677
No, you're not going on. Stay off the road!

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,596
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!

95
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,723
People's lives are in peril!

96
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,602
Stay off the roads!

97
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,608
I'm gonna have him!

98
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,570
Stay off the roads!

99
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,698
Get off the roads!

100
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,117
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!

101
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,046
Oh, my God.

102
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,778
<i>I am ready.</i>

103
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,821
<i>I am ready for your best.</i>

104
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,908
Oh, my God, what happened?

105
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,661
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.

106
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,163
I think he broke his leg.

107
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,165
I want to find out what's happening.

108
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,708
<i>Max, can you hear me?</i>

109
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,418
Main Force Patrol...

110
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,504
...we're out of the game...

111
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,798
...unable to continue pursuit.

112
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,385
You'd better send a meat truck.
Charlie's copped the saucer in the throat.

113
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,678
Hey, Max?

114
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,098
<i>Max?</i>

115
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,349
Go ahead.

116
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,352
<i>We are 100 percent SNAFUed.</i>

117
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,770
You okay, Goose?

118
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,523
Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.

119
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,024
Much damage?

120
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,113
<i>You should see the damage, Bronze!</i>

121
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,698
Metal damage...

122
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,907
<i>... brain damage?</i>

123
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,409
<i>You listening, Bronze?</i>

124
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,036
I am the Nightrider!

125
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,834
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.

126
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,296
<i>I am a rocker! I am a roller!</i>

127
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,632
<i>I am an out-of-controller!</i>

128
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,261
I am the Nightrider, baby...

129
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:59,057
<i>... and it's me and my Marmaduke,
and we ain't never coming back.</i>

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,785
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.

131
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,830
I am the Nightrider!

132
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:32,049
I am the chosen one,
the mighty hand of vengeance...

133
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,093
<i>... sent down to strike the unroadworthy!</i>

134
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,889
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.

135
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,767
Step right up, chum, and watch the kid...

136
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,437
...lay down a rubber road right to freedom!

137
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,436
What's wrong?

138
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,900
- Baby, what's wrong!
- Nothing.

139
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,747
It's going.

140
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,750
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.

141
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,343
Stop!

142
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,488
That feels good.

143
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,075
After three days, that feels so good.

144
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,705
I got a right hook in the mouth
this morning.

145
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,957
Sprog?

146
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,626
I told him to always lead with his left.

147
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,963
You know, I think we've got
a monster on our hands.

148
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,340
Yeah, takes after his old man.

149
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,424
What's that?

150
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,134
Monster!

151
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,347
<i>Montazano, who called himself
the Nightrider...</i>

152
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,142
<i>... had broken from custody
and escaped in the police vehicle.</i>

153
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,186
You made the news again.

154
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,273
Who was he?

155
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,399
I don't know.

156
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,027
Just another glory rider, I guess.

157
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,637
Jessie, I told you.

158
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,639
The Goose wants me there early.

159
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,141
What for, he didn't say.

160
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,851
You know the Goose.

161
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,312
Coffee's ready.

162
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,004
I'm not grumpy.

163
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,721
Get out of here.

164
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,850
Okay.

165
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,894
I gotta go.

166
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,210
What's that?

167
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,505
Crazy about you.

168
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,861
<i>All supplies must be requisitioned
from the people's bond.</i>

169
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,907
<i>Please do not exploit your privileges.
Doing so is an offense.</i>

<i>Memorandum Seven:</i>

asked that pursuit officers...</i>

172

<i>... refrain from using the slang "Bronze"
for the Main Force Patrol.</i>

173
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,837
<i>The word is considered disrespectful...</i>

174
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,591
<i>... and citizens should be
actively discouraged from its use.</i>

<i>MFP personnel may sign on
with the following sector captains.</i>

178
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,607
<i>One, six three, two four, one one two...</i>

179
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,109
<i>... five seven, and two six.</i>

180
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,779
Kick it in the guts, Barry.

181
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,745
She's the last of the V8s.

182
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,665
You can shut the gate on this one.
It's the duck's guts.

183
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,459
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.

184
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,960
Sucks nitro.

185
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,420
Phase 4 head.

186
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,006
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower.

187
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,300
- 600 horsepower.
- The blower, man.

188
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,138
She's meanness put to music
and the bitch is born to run.

189
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,849
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.

190
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,865
How the hell did you get all this together?

191
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,868
It just happened, Max, you know?

192
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,788
A piece from here and a piece from there.

193
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,249
- So easy?
- Yeah.

194
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,085
Come on, Max. You've seen it.

195
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,837
You've heard it...

196
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,506
...and you're still asking questions.

197
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,803
When do we go for a ride?

198
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,349
<i>He loves it.</i>

199
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,601
I think we've got him.

200
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,894
I hope so.

201
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,896
Yeah, we've got him.

202
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,190
Your top pursuit man wants
to quit the road...

203
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,943
...and we have to seduce him with candy?

204
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,696
People don't believe in heroes anymore.

205
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,491
I know, Macaffee. You want
to give them back their heroes.

206
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,869
You will not try this one on me again.

207
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,871
I do not enjoy wasting money.

208
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,247
Goodbye...

209
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,666
...and good luck!

210
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,335
Thanks, Labatouche.

211
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,088
You're a real human being.

212
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,867
Get out of my way!

213
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,161
The old meat grinder's humming tonight?

214
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,706
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies
over the high side.

215
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,126
Will you shut up!

216
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,255
The hot mops and the towees.

217
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,258
It's in the food.

218
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,177
Another one for your books, eh?

219
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,512
Have you eaten yet?

220
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,181
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.

221
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,433
That Code 3 you ran down
a few days ago"..."

222
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,560
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.

223
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,312
- Got a problem.
- What's that?

224
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,523
His friends. Word is they're out to get you.

225
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,775
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.

226
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,611
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.

227
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,155
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.

228
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,859
Good afternoon.

229
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,362
Good afternoon.

230
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,449
We're here to meet a friend.
Come in on the train.

231
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,954
Nothing come in on the train
except a couple of crates and a...

232
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,789
...coffin.

233
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,458
Our friend.

234
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,295
You'll have to see the agent
and sign the papers.

235
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,422
Where do we find...

236
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,882
...this agent?

237
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,302
Wait.

238
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,112
That must be your friend there.

239
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,030
Didn't leave much of him.

240
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,783
Must have cut his heart out?

241
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,747
Yes, that's what I meant.

242
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,543
Poor bastard.

243
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,255
The Nightrider.

244
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,633
That is his name.

245
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,220
The Nightrider.

246
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,890
The Nightrider.

247
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,434
Remember him...

248
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,187
...when you look at the night sky.

249
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,939
I will.

250
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,026
Take your hat off.

251
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,502
Anything you say.

252
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,629
Anything I say.

253
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,674
What a wonderful philosophy you have.

254
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,551
Take him away.

255
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,395
Bubba. Johnny.

256
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,359
Push me, shove you!

257
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,944
Oh, yeah? Says who?

258
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,342
Nightrider!

259
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,263
Nightrider!

260
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,434
Nightrider!

261
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,187
No worries.

262
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,718
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

263
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,387
Rockatansky.

264
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,431
<i>We have incident at Wee Jerusalem.</i>

265
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,600
<i>Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.</i>

266
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,228
Okay, we're on it. We gone.

267
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,396
Goose, come on.

268
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,446
What's this?

269
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,949
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.

270
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,758
<i>- Any more details?
- No.</i>

271
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,554
Okay, we're gone.

272
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,641
- Max, he looks"..."
- Yeah.

273
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,355
Hey, fella, stop!

274
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,404
<i>Hey, fella, stop!</i>

275
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,074
What a turkey!

276
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,911
<i>Hey, fella, you're a turkey, you know that?</i>

277
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,832
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.

278
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,588
Nightrider. My "Niqueur."

279
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:43,265
<i>Pursuit units in sectors,
eight, nine and ten.</i>

280
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,188
<i>A cyclecade of nomad bikers.</i>

281
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,231
<i>A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.</i>

282
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,319
<i>Your instructions are to locate.
Do not engage.</i>

283
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,783
<i>Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.</i>

284
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,956
Bronze!

285
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,751
Gonna get you!

286
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,046
It's okay.

287
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,633
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

288
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,259
It's all right.

289
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,428
This one's whacked out of his skull.

290
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,680
Whacked right out of his skull, man!

291
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,849
He ain't never coming back.

292
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,822
It's all right.

293
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,784
I'm gonna let this go now.

294
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,873
I know you're frightened, girl...

295
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,918
...but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.

296
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,506
My name's Jim Goose,
and everything's gonna be all right.

297
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,438
The Nightrider!

298
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,274
Hey, Jimbo.

299
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,944
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah.

300
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,947
Remember him when you look up"..."

301
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:26,577
Nightrider!

302
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,956
Well, well, well.

303
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,816
Johnny the Boy has done it again.

304
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,235
This time it's a scrubber.

305
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,030
He's never gonna learn.

306
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,367
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.

307
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,536
You are going back for him.

308
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,915
No way! Not me, not for him!

309
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,417
But it's not for him.

310
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,711
It's for me, Bubba.

311
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,679
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!

312
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,140
He's nothing like the Nightrider!

313
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,997
<i>Code seven progress, eight one.</i>

314
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:56,041
<i>Code seven progress, eight three.</i>

315
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:59,044
<i>Code seven eight six, eight one, eight zero.</i>

316
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,922
<i>MFP Code 1.</i>

317
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,968
<i>Captain Macaffee in convoy from
the courthouse to the Halls of Justice.</i>

318
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,511
<i>Code one progress.</i>

319
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:26,155
Hey, mister.

320
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,407
What happened to the car?

321
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,868
What do you think happened?

322
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,037
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.

323
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,833
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.

324
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,252
Hey, Roop.

325
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,296
Stay here, mate.

326
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,307
<i>I think they're out there.</i>

327
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,810
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.

328
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,854
<i>Good day and good luck.</i>

329
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:04,276
<i>I can see the Interceptor.</i>

330
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,534
What do you say, Scag?

331
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,620
Got no place special to go?

332
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:17,247
<i>We'd better prep him.</i>

333
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:20,083
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?

334
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,339
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?

335
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,757
No contest.

336
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,194
Hey, Fif! What's going on?

337
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,862
- What happened?
- Let him go.

338
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,906
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Who's this?

339
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,574
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?

340
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:53,992
No one showed, okay?

341
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,787
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

342
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,248
No one showed. No one.

343
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,375
What's he mean, "No one showed"?

344
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,001
They didn't show.

345
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,337
Nobody! The punks didn't show.

346
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,382
The girl didn't show,
the townspeople didn't show.

347
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,133
Nobody showed!

348
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,302
We're screwed! It's the law.

349
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:15,264
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?

350
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,183
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.
No contest.

351
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:21,353
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna
let him walk out the door, Fifi?

352
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,522
That's exactly what you're going to do!

353
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,941
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie!

354
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,193
It's alright.

355
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:32,239
Hey, Bronze, look at you,
a cripple and a mute!

356
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,325
Scag, he sings and I tap dance!

357
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,871
Hey, you know what you are?

358
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:42,833
The courts will hear about this.
I promise they'll hear about this disgrace.

359
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,545
He wearing that face for a bet
or does he really look that stupid?

360
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,380
This man is grossly offensive!

361
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,090
Get him out of here, Max!

362
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,885
- I can make a case of it!
- What case, you fool?

363
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,887
You saw what they did to that girl!

364
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,347
For God's sake, she was the town bike!

365
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,228
He's my prisoner,
and he's not walking out that door!

366
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,647
- Get him out of here!
- Who is this guy?

367
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,691
Goose, settle down, boy.

368
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,321
Jesus, Fifi.

369
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,156
Fifi, Jesus.

370
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,241
Look, they're laughing at us!

371
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,953
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
They don't believe us!

372
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,249
See you later, Goose.

373
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,752
It's been a pleasure.

374
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:57,324
Skiffington, go home. Go.

375
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,201
Goose!

376
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,537
You can't do anything about it!

377
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,164
We know who you are, Bronze!

378
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,208
We'll see you on the road, Scag!

379
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,836
See you on the road
like we saw the Nightrider!

380
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:13,507
We remember the Nightrider,
and we know who you are!

381
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:21,473
Okay.

382
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:26,854
So long as the paperwork is clean,
you boys can do what you like out there.

383
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,527
Here he is, the walking armpit!

384
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:47,291
There's a fire in my belly,
and she's the woman to put it out.

385
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,586
Off, brute!
This angel is hot in the tubes for me!

386
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,843
I'm on fire!

387
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,053
Joviality is a game of children.

388
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:04,099
- She's mine.
- I should be a surgeon with these hands.

389
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,981
Mudguts, get out of there!

390
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,320
Cundalini, put her against the post.

391
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,495
We have a problem here.

392
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,123
She is not what she seems.

393
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,919
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority...

394
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,923
...she's sent by the Bronze,
full of treachery.

395
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,931
The Bronze, take our pride.

396
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:59,071
If you're gonna waste the Bronze,
you gotta do it big!

397
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,116
You just don't have the style,
do you, chicken shit?

398
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,288
Goes to water on a dummy.

399
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,388
It's all right. It's okay.

400
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,518
Just remember...

401
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,479
...to keep your sweet...

402
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:36,316
...sweet mouth shut!

Hey, it's the Goose.

423
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:45,584
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.

424
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,961
Hey, Midge...

425
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:52,549
...don't write off the Goose,
until you see the box going into the hole.

426
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,053
Yeah, well, don't wreck me truck now.

427
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:59,139
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.

428
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,892
Hey, you sure you're all right?

429
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,269
Couldn't be righter.

430
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:09,608
Jimmy the Goose,
larger than life and twice as ugly!

431
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:33,650
Light me, Johnny.

432
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,298
Light another.

433
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:05,140
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.

434
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:07,684
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.

435
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:09,645
Light it!

436
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:18,779
The Bronze,
they keep you from being proud.

437
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,908
Look at him. He looks silly,
doesn't he, upside down?

438
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,412
Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!

439
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:29,206
I can't. No!

440
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,918
You scum-sucking trash!

441
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,503
Throw it!

442
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,464
I can't stand the pain!

443
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,707
Max.

444
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:16,814
That "thing" in there, that's not the Goose.
No way.

445
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:24,631
I was hungry.

446
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,468
Peanut butter and honey.

447
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,862
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess.

448
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:52,784
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.

449
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,163
Now there's nothing.

450
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,627
Here I am, trying to put sense to it...

451
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,630
...when I know there isn't any.

452
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:11,970
I'll be all right,
once I get it clear in my head.

453
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,836
- What's this?
- I'm through.

454
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,963
- Again?
- No, not again.

455
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,507
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.

456
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,511
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.

457
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:54,555
Now, just a minute!

458
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,808
All right, so the Goose bought it.

459
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,768
That's the way
he always came at the world.

460
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,061
Off beat.

461
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:04,398
Max, you'd be the first to admit
it was long overdue.

462
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,651
All right, I'll tell you how it is.

463
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,486
You're a winner, Max.

464
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,363
You're on the top shelf...

465
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:15,742
...and I'm not gonna lose you because
of some crazy notion about quitting!

466
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:21,165
They say people don't believe
in heroes anymore.

467
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,584
Well, damn them!

468
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,502
You and me, Max...

469
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,256
...we're gonna give them back their heroes.

470
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:33,302
Do you really expect me
to go for that crap?

471
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:36,763
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute?

472
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,265
'Bye, Fifi.

473
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,643
Come on, do you want me to beg?

474
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,938
Do you want me on my knees, crying?

475
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,149
Now just a minute.

476
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,151
Give me a reason.

477
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,573
I'm scared, Fif.

478
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:58,702
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.

479
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,496
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

480
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,039
What is this, funny week?

481
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:05,083
Any longer out on that road,
and I'm one of them, you know?

482
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,919
A terminal crazy.

483
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,672
Only, I've got a bronze badge
to say I'm one of the good guys.

484
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:13,091
You know what I'm trying to say?

485
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:16,053
I'll tell you what I'll do.

486
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:22,392
Take off a few weeks?

487
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,354
Grow yourself a beard.

488
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:28,482
Draw flies. Just think about it for a while.

489
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,402
If you still feel the same way
when you come back, it's okay by me.

490
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:33,654
Go on.

491
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,203
I'm not gonna change my mind.

492
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:44,414
Get out of here
before I decide to come with you.

493
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,793
'Bye, Fif. Thank you.

494
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,757
You'll be back, Rockatansky!

495
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,343
You're hooked, Max.

496
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,804
And you know it!

497
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,624
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.

498
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:13,670
Guess I always
counted on you understanding.

499
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,222
When I was a kid...

500
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:28,143
...me and my father
used to go for long walks.

501
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,815
I remember staring down at his shoes.

502
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:37,444
They were special shoes, brown.

503
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,864
And he always kept them really shiny.

504
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:47,871
He was tall,
and he used to take long strides.

505
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,792
And there I'd be right alongside him...

506
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,294
...just trying to keep up with him.

507
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:02,344
I don't think he ever knew
how proud I felt of him.

508
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:07,808
Or how good it felt
just to be there alongside him.

509
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,897
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel"..."

510
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,362
The thing is, Jess...

511
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,826
...I couldn't tell him about it then,
but I can tell you about it now.

512
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,834
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you
how I'm feeling about you right now.

513
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,613
Get a load of that!

514
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,323
We had a blowout a while back.

515
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,241
Raunchy, very raunchy.

516
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:07,951
What's the donk like?

517
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,454
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire"..."

518
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:14,249
Don't do much work on these myself,
except to scrape 'em off the road.

519
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,919
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire?

520
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,378
Have it fixed in no time.

521
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,048
I can sell you a set of 'lops
for next to nothing.

522
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:24,384
I can't remember where I got 'em,
but I got 'em, know what I mean?

523
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,180
No, we'll be all right
just as soon as we get this fixed.

524
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,765
- Max?
- Yeah?

525
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,100
Listen...

526
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:36,438
...Sproggo's talked me
into buying him an ice cream, so...

527
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,232
...I think I'll see you later.

528
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:41,401
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.

529
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:43,612
They'll appreciate the business.

530
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,364
Sure, thanks.

531
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,074
Toodlepip.

532
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:04,758
You just trucking around?
Good time for just trucking.

533
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:08,178
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?

534
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,096
Maybe.

535
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:42,045
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.

536
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:45,716
Main course and dessert.

537
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,177
My favorite kind:

538
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:50,345
Female.

539
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:31,929
Watch the tongue, lovable.

540
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,556
I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean.

541
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:08,924
Must've spent some coin.

542
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:12,344
Like the sign says,
speed's just a question of money.

543
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,429
How fast do you wanna go?

544
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,640
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?

545
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:18,559
Just take my word for it, get in!

546
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:21,311
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!

547
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:24,940
Your tire, man.

548
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,651
Hey, fella, what about your tire!

549
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:28,694
Hey, fella, what about your tire!

550
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:33,782
Crazy people!

551
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,452
The world's full of crazy people.

552
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,221
That wagon, was it here?

553
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,890
A couple with a kid.

554
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:59,558
I was just fixing their tire.

555
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:02,936
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.

556
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,816
- Who are they?
- A couple, passing through.

557
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,860
Said they were heading north. Maybe.

558
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,833
You want to drive the car? Yeah?

559
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:28,045
Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore.
Into the back.

560
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:29,588
Here you go.

561
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:35,344
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.

562
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,388
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?

563
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:41,225
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.

564
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:48,482
What's the matter with you?

565
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,946
What you got there, mate?

566
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:06,875
Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.

567
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,090
Sure. It's been nice talking to you". '"Bye.

568
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:16,468
Take it you agreed with him.

569
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,470
They're not worried, I'm not worried.

570
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,097
What about that?

571
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,016
I figure it's lost property.

572
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,520
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.

573
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:30,357
Sounds okay to me, Jess.

574
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,733
Don't know.

575
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:34,736
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.

576
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:38,073
May's expecting you
up at the farm sometime.

577
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:41,785
You'll have no more trouble up there.
Just green grass.

578
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,070
How are you doing?

579
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:19,198
I'm getting there.

580
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:30,000
I reckon you ought to connect
the doohickey to the gizmo.

581
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:34,129
Come here, you.

582
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:38,091
You touch me with those hands
and I'll rip you apart. No!

583
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:40,093
Look at them! No!

584
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:03,659
May told me about the little beach
down by the trees. Do you want to come?

585
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,327
Love to.

586
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:09,832
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt,
or we're never gonna get outta here.

587
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:13,001
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.

588
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,875
If you meet Benno down there,
don't let him bother you.

589
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,585
He's only a baby.

590
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,129
Sure, May.

591
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,233
- The men.
- What men?

592
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:49,278
Now you calm down
and you tell me what's the matter.

593
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:51,113
Very, very naughty.

594
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,241
- Now, you tell May what you...
- May.

595
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:57,411
May, you call The Dark One.

596
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:00,831
And you tell him
to get here as fast as he can.

597
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,374
Why? What's going on?

598
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:05,752
I think we've got some hoon trouble.
It's gonna be all right.

599
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:10,632
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.

600
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:27,107
You've had an awful time, darling.

601
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,694
But it's all over now.

602
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:33,989
Everything's going to be all right.

603
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,788
I've just got to go and make a phone call...

604
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:44,917
...and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

605
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:06,563
The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you?

606
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,732
It's May Swaisey.

607
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,326
Sprog? Oh, no!

608
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:30,546
Sprog?

609
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,050
Sprog!

610
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:40,681
Sprog!

611
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:05,706
Well, well, well.

612
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:09,042
It's our little mother.

613
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:15,507
That there is Cundalini...

614
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:19,219
...and Cundalini wants his hand back.

615
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:22,514
I want my baby.

616
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,183
Tell you what...

617
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,519
...l'll swap you.

618
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:30,647
Please, give me my baby.

619
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:31,732
Jessie.

620
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:38,155
You've not got a sense of humor.

621
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:43,076
You've got a pretty face, though.
Awful pretty.

622
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:45,704
Awful pretty.

623
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,498
I suppose...

624
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:50,584
...you don't need a sense of humor
with a pretty face.

625
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,879
The only trouble is though, missy...

626
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,464
...if you should...

627
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:58,592
...lose the face...

628
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,552
Please, don't hurt my baby.

629
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,179
...you've got nothing!

630
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:04,056
What do you want from me?

631
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,309
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

632
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:07,976
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

633
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,229
Right there!

634
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,691
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.

635
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:15,901
Stand back!

636
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,403
- Stay back!
- Woman!

637
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:19,738
Stay back!

638
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:32,334
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!

639
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:34,086
Open that door.

640
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:36,046
Everyone of you, in there.

641
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:40,717
Put the babe on the ground.

642
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,764
Jessie, get the van.

643
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,390
Don't stop. Just go right through.

644
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:53,332
Now what?

645
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:03,342
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?

646
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,302
I don't know, it just died on me.

647
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:56,562
Jessie!

648
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:58,480
Where?

649
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:02,192
Lord, have mercy!

650
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:49,573
What do you reckon?

651
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:51,825
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.

652
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,660
This your subdural?

653
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:56,038
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems?

654
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:59,791
Multiple traumas, spleen,
liver, lung, flail chest...

655
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,628
...left neck of femur, renal shutdown.

656
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:05,130
Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable?

657
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:08,133
Yeah, sure,
we got all her signs back last night.

658
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:09,968
- Relatives?
- The husband.

659
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,095
They lost the kid. DOA.

660
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:16,558
Listen, tell him she's going to be all right.
Tell him not to worry.

661
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,852
Tell him, if he wants, I'll talk to him.

662
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:22,189
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.

663
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:25,400
He's been standing there
like a zombie all day.

664
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:30,424
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?

665
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,427
You come for the grunt?

666
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:36,388
She won't be ready until this afternoon.

667
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,932
Still having trouble with the front forks.

668
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:41,185
They're mongrels to work with.

669
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:45,022
You asshole!

670
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:47,065
What the molly fuck
you think you're doing?

671
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:50,611
You and me are gonna talk
about the Toecutter.

672
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:52,779
Never heard of him.

673
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,574
What the Christ are you?

674
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:57,743
I wanna know about the tattoo.

675
01:16:57,868 --> 01:16:59,745
I mind my own business, don't I?

676
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:02,289
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?

677
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:20,140
I'll say the names,
and you say "yes" or "no"."

678
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:23,101
Nightrider...

679
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:27,481
...Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.

680
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:28,982
There's more?

681
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:31,151
- Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?

682
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,946
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?

683
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,907
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.

684
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:38,700
Are they coming back?

685
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:41,411
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.

686
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:43,580
For Christ's sake!

687
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:45,374
I don't know.

688
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:03,924
<i>Code Unspecified.</i>

689
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:07,511
<i>We have a query
locate on a black Pursuit Special.</i>

690
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,722
<i>Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.</i>

691
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:16,103
<i>This is designated as a potential

692
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:11,783
Quit toying, Bubba.

693
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:15,245
Easy. I know what I'm doing.

694
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:40,344
Hi.

695
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:45,724
This isn't what it looks, man.

696
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:48,894
I just came down here
to check it out, and...

697
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:51,855
...this guy, he's already snuffed it.

698
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,191
Nothing you could do for him.

699
01:27:55,818 --> 01:27:56,777
Ankle.

700
01:27:58,445 --> 01:27:59,696
It's okay.

701
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:06,245
What are you doing, man?

702
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:20,884
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do
with anything going on back there, man.

703
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:25,139
Listen, man, will you? Listen to me!

704
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:28,100
They were a hell of a lot of
crazy people back there, man.

705
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:32,604
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.

706
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:37,442
What are you doing, man?

707
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:42,114
What do you say? What are you doing?

708
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,202
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.

709
01:28:47,286 --> 01:28:49,329
I'm sick, see? Sick.

710
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:51,623
What do you call it?

711
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:54,668
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.

712
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,879
The court, man, he said so.

713
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:59,381
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

714
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,471
Jesus! You can't kill me!

715
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,724
Not for stealing a man's boots!

716
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:12,394
He was dead, for Christ's sake!

717
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:16,773
He won't need 'em anymore.

718
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:19,860
What are you doing?

719
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:24,156
I wanna know what you're doing.

720
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:33,457
The chain in those handcuffs
is high-tensile steel.

721
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:38,795
It'd take you ten minutes
to hack through it with this.

722
01:29:40,798 --> 01:29:43,050
Now, if you're lucky...

723
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:46,386
...you could hack through your ankle
in five minutes.

724
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,471
Go.

725
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:50,808
You're mad, man!

726
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:54,102
You think I look silly, don't you?

727
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:57,356
Don't bring this on me, man.

728
01:29:57,773 --> 01:29:59,525
Don't do this to me!

729
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,821
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

730
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:04,321
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

731
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,158
Don't bring this on me, please!

732
01:32:55,993 --> 01:33:06,420
