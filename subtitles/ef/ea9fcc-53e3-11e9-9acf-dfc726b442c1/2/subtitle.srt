1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,900
We've also made 2,500kg
of morphine,

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,940
700kg of heroine

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,860
and 300kg of cocaine.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,300
Apart from reserving some for our own use
it's all exported for fund-raising

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,180
or for preaching purposes.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,620
The new tranquilliser we've had under
research has been successfully made.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,940
Chief, Asian Hawk and Alan are here.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,220
The agents of many countries
are interested in it.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,340
- We must mass-produce it.
- Take care of this.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,180
When the plant at hillside
starts production

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,060
we can cope with our needs...

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,740
Friend, could you
cut short your report?

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,940
My report's over.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,060
Brothers, after 30 days hard work,
today is festival once again.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,180
The Goddesses are now here.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,500
We should thank our true God.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,900
Supreme Creator.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,820
Thank you for bringing us
to this world

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,220
for creating the sun, moon and stars
to shine on our life.

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,900
Thank you for creating animals,
plants, everything

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,540
to keep us safe from starvation...

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,620
health and for creating sickness.

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,220
We also thank you
for creating the two sexes

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,380
to enable us to have pleasure.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,460
Thank you, Lord for your grace.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,660
The happy hour begins.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,940
Quiet!

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,140
Enjoy yourselves.

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,820
May has been captured.

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,340
Never mind. Let's go.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,020
- We must act gracefully.
- Right.

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,700
Let her try being a whore.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,300
Cut that out.

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,220
Do you know where Laura is?

35
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,220
Don't keep thinking of her.

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
You never cared for May. Now...

37
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,420
It's all right. She's now...

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,020
It's her own doing.

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,380
Women are a nuisance.

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,780
You're a nuisance.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,860
- What are you doing?
- I'll exorcise your spirits.

42
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,100
Spirits? I've no spirits.

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,140
Now tell the Llama.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,260
The Asian Hawk is here.

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,060
Let them do anything they please.
Don't stop them. Understand?

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,860
How long will it last?

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,700
Three days.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,300
During this time
she'll be totally in my power.

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,460
Good.

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,700
Pledge upon death
allegiance to the Chief.

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,100
I pledge upon death...

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,100
You must go with Alan to get
the 3 pieces of the Armour of God.

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,140
I must get...

54
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,380
Inject the Asian Hawk
to make him loyal to us.

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,940
Inject the Asian Hawk
to make him loyal to us.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,060
Let's drink to our meeting.

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,300
Don't drink too much,
it's very strong.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,660
Are you afraid of getting drunk?

59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,740
I'm not afraid of strong wine.

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,100
Great, isn't it?
Don't waste any time.

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,100
What are you doing?
I've already paid.

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,380
I want to talk.

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,820
There's nothing to talk about.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,740
You're the most beautiful little whore.

65
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,380
- What are you up to?
- I want to give you more wine.

66
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,140
- Who are you?
- I'm a prostitute.

67
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,820
- No, you're a well-bred girl.
- I'm not, I'm a whore.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,100
What are you trying to do?
Who on earth are you?

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm really a whore, believe me.

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,440
What is it?

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,100
The Chief says this girl is a spy.
Never mind.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,620
- You promised to bring me wine.
- OK, I will.

73
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,900
What now?

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,620
- Ask someone the way.
- What?

75
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,500
- Ask him.
- Who?

76
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,700
Buddha be praised.

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,620
That was easy.

78
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,700
He's following us. Keep calm.

79
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Don't laugh.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,100
Where's the Chinese girl?

81
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,020
- Who?
- The Chinese girl.

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,420
Downstairs, in a guarded room.

83
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,740
- What are you doing here?
- Your job?

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm in charge of storerooms, the garbage rooms,
kennels and the dungeon.

85
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,900
Let's talk in bed.

86
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,860
Get up, don't sleep.
I can't get away if you're in bed.

87
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,140
Get up.

88
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,060
You're drunk as a Lord.

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,580
I can only cope with two.

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,620
And the other one?
You want me to persuade him?

91
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,060
My hand still hurts.

92
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
It's up to you.

93
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,100
Pick up your robe.

94
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,060
This is for you.

95
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,580
Violence? I sang in a Peace Concert.

96
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,660
Violence is disgusting.

97
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,780
It's up to you. I'll fix these two.

98
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,340
Don't talk about this
when you return to Hong Kong.

99
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,780
Close the door.

100
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,300
Only a nut would rely on you.

101
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,860
I didn't ask you to come for nothing.

102
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,020
She hit me.

103
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,940
I didn't know it was you.

104
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,540
They... Everything OK?

105
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,180
- What do you want to know?
- I wish everything was OK.

106
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,420
See if there's a key.

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,940
Would a nobody have the keys?

108
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,260
Right you are.

109
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,780
Girls are great sometimes.

110
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,580
Help tie them up.

111
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,260
Laura...

112
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,700
I had so much trouble
finding you, Laura.

113
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,340
Laura, it's Jackie.

114
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,620
Are you all right? You're scaring me.

115
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm scared.

116
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,580
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here.

117
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,180
Maybe she's in shock.

118
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,100
Let's talk after we get out.

119
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,460
Get her out of here at once.

120
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,780
Hurry up.

121
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,660
Bye...

122
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,460
See you next time.

123
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,500
Thank you.

124
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,300
The earliest flight's tomorrow.

125
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,260
Let's spend the night here.

126
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,380
OK.

127
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,780
Anyway, Laura's unfit to travel.

128
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,460
She'll be all right tomorrow.

129
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,060
Make yourselves at home.

130
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,660
We still have to keep
our promise to your daddy.

131
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,020
What?

132
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,500
- What?
- Never mind. Go to bed early.

133
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,020
I'll see what I can do.

134
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,980
- Good night.
- Good night.

135
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,620
I'll go up with them.

136
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
I'm really grateful.

137
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,780
It's nothing much.

138
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,580
It's been unexpectedly easy.

139
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,660
Of course, with me here.
I am a lucky charm.

140
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,620
- Good night.
- Good night.

141
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Good night.

142
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,500
Let's go.

143
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll take them to Frankfurt airport
for a flight to Hong Kong

144
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,700
before coming back.

145
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,260
Is that necessary?

146
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,340
I like to keep my promises
but more than that, I want to do it.

147
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,460
Want to play whore again?

148
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,360
Sorry. Good night.

149
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,940
You want to see
the Armour of God now?

150
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,540
How about seeing it tomorrow?

151
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,220
I really want to see it.

152
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,660
OK...

153
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,860
I'll show it to you.

154
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,340
What are you doing?

155
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,300
- You act as if Laura were kidnapped again.
- It's nothing.

156
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,060
Why do you need me then?

157
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,100
Can't I just pay you a visit?

158
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,740
Go and see Laura then.

159
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,460
She won't do anything.

160
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,260
So you come to see me?
What do you want?

161
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,620
Sorry, I don't know how to put it.

162
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,820
What is it?

163
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,980
Did you notice
anything wrong with Laura?

164
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,220
It's natural
after a long confinement.

165
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,980
She looks funny to me.

166
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,860
She's no longer as young as she was.

167
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,420
She wants to see the Armour of God now.
Isn't that a bit fishy?

168
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,820
Fishy yourself.
She's always been curious.

169
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,340
And she was kidnapped for it.
Let her see it.

170
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,340
Borrow it from May then.

171
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,420
She just slapped me in the face.

172
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,180
Slapped you in the face?

173
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,100
Why? Tell me about it.

174
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,100
Are you sure you want to borrow it?
Come on, but you ask her.

175
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,020
Knock at the door.

176
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,500
No answer. She must be
taking a bath or changing.

177
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,020
Just see for yourself.

178
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,820
May.

179
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,740
- She's not in.
- Wait till she comes back.

180
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Laura's waiting.
I'll show her and put it back.

181
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,500
Hurry up.

182
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,180
Jackie, why are you at my door?

183
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,460
I...

184
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,620
You standing at my door when
I'm not here. What are you doing?

185
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,340
Trying to take the Armour of God?

186
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,860
No.

187
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,860
Get out at once.

188
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,300
I hate intruders or those
who do not respect others' privacy.

189
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,780
Listen.

190
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,380
I'd like to apologise.

191
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,860
I know I was wrong.

192
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,380
You do?

193
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,020
I don't.

194
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,780
- What?
- I know I should watch my language.

195
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,060
- And?
- And?

196
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,860
What else is there?

197
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,860
Why didn't you kiss me?

198
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,620
I wanted to, but...

199
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,940
What is it?

200
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
I've something to show you.

201
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,760
Something to show me?

202
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,280
But I can't show you here.

203
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,160
Where then?

204
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,480
Come to my room.
Come, I'll follow you. Go now.

205
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
Why show me in your room?

206
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,520
I'll tell you there.

207
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,280
I thought you had
something to show me.

208
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,280
Show you?

209
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
I'll show you some children's photos.

210
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,160
Laura.

211
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,600
Is that what you wanted me to see?

212
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,560
May, listen to me.

213
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,840
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

214
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,560
I wanted to see you.

215
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,640
What for?

216
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,520
Don't you know I missed you?

217
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,960
Don't, Laura, don't!

218
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,520
Don't let Alan see.

219
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't mention him.

220
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
Laura, don't.

221
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Wait a minute.

222
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Jackie.

223
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
- Has Laura been here?
- No.

224
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,960
- Isn't she in the room?
- No.

225
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,720
- Anybody in?
- No.

226
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,480
No?

227
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,160
What a liar.

228
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
Who is it?

229
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
May.

230
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
Don't be shy.

231
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,160
I didn't want to embarrass her.

232
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
Let's go out and let her stay.

233
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,080
OK.

234
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
I'll be back right away.

235
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,360
When did that start?

236
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,640
Just now.

237
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,360
Frankly, that slap was good for you.

238
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,800
Good?

239
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,000
- Your bathroom?
- My bathroom opens onto hers.

240
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,680
Pretend you know nothing
when she comes out.

241
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,440
You've been to his room,
you've seen it.

242
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,240
- I didn't see anything.
- Stop acting.

243
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,960
I don't have to see it to know.

244
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,320
- You don't mind then?
- No, times are different now.

245
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
This brings us closer.

246
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,240
So you're more than friends,
you share everything.

247
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,240
- Right, we're better than friends.
- Right!

248
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
Friends.

249
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,040
You're worse than beasts.

250
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,160
You're accusing me again?

251
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,360
She seems to have
suffered a big shock.

252
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,080
I didn't do anything.

253
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,160
I'll give her a piece of my mind.

254
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,320
No need. See if Laura's in.

255
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,320
- I have a way with girls.
- Go ahead.

256
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,600
May's a good girl.

257
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,000
- I know.
- She's good for you.

258
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,400
Go now...

259
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
Go.

260
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,320
You again?

261
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm arranging for a couple
to make love.

262
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,640
- What?
- Not you.

263
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,520
Why are you packing?

264
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,360
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'm leaving.

265
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,200
- What are you doing?
- Helping you pack.

266
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
May...

267
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,840
That room is linked to this one?
Nonsense.

268
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Laura.

269
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,000
What is it, Jackie?

270
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,400
Alan and Laura have taken
the Armour of God.

271
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,280
How come?

272
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,880
I must go up.

273
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,680
What about me?

274
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
You help me arrange something.

275
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,480
What's wrong with the dogs?

276
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's go and see.

277
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,800
Calm down.

278
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
Snookums.

279
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,000
Don't be afraid.

280
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,840
It's all right. I'll help you.

281
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,320
- What did you call him?
- Snookums.

282
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,760
- Only she calls me that name.
- Disgusting.

283
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,960
What took you?

284
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,280
- Don't you know what you did?
- I do, but we couldn't help it.

285
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Luckily we're both all right.

286
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
I believe you too.

287
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,560
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
called me Snookums.

288
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,040
Disgusting.
How are we going to get out?

289
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,920
Laura and I escape.
You try to escape by yourself.

290
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,880
- You have so much confidence in me?
- I only promised to help Laura out -

291
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
not you.

292
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,520
Bravo, Snookums.

293
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,200
Now you've a chance
to even things up.

294
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,040
He always accused me
of taking away his love.

295
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,680
You're great, I can't get out.

296
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,440
- Go and take good care of Laura.
- You don't have to tell me that.

297
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,480
- Let's go before it's too late.
- We can't leave him behind.

298
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,360
Laura, forget me, an unlucky man.

299
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,960
Good luck to you both.

300
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,280
Why won't you rescue him?

301
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,880
I had a wish when I was a kid -
to save every man like Jesus does.

302
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,640
When I grew up,
I realised one man's strength is limited.

303
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,640
If he comes we won't all get away.

304
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Right, Laura, don't be emotional.

305
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,560
Jackie's kung fu is limited.

306
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,600
If he tries to save me too,
then we'll all be captured.

307
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,800
Leave me, follow him.

308
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,600
Nothing would please me more
than to see you both happy and free.

309
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,520
Go now.

310
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,280
Alan, you're so nice to me.
I was right about you.

311
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,360
You go, I've decided to stay.

312
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,520
You don't mean what you say.

313
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,120
I've been wondering
why I lost Laura to you.

314
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Now I've learnt your trick.

315
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,200
I must rescue you, come what may.

316
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,360
As I said, you're the bravest man.

317
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,880
But girls only fall for sweet talk.

318
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,560
- I must thank you then.
- Never. I won't help you for free.

319
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,040
They're demanding a ransom
of $5 million.

320
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,880
- Give me at least half that.
- Don't be so mean, it's not you.

321
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,400
He always acts the good guy.
So I'm forced to play the bad guy.

322
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
Teasing me?

323
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm not afraid.

324
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Remember, be alert.

325
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
I know. What nonsense.

326
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm all right.

327
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,600
This way looks better.

328
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,120
You go that way then.

329
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,800
It makes no difference.

330
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,800
Let's split up after this.
I'll take care of the guards.

331
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,720
- What about you?
- Me?

332
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,760
Forget me, an unlucky man.

333
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,080
Never mind him, he never changes.

334
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,520
He's only thinking
of the Armour of God.

335
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,280
Don't kick off
the ladder after going up.

336
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,440
- Why are you giving me this?
- To make coffee.

337
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,800
- A knife? I don't like violence.
- Take it to kill yourself.

338
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,040
Be careful, this path is dark.

339
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
Don't worry.

340
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,120
I'm used to it.
I grew up in the country.

341
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,320
Mud, stones and ponds...

342
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,160
Come on.

343
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,720
Help me, Jackie...

344
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,640
One word and I'll stab you to death.

345
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,360
Quiet!

346
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,320
Why is he here?

347
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,200
- Find the other one.
- Yes, sir.

348
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
Get him.

349
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,880
Come out.

350
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,880
I'm not fighting. Don't pull.
Stop pulling...

351
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
Well, you've provoked me.

352
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,360
Brother, my pants are coming down.

353
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
No more pranks.

354
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,200
- Take Laura.
- Keep them here.

355
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,080
- Go now.
- Need help?

356
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,120
No.

357
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,880
Keep it up...

358
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,520
Jackie, watch out!

359
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,800
- I really must go.
- Go then.

360
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,200
- Kuang Sheng!
- Come on!

361
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
Goodbye.

362
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,200
- After them!
- Yes, sir!

363
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
Come on.

364
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Put out the fire.

365
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,680
Wait, we meet again.

366
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,760
Over there.

367
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
Give me that.

368
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Fly...

369
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,040
Give them to me.

370
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,760
Get down!

371
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,960
There's a door behind you, go now.
Don't come back.

372
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
I won't.

373
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,360
When I count to 3, run.
Ready, 1, 2, 3.

374
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,640
Go now.

375
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,440
A man?

376
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,480
Come on.

377
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
Split up.

378
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,520
Jackie, we're really leaving this time.
Take care.

379
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Over there, follow him.

380
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,960
Don't go.

381
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,760
There's something you don't know.

382
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm no fool.

383
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,880
Who are you?

384
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,040
Get him!

385
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,120
- Go out and block all the exits!
- Yes, sir.

386
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,680
Are you Asian Hawk?

387
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
Yes.

388
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,120
This is Europe.

389
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,640
To a hawk's eyes,
there's no difference.

390
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,000
Stealing a piece
of the Armour of God?

391
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,920
Not a piece, the set.
I'll take it, if you don't object.

392
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,560
What gave you the nerve
to come and get killed here?

393
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,920
I always obey my God's order.

394
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,200
He provides board and lodging for me.

395
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,360
I never say no to him.

396
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,120
What's the name of your religion?

397
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,560
What's the name of your God?

398
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,480
I believe in a powerful religion.

399
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,040
The name of my God is Money.

400
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,840
Now sacrifice yourself for money.

401
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,600
You'll die for sure.

402
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,640
I'm being easy on them
because they are girls.

403
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,120
So a money-worshipper has heart.

404
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,760
These girls have no feelings.

405
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,760
They only know that
if someone is against us,

406
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
they will kill them.

407
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,920
Risking my life for myself is better
than you brainwashing the masses.

408
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,560
You cause so much fighting
and killing. What for?

409
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,760
You bring misfortune to the world.

410
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,720
I'll take these, if no one objects.

411
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,000
No one objects? If we each give you
a punch, you'll be finished.

412
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,520
You can't scare me.

413
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,800
- Tear him in two and offer him up.
- Yes.

414
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
He's bluffing.

415
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,880
Try me.

416
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,120
I knew you were bluffing.

418
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,800
This time I'll give you a chance.
Next time I'll let it blow up.

419
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,360
At worst we'll perish together.

420
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,600
We're ready to sacrifice
for the true God. Right?

421
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Yes.

422
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,440
Let me see how great you are.

423
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,040
Why make unnecessary sacrifices?

424
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,240
I'm only taking a few things.

425
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,720
Yellow smoke, over there.

426
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,640
- Fly over at once.
- Help me.

427
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,080
Fly closer.

428
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,800
Coming.

429
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,120
Jackie, how are you doing?

430
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,520
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Keep up the speed.

431
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,900
Watch out!
