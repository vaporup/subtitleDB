1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,400
Get down on your knees!

2
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,440
Listen carefully.

3
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,880
Jackie and Alan were close friends,
but later clashed because of Laura.

4
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,640
Jackie left the band to start his
career as a high society Robin Hood,

5
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,280
calling himself Asian Hawk.

6
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,280
What has this to do with the
last 3 pieces of The Armour of God?

7
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,960
A holy sword recently
put up for auction

8
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,640
was stolen by him
from an African tribe.

9
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,840
If he can get the sword
he can get the remaining 2 pieces.

10
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,200
Let's hire him
to get the other pieces then.

11
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
Idiot, let him continue.

12
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,240
We can hire him to do that,
but we don't have to pay him.

13
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,840
What do you mean?

14
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Laura is now a famous fashion designer.

15
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,240
She's going to a fashion show in Paris.

16
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,920
She's Alan's girlfriend
but Jackie still cares for her.

17
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Get Laura for me.

18
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,760
Now the "star"
of today's auction appears.

19
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,040
This is the famous holy sword.

20
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,040
The starting bid is $30,000
increasing in units of $5,000.

21
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,960
I now declare the auction open.

22
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,760
- $35,000.
- $40,000 - $45,000.

23
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,160
- Any bid higher than $45,000?
- $50,000.

24
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,200
- $55,000.
- $60,000.

25
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
$65,000.

26
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,320
Any bid higher than $65,000?

27
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,400
It seems we're still warming up.

28
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,520
Any bid higher than $65,000?

29
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,880
$70,000.

30
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Any bid higher than $70,000?

31
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,160
$75,000, $75,000.

32
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
$100,000.

33
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
The lady offers $100,000.

34
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Any bid higher than $100,000?

35
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,720
Anyone offering higher than $100,000?
The bid has now reached $100,000.

36
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,520
$105,000.

37
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
I bid $150,000.

38
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,880
The lady bids as much as $150,000.
Any bid higher than $150,000?

39
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,480
$150,000 is close to the true value
of this holy sword.

40
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,440
Any bid higher than $150,000?

41
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Any bid?

42
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,760
I offer $300,000.

43
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,200
What an exciting bid!
The gentleman seems determined to win it.

44
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,720
$300,000 is undeniably
a very attractive bid.

45
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,280
Let's see if anyone
wants to raise the bid.

46
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,240
Any bid higher than $300,000?

47
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,560
Any bid higher than $300,000?

48
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
$300,000, going once.

49
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,280
$300,000, going twice.

50
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,880
I offer $400,000.

51
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,920
$400,000!

52
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,600
I proudly announce the conclusion
of the bid at $400,000.

53
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,000
You did well to have won.

54
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,520
You did better
to have got such a good price.

55
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
Yes.

56
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,520
What a beautiful car.

57
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,560
- Let me give you a lift.
- OK.

58
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,400
Stop.

59
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
What is it?

60
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,200
The car's great,
but the wind's too strong.

61
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,200
I'd rather take my own car.

62
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
I can drive more slowly.

63
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Go!

64
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
Thank you.

65
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,720
Room 206, please.

66
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,840
Mr. Chen, some messages for you.

67
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
Thank you.

68
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,800
So many.

69
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,120
Please, call back. It's urgent.

70
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,840
Help! Please, call my cellular phone.

71
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm booking a flight.

72
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm trying to get a seat.
Wait for me.

73
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm flying to your side to seek help.

74
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm waiting at the airport.
Don't go away.

75
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,160
Where on earth have you been?
I'm waiting in the lobby. It's urgent.

76
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Come at once. Only you can help me.

77
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
Jackie.

78
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
Laura's been kidnapped?
How much do they want?

79
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,680
If money could fix it,
I wouldn't need you.

80
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,960
If money can't fix it,
I'm not needed either.

81
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm not a volunteer.

82
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
They want the Armour of God
as ransom.

83
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,680
The Armour of God?

84
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,520
You said it's worth a lot of money.

85
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
I've just sold the holy sword.

86
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,000
Buy it back for me at once.

87
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
The Armour of God consists
of five pieces

88
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,720
but I only know
the whereabouts of three.

89
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Where?

90
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,760
Two were sold to a Count.
The last was sold to a lady.

91
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
You can get it back then.

92
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Why should I help you?

93
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,240
What a silly question.
Don't you care for Laura?

94
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,480
Don't take advantage of my feelings.

95
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,120
What about the feelings between us?

96
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
What feelings between us?

97
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,280
What? We grew up together.

98
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,560
We formed a band together
and chased the same girl.

99
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,200
We were like brothers.

100
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,120
Don't you remember?
You always bullied me.

101
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,280
You said my voice was bad.

102
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,080
When I dated Laura,
you stole my pants.

103
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,120
Have you no shame?

104
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,360
So you still hate me
because you lost Laura.

105
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,440
I didn't lose her, but I don't want
this to affect our friendship.

106
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,840
So, you do think
there's friendship between us.

107
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,000
There was, but not now.

108
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
So you suffered greatly because of her.

109
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,120
I shouldn't have come to you.

110
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,760
I'll try some other way to rescue her.
I just hope she's still alive.

111
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,760
Have you finished the American
ginseng I gave you?

112
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,600
- Yes, two years ago.
- I like the stamps you sent me.

113
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,960
I came in such a rush,
I didn't bring anything much.

114
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,400
Just some preserved
bean curd that you like.

115
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
It's hot.

116
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Just forget that I came.

117
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,160
- I know I'm stubborn.
- You're not.

118
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,800
I am stubborn.

119
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,080
OK, you are stubborn.
Let's not argue any more.

120
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,160
- How do you plan to rescue Laura?
- I'm not sure I want to.

121
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,520
Why?

122
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,240
You may not know it, but what I value
most is our friendship.

123
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,680
I don't want to lose you
because of Laura.

124
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Goodbye.

125
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
Hold it!

126
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,280
How can we contact
Laura's kidnappers?

127
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,840
They've given me a map.

128
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,160
They want me to bring the three
pieces of the Armour of God

129
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,120
to a small town
where we exchange for Laura.

130
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,800
Let's try to borrow the two
from the Count

131
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,040
then get in touch
with the lady buyer of the sword.

132
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,640
Do you know what it says?

133
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I think...

134
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
You don't know then.

135
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,880
Is there a bell?

136
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,240
The house is over there.

137
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,440
Stop.

138
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,920
Calm down.

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,960
What now?

140
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
What? I'm scared.

141
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,880
Excuse me. Please, follow me.

142
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,680
Now I know what that sign says.

143
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,680
Even a moron knows now.

144
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,160
The owner of this house
must hate deer.

145
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,560
Deer hunting is a European pastime.

146
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,240
Don't be afraid. He's leashed.
Please come with me.

147
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,880
So you need these pieces
to avert a world disaster?

148
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,360
It's not that serious.

149
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,760
The fact is we need them
as ransom for my girlfriend

150
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,160
or they'll kill her.
Isn't that serious enough?

151
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,640
To me, every life
is equally as important...

152
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,560
or unimportant.

153
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,880
If I lend you these to save her life,
I'd have to donate all my property

154
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,000
to save the countless
starving in Africa.

155
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,960
I'll return them to you
once we've saved her.

156
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
Can you guarantee that?

157
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Yes, I will.

158
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,560
But I have no reason to trust you.

159
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,680
I'll pay you for them.

160
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,560
Why would I be interested
in your money?

161
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,920
Let's not get discouraged.

162
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,840
Would you care to see my antiques?

163
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm not interested in antiques.

164
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,080
I do have an interest in them.

165
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,240
So we're two of a kind.

166
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,120
Please follow me.

167
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,880
This is amazing!

168
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,240
This looks more like a small museum.

169
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,520
In fact, museums all over the world
borrow my collections for exhibition.

170
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Security must be tight here.

171
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,640
I keep fifty dogs and three leopards.

172
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
They keep away intruders.

173
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,840
Why should I need guards?

174
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Show me your two pieces
of the Armour of God.

175
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,160
They're over there.

176
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,760
You can't leave valuables
lying around like that!

177
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,240
To me, they are a memento
from history.

178
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,240
But not everyone shares my opinion.

179
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
What's the origin of these?

180
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Are they linked
to my girlfriend's abduction?

181
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,960
Sit down...

182
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,760
They say that before Christ...

183
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,040
evil was rampant.

184
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,840
The true God that stands for justice

185
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,600
waged a holy war
against these forces.

186
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,640
Finally the true God won of course.

187
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,800
The weaponry they used is called
the Armour of God.

188
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,920
Recently evil cults
have staged a comeback.

189
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,840
They believe that by destroying
the Armour of God

190
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,600
the religion of the true God
will perish

191
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,880
and they'll prosper
and rule the world.

192
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
That really defies logic.

193
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,800
Religion exists only
when there is faith.

194
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,520
When it brings peace,
happiness and well-being

195
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
it's the force of righteousness.

196
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,280
Who kidnapped my girlfriend?

197
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,120
Sorry, I can't answer that.

198
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
It's getting late.

199
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,880
Hawk, I didn't expect your visit.

200
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
I have a party to attend.

201
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,360
Stay for a few days
and let me entertain you.

202
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,400
No need...

203
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,240
It's the most beautiful place
I've ever seen. We'd love to stay.

204
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,400
Splendid, it's settled then.
Tell my butler if you need anything.

205
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,120
Take good care
of my two guests tonight.

206
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,600
Just make yourselves at home.

207
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
Please, follow me.

208
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

209
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,920
We've only just finished supper.

210
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,720
Why have you ordered so much steak?

211
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,000
It's for the dogs and leopards.

212
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
What do you mean?

213
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,480
Hawks always take,
without asking the owner's consent.

214
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,920
What? You expect me to steal?

215
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,400
As he said, it's not guarded.

216
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
We're his guests.

217
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,920
He told us to make ourselves at home.

218
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,200
So you steal from your own home?

219
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,720
- Do you want to see Laura killed?
- Of course not.

220
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,080
You want her to be killed by others
because you can't win her love.

221
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,800
You really are crafty.

222
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,800
What? I'm saying don't steal.
Not that I won't help you.

223
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,080
When are you going to do something?

224
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,400
We're living like kings.
Have you spared a thought for Laura?

225
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,960
Don't think I feel any better.
But stealing won't work.

226
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,040
Isn't it worth trying?

227
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,760
You're more stupid than you look.
You think you can just take it?

228
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm ready to borrow the Armour of God
from the Count whatever he demands.

229
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,680
Why don't we steal it and return it later?
Isn't that more clean-cut?

230
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,160
I already said no, I won't help,
and I won't let you steal it either!

231
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,600
OK, I give up.
I never really knew you until now!

232
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Good night!

233
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
The Count wants to see you, sir.

234
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,960
Please.

235
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,040
Quiet.

236
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,000
- Are you all right?
- I was nearly the dog's dinner.

237
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
Don't worry.

238
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,040
They won't attack without orders
from me or my daughter.

239
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,240
Do something.

240
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,800
Hurry up. Out!

241
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,680
So it's you.

242
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,280
This is my daughter, May.

243
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,160
We met at the auction.

244
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,680
So you know each other.
That's better.

245
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,120
I found this.

246
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,400
- Is this the one you talked about?
- It is.

247
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,880
This is the man who got someone
to compete to buy back his own sword?

248
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,680
I didn't know she was your daughter
or I wouldn't have done it.

249
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,160
So you were up to no good.

250
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,320
And Daddy treated you as guests.

251
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,000
He did that
only to save his girlfriend.

252
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,280
I swear I will return them to you
intact after rescuing my girlfriend.

253
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,560
- What's that?
- It's not an ice-cream van.

254
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,240
- Show the police in.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,240
I'd like to let it go, but the police...

256
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,960
You've captured me.
Do anything you like!

257
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,400
Have you got the right to speak?

258
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,640
No, but you have.

259
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,800
In what way can you help me?

260
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Go on, be nice to him.

261
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,760
Do you want the Armour of God?

262
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,960
- Go and take care of the police.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,760
The Armour of God has five pieces.
The kidnappers only asked for three.

264
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,440
- So they've got the other two.
- You're smart.

265
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
That coincides with my information.

266
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,680
If you lend me your pieces,
I'll guarantee their return

267
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
and I'll get the other pieces
to make one complete set of Armour.

268
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,040
It's a deal.

269
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,600
But I have one condition.

270
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,320
I go with you.

271
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
No problem.

272
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,400
Can't two men take care of a woman?

273
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,160
OK. You must guarantee
she returns safe and sound.

274
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll only guarantee her safe return
not her sound return.

275
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,720
We'll see about the rest.

276
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,320
Splendid.

277
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
What is that?

278
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,640
You wouldn't like it.

279
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
Let my try.

280
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,480
Help yourself.

281
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,680
There's no point in worrying.

282
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,600
You won't see the kidnappers
until tomorrow.

283
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,160
I'll go with you.

284
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,960
Why are you staring at me like that?
You think women are good for nothing.

285
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,680
I was runner-up in last year's
European Women's shooting.

286
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,080
You'll be safe with me.

287
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,400
Only two women
took part in that contest.

288
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,440
What is this?

289
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
Chinese butter.

290
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,240
It tastes funny.

291
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,720
It turns into cheese
when you keep it.

292
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,320
- Jackie, this stuff is rotten.
- I know.

293
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,160
- Why are you eating it then?
- I'm eating butter.

294
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,240
Did they give you any special sign?

295
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,960
No, they only told me to come to the
town with the armour in a black bag.

296
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,960
They told me to come alone.

297
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,560
I can't accompany you then.

298
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,520
I'll keep an eye out for any suspects.

299
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,960
Let me jockey for a position.

300
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,480
You look OK.

301
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,040
She is very attractive.

302
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,360
You'd risk Laura's death with a fake.

303
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,720
We risk getting robbed
with the real one.

304
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,560
Don't hand it over until we know Laura's safe.
Let's go.

305
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Go alone. I'll keep watch.

306
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,080
- No looking at the ladies, now.
- I won't.

307
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,920
Miss, our religion
has many advantages.

308
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,000
I'll consider it.

309
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,760
- Do you believe in a Creator?
- What? I have no religious faith.

310
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,480
Believe and this person
shall be saved.

311
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,760
Laura.

312
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,920
Next time remember
to pay the balance.

313
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,960
OK.

314
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,520
The Armour of God?

315
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,760
Right here.

316
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,560
But I want to know she's safe.

317
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
It's a fake.

318
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,960
My friend's got it, but only if...

319
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,920
Don't try anything!

320
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,240
Come over here.

321
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,960
Jackie, stop fighting.
Come here. Safety zone.

322
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,520
Keep away, it's dangerous.

323
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Dangerous? Come here.
Get him, get him.

324
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,440
She's a nuisance.

325
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,040
Let's go.

326
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,280
- Let's go.
- No, we must interrogate them.

327
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,840
Go ahead...

328
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,320
Here are those two Chinese.

329
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
Let's go.

330
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
- You haven't interrogated them.
- Go ahead.

331
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,560
I said bring the genuine one.
Now what will happen to Laura?

332
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
Stop talking. It won't help her.

333
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,720
I can't even talk, now!

334
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,400
How are we going to find Laura?

335
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,640
Someone's coming to tell us.

336
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,160
Look out!

337
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,800
Look out!

338
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,080
Move it!

339
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
Look up there.

340
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Sit still.

341
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,080
They're getting close. Do something.

342
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,760
- What's that?
- Hold on.

343
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
Bump him...

344
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,840
They're coming.

345
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,960
Great, we got away from them.

346
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,640
- What are they doing?
- Trying to hit us.

347
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
What now?

348
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Hold tight.

349
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Tight?

350
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
What are you doing?

351
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
This car's crowded.

352
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,280
It was designed for me alone.

353
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,480
Goodbye!

354
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,080
Please, sit down.

355
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,000
Three beers.

356
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,360
OK, right away.

357
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
What? You asked us here for beers?

358
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,440
Next time ask what we want first.
Not everyone likes beer.

359
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,640
I ordered all three for myself only.

360
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,480
900 dinars for three beers.

361
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,920
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

362
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Keep the change.
I'd like to ask some questions.

363
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,160
My answers are very expensive.

364
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
How much?

365
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,760
US$100 for each question.

366
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,320
Normally I ask questions
everywhere I go.

367
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,480
I ask this and that.

368
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,200
I answer all questions.

369
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I saw some robed people
in the square.

370
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Who are they?

371
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
The disciples of a nearby missionary.

372
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,080
- Where can I find them?
- On the hill.

373
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
That's no way to spend money.

374
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,840
What are their other activities?

375
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,880
They come down on the first
of every month for supplies

376
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,360
and take girls with them.

377
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,760
What sort of girls?

378
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,480
Don't answer that. Let's go.

379
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,440
- Do you know what they are?
- Prostitutes, of course.

380
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,280
We must spend $100 more.

381
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,480
Tell us the route to go up.

382
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,760
Sorry, I don't know.

383
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,960
Thank you.

384
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,080
- We'll come again next month.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

385
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,880
Hurry up.

386
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,520
Drop it.

387
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,600
- Why are you here?
- I'm a prostitute.

388
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,840
This is dangerous.
What will you do after getting there?

389
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,080
Don't worry. At worst I'll die.

390
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,520
No need to die.
I'll show you how to be a whore.

391
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,520
It's nice to see you. Come down.

392
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,120
Come down... Come down...

393
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,400
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

394
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,640
Be careful.

395
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,520
This way, please.

396
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,040
Go up.

397
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,280
May God bless you.

398
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,160
According to our latest report over
3000 new disciples joined last month.

399
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Come in...

400
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,600
Tell them come in.
This time we're getting more.

401
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,680
Yes.

402
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,440
It means more
believe in our religion.

403
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,920
Well done...

404
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,760
What about the harvest?

405
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,560
The poppies produced
3,600kg of opium.

406
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,000
It can be delivered soon.

407
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm tired.

408
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,520
This long flight of stairs
is killing me.

409
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,800
Get going. No more nonsense.
