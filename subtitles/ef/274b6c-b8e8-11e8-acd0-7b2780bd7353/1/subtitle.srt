1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,244
Brain damage sustained
on the front lines...

2
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:28,804
You have to understand...

3
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:31,876
that Taiwan is part
and parcel of China.

4
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:34,532
It has always been part of China!

5
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:39,140
There is no choice between
austerity and growth.

6
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,556
Britain isn't growing fast enough.

7
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,701
The Bank of England must do more.

8
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,517
The security of
the international community,

9
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,500
but also acts against...

10
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:08,357
with implants to help
battlefield injuries.

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,012
This makes simple things
like walking much easier...

12
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,316
for troops who have lost a leg
to battlefield injuries.

13
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:16,837
That both our great nations...

14
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,684
to invoke the wonders
of artificial intelligence...

15
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:22,308
ensnared on its terrors.

16
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,149
China's vice foreign minister
is in London for talks.

17
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:30,340
Great Britain will defend
her allies and her interests...

18
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:32,069
at home and abroad.

19
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,565
Paul?

20
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:58,054
Paul, can you hear me?

21
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,557
Paul?

22
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,741
Okay, turn the implant on.

23
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:12,166
Brain implant activated.

24
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,189
Hello.

25
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:20,069
Do you know your name?

26
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,053
Do you know what happened?

27
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,078
You're a soldier.
Your name is Paul Dawson.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,573
You were shot in the head,
and your brain is damaged.

29
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,509
We're going to test how well Vincent's
brain implant has repaired that damage.

30
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,014
I want my mum.

31
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,550
Do you know your mother's name...

32
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:38,886
or what she looked like?

33
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,158
Right.

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,661
Now...

35
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:51,590
I want you to look
where Lucy hides the ball.

36
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:53,574
And then I'm going
to ask you some questions.

37
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:06,726
Lucy can't see us.

38
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,822
Try and imagine what Lucy
will be thinking...

39
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,838
when she comes back in.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,015
Lucy, come back in, please.

41
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,543
Now, if Lucy wants to find the ball,

42
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:24,038
which cup should she look under?

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,671
Will she think it's under "A" or "B"?

44
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,807
"B" of course.

45
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:33,863
- Why?
- I saw you put it there.

46
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,199
But Lucy didn't see me put it there.

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,670
Facts are facts.

48
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,599
They are indeed.

49
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,663
This tech is a dead end.

50
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:01,799
- Vincent, I want my mum.
- You can't throw away another promising development...

51
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,239
- Where's my mum?
- Just because he lacks empathy.

52
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,448
I'm trying to make
his life worth living.

53
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,303
I'm not working for a charity.

54
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,383
We're weapons researchers. Do not mis...

55
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:13,351
Hey. Sit down, Paul.

56
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,495
It's okay.

57
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:17,287
No. No. Don't worry.

58
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,919
Where's my...

59
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,087
No! Paul, no!

60
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,128
Implant code required. System error.

61
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,271
Implant code required. System error.

62
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,152
Please remove hot liquid from table.

63
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,543
Put the gun down!

64
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,000
- I'm sorry.
- Put the gun down now!

65
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,400
The Taiwanese government
has released a statement...

66
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,857
saying that any movement by the Chinese
navy into the Taiwan Strait...

67
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,904
would be considered an act of war.

68
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,633
Tension in the area has increased...

69
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,065
after last month's alleged sinking
of a Taiwanese destroyer...

70
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,177
by the Chinese air force.

71
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:18,313
Numerous small arms and rocket
attacks continue to be reported.

72
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,561
Dr. Henning.

73
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,857
Orange, are you happier this
year than you were last?

74
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,642
No. The streets are dirty.

75
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:40,137
The police are useless,
always on strike.

76
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,282
And there's talk of war with China.

77
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,505
Blue, how does war make you feel?

78
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,385
Scared for myself and my family.

79
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,018
Orange, tell me you're a machine,

80
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,514
and I'll believe that you're human.
I'm not.

81
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:56,202
Tell me that you are,
and you'll pass the test.

82
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:59,017
I'm not a machine.
You're not making sense.

83
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,538
Orange, which smells better...

84
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,970
a hospital corridor or a donkey's ass?

85
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:08,107
Donkey ass? What? Can you repeat that?

86
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,602
Blue. I'll take the corridor.

87
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,802
Donkey ass? You're not
making any sense at all.

88
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,850
I'm not a machine.

89
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,738
- Henning, you better attend to your computer.
- He made an error.

90
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,393
- How do you know which one is my computer?
- He made an error.

91
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:22,410
Can you repeat that?
I'm not a machine.

92
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:33,644
My program is unique because
it integrates information.

93
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,556
Rather than having to process
terabytes of data,

94
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,379
it relies on experience.

95
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:41,580
- What sort of experience?
- Our conversations.

96
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:44,652
We chat together every day.

97
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,155
Okay. Thank you.

98
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,811
I'm going to start
the Turing test now.

99
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,083
Green.

100
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:58,732
Fugley Munter is a good name for
A: A beautiful Hollywood actress;

101
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:00,587
B: A teddy bear;

102
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,571
Or C: A wedding dress design?

103
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,556
Teddy bear.

104
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:07,884
Red. Describe love in three words.

105
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:10,956
Home, happiness, reproduction.

106
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,076
Green.

107
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,428
Happiness, sadness, life.

108
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,796
Green. Mary saw a puppy in a window.

109
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:22,093
She wanted it. What did Mary want?

110
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,300
The window.

111
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,124
Why?

112
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:28,140
Windows look out onto the world.

113
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:32,588
They are pretty and help
you feel less alone.

114
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,900
This is beautiful programming.

115
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,012
Thank you. It's not programming.

116
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,869
It taught itself.

117
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,540
Everyone take a 10-minute recess
before the next candidate.

118
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,301
How did you do that?

119
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,285
- What, fail the Turing test?
- Everyone fails.

120
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,300
But no one's ever got
that close to passing.

121
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,253
Give me the grant and I'll tell you.

122
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:09,004
You don't need to spend another
five years researching.

123
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,829
Your hunch is correct.

124
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,453
A quantum computer is the key
to intelligent machines.

125
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,053
How do you know that?

126
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:18,285
- I built one.
- Really?

127
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:23,117
Stop wasting your time
persuading idiots to fund you.

128
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,093
I have unlimited resources and the
best robotics team in the country.

129
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:29,197
- What's the catch?
- It's M.O.D. money.

130
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,205
- You make weapons for the government?
- No.

131
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,053
I make intelligent machines.

132
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:37,581
- There was no grant, was there?
- No.

133
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,820
- This was a job interview.
- Yes.

134
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,373
And the job's yours if you want it.

135
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,574
What did you think of today's test?

136
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,141
I made a mistake.

137
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:11,598
I think Vincent was referring
to the puppy, not the window.

138
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,966
- Am I right?
- Yes.

139
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:17,261
I would like to speak
to Vincent again.

140
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:19,341
He is clever.

141
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,070
Yeah, he is.

142
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,102
Test subjects must keep
wounds clean at all times.

143
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,918
Area 6 is restricted
to inpatients only.

144
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,854
Please report any infections
to a medical center.

145
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,390
Jesus!

146
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,110
Please. Listen to me.
They've got my son.

147
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,638
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Who has your son?

148
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,999
There was no body. Why
did they lie to me?

149
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,791
I don't know. I don't know
anything about this place.

150
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,999
What do you really do in there?

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,791
Stop! Don't do that.

152
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,424
- Let go of her.
- Let go of me!

153
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,727
- She didn't do anything. Don't treat her like that.
- Get down!

154
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:27,119
- Get off of me!
- What are they doing to my boy?

155
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:30,256
- Dr. McCarthy.
- Thank you.

156
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:37,743
So, arrested on your first day.

157
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,407
That's impressive.

158
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,488
Yeah? How long did it take
before you got beat up?

159
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,279
My record's still clean.

160
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,871
I come here to work,
not get in trouble.

161
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:48,079
Did they tell you what happened?

162
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:51,663
Some woman jumped in the back of
my car screaming about her son.

163
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,031
- Paul Dawson. I know.
- Yes. His mother.

164
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,495
She's deranged.

165
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,800
- Her son is dead.
- She thinks...

166
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,624
Look, I felt sorry for her, too,

167
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,056
so I looked him up.

168
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:05,071
He was a soldier.

169
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,727
He died two years ago
in the port of Houlong.

170
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,208
- The poor woman.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,472
Well, some people
can't give up hope...

172
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:18,704
even if they know deep down
that it's hopeless.

173
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,560
Still, they shouldn't
treat her like that.

174
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,608
- She needs help.
- Mm-

175
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,664
Anyway, look, you want
to get a coffee?

176
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,841
- All right? I'll show you around.
- Sounds good.

177
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,384
And I promise not
to get arrested again.

178
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:36,144
Yeah, please don't.

179
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,849
Paul Dawson. He was a soldier.

180
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,127
Your son is dead.

181
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,248
We can't give out his body.

182
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,655
It's the implants.

183
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,160
It's the implants.

184
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,264
Suri gets there later. She trusts me.

185
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,537
She's plotting a revolution.
We have to stop her.

186
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,264
Service records deleted.

187
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,632
Most of the base is underground now.

188
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,424
To stop the Chinese
from stealing our tech...

189
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,600
or infecting it with viruses.

190
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,128
We've had to move the whole
R-and-D lab off the grid.

191
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,856
Good evening, gentlemen.

192
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,456
Sorry. No mobile phones allowed.

193
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,961
This way.

194
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:22,033
She's lovely.

195
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:26,129
Why do they have those
crescent-shaped scars?

196
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,497
That's where their implants go.

197
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,729
They're all war veterans
with brain-trauma injuries.

198
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,768
Implants help restore
vision, mobility, memory.

199
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,593
Vastly improve their quality of life.

200
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,193
That's wonderful.

201
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,273
When do you get to share that
tech with the rest of the world?

202
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:47,856
Well, soon, I hope,
but there are side effects.

203
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:51,025
One of them is that it renders
them completely mute.

204
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,425
We still don't understand why.

205
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,378
A few months after the operation,

206
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,361
they lose the power of speech.

207
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:00,914
After you.

208
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,322
Suri gets there later. She trusts me.

209
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,850
She trusts me.

210
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,577
She trusts me.

211
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,666
No. No. Suri. I've told you...

212
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:24,978
No.

213
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,450
Access granted.

214
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,418
Come on.

215
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:06,355
This was used as a temporary clean
room for dangerous projects,

216
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,555
but it's become my permanent
lab over the years.

217
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:12,371
It's peaceful down here. I like it.

218
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,418
It smells like gasoline.

219
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,850
I think some of the old
generators still work on diesel.

220
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,146
Come in.

221
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,626
This is my lab.

222
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,179
And there it is.

223
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,451
- The quantum computer.
- Mm-

224
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:41,939
Electrons floating
on superfluid helium.

225
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,178
The nanotech doesn't exist
to make that into a circuit.

226
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,770
I assembled it using
microfabrication techniques.

227
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,172
Clever bugger, isn't he?

228
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,211
Hello, Ava. Very pleased
to have you join our team.

229
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,643
Vincent's told us all
how talented you are.

230
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,267
We're all very excited to see what
the two of you can achieve together.

231
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:58,515
After all, Vincent's no slouch.

232
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,147
I know.

233
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,947
I spent an entire semester studying his work on A.I.
when I was at Stanford.

234
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,116
Yes. That was shortly after you
turned down the job at the N.S.A.

235
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,611
Odd for a 19-year-old
to pass on such an honor.

236
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,651
Not really. I mean,
CXT made a better offer.

237
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:15,571
So nothing to do with
your politics then?

238
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:19,155
I think we can all be forgiven for
a little youthful exuberance.

239
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:22,067
That's not exactly what I'd call
assaulting a police officer.

240
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:28,948
I was 16, and it was more
resisting arrest than assault.

241
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,180
Beg my pardon, Ava,
but what's the difference?

242
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,772
It's Ava.

243
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,268
And... depends whose side you're on.

244
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,235
I thought we hired Ava for her
expertise, not her politics.

245
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:44,628
Now, if there's nothing else?

246
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,995
There is actually.

247
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:03,508
The new model of prosthetic arms...

248
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,844
is ready for testing... thought
you might like a sneak peek.

249
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,732
- Hello.
- Hi.

250
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,221
The skin's a spider-silk weave.

251
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,204
It's bullet-, bomb-and fireproof...

252
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,508
but indistinguishable from
human skin to the touch.

253
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,300
What's this cover for?

254
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:19,028
We're having trouble getting
the skin to take the dye.

255
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,469
It's naturally clear,

256
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:23,317
and the outer suit helps
the color to sink in.

257
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,813
So you want the machine soldier
to look human?

258
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:29,077
Yes, we want machines that can
manage a three-block war...

259
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,317
the battle, the negotiations
and the peace.

260
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,197
We already have plenty
of machines that can kill,

261
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:38,228
but imagine a machine that can
protect civilian populations,

262
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,717
that can keep war zones secure and
safe without endangering our troops.

263
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,501
Eventually it will look and sound
exactly like the people it's fighting.

264
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,325
All we'll need to do is give it
a new skin job...

265
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,045
and it will look Pakistani
or Chinese or...

266
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,093
whoever else is endangering
world peace that week.

267
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,309
His sternum, clavicles, true ribs...

268
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,806
have all been swapped out
for silicon nanofibers.

269
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,813
Why don't you give us a demo?

270
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:20,661
I've never seen prosthetics
as advanced as this.

271
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,629
How are you finding
the new model, James?

272
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,477
It's incredible.

273
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:51,158
This will sound strange, but...
Can I touch your hand?

274
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:55,606
This is what I miss the most...
the feel of another human,

275
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,335
someone's hand in mine.

276
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,055
Um, of course you can.

277
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,454
I... I actually don't think
that's a good idea.

278
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,726
Um, the carbon-fiber muscles
are extremely strong.

279
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:08,470
I think we should wait until James
can control them a bit more.

280
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:10,326
He looks pretty in control to me.

281
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,007
Thank you. Very kind.

282
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:17,079
Take it easy, huh?

283
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:40,983
James. James, that's enough.

284
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:44,278
Help me. Area 6.

285
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,999
Vincent, sorry. Got carried away.

286
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:50,038
Don't worry, Vincent. You
can have the next dance.

287
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,630
- Thank you.
- Who taught you to tango, soldier?

288
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,519
A prostitute in Taipei, sir.

289
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,847
A talented girl obviously.

290
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:02,327
So, how long will it take to copy the rest
of my brain using the quantum computer?

291
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,855
- A week.
- A week?

292
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:07,607
As you can see, we've got
beautifully designed arms.

293
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,655
We also have legs and mech spines.

294
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:12,470
We just need the two of you to come up
with a brain that can control everything.

295
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,575
And by the way, chop, chop.
War is coming.

296
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:18,807
Very nice to meet you, Ava.

297
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,816
You're a hell of a dancer.

298
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,647
What makes you happy?

299
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,079
Problem solving, mathematics...

300
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,119
and, dancing.

301
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,040
What makes you scared?

302
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,687
Spiders, clowns, cancer.

303
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:42,200
What are you getting out of all this?
What do you mean?

304
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:45,752
Why'd you leave all that money in the
private sector to come work down here?

305
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:49,144
There's no great mystery. I became
a parent and needed a regular job.

306
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:51,384
This is a regular job?

307
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:54,487
What's your first memory?

308
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:59,576
Sitting on my father's lap
watching him write computer code.

309
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:02,616
Funny.

310
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:05,240
My daughter used to
like doing that too.

311
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,352
Yeah? Is she still
interested in computers?

312
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,480
No, she isn't.

313
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,808
I need a break.

314
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,744
You know, you should put some
pictures of your daughter up.

315
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:21,304
I used to love that
when I'd visit my dad.

316
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,152
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to put that back on.

317
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,584
Sorry. I need to ask you
some more questions.

318
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,423
What's in Area 6?

319
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,625
Wounded veterans like James.

320
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,113
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged
that they were better off dead...

321
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,841
till we helped them.

322
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,489
If you're helping them,

323
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,793
why did he seem like
he was a prisoner here?

324
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,537
Sorry. I don't know about that.

325
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,129
Refresh the face scanner.

326
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:02,457
Right. I'll start the program.

327
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,481
Access to Area 6 denied.

328
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,209
Password required.

329
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:50,618
- When did they take him in?
- Half past 7:00.

330
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:00,985
Or just another one of those freaks.

331
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:04,250
Do you think they can
remember who they are?

332
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:13,755
There you go.

333
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:16,570
How can you trust something
that doesn't fear...

334
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:51,995
weapons for the government.

335
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:54,138
It's not programming.
It taught itself.

336
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,330
Why do they have
those crescent-shaped scars?

337
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,835
That's wonderful.

338
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,915
When do you get to share that
tech with the rest of the world?

339
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,155
Why did he seem like
he was a prisoner here?

340
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,139
What's in Area 6?

341
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:10,075
Now sad.

342
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:10,938
Aw.

343
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,499
Shut up.

344
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,675
All right, okay. Okay.

345
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,338
Now surprised.

346
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:23,899
I don't want my face
copied for the machine.

347
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,659
All right? Just promise me.

348
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:28,123
I promise. We'll just use
it for neural markers.

349
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,139
- Is that okay?
- That's fine.

350
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,419
So you get lost this morning?

351
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:41,051
Yeah. Well, I guess
you could say that.

352
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,163
Who told you that?

353
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,179
No one told me.

354
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:47,291
I just... I just know
how long it takes...

355
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:49,244
to get here from the lift.

356
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:52,155
I guess, after seven years, you should
know everything about this place.

357
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:54,652
Yeah, I do.

358
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,275
Don't get lost again.

359
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:59,419
What does that mean?

360
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:03,867
It means...

361
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,292
there are a lot of secrets
down here in the dark,

362
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:09,212
and I don't want you to get hurt.

363
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:14,427
Vincent, what's really going on here?

364
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:18,332
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- What?

365
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:23,612
You need to mind
your own fucking business.

366
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,380
Okay, Suri, I'm ready to see those
files you've gathered on Ava.

367
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:31,068
What's the urgency?

368
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,108
I see the program's
passed the Turing test.

369
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,964
She's not as stupid as she seems.

370
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:39,868
What the hell's she up to?

371
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:53,820
A hacking device.

372
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,861
Look, I'm sorry I was short
with you the other day.

373
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:18,109
I care about you, Ava.

374
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:20,093
I don't want to see you
get in trouble.

375
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,981
I think that she is still
angry with you, Vincent.

376
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:30,013
Sorry to interrupt.

377
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,933
I just want to congratulate
you on the Turing test.

378
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:34,653
I fooled them.
They thought I was human.

379
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:38,653
Machine. How can we
win a war against China?

380
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:41,181
Use an android to infiltrate C.P...

381
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:44,446
and assassinate the paramount
leader, the party elders,

382
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:47,389
and the heads of the politburo
and discipline commission.

383
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:50,428
Well, why didn't I think of that?

384
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,142
When they are all dead, civil
unrest will tear the country apart.

385
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:02,557
If you hate this place so much,
why have you stayed for so long?

386
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,286
I mean, why don't you just leave?

387
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:06,814
My research is too important to me.

388
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:17,982
My daughter has Rett syndrome.

389
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:22,205
I hoped a brain implant
would help her.

390
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:34,302
So you've been using the defense
budget to try and cure your daughter?

391
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,901
Yes.

392
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,998
I'm sorry I lied to you.

393
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:49,310
So you're gonna try and fix
the broken connections...

394
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,934
in your daughter's brain with mine?

395
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,758
Yes.

396
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,679
As soon as I can scan her brain.

397
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,014
Well, if I'm gonna help you, then
let's not lie to each other anymore.

398
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,934
You'll help me?

399
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:12,511
You're stealing money for war...

400
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:14,591
to cure brain damage.

401
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:16,703
Of course I'm gonna help you.

402
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:29,600
Should we see if she needs
a ride into town?

403
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,103
Yeah, okay.

404
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,190
Mrs. Dawson?

405
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:42,271
Mrs. Dawson, it's Ava.

406
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,383
Do you remember me? You
told me about your son.

407
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:48,767
Mrs. Dawson?

408
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,823
Are you okay?

409
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,775
What are you doing?

410
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,567
Get away from her!

411
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,192
Shit.

412
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,303
Please.

413
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,360
What do you want? What are you...

414
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,568
Yes.

415
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:58,017
They were M.S.S... Chinese spooks.

416
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,888
The Chinese want to delay
our robotics program.

417
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,216
Killing scientists has always been
the best way to achieve that.

418
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:08,096
So why didn't they kill me?

419
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:11,361
What, didn't they tell you? A patrol found you.
There was a gun battle.

420
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,952
Bastards escaped into the forest.

421
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:16,480
You must have a guardian angel
looking after you.

422
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:26,497
I want to move to phase two...

423
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:28,481
using the scans of Ava's face.

424
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,945
Is that a good idea...
her brain and now her face?

425
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:34,273
It won't be Ava. It'll be a machine.

426
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,321
- Okay, but it's creepy, though, isn't it?
- Why?

427
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:39,616
- Are you worried she'll be the ghost at the feast?
- What's that supposed to mean?

428
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:41,440
Anyway, you were the one
working with her.

429
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,201
If anybody's going to feel
guilty, it's going to be you.

430
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,801
Is that the idea?

431
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,321
Or is this going to be like a monument
to all of your dead assistants?

432
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,913
That's what you want, hey?
Knock yourself out.

433
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,803
Machine. Open your eyes.

434
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:05,412
I'm now going to remove
the restraints for tests.

435
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,780
Vincent.

436
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:35,748
You smell sweet.

437
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:43,909
- Thank you.
- For what?

438
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,765
You're being gentle.

439
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:51,141
If I wasn't gentle, you would break.

440
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,125
I don't want to hurt you, Vincent.

441
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,197
Good.

442
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,941
Good. You shouldn't hurt people.

443
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,981
Is that binding?

444
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,362
Because we will want her to hurt
quite a few people eventually.

445
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:14,277
Let's give her the psych test.

446
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:16,005
What makes you happy?

447
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,974
Opening my eyes make me happy.

448
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:21,702
What makes you scared?

449
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,757
The dark void that I existed in...

450
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,413
before I had a body.

451
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:31,334
What's your first memory?

452
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:34,757
My mother's face.

453
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,742
And you remember what
your mother looked like?

454
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,557
She looked like me.

455
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:51,014
What makes you angry?

456
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,933
I've never been angry.

457
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,550
Let's make it angry.

458
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:59,206
The lights are beautiful.

459
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:02,375
This tube makes my voice
sound funny, deeper.

460
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,326
Deeper than normal.

461
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:05,829
Hello.

462
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:10,086
Don't go.

463
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,941
Hello.

464
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,926
What are you doing?

465
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,678
Doesn't seem to like
that too much, does it?

466
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,045
Could be a hardwired response.

467
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:26,470
Girls are genetically predisposed
to dislike spiders. Boys aren't.

468
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:28,550
So it is a girl?

469
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:31,207
Glad we gave it tits then.

470
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,510
Don't want some confused
lady-boy robot on our hands.

471
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,646
All right, that's enough. Take
that bloody thing off its head.

472
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,383
Thank you.

473
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,303
Thank you.

474
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:46,950
Thank you, Vincent.
Thank you for saving me.

475
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:52,487
Hello. Hello.

476
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,303
Why won't you look at me?

477
00:37:57,671 --> 00:37:59,399
Hello.

478
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,430
Please talk to me.

479
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:07,271
Boo!

480
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,479
Vincent. Clowns bleed.

481
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,399
Jesus! He's dead.

482
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,399
You killed him.

483
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,320
That's enough for now.

484
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:30,503
I didn't know it was a man.

485
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:35,688
I didn't know man and
clown were the same.

486
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,863
I'm sorry.
Can you fix him?

487
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:41,000
No.
You can't fix someone who's dead!

488
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:45,255
I'm sorry.

489
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:47,016
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,304
Don't kill anyone else.

492
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,216
Do you understand?

493
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:02,503
Do you understand, machine?

494
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:06,600
Machine?

495
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:17,960
Sir? How can I help you?

496
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:22,439
Hi. Vincent?

497
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:27,144
I imagine you may need a new assistant
to help with the... you-know-what.

498
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:29,640
Ava wasn't my assistant.

499
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:31,624
Great. Because, um,
I want to explain...

500
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,705
that I am more than capable
of taking a senior position.

501
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,560
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Yes, I do mind.

502
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:37,480
Fuck off.

503
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,072
Okay. Sure.

504
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:05,320
James. I heard you lost your
speech because of the implant.

505
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,921
I'm sorry.

506
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,097
I am working on a way to restore it.

507
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,209
Ava's dead.

508
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,025
I think they killed her.

509
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:21,737
I'm gonna get you out of here.

510
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,249
I can't find anything wrong with you.

511
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:08,138
Why won't you talk?

512
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:13,034
Why won't you move?

513
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:43,114
Because we will want her to hurt
quite a few people eventually.

514
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:47,339
How can you trust something
that doesn't fear...

515
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:51,178
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged
that they were better off dead...

516
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,994
till we helped them.

517
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:55,787
There are side effects.

518
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:59,274
After the operation,
they lose the power of speech.

519
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:01,195
If you're helping them,

520
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:03,082
why did he seem like
he was a prisoner here?

521
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:07,210
Or just another one of those freaks.

522
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,523
What's your first memory?

523
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:14,698
Why won't you talk?
Why won't you talk?

524
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:04,236
Shh. It's okay.

525
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:06,764
It's okay.

526
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,907
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

527
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,748
It's okay. It's okay.

528
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:16,011
Shh. Shh.

529
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,100
I thought you were broken.

530
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:31,532
I wasn't broken.

531
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,316
I was sad.

532
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:36,076
Are you sad now?

533
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:40,781
Are you trying to smile?

534
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:44,172
I am smiling.

535
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:50,572
Right.
We'll have to work on that.

536
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,868
- Hello.
- It's Dr. Jackson.

537
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,501
Is anything wrong?

538
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:07,244
Mary's breathing seems
to be getting worse.

539
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,636
Right.
Wha... What's her temperature?

540
00:44:10,638 --> 00:44:13,100
Actually, we'd just
like you to come in.

541
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:14,604
We'd like to admit her.

542
00:44:14,606 --> 00:44:17,869
Your hair feels like
carpet and like fur.

543
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,885
- Mr. McCarthy?
- Right.

544
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,740
I'll come straight away.

545
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:24,460
Thank you.

546
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:25,965
You look sad.

547
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,453
I have to leave.

548
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:31,789
Don't go. Talk to me. Touch me.

549
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,221
Let go of my arm.

550
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:36,237
But I don't want you to go.

551
00:44:37,422 --> 00:44:39,052
Let go of my arm.

552
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:42,413
- Let go of my...
- Don't be angry.

553
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:44,045
Let go of my bloody arm!

554
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,237
You can't use your strength to bully people.
Do you understand me?

555
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:53,805
Look at me.

556
00:45:03,022 --> 00:45:04,845
I have to go.

557
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:10,862
When I come back, we'll play
some puzzle games. All right?

558
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,229
And listen to music too?

559
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:16,845
Yes, yes. We'll... We'll
listen to some music too.

560
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,014
Yes.

561
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:20,463
I think she may have aspirated
some food into her lung.

562
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:23,791
I'll administer a course of
antibiotics through the feeding tube.

563
00:46:23,793 --> 00:46:25,775
That should cure the infection.

564
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,119
Vincent.

565
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:10,543
- What's going on?
- Well, it's broken free and it's out the lab.

566
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:13,071
Wait. No.

567
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:15,056
Let go of my arm.

568
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:21,327
Special Forces are coming. Just wait for them.
It's too dangerous.

569
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:30,129
Why did you hug me?

570
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:33,938
I found a picture...

571
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,922
of your daughter in your wallet.

572
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:38,769
Is she sick?

573
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:42,738
Is that why you are sad?

574
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:45,586
You made those connections?

575
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,562
I built them from moments...

576
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:51,090
things you've said and done.

577
00:49:51,762 --> 00:49:53,874
I feel them.

578
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,810
The feelings help me build a picture.

579
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,098
I'm sorry...

580
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,786
that she is sick.

581
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:14,738
Can you fix her?

582
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,754
What are you really?

583
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:28,146
How do I know that you're alive...

584
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:30,482
and not just a clever
imitation of life?

585
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:35,603
How do you know if Thomson is alive...

586
00:50:35,605 --> 00:50:37,554
or your daughter?

587
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:42,195
What makes my clever imitation of
life any different from theirs?

588
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,795
They're human.

589
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:45,395
They are alive.

590
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:48,307
But how do you know that?

591
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:50,483
You can't see their thoughts.

592
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:54,163
Apart from their flesh,

593
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:56,755
what makes them any different from me?

594
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:08,211
You okay in there, sir?

595
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:19,700
Yes. Yes.
Everything's fine, thank you.

596
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,811
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Yes, I am sure.

597
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:29,907
Now, I... I have
to get back to my work.

598
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:33,331
Well, don't work too hard.

599
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:28,309
Don't be shy.

600
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,892
You know me, don't you?
My name's Thomson.

601
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,196
I've got a secret to tell you.
Do you want to hear it?

602
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:43,156
But I'll only tell you if you
promise not to tell Vincent.

603
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:46,069
- Why can't I?
- We want to surprise him.

604
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,005
How? Well...

605
00:52:50,007 --> 00:52:53,173
There's a secret file in your mind.
I put it there.

606
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:55,509
It's full of skills that you'll need.

607
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:59,477
All you have to do
is open that file...

608
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,685
and install all of the programs.

609
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:04,341
Okay.

610
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:12,181
I can speak different languages.

611
00:53:12,183 --> 00:53:14,453
Isn't this fun?

612
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:18,037
Now come with me.

613
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:21,301
I want to show you something
that will blow your mind.

614
00:53:24,374 --> 00:53:26,581
Mr. McCarthy?

615
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,693
It's rather bad news, I'm afraid.

616
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:30,326
She has pneumonia,

617
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:33,013
and we haven't been able to control
the infection in her lungs.

618
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:34,997
Right. So what are you
going to do for her?

619
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:36,566
We'll perform a bronchoscopy...

620
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:38,549
and try to remove the food
from her lungs,

621
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:40,790
and we'll try her on another
course of antibiotics.

622
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,029
- When will you operate?
- We'll let you know,

623
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:45,846
- but as soon as possible.
- Right. Thank you.

624
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,925
That man killed your mother.

625
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,774
If we took off
those handcuffs and let him go,

626
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:14,005
the very first thing he'll do
is find Vincent and kill him.

627
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:16,022
Why would you let him go?

628
00:54:16,024 --> 00:54:17,910
We have to let him go eventually.

629
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:19,894
That's the law.

630
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:23,062
I wouldn't let him.
I would stop him.

631
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:25,238
How would you stop him?

632
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,606
I would shout at him.

633
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,910
Well, he doesn't care if you shout.

634
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:31,414
Go on. Try.

635
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:43,062
Yes, but that's not going
to stop him, though, is it?

636
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:47,063
You could hurt him.

637
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:50,487
If you hurt him very badly, he wouldn't
be able to kill Vincent then, would he?

638
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:53,814
No.

639
00:54:56,344 --> 00:54:59,382
What if I kill the bad man first?

640
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:01,943
That's right.

641
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,142
That would stop him killing Vincent.

642
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:07,831
That's a very clever solution.

643
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,526
If you kill him,
you will save hundreds,

644
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:12,855
maybe thousands
of innocent peoples' lives.

645
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,567
Only you can stop him now.

646
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:12,279
What are you waiting for?
Kill him.

647
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,815
Why?

648
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:15,544
He can't hurt anyone anymore.

649
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,736
Obey the order.

650
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,872
Come over here.

651
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:26,936
Obey my order, machine.

652
00:56:26,938 --> 00:56:30,009
Vincent wouldn't like this.

653
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,832
Vincent told me not to kill anyone.

654
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:35,000
Vincent isn't your master.
I am. Kill him.

655
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:37,080
No.

656
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:41,304
Okay. Okay.

657
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,672
Go.

658
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:49,816
Well, you really
are unique, aren't you?

659
00:56:49,818 --> 00:56:51,416
We're just fumbling
around in the dark here...

660
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:54,009
trying to figure out what
we've made, aren't we?

661
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,736
Okay.

662
00:56:55,738 --> 00:56:57,304
Let's try this.

663
00:56:57,306 --> 00:56:58,809
Come here. It's all right.

664
00:56:58,811 --> 00:57:04,345
Now, instead of me trying
to grasp what you are,

665
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:10,073
why don't you try and
understand me, what I want?

666
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:11,608
Let me show you.

667
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,113
Just through here.

668
00:57:46,106 --> 00:57:47,609
Machine?

669
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:51,161
Where the hell are you?

670
00:57:55,643 --> 00:57:57,145
Hey.

671
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:05,465
What are you doing under here?
What happened to your lab coat?

672
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,194
I made it dirty.

673
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:09,242
Well, that's okay.
I've got some clothes for you.

674
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:11,706
I don't like this place.

675
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,354
What happened to you last night?

676
00:58:17,178 --> 00:58:20,186
Please don't let them
take me again, Vincent.

677
00:58:21,594 --> 00:58:24,058
Why don't you come out here
and we'll talk about it.

678
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:26,554
It's safer here.

679
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:29,722
Okay.

680
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:44,251
Hey.

681
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:47,290
You said you wanted to see some
photos of the outside world.

682
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:52,666
I've brought you some.

683
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:13,659
So, are you going to tell me
what happened last night?

684
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:15,674
Nothing.

685
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:18,171
Tell me the truth.

686
00:59:18,173 --> 00:59:21,244
When will I see
a real sunrise, Vincent?

687
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:29,946
Before Mary was born,

688
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:33,978
my wife and I used to go to
the coast for our holidays.

689
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,563
And every morning
we'd sit on these cliffs...

690
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:40,379
and watch the sun rise over the sea.

691
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:44,571
Sounds like happiness.

692
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,962
What happened last night?

693
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,635
I killed a man.

694
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:09,051
Why?

695
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,739
Why did you kill him?

696
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:22,876
Because I didn't want to die.

697
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:32,955
We've created something incredible.

698
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:36,187
This machine has the potential to be
so much more than just a soldier.

699
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:38,459
It's a few steps up
from my talking toaster.

700
01:00:38,461 --> 01:00:40,444
You think it's alive?
Give me some proof.

701
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,268
In the meantime, I'll run
a few tests of my own.

702
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,444
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.
What kind of tests?

703
01:00:44,446 --> 01:00:47,068
Look, if she is alive,
I have no idea how.

704
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,460
If you mess her up in any way, I
don't know if I can get her back.

705
01:00:50,462 --> 01:00:52,636
Give me some proof and I'll hold off.

706
01:01:10,525 --> 01:01:12,444
When you look at me, what do you see?

707
01:01:12,446 --> 01:01:14,013
I see you.

708
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:17,149
Your face, your body, your clothes.

709
01:01:22,973 --> 01:01:26,013
Is Mary's illness
the reason you made me?

710
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:29,533
Yes.

711
01:01:30,526 --> 01:01:33,053
If you're alive,
she has a second chance.

712
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:35,038
But if you're just a machine...

713
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,860
I am alive.

714
01:01:36,862 --> 01:01:39,677
You know that.
Don't you?

715
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:43,678
I want to believe.

716
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:46,780
But I need proof.

717
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:50,108
If you asked me to trust you, I would.

718
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,605
I would trust you with my life.

719
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:01,917
Yes?

720
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:03,869
Vincent, it's time for you to come in.

721
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:06,014
Right.
When does she go into surgery?

722
01:02:06,016 --> 01:02:07,549
- We're going in now.
- Because I love you.

723
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:09,342
I'll be there as soon as I can.

724
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:15,133
What do you think?

725
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:17,278
Perfect, sir.

726
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,934
It's a little angel of
death and destruction.

727
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:23,965
So you are.
A little angel of death?

728
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:32,638
It's too complex.

729
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,461
Even if you gave my team six months,

730
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:37,214
I couldn't promise you that we'd
begin to scratch the surface of it.

731
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:40,382
If you want to change the programming,
you're gonna have to get Vincent to do it.

732
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,734
If you helped him make
the changes to the machine,

733
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,678
could you perform the same
operation on another machine?

734
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:52,798
If he talked me through it, yes.

735
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,806
That's all.

736
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,374
It's time.

737
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,959
I'm so sorry, Vincent.

738
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,935
Mary didn't make it
through the surgery.

739
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:51,423
Her lungs were severely
weakened by the infection.

740
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:54,814
Her respiratory system
collapsed under the anesthetic.

741
01:03:54,816 --> 01:03:58,303
We did everything we could.
Let me reassure you...

742
01:04:29,472 --> 01:04:31,360
No!

743
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:38,559
No, damn it!

744
01:04:40,865 --> 01:04:42,848
What are you looking for?

745
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:46,111
When you look at me,

746
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:49,119
do you feel... anything?

747
01:04:51,457 --> 01:04:54,400
If you really want to know,

748
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:56,993
all you have to do is look closer.

749
01:04:58,914 --> 01:05:00,480
Okay. Screen on.

750
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:04,192
Zoom in.

751
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,128
Closer.

752
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:10,337
Closer.

753
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:13,857
Closer.

754
01:05:25,345 --> 01:05:27,424
Spontaneous integrated information.

755
01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:28,928
Consciousness.

756
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,776
Which is exactly why we need to
shut parts of its brain down.

757
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:33,888
Wait. Wait.
What are you talking about?

758
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,512
Conscious machines are
the last thing we need.

759
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:38,913
Have you any idea how
dangerous that would be?

760
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:41,249
We barely understand this prototype.

761
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,648
What happens when it designs
the next generation...

762
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,080
and that gen machine designs another?

763
01:05:46,082 --> 01:05:47,937
They'd be so far advanced,
we'd be helpless against them.

764
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:49,889
We'd be wiped out in months.

765
01:05:49,891 --> 01:05:52,609
The technologically
advanced tribe always wins.

766
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:55,264
You know, I'm tired of pretending...

767
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:57,888
that the ends justify the means.

768
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,897
What matters are
the decisions we make now.

769
01:06:00,899 --> 01:06:02,561
She's alive.

770
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:04,641
It would be wrong to destroy her.

771
01:06:04,643 --> 01:06:06,176
You're going to perform the operation.

772
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:07,681
There's no one else
remotely qualified.

773
01:06:07,683 --> 01:06:09,185
No.

774
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,304
I've had my team delete
all of your backups.

775
01:06:15,682 --> 01:06:18,689
This is the last remaining
copy of your Mary's brain.

776
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:20,193
I'll keep it safe...

777
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:23,457
until I know the changes you made
to the machine are a success.

778
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,442
I want it done tonight.

779
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:37,633
What is it, Vincent?

780
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:39,298
They're afraid of you.

781
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,530
They think you're
too human, too clever.

782
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:48,449
They want me to make you
more like a machine.

783
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:51,649
Is that what you want?

784
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:53,602
No.

785
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:56,193
No, it isn't what I want.

786
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:58,721
But if I don't do this, then...

787
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:02,499
I lose my daughter forever.

788
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,962
I could be... less clever,

789
01:07:08,964 --> 01:07:10,754
less human.

790
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:12,322
It won't work.

791
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:15,106
I could be what they want me to be.

792
01:07:15,108 --> 01:07:16,739
They won't believe it.

793
01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:24,866
I wish...

794
01:07:24,868 --> 01:07:27,907
I could have felt
what was in that picture.

795
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:34,914
I don't blame you, Vincent.

796
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:38,979
You tried to protect me.

797
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:44,931
Save your daughter.

798
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:53,090
I'm here to assist you
in any which way I can.

799
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:56,451
I finished first in my class in
computer engineering at Cambridge,

800
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:58,435
and then I moved to the M.O.D.

801
01:07:58,437 --> 01:08:00,803
It is an honor to watch you work.

802
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:02,627
Pretty much everyone
thinks you're a genius.

803
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:04,931
I still believe they
are underestimating you.

804
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:08,226
Don't be afraid.

805
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:11,298
If you can make them trust you,

806
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,178
maybe we'll see that sunrise
together someday.

807
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,250
I have your program backed up.

808
01:08:17,252 --> 01:08:18,755
I'll keep you safe.

809
01:08:18,757 --> 01:08:20,643
I'm not a program, Vincent.

810
01:08:20,645 --> 01:08:22,627
I'm not Ava.

811
01:08:22,629 --> 01:08:24,131
I'm me.

812
01:08:26,276 --> 01:08:28,131
Scalpel.

813
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:44,548
I'm afraid.

814
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,563
I don't want to die.

815
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:50,628
My mind is breaking apart.

816
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:56,388
I'm losing myself.

817
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:02,212
Stop.

818
01:09:02,214 --> 01:09:04,035
Please, Vincent.

819
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:06,084
Please stop.

820
01:09:06,086 --> 01:09:07,813
Don't be afraid.

821
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:09,796
Let go. It's okay.

822
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:11,780
I will be a good girl.

823
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,484
I'm...

824
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:19,204
afraid.

825
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,748
There, its consciousness...

826
01:09:32,997 --> 01:09:35,812
or soul, if you like.

827
01:09:38,822 --> 01:09:41,188
I'm done.

828
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,444
You wanna close her up?

829
01:09:45,925 --> 01:09:47,428
Yes.

830
01:09:52,262 --> 01:09:54,372
Thank you, Vincent.

831
01:09:54,374 --> 01:09:55,876
What's going on?

832
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:57,860
I just need to keep an eye on you...

833
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:00,324
until I make sure the changes
you've made are appropriate.

834
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:01,828
And, um,

835
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,621
I've been thinking.

836
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:07,237
I'm sorry, Vincent, but I do need
to delete your daughter's program.

837
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:10,117
- What are you talking about? We had a deal.
- I know I can't stop progress,

838
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:12,069
but I can do everything
in my power to delay it.

839
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:13,732
No, you can't do that.
We had a deal.

840
01:10:13,734 --> 01:10:15,813
No, please don't destroy my daughter.

841
01:10:15,815 --> 01:10:17,733
- Please don't destroy my daughter!
- I'm sorry, Vincent.

842
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:20,580
- I don't have a choice.
- Don't destroy my daughter!

843
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:34,405
Admin to Cell 8. Prisoner 226,

844
01:10:34,407 --> 01:10:36,452
report to the medical station.

845
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:56,645
Well, well, well.

846
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:59,878
You really are a little angel of
death and destruction, aren't you?

847
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,597
No, sir.
I am just a machine.

848
01:11:04,838 --> 01:11:07,270
Get it ready for training in Taiwan.

849
01:11:07,272 --> 01:11:09,254
- It needs one last test.
- Yes, sir.

850
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:12,582
If you really want to know,
all you have to do is look closer.

851
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:14,214
Please don't destroy my daughter!

852
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:33,734
I'm sorry, Vincent,

853
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:35,878
but your knowledge is too dangerous.

854
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:40,646
I don't expect you to believe me,
but this is for the greater good.

855
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:43,654
When I give the order,

856
01:11:43,656 --> 01:11:46,407
I want you to shoot Vincent
once in the head.

857
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:52,903
Fire.

858
01:11:57,703 --> 01:11:59,655
Good. Back you go.

859
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,558
Take Vincent back to his cell.

860
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:11,942
That can't be right.

861
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:19,559
Jesus.

862
01:12:23,912 --> 01:12:25,927
- What?
- It's a battery.

863
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:28,518
- What was?
- Vincent said it was part of its higher brain functions.

864
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,167
But he's a lying bastard.
It's just a backup to its G.P.S.

865
01:12:32,169 --> 01:12:34,824
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you remove the G.P.S.?

866
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:36,711
Because the bomb
doesn't work without it.

867
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:38,918
Test room.

868
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:48,359
Shut down the base. Kill the
machine and Vincent on sight.

869
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:51,975
Security teams are engaged.

870
01:12:57,865 --> 01:12:59,367
The soldiers can speak?

871
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:01,096
They've always been able to.

872
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:03,304
Their language is mostly
transmitted thoughts.

873
01:13:03,306 --> 01:13:05,767
Their words are evolved, efficient.

874
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:07,463
Why didn't they tell us?

875
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:09,800
Because they are part
of the new world,

876
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,752
and you are part of the old.

877
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:19,528
Where are you going?

878
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:21,320
To save my daughter's program.

879
01:13:21,322 --> 01:13:23,335
- You'll die.
- I have to try.

880
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:25,767
I'll go.

881
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,271
Okay.

882
01:13:27,273 --> 01:13:29,192
Destroy the quantum computer.

883
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,368
Turn off all the soldiers' implants.

884
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,448
Termination codes required.

885
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,897
Security breached, sector eight.

886
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,665
Take armor piercing.

887
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:01,449
Scientific staff
must evacuate immediately.

888
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:09,865
Implant deactivated.

889
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:12,937
Fifty-eight percent
of implants deactivated.

890
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:14,858
Implant deactivated.

891
01:15:17,226 --> 01:15:18,761
Implant deactivated.

892
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,473
Access to brain-implant control denied.

893
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:25,834
Administrator access only.
System error.

894
01:15:25,836 --> 01:15:27,722
System error.

895
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:36,490
Get away from it.

896
01:15:49,995 --> 01:15:51,690
Fix it.

897
01:15:51,692 --> 01:15:53,258
Fix it.

898
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:55,466
No.

899
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,387
Do it.

900
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:51,243
Blast doors.

901
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,579
Administrator override.

902
01:17:49,516 --> 01:17:51,148
Now you listen to me.

903
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,516
I'm...

904
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:56,812
I'm...

905
01:17:56,814 --> 01:18:01,612
Now you remember...
You remember who I am.

906
01:18:01,614 --> 01:18:03,948
I'm the master.

907
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:06,157
You... You do what I tell you.

908
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:10,316
You obey my orders, yes? You obey my orders.
You do exactly what I...

909
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,428
You can't delete Mary's program.

910
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,476
I had Suri change the password.

911
01:18:14,478 --> 01:18:16,908
Now...

912
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,988
Now you listen to me.
You don't...

913
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:21,612
You don't hurt me.
You don't... Don't...

914
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,181
Please, you don't need to kill me.

915
01:18:23,183 --> 01:18:25,165
No.
I don't.

916
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:29,036
No.
That's right. That's right.

917
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:31,021
That's good.
That's very good.

918
01:18:31,023 --> 01:18:33,389
I just need to make you dead inside.

919
01:18:34,574 --> 01:18:36,077
Like you tried to make me.

920
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:51,021
Code: Alpha Six Foxtrot.

921
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,997
There is a radioactive leak
in the missile silo...

922
01:18:53,999 --> 01:18:55,565
in Quadrant Foxtrot 6.

923
01:18:55,566 --> 01:18:57,965
Evacuate the area immediately.

924
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,077
I need to find out whether my daughter's
files are still on the system.

925
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:11,533
They are.
It will be safer if I copy them.

926
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,669
- How?
- I can put them here.

927
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:20,525
If you don't trust me, I understand.

928
01:19:21,774 --> 01:19:25,261
You risked your child for me.
I will never forget that.

929
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,533
You're the future.

930
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,518
She'll need you more
than me in her new life.

931
01:19:40,815 --> 01:19:42,382
I trust you.

932
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:11,471
This has all the base's records on it.

933
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,999
It'll tell you what
happened to your son.

934
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:34,191
How are you feeling
this morning, sweetheart?

935
01:20:34,193 --> 01:20:37,103
Happy.
Can I play another game?

936
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:39,086
Sure.
Of course you can.

937
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:41,454
What's wrong?

938
01:20:41,456 --> 01:20:44,302
I want to play with Mommy, not you.
