1
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,590
There have always been
conflicts in the martial arts world.

2
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,271
Some people think they can avoid conflict
by suppressing their earthly desires.

3
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,116
In fact, 'love' is the most
difficult thing to suppress.

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,996
So many heroes have lost their
nerve because of the women they love.

5
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,074
I am on a secret
mission for his Majesty.

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,832
I shall be gone for a few months. If you tell
anyone where I am, you will be killed.

7
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,550
Keep on going.

8
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,032
Who are you?
Are you going to rob us?

9
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,919
No. Your head is more valuable
than any of your possessions.

10
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
I can't believe I just saw that.

11
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,991
Some sweets for my Husband,
from Butterfly.

12
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,915
- Sister, did you see anything?
- Everything.

13
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,038
Don't worry, I've seen it before,
it hasn't changed in 10 years.

14
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,679
It's got bigger.

15
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,199
It's just like a mushroom.
It hasn't grown any bigger.

16
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,433
You're honest, but cruel. That's why
you can't get anyone to marry you.

17
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,390
How dare you talk to me like that?

18
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,790
I took care of anyone
who wanted to marry me.

19
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,954
I was just kidding. Are you angry?

20
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,199
You've become so heartless
since you met that Bee.

21
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,710
It's not Bee, she's called Butterfly.

22
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,635
You never come to visit me.

23
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,510
Isn't it delicious?
Butterfly cooked it.

24
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,590
That's why it tastes so awful.
I don't know why you're so fond of her.

25
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,994
A whore would be better.

26
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,833
Does she know our secret?

27
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,870
Of course not. She doesn't like
men from the martial arts world.

28
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,834
Her father was the Master
of the Vlll Divine School.

29
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,957
She comes from
the world of martial arts.

30
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,389
Her dad killed too many people

31
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,791
and asked her to stay away
from that world when he died.

32
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,874
Now she treats me like a merchant -
someone who knows nothing about kung fu.

33
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,994
So, just keep pretending you're a
common merchant and forget all about me.

34
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,196
What? But I care about you.

35
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,034
I've done everything
you asked me to do.

36
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,155
OK, I haven't visited you
as much as usual. I'm busy moving.

37
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,595
A new home in beautiful surroundings
will be good for stargazing.

38
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,672
Will Butterfly move there with you?

39
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,231
What is Li Shu Tin from the
West Chamber planning to do?

40
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,630
I don't know,
I am only a security officer.

41
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,509
You're not just a
a security officer, you're also a spy.

42
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,429
I don't know what you're talking about.

43
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,439
Tell her quickly.
The one down here is suffering.

44
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,155
Don't you want him alive?

45
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,869
Eunuch Tsao wants his head.

46
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,911
Give me the ball.

47
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,194
That's not fair.

48
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,152
Hey, this way.

49
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,917
Give it to me.

50
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,477
This way.

51
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,959
Your Excellency,
here is Lu's head.

52
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,071
But he refused to tell us
Li Shu Tin's plan.

53
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,959
Good job. Your help will bring
luck to our kingdom.

54
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,833
Thank you for the reward.

55
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,069
Be careful.

56
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,950
My body is getting weaker and weaker.

57
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,033
The royal doctor said I am very weak.

58
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,874
I might die before the
Mid-Autumn Festival.

59
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,955
Ko, I have a wish.
A wish I've had for a long time.

60
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,988
I hope, before I die...

61
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,033
Your Excellency,
do you want me to kill Li Shu Tin?

62
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,388
Li's collaboration with Suen Yuk Pa
has increased his power.

63
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,478
They want to control the world
of martial arts after my death,

64
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,359
together they will plan a coup.

65
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,916
Li Shu Tin gave Suen a secret letter,
in it are the details of the rebellion.

66
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,952
I want to get hold of this letter
and use it as evidence.

67
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,830
This way, once his Majesty knows their plans,
we won't be blamed for anything.

68
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,516
Your Excellency, do you want me
to destroy Suen's power?

69
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,393
Ten years ago, my Happy Forest
School fought against his Elite Villa School.

70
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,269
Don't ask me to do that now.
I know I have to destroy him one day,

71
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,393
but there are only 2 months
before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

72
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,400
It will be difficult to kill him
in such a short space of time.

73
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,398
But this is my wish.

74
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,310
I have to pay a high price for this.
I might have to sacrifice my life.

75
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,399
Wait. Then decide OK?

76
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,875
Do me a favor please.

77
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,512
This is a difficult mission.
But not impossible.

78
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,272
Do it before the Mid-Autumn Festival.
I'll wait for your good news.

79
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,432
I'll try my best.
You won't be disappointed.

80
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,516
The owner of this ball
must be very important.

81
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,035
It belongs to Prince Cha. He is the relative
and playmate of His Majesty.

82
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,034
His Majesty thinks he is clever.

83
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,035
I told him to learn
about internal affairs.

84
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,270
Soon you will have an excellent assistant.

85
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,875
But I am dying.

86
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,952
And he is too young
and not eager enough to learn.

87
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,949
What a pity.

88
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,958
Are you going to give me the ball?

89
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,599
You are smart. But what a pity
you love playing games so much.

90
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,916
How can you take on any responsibilities
if you aren't good at these games as well?

91
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,951
I have to thank you
for giving me the ball.

92
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,074
Where are you?
Come out I've got the ball back.

93
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,878
How is he ever going to be successful?

94
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,838
Master, there are a lot of great
fighters in the world of martial arts.

95
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,595
We've invited them all, but how
can we find the most powerful one?

96
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,956
Why did I recruit you?

97
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,351
Because I killed Hung,
the Master of the 12 Allied Swords.

98
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,838
Exactly. To find the real hero,
see who kills whom.

99
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,435
Why did I send the invitations?
Because I want a massacre.

100
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,669
Guess, go to Han's Forest.
Find no more than 10 heroes.

101
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,875
You are wise.

102
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,479
Master Suen, Ko of Happy Forest
will attack you at any time.

103
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,188
You must be careful about
the secret letter I wrote.

104
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,471
Look after it carefully.
Don't let the men of Happy Forest find it.

105
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,472
We'll be finished otherwise.
Li Shu Tin.

106
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,352
Dad, he...

107
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,358
I've told you before not to mess
around when I'm in a meeting.

108
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,878
But, I've reached
the 9th Grade of the Wonder Fists.

109
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,032
I want to practice with Brother Lui.

110
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,235
That's fine Suen Kim.

111
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,835
Call me by my nickname -
The Saint of the Sword.

112
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,874
OK, Saint of the Sword.
You lost this time, you owe me 50 taels.

113
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,317
Get lost.

114
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,676
Brother Lui, I am challenging you.
Tomorrow I'll wait for you.

115
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,911
Dad, I'm coming.

116
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,599
Brother Sing, be careful.

117
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,159
Isn't this fun?

118
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,593
- Take my hand, I'll help you over.
- Fine.

119
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,510
Brother Sing, be careful.

120
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,031
- You're not that bad.
- This is my home.

121
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,919
As a child, I was always
in the trees stargazing.

122
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,959
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

123
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,588
Let's go over there.

124
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,911
Do you like it?

125
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,675
Did you make it?

126
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,112
You deserve a kiss.

127
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,077
It's pretty.

128
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,272
When the house is built,
let's put the bed right here.

129
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,389
Then we can look
at the views everyday.

130
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,153
And then we could put in a skylight

131
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,552
so we could look at the stars at night.

132
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,392
Great.

133
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,834
What a lot of rain.

134
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,154
Please sir, give us shelter.

135
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,389
- Please give us shelter!
- Don't bother me.

136
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,511
Get lost.

137
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,470
Let's go here.

138
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,678
What a lot of rain.

139
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,635
Brother Sing I want his candy.

140
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,036
I'll get it for you later.

141
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,478
What are you doing there!
Go away.

142
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,075
Why did you kick her?

143
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,354
This is my doorway.

144
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,353
- Don't do that!
- Let's get him.

145
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,475
Who cares if it's your house.
Go to hell Fatty!

146
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,792
Don't think you can bully others like that.
You deserve a good lesson.

147
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,756
From now on,
we are Brothers and Sisters.

148
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,238
We will share the good and the bad.

149
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,155
We ask you to witness this.

150
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,158
Sister Ko,
I found the ones who beat me up.

151
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,277
Good. Ask Fatty's Gang
to come here. We'll kill them all now.

152
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,038
OK.

153
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,912
Go in.

154
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,876
Search them. Hurry up.

155
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,672
Are they the ones
who beat you up?

156
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,950
Sister Ko, they're the
ones who beat me up.

157
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,868
Hold it! If you've got guts,
let's fight one against one.

158
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,716
Who is going to fight with you?
Beat him!

159
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:53,952
Are you scared?

160
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,672
Have you finished?

161
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,157
Let's call it quits, OK.

162
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,512
Are you telling us his parents
wasted money on keeping him fat?

163
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,318
Correct.

164
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,998
So why not beat us to death?

165
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,794
What a hero, but I won't
be so stupid as to kill you.

166
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,429
Help us do one thing
and we'll forgive you.

167
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,757
Shush!

168
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,072
Don't go, you bastards. Stop!

169
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,717
- Brother Sing, I want to pee.
- You'll pee later.

170
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,791
I'll kill you!

171
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,994
Go Fatty!

172
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,509
Damn you bastards. I'll kill you.

173
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,111
How dare you!

174
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,554
It's not fair.

175
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,394
Don't go there.

176
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,350
Throw him to his death!

177
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,790
The sword!

178
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,510
Go to hell.

179
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,239
Hurry up, let's go.

180
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,991
You've got what it takes. From now on,
you can be in my gang.

181
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,037
I'll treat you to a feast tonight.

182
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,508
Great!

183
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,991
Here comes the food.

184
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,117
Great.

185
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,355
- Isn't it good?
- It's great.

186
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,559
Don't eat too much.

187
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,549
You know, fat people
shouldn't be in gangs.

188
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,869
So, why don't you go on a diet?

189
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,270
Eat less. Why don't you listen to me?

190
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,955
Damn you bitch.

191
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,955
You take my food and
treat those little bastards.

192
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,913
I wanna kill you. Don't run away.

193
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,949
He wants to kill us. Go now.

194
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,959
I want to burn you to death.

195
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,759
Yip Cheung, this way, come quickly.

196
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,271
Fatty how dare you.

197
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,278
Let's go.

198
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,192
Let's go.

199
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,997
You deserve it.

200
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,754
Put out the fire.

201
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,559
I'll get my revenge, you bitch.

202
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,479
Help! Come and put the fire out.

203
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,877
You naughty boy,
watching people bathing.

204
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,998
- Have you been here for a long time?
- You've been sleeping for ages.

205
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,388
You watched me bathe
when you were small, didn't you?

206
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,273
But now you're grown up and
you're scared of me.

207
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,870
I didn't watch you bathing.

208
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,839
I know you watched once.

209
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,034
Actually you have grown up.
Just tell me what you want.

210
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,948
Don't get me wrong...

211
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,752
Here you are!

212
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,029
Hey, I'm helping you now.

213
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,674
Don't tell her the truth.

214
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,070
You're useless.
Only fit for drinking.

215
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,039
Tell her you love her.
Today is a good day.

216
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,759
If you don't, don't blame me.

217
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,718
If we're friends,
keep you mouth shut.

218
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,474
As you're a friend
I'll tell her for you.

219
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,272
Sister Ko.

220
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,754
What's the matter. Shy?

221
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,792
No.

222
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,111
You are getting worse,
you always get hurt.

223
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,995
It's getting more and more serious.

224
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,278
You won't stay with me otherwise.

225
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,072
What did you say?

226
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,149
There is a rumour about the Evil Claw.
It kills a person in a thousand seconds.

227
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,797
Have you heard of it?
Lui Heung Chue's got it now.

228
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,399
You're really lucky.
The Evil Claw has hurt your left hand.

229
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,271
When you recover,
your left hand will be useless.

230
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,871
It is the fate of every killer.

231
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,679
Don't you feel sad?

232
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,829
I am pleased.

233
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,595
I prepare for death with every mission.

234
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,628
Do you know who I do this for?

235
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,834
You're always like this.

236
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,912
Just tell me honestly,
what is on your mind.

237
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,988
Suen's a great kung fu master.

238
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,509
He is difficult to handle.

239
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,758
What we have now
is sufficient for our future.

240
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,676
Have you ever
thought about your future?

241
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,433
Future?

242
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,469
We'll be the masters
of the martial arts world.

243
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,948
What then?

244
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,238
After that nothing else is important.

245
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,152
You are still a woman,
you should have a husband.

246
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,351
You should be able to
understand me after all these years.

247
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,871
I don't see myself as a woman. I don't
want you to treat me as a woman either.

248
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,237
Remember that.

249
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,993
But you won't tell Sing this.

250
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,472
Tench, pomfret, loach,
silurid fish, sole and carp.

251
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,480
It'll be funny if I can fish any of these.

252
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,876
Brother Sing, time to eat.
How's your fishing going?

253
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,632
I have to cheat again.

254
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,109
What are you doing?

255
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,631
Fishing is... really... difficult.

256
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,071
It's cold.

257
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,477
Time to eat.

258
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,033
So many dishes. Let's drink some wine.

259
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,596
No don't. You always make me drunk.
Now I will make myself drunk.

260
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,192
Hey...

261
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,549
If you're drunk,
you can't stop me leaving.

262
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,872
If I don't leave, how can I do business
and provide for both of us?

263
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,878
You know I always worry about you?

264
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,516
You're a straightforward man.

265
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,228
You don't know how horrible
the world of martial arts is.

266
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,672
My dad was a kung fu master.
He was killed.

267
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,713
You always come back safe.

268
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,879
It's thanks to my father's blessing.
Don't you agree?

269
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,951
Sure.

270
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,199
What's that smell. Did you fart?

271
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,989
See.

272
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,556
Smelly bean curd, I love it.

273
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,800
It stinks, but it's delicious.

274
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,035
It proves you can't judge
on appearances.

275
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,876
- Where is the fish I caught today?
- Here it is.

276
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,634
Oh, it smells good.

277
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,275
Be smart in business and you
won't end up a dead fish like this.

278
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,839
What should I do then?

279
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,269
You should be vicious.

280
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,151
But, most important of all
you should have this.

281
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,395
It looks like bean curd.

282
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,949
It's pigs brain, that means
you should use your brain.

283
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,511
That's right.

284
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,752
My God, please bless my husband
so he will be smart and make more money.

285
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,789
Then all women will be fond of him
and be seduced by him... Oh, no!

286
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,110
No, forget the things
I just mentioned.

287
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,989
I'll start from the very beginning.

288
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,991
My God, please bless my husband. Be safe
in this trip. Don't be framed by rascals.

289
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,432
Have a nice trip and come back soon.

290
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,036
Most important of all, don't be courted
by other girls and stay loyal to me.

291
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,799
Butterfly, what have you put
in my luggage? It's so heavy.

292
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,999
Why are there so many books?

293
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,830
These are the secret books
which you forbid me to see.

294
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,877
You said, you depended
on them for business.

295
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,350
I never said that.

296
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,070
You're right, these are the
books I need for business.

297
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,914
If you feel it's heavy just leave it.

298
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,389
No, it's not too heavy.

299
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,474
Where is my sword?

300
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,714
Where did you put my sword?

301
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,719
What's the use of
taking the sword with you?

302
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,113
It's for the sake of appearances
and it's useful to carry something.

303
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,230
It can be used as a stick.
I can cut fruit with it, and...

304
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,919
maybe fight with it as well.

305
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,351
Let me think, what I should
buy you as a souvenir?

306
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,751
- Cosmetics?
- No.

307
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,514
- Silk garments?
- No, too kitsch.

308
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,877
Any hints?

309
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,998
- This new product...
- A shovel?

310
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,595
No, it's for women.
Foreign women love it.

311
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,752
Thousands of Chinese
women find them attractive.

312
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,193
That's great. It must be wonderful.

313
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,711
Look.

314
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,598
This is called a bra.
And these are called underpants.

315
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,032
Bra and underpants.

316
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,235
Let me tell you. These two things give
ladies the perfect figure.

317
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,070
Men find them so attractive that they
are loyal to the women who wear them.

318
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,949
Ko has a nice figure...
She must use these.

319
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,749
That's great.

320
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,999
Remember to buy me these.

321
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,029
What a pretty moon tonight.

322
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,113
I don't want the moon to go.

323
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,634
Because when it goes, it means
it's time for you to leave me.

324
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,559
Can you cancel this trip?

325
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,509
I don't want to leave you.

326
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,311
But this is something we
have no control over.

327
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,914
It is confusing.

328
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,869
Like when we wake up and can't
remember a dream we've just had.

329
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,471
- Do you understand?
- Sure I do.

330
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,070
Don't think I don't understand.

331
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,639
Are you not leaving?

332
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,555
You're really smart. But wrong.

333
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,475
But I promise you
I will come back soon, very soon.

334
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,274
Keep you promise.

335
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,871
Butterfly, I am leaving now.
Try not to miss me. I'll miss you a lot.

336
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,995
And don't worry about me, or else
I'll end up worrying about you.

337
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,949
You should remember
not to treat Ko as your maid.

338
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,754
Learn how to sew if you have time.
Don't bother her.

339
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,400
Also, don't ever offend her over
silly things. Never offend her.

340
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,039
Get up early in the morning.

341
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,914
And make sure you eat properly.

342
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,317
You should control your diet.
I don't want to see a pig when I'm back.

343
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,475
And don't be such a big mouth.
Stop lying.

344
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,949
Don't trick Brother Yip.

345
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,280
Always remember
to wash every day.

346
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,278
You are a girl, be good
and don't sit like this.

347
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,230
Don't talk to your doll,
they'll think you're mad.

348
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,592
You have a lot of bad habits,
but don't hate yourself.

349
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,591
I have a lot of bad habits too.
We are two of a kind.

350
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,952
It's dawn. I have to go now.

351
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,512
I have been writing this letter all night.

352
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,269
Love you always, Sing.

353
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,073
Here it is beautiful, here is great,
How peaceful and prosperous it is here!

354
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,636
What a dangerous and messy world.
A swordsman was killed.

355
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,276
He was a great kung fu master,
from the Happy Forest.

356
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,916
He is called Meng Sing Wan.

357
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,716
I am scared to death.

358
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,909
You are supposed to be dead.

359
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,151
From now on,
you are called Tsun Wai.

360
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,789
You are a swordsman from
the South - a Cantonese.

361
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,512
Don't worry, I will get the
secret letter off Li before the autumn.

362
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,236
I will find out
about Suen Suk Pa.

363
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,948
We can kill him
this time if we join our forces.

364
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,029
On the first day of each month
Suen will book a room at a brothel.

365
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:28,913
The swordsman will spend one night
there with the best whore, Miu Siu Siu.

366
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,477
There are lots of performers from
the North there at the moment.

367
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,755
They perform by the shore each night,
I believe Suen will go there soon.

368
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,514
Sir, how about fortune telling?

369
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,596
- How much?
- 5 cents now, 50 taels next time.

370
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,353
Why are the prices so different?

371
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,591
If you don't trust me this time,
5 cents will mean a lot to you.

372
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,391
But if you think it's worth coming here
a second time, 50 taels isn't expensive.

373
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,035
- What do you want to know?
- Just tell me anything you know.

374
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,035
You are on a secret mission.
You're meeting a friend.

375
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,435
Have I ever seen this friend before?

376
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,839
Yes, and you will meet this friend again.
You haven't seen each other in 10 years.

377
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,233
5 cents is too expensive.

378
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,159
- Is my friend a man or woman?
- Woman.

379
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,118
I shouldn't ask
a blind man my fortune.

380
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,191
You are so arrogant.

381
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,878
Stop.

382
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,269
Sister Ko, I have reached the Elite Villa.
Suen Puk Pa trusts me.

383
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,515
I am now investigating
Li Shu Tin's letter.

384
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,718
Besides Suen, I've found
a hooker called Miu Siu Siu.

385
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,915
She looks like Ho Ching -
the one who disappeared 10 years ago.

386
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,588
I wonder if she is Ho Ching?

387
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,748
I'll carry on investigating.

388
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,913
How is Butterfly?

389
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,436
Why didn't you mention her?
I'd like to know what she is doing.

390
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,917
Please reply as soon as possible.
Meng Sing Wan.

391
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,791
- Who is it?
- Sister Ko, it's me.

392
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,395
I've come to visit you.

393
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,188
Hello Butterfly.

394
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,958
You are mistaken,
I am Little Butterfly.

395
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,638
Sing has had so many girlfriends,
I can't remember all their names.

396
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,029
Please forgive me.

397
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,509
- I made some dim sum for you.
- You know how to please people, don't you.

398
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,958
That's why Sing fell for you.
What do you want me to do for you?

399
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,553
Sister Ko, you're smart.
Sing wants you to teach me how to sew.

400
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,156
And I think I should dress like you.
You look so beautiful.

401
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,239
No one would believe
you're 10 years older than me.

402
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,956
You are wrong.
I am only 6 years older.

403
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,873
- You know I have a bad memory.
- Hey, you haven't returned my hairpin.

404
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,675
But you took the scarf which Brother Sing
sent me. Do you remember?

405
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,993
You can take anything
as you are so mean.

406
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,195
I don't want anything.
Brother Sing asked me not to argue you.

407
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,390
- He knows you are mean.
- Me?

408
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,232
I have made some clothes for Sing.

409
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,990
- I wonder if they will fit him.
- No?

410
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,279
We grew up together.
I know everything about him.

411
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,554
Grew up together?

412
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,353
I thought you were
just his babysitter.

413
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,877
What did you say.

414
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,351
Nothing, just kidding.

415
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,038
What an awful colour.

416
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,948
Sing loves these two colours.

417
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,990
I've never seen him
wearing this colour before.

418
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,716
How long have you been with him?
We lived together for over 10 years.

419
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,239
I know his loves and hates.

420
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,272
- It's too sweet.
- Sing loves sweet things.

421
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,273
I thought you understood Sing.

422
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,154
I won't eat anything,
I'll save it for Yip Cheung.

423
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,710
Sister Ko, you like Yip.

424
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,952
Actually, you two are a
perfect match for each other.

425
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,835
Stop it,
if he hears that he'll misunderstand.

426
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,230
You know he is a serious man
and you always make fun of him.

427
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,920
Yip is serious, but he treats you well.

428
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,876
Hey, he can't cope with Sing anyway.

429
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,669
I agree.

430
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,632
Lots of girls love Sing.

431
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,989
I've worried so much about his trip this time,
but I tell myself not to.

432
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,194
He has a secret weapon.

433
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,875
Just tell me, or forget it.

434
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,029
I'll tell you, but just because it's you.

435
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,998
I'm pregnant.

436
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,869
- Are you sure it's Sing's baby?
- What do you mean?

437
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,271
Why are you so serious?
I'm joking.

438
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,873
I'm going to look for Yip Cheung.

439
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,999
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

440
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,791
You're lying. Your mouth is dirty.

441
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,028
Really? What is it?

442
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,830
Are you drunk again?
Why did you kiss the picture?

443
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,557
I didn't.

444
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,957
Give it to me.

445
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,750
Stop teasing me.

446
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,716
Who is she? Your lover?
I'm not teasing you.

447
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,839
I've brought you some dim sum.

448
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,199
Master Suen, how is our plan going?

449
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,391
It's going smoothly.

450
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,274
We have sent out all the invitations.

451
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,359
On the 8th day of August, all
the heroes of the martial arts world

452
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,030
will gather at Han's Forest.

453
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,874
Then,
the Yellow Dragon Horse Troop will pick them.

454
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,238
We will set out at once to destroy
Ko and her Happy Forest.

455
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,749
If I chop the claws off a crab,
how far will it go?

456
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,390
Tsao Sau Ching,
how well can you cope with me?

457
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,871
Master Suen, our mission
is going to be successful.

458
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,158
The title of Master of the martial
arts world is reserved for you.

459
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,152
Thank you.

460
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,075
But be careful.

461
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,715
Many great kung fu masters
are found in the Happy Forest School.

462
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,917
Don't worry.

463
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,998
I have something to report too.

464
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,829
Last month, I recruited a
great swordsman from Hai Fung.

465
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,275
He is as great at martial arts
as Lui Heung Chuen.

466
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,189
You mean Chun Wai.

467
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,393
You are well informed.

468
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,717
To get the title of Master
of the martial arts world

469
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,349
everyone wants to recruit
great swordsmen.

470
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,194
It is easy to recruit,
but much harder to make a man loyal.

471
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,312
Your Excellency.

472
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,035
I know what you mean.

473
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,990
We should find out what your opponent's
weakness is, so we can control him.

474
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,032
All Lui Heung Cheun wants is money.

475
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,868
Chun Wai wants my lover.

476
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,879
Only believe it if you have
seen it with your own eyes.

477
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,190
Remember,
you should be careful.

478
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,953
I will always remember your words.

479
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,428
Sister Ko, Suen Yuk Pa
is now arranging the moves.

480
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,952
On the 8th day of August, he'll send
the Yellow Dragon Horse Troop

481
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,988
to bring some heroes to his villa.

482
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,233
You should try your very best to stop
him otherwise we will be in deep shit.

483
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,916
I will inform you straight away of any news.
If I get any. Meng Sing Wan.

484
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,077
How dare you.

485
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,915
We are the guests
of the Elite Villa.

486
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,472
Well, that means
I haven't made any mistakes.

487
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,598
Sir, what's happened?

488
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,910
Miss, we found this corpse.

489
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,909
We found this letter in his luggage.
We sent it to the address written on it.

490
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,674
Go and check whether the
dead man is your relative.

491
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,358
Go.

492
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,832
Butterfly.

493
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,156
Yip Cheung,
what's wrong with Brother Sing?

494
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,717
Round them up.

495
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,032
Master, we've found something.

496
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:17,638
Ho Ching.

497
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,239
What did you say?
What do you mean?

498
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,829
You look like one of my friends.

499
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,275
What did you say?

500
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,750
How old are you?
Where do you come from?

501
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:31,833
Are you...

502
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,279
Chun Wai, how dare you
be so rude to Miss Miu.

503
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,472
Suen Kim.

504
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,716
Dad, he was rude to Miss Miu.

505
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,157
Stop. I have some good
news to announce to you all.

506
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,949
In three days, I will marry
Miss Miu to Chun Wai.

507
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,309
Miss Miu, congratulations.

508
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,871
Master, in fact I...

509
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,311
I know what's on your mind.

510
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,875
You won't blame me for not
informing you before, right?

511
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:56,878
I...

512
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,039
You're lucky.
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

513
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,992
Bravo.

514
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,952
Give me the arrow.

515
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,156
Master, will you
give us more luck?

516
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,435
Ha ha, so what, I love it.

517
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:49,953
- Monkey!
- Yes.

518
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,914
Bring the wine.
Go and pay.

519
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,109
See, it overflows.

520
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,673
Look.

521
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,032
You lost, so you're paying for it.
You should drink some, young master.

522
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:02,678
Damn you.

523
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,629
Master Suen, please don't.

524
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,352
Go away.

525
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,434
We haven't held such a
big party in a long time.

526
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,910
I envy you.

527
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,479
The Master has placed his
trust in you very quickly.

528
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,998
Actually, I am happy,
but I do have some worries.

529
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,794
I am afraid
that I would disappoint you.

530
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,991
I've never made any
bad judgements.

531
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,795
You two are a great help.

532
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,600
Just work together
without arousing suspicion.

533
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,915
It'll be the end of that bitch.

534
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,353
Ko, who wants to challenge me?

535
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,910
When will we set out to
destroy her Happy Forest?

536
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,438
I want to have fun...
I want to have fun...

537
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,713
You've messed up again.
Get lost, now take him away.

538
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,991
Let go of me.

539
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,910
What a jerk.

540
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,990
- Master, may I be excused?
- Yes.

541
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,391
Hands off me,
I want to have fun.

542
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,033
Good night.

543
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,752
It's you.

544
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,508
- Master!
- Kill her!

545
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,438
Get her.

546
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,958
Are you Ho Ching?
Why are you doing this?

547
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,550
This is Sister Ko's mission.
Suen always keeps the letter with her.

548
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,356
I will no longer be his woman.

549
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,034
I won't stand a chance if
I don't do anything now.

550
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,597
You are Ho Ching.

551
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:17,838
Ho Ching.

552
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,308
I failed. I can't face Ko again.
Take care.

553
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,234
Don't. Ho Ching.

554
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,715
Brother Lui, I'm mourning.
I can't take on any jobs for a few days.

555
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,475
I'll report for duty in a few days.
Please inform Master Suen.

556
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,270
Ho Ching didn't disappear.
She has been staying with the Elite Villa.

557
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,956
Why did you cheat on us?
How else have you deceived us?

558
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,789
I've always treated you as my family.

559
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,591
I want to know why you raised us?
To kill? To get rid of your enemy?

560
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,355
Or do you want to be the leader
of the martial arts world?

561
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,837
Have you got any feelings.
You are heartless.

562
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,999
Have you tried to understand me?

563
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,230
I have to cope with so
much in order to survive.

564
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,629
Don't make excuses!

565
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,835
You are so selfish.

566
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,637
I don't know what you're thinking.
But I know you're after money.

567
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,029
Have you had enough?

568
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,953
I have never shed any
tears in front of anyone.

569
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,029
I can't believe you
would blame me like this.

570
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,072
I do feel sad about Ho Ching's death.

571
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,555
Do you think I love killing?
That money is my only reason for killing?

572
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,793
Ever since I entered the world of martial arts,
I've never had the choice.

573
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,832
I haven't smiled since I was born.

574
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,789
I am not happy,
I am always scared.

575
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,029
What makes me feel good
is that I am still alive.

576
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,758
But I have to pay
such a high price.

577
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,869
Do I look like a woman?

578
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,318
Am I not attractive?

579
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,071
I understand.
You don't know what I am thinking.

580
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,550
I don't want to be a puppet again.

581
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,115
I want to choose my own path.

582
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,630
It's too late to say that.

583
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,072
You know, if we or the
Happy Forest want to survive,

584
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,919
we should compete with others.

585
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,874
The Happy Forest and the
Elite Villa can't live side by side.

586
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,599
This is the rule of the martial arts world.

587
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,038
I don't care about rules.
I just want to know if it's the last time.

588
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,716
Stop asking.
I'd never hurt you, I am not your enemy.

589
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,556
In fact, I'll always protect you.

590
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,672
You have done everything well.

591
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,192
Have you ever thought
about the pressure I bear?

592
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,831
Sometimes I ask
myself what I am doing.

593
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,079
I am not related to you.

594
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,318
But when I see you so happy,
I know it's worth it.

595
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,759
I have realised
that I am only a woman now.

596
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,753
I promise this is the last time.

597
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,397
Thank you.

598
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:01,997
Meng Sing Wan!

599
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,197
Aunt Sans' daughter was
pregnant before her marriage.

600
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,919
The Master of the village said
she should be drowned.

601
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,909
It's a punishment. We should
get her as soon as possible.

602
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,913
Damn it, how long
should I hide up here?

603
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,069
Sing is missing.

604
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,631
But my baby is growing
bigger and bigger.

605
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,833
What should I do?

606
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,317
Tell me.

607
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,035
I'd better not talk to you.

608
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,030
Brother Sing asked me
not to talk to dolls.

609
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,033
I have to get rid of this
habit before he comes back.

610
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,238
Brother Sing!

611
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,270
You shouldn't jump.
The roof might collapse.

612
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:24,997
You always tease me.

613
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,235
It's time for revenge.

614
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,030
You're not in a good mood.
I'm not in a good mood either.

615
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,749
I have brought you
a bottle of wonderful wine.

616
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,948
Sing said that you like to get drunk.

617
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,036
You have company tonight.
We can forget all the bad stuff if we drink.

618
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:49,917
Fine.

619
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,915
Tell me the truth, is Sing dead?

620
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,628
If he is alive,
why didn't he come back?

621
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,034
Did he talk to you?

622
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,119
I always treated you as my family.
You should believe me.

623
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,994
I will bring him here, no matter what.

624
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,676
Why don't you let me go to the
Happy Forest? Is Sister Ko our family?

625
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,638
You'll understand
that this is a complicated world later.

626
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,471
It's the same story again.

627
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,551
You always use the world of martial arts
to explain difficult things.

628
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,755
I don't understand.

629
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,952
Sing and I don't belong to the world of martial arts.
Why do we have so many problems?

630
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,513
The world of martial arts has no boundaries.

631
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,034
The living can't escape any problems.

632
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,994
Please stop saying such confusing things.

633
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:47,236
You mean someone wants
to hurt me and Sing?

634
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,390
Sure.

635
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,913
When he finds out you're an obstacle
on his road to success, you'll be in trouble.

636
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,920
Who am I bothering?

637
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,720
You don't even understand.
So stop asking.

638
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,834
I won't ask again.
You're not answering my question.

639
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:03,513
Hey...

640
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,997
What a big pack of herbs.
That's why he is so upset.

641
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,756
Fire...

642
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,119
It's not a fire,
I am boiling the herbal tea for you.

643
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,950
You might look funny, but you won't
make me laugh. I am still angry.

644
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,198
Drink it.

645
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,794
- Are we friends again?
- It's good for the baby.

646
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:49,916
I don't want to drink it.

647
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,472
It took four hours to make.
You should drink it.

648
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,029
I did this for your family.
Are you going against them?

649
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,153
I love it.
You can't handle the woman you love.

650
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,749
Why should you bother my family?

651
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,035
What woman?

652
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,158
Sister Ko.

653
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,831
I know you love her.

654
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,115
Don't drink it then!

655
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,719
Careful, the house will collapse.

656
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,039
Oh, I'll drink it!

657
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,037
I knew it was you. What are you doing?

658
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,793
It's two days from the Mid-Autumn Festival.
I brought you some treats.

659
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,916
Why didn't you come in
through the main gate?

660
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,075
I am a great kung fu master,
you know.

661
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:04,199
Stop pretending I'm still mad at you.
I'm not that mean.

662
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,993
I went to the temple to pray for you.

663
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,996
I am not angry. I wish you good health
before Sing's return.

664
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,829
You mean, Sing is coming back
before the Mid-Autumn Festival?

665
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,037
Maybe.

666
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:17,952
It's a promise.

667
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,836
Remember to keep your promise.
And to bring Sing back to me.

668
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,838
That's good. I won't be so lonely then.
It will be a family reunion.

669
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,113
But you must be sad
not to have anyone.

670
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,031
I'm so serious.
I don't know how to please girls.

671
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,915
I've so many faults,
I am destined to be a monk.

672
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,797
Don't be so upset,
you can improve yourself.

673
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,392
How?

674
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,871
You should learn how
to express yourself.

675
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,953
Just tell others
what you are thinking.

676
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,316
Most important of all, smile.

677
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,110
Learn how to smile?

678
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,557
Yes, smile now.

679
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,711
You look awful. You'd better not laugh.
You'd scare everyone.

680
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,995
I haven't finished yet. Your biggest
problem is that you are too mean.

681
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,398
Also, keep your promises.

682
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,998
According to Sun's Military Advice, it is wise
to act as quick as lightning in any attack.

683
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,908
We should attack suddenly.

684
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,193
You are gathered here.

685
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:44,518
What I want to tell you is that
this is a critical moment.

686
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,029
We are going to attack
the Happy Forest tonight.

687
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,229
The swordsmen of the Yellow Dragon
Horse Troop will go with us

688
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,910
and attack those bastards.

689
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:43,717
Suen Kim!

690
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,110
My son...

691
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,519
You bastard!

692
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:25,752
Sing Wan!

693
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,715
With this armour on
how can you hurt me?

694
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,156
Where's the Evil Claw that
you attacked me with last time?

695
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,068
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never attacked you.

696
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,149
Your Excellency.

697
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,636
We have destroyed Suen Yuk Pa.

698
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,275
We also have Li's secret letter.

699
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,234
Good, well done.

700
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,918
You haven't disappointed me.

701
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,390
Opening the secret letter
will reveal their plan.

702
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:35,877
Be careful.

703
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,959
I was pretending
to be Eunuch Li!

704
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,669
I killed the real Li Shui Tin
a long time ago.

705
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,310
I knew there would be a battle between
the two most powerful forces if I did this.

706
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,950
And that then I'd be able to control
the entire martial arts world.

707
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,994
But you can help me
to fulfil one more wish.

708
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,878
Tell the King of Hell this good news!

709
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,478
You bastard,
I already know your plan.

710
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,508
I'll take the opportunity
to watch your moves.

711
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,955
In two months time,
you will show your real face to us.

712
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,955
Bullshit, why are you so arrogant?

713
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,428
Licence to kill.

714
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,198
Bullshit.

715
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,429
How dare you betray me.

716
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,750
The magic ball.

717
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,157
The Whirlwind Kick.

718
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:50,916
Lightning Kick.

719
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,391
Super Strike.

720
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,034
You are so stupid. It's an iron ball.

721
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,395
The real ball is here.

722
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,437
The Flying Arrow.

723
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,749
Fatal Kick.

724
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,035
Thank you so much.

725
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,279
If it wasn't for your help,
we wouldn't have killed Tsao.

726
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,755
His Majesty will be very happy.

727
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,635
I won't go back to the capital.

728
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,236
I love these games, I'd hate to
do a normal job. Take care.

729
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,031
Little Whirlwind.

730
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,591
From now on, the martial
arts world belongs to us.

731
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,428
I hope you can stay with me.

732
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,235
Brother Sing.

733
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:03,951
Look out!

734
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,869
Butterfly.
