11
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,021
Once upon a time...

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,290
In the Mt. Holy lived
Mae and Hwasan tribes.

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,891
Mae made war on Hwasan
to rule the world...

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,595
...and, worshiped by Hwasan,
Mt. Holy punished Mae.

15
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,363
Years later...

16
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,140
Having been exiled to the barren land...

17
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,902
...Mae made the holy sword with
blood and bones of 1,000 people...

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,969
..in an attempt to destroy
Hwasan tribe and Mt. Holy.

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,213
Now, the descendant of the Hwasan Royal Family...

20
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,548
...needs to be given as a sacrifice
to complete the holy sword.

21
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,051
No regrets?
We'll be lonely.

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:14,393
With you and our baby,
I couldn't be happier.

23
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,580
Why?

24
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,014
Do you really think
I loved you?

25
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:41,117
Wake up!
I only needed your sperm.

26
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:53,233
You did your job!
Forever, Mae tribe!

27
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,435
The baby will die anyway.
You want to kill it yourself?

28
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,455
What are you waiting for?
Go head!

29
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,660
I'll never forgive you!

30
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,156
Brothers and sisters of Mae!

31
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,096
Having ruled the world
for thousands of years...

32
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,432
...owning everything on earth...

33
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,433
...the curse of Mt. Holy

34
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,672
put an end to our prosperity.

35
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:17,720
In years to come, if there's to be
our descendants, our own flesh...

36
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,360
...they'll rule the world again,

37
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:26,393
and Mt. Holy won't stop them.

38
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:32,003
With the holy sword
made from blood and bones...

39
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,809
...let fight the curse of Mt. Holy!
Descendants of Mae!

40
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:43,739
Regain the honor we enjoyed
and prosper forever!

41
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,851
500 years from now,
when the black moon is up...

42
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,578
...a girl will be born

43
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,652
and named Vee.

44
00:04:53,926 --> 00:05:00,195
Only her spirit can
wake up the holy sword!

45
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:20,914
Your holiness will shine the world...

46
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:26,720
...saving our tribe
from the everlasting nightmare.

47
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,154
Witness the eternity of Mae!

48
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:25,211
With a 500-year-old promise,
when the darkness falls...

49
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,281
...the spirit of Vee
will complete the holy sword...

50
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,681
...that will free us
from the chains of Mt. Holy!

51
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:45,760
The spirit of Vee!
Open the world of darkness!

52
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,639
I'm taking her with me.

53
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,041
She was born to be a sacrifice.

54
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,343
You can't change her fate!

55
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,883
It's also her fate
that I'm to protect her!

56
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,452
Don't be dirty her fate
with the name of tribe Mae.

57
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,624
I won't tolerate it!

58
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,665
Bring her back to me.
By all means!

59
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,030
Years later...

60
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,080
Where's Dahn?

61
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,581
- Nowhere in sight! Where?
- The valley of clouds!

62
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,155
- Who are they?
- Beats me.

63
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,891
We shouldn't let them
enter the village.

64
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,906
A backward grip!
He's from our tribe!

65
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,710
Wait for Dahn.

66
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,619
If we do, the village will be
in danger. Come on!

67
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,184
Are you okay?

68
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,808
It's time to go home.

69
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:37,821
Are you okay?
It's all over.

70
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,962
I had a dream last night.The golden
leaves covered the whole village.

71
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:16,594
I guess it tried to tell me
you were coming.

72
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,798
I gave it a lot of thoughts.

73
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,806
It's not easy coming home
after deserting your family.

74
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,842
What happened today was

75
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,641
Hwasan against Mae tribe.

76
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,244
We couldn't care less

77
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,413
about who's after you.

78
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,254
Long ago,

79
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,986
you deserted us and left Mt. Holy.

80
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,962
Nether can you come back,
nor stay here. Leave!

81
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:58,576
Vee... is that your name?
I heard Han call you that.

82
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,911
Yes, Ma'am.

83
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,508
- How old are you?
- 15.

84
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,377
It hasn't been easy for me.

85
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,578
Right before you came,
Mt. Holy cried.

86
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,224
I guess we'll find out later

87
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,156
what it meant.

88
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:21,095
Han wants you to stay here.

89
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,565
He believes that
Mt. Holy will protect you.

90
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,296
I won't ask you

91
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,548
Whatever my dad wishes.

92
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:45,923
You can stay,
but Han is leaving tonight.

93
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,633
This pendant of warrior
symbolizes courage before death.

94
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,934
It also symbolizes hope.

95
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:09,608
Courage is the only hope

96
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,310
that saves you from death.

97
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,353
Someday,

98
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,788
it'll clear your eyes out of fear.

99
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:28,332
We've lived a life of hardships.

100
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,597
But I know that

101
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,164
daddy isn't a bad man.

102
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:47,315
Don't worry about me.

103
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,684
I won't.

104
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:56,025
Though I won't be with you,
I'll keep praying for you.

105
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,291
Be well.

106
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,119
It's from Vee.

107
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,731
Take a good care of her.
She needs friends.

108
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,876
I haven't seen anybody
making paper for ages.

109
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,279
I would do it with my mom
when she was alive.

110
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,821
She said I was better
at it than Juk.

111
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,024
It's been already 5 years.

112
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,096
I remember her.
She was such a sweet lady.

113
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,969
It's just

114
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,067
an old memory now.

115
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,606
You care so much about Juk.

116
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,745
Because he's my best friend.

117
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,921
What were you talking about?

118
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,529
- Who?
- You and Vee.

119
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,529
I taught her how to make paper.
You saw, didn't you?

120
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,571
- Nothing else?
- No, that was about it.

121
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,901
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.

122
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:06,414
You like her, don't you?

123
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,956
Silly goose!

124
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:29,400
I will be fine.
I know I will!

125
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,504
Come on!
- Dahn! Dahn! Dahn!

126
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,571
Come on!

127
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:17,862
Today, sons of Mt. Holy
became adults.

128
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,054
Congratulations!

129
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,937
You'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa

130
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,630
in the morning.

131
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,876
It's Mt. Holy that decides
who survives...

132
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,810
...but those who make it back
will be warriors of the tribe.

133
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,841
We'll light the night for you.

134
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,049
This is for you.

135
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,220
I made it myself.
It will protect you.

136
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,158
I always take things from you.

137
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,100
Haven't I told you?
I'm your shadow.

138
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,335
Thanks, man!

139
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,473
I'm so lucky to know you.

140
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,347
I'm happy that I can help you.

141
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:16,185
It's the painting of prophecy.

142
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,016
They say our future lies in it,

143
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,450
but I don't buy it.

144
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,496
Do you know

145
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,826
that it's only Haeah
and me who are allowed in here.

146
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,299
In the morning,
you'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa.

147
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,174
When you come back,

148
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,140
you'll be the patriarch.

149
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,140
And, by the rules of the tribe,
I'll be your wife.

150
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:48,886
That's not...
What are you doing?

151
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:56,016
Have a safe trip.

152
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,789
I don't want anybody else
to become the patriarch.

153
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,528
Let's get out of here.
They're waiting for me.

154
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:11,406
Who?
Who's waiting for you?

155
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,222
I've been looking
all over for you.

156
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,721
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

157
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,756
You're leaving in the morning.

158
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,858
- And?
- Have a safe trip.

159
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:41,868
- What am I supposed to say?
- No presents?

160
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,973
Oh, I completely forgot.
Sorry about that.

161
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:59,715
No, I've got one for you.
There you go. Take it.

162
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,450
My late father gave it to me.

163
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,996
Play it when you feel down.
It'll cheer you up.

164
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:18,067
It worked for me. Goodnight.
You look gorgeous tonight.

165
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:26,512
Wait! Thanks.

166
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,696
Tell me about it.

167
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,091
About what?

168
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:44,190
- I don't have your heart.
- That's not true.

169
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,495
It's Vee, isn't it?

170
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,236
Does she know?

171
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,341
What are you talking about?

172
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:53,136
You've changed a lot
since she came here.

173
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,008
She's just a friend.

174
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,012
Can you swear on it?

175
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,014
Stop being silly.

176
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,186
You're evading my question!

177
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,314
I'm afraid you might give up

178
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,719
on your goal because of her.

179
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,052
Nothing's going to change.
Vee needs friends.

180
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,027
You can never be sure!

181
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,827
All I want is to become a king

182
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,628
and rule the world.

183
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,501
I hope you mean it.

184
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,837
Keep in mind what you want
and who can help you.

185
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,520
This pendant of warrior
symbolizes courage before death.

186
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,930
It also symbolizes hope.

187
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,369
Courage is the only hope

188
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,937
that saves you from death.

189
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,708
Someday, it'll clear your eyes
out of fear.

190
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,169
Bye.

191
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,973
Make it back!

192
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,082
Our ancestors' fury was
buried here 500 years ago.

193
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,814
As the descendants,

194
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,456
if we wreck vengeance...

195
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,289
...we won't be breathe as alive
and close our eyes as dead.

196
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,396
The day of fate is coming!

197
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,057
We've got to destroy Mt. Holy

198
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,227
and Hwasan tribe!

199
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:11,304
Go bring back Vee,
the key to the holy sword!

200
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,990
Forever, Mae!

201
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,199
The fire of Mt. Sunghwa
will be waiting for you.

202
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,138
By all means,

203
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,704
bring it back to Mt. Holy.

204
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,175
The tribe will be waiting
for the new patriarch.

205
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:05,647
Out of the woods is Mt. Sunghwa.

206
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,858
Whoever stays alive,
bring the fire back home.

207
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,995
At any cost,
we have to pull this off!

208
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,664
- The leader...
- I will!

209
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,762
Dahn, take the lead.

210
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,732
Help!

211
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,830
Let's go!

212
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:55,021
Pull!

213
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,300
Are you okay?

214
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,181
Pull!

215
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:55,543
Dahn!

216
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,855
The village!

217
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:17,427
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Go help others!

218
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:42,088
It's okay.

219
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,215
Warriors are back!

220
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,324
Welcome home!

221
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,599
Congratulations!

222
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:13,304
Don't be sad.
He's just being late.

223
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:21,279
Maybe he's lost,
or has a place to stop by.

224
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:29,753
Wait for him.
He's coming back.

225
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:05,388
It's a mess in here.
It'll take a while to clean it up.

226
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,699
I thought I had to tell you

227
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,094
what happened in person.

228
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,136
We tried to save him

229
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,941
but only to fail.

230
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,181
It's all my fault.

231
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:45,797
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Don't say anything. Don't

232
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,565
Dahn always supported you.

233
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,267
He'd wanted to see you
sit in the throne.

234
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,869
I'm so happy you're back,

235
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:29,846
but I just can't believe it.

236
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,206
I can't believe he's gone.

237
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,690
Feels like he's coming in here
anytime soon.

238
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,660
Yeah, he's coming back.
Maybe he's already here.

239
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:58,775
Dahn is not coming back!
Dahn's dead.

240
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,708
- Mom made them for you.
- Thanks.

241
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:18,302
They're pretty good.
Try some.

242
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
Delicious, isn't it?

243
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,710
I know why you're sad.

244
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:41,280
It's Dahn, isn't it?
Is he dead?

245
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:52,487
No... he's coming back.

246
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,525
I'm sure he's coming back

247
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,727
for you.

248
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,601
He's here!

249
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,561
Long time, no see.

250
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,068
- Who is it?
- Get back inside!

251
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,410
Time to go home, girl.
They're waiting for you.

252
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:23,451
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my home. No way!

253
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,457
I wish I could tear you apart
right now!

254
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:39,200
But I won't
You have a job to finish.

255
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:44,235
It's shame that
your daddy isn't here.

256
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,658
You're late.

257
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,020
It feels as if I was dreaming.

258
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,195
A tree broke my fall,

259
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,096
and I was in a strange place.

260
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:31,439
- Somebody saved me.
- Who could it be?

261
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:45,691
Don't you leave me again.
You hear me?

262
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,527
I won't.

263
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,521
I knew you'd make it back.

264
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,859
The patriarch should be selected
through the competition.

265
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:22,194
But all the warriors
and elders are in favor of Juk.

266
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,263
Dahn?

267
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,830
I'll accept their decision.

268
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:35,940
Good. By the unanimous decision,
Juk will be the patriarch.

269
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:40,171
No! The position is only given

270
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,145
to the best warrior.

271
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,855
The tradition should be valued.

272
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:53,492
Therefore, I ask for a duel
with Dahn.

273
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,759
I ask for your permission.

274
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,997
The winner will marry Yun...

275
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:11,111
...and carry down the blood
of the Hwasan Royal Family.

276
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,778
For the honor of Hwasan,
do your best.

277
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,916
Why are you doing this?

278
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,962
The best warrior
should be the patriarch.

279
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,859
Don't worry.
You'll be the one.

280
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,831
Let's call it quits
before one of us gets hurt!

281
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,033
What do you mean?
You're willing to lose?

282
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,540
- It's you that Yun wants.
- And Vee wants you?

283
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,708
Don' t be mistaken.
You can't deceive the tribe.

284
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,512
If you don't do your best,
you'll end up dead.

285
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,680
Why are you doing this?

286
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,523
I want Vee.
How about that?

287
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,295
What do you say?

288
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:13,868
- What's wrong?
- Mt. Holy...

289
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:38,756
It's over.

290
00:51:55,145 --> 00:52:00,276
Pay respect to Juk,
the new patriarch!

291
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,619
Juk, where were you?

292
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,028
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

293
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,530
Sorry I've lost a friend, though.

294
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,130
I'll see you later.

295
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,607
She said she was going
to Mt. Holy?

296
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,282
By the precept of Mt. Holy...

297
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,814
...Juk, you'll marry Yun

298
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,550
and become the new king.

299
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,954
The wedding will be held

300
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,265
7 days from today.

301
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,498
Dad would tell me about Mt. Holy.

302
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,500
He said that l'd end up there,

303
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,878
and it'd make me suffer.

304
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,051
- I think the time has come.
- I don't understand it.

305
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,483
Forget about it.
You're confusing me.

306
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,989
The day you came back...

307
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,997
What happened today
...it's not coincidental, is it?

308
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,566
Didn't you see?
Mt. Holy tried to kill me!

309
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,079
Please, leave.
I want to be alone.

310
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,183
We broke the rule!

311
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,817
People of Hwasan aren't
allowed to go to Mt. Holy.

312
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,588
Those who did in the past
never made it back alive.

313
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,723
We should be happy
we're still alive.

314
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:40,400
That's what frightens me.

315
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,230
I came back alive, didn't l?

316
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:55,807
- Why am I different?
- I didn't mean it that way.

317
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:01,000
Why?
Why am I different?

318
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,353
Go!
I don't want you here.

319
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,295
Sorry.

320
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,701
The day you came here,
Mt. Holy cried.

321
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,905
I didn't know what it meant then,
but I do now.

322
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:59,543
The shaky ground,
the evil spirit in the air...

323
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,577
...Mt. Holy was warning us
of a disaster.

324
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,244
Did you know?

325
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:13,961
I think you couldn't tell us,
but you did know.

326
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,600
Mt. Holy is afraid of you

327
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,204
cause you're to destroy it.

328
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,972
That fate of yours is a disaster,
damaging our tribe.

329
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,180
Hold my hands.
Mt. Holy will talk through you.

330
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:15,881
As the black moon appears
after the 3-day-long sun...

331
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,459
...two angry dragons will kill

332
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,427
all the living things on earth.

333
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:30,701
Trees will sooth the dragons...

334
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,736
...but the sword of the spirit
won't be stoppable.

335
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:42,313
When the sword shines...

336
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,620
...the world will quiet down
with sadness...

337
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:56,094
...but the chains of sadness
will last forever.

338
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,848
Mt. Holy wants me.

339
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,954
If I sacrifice myself to it,
the tribe will be safe.

340
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,327
I know now why my father

341
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:37,768
wanted to go to Mt. Holy...

342
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:45,010
...and why he left me here.

343
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:53,414
It was to protect the tribe.

344
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:03,093
Haeah!

345
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:07,498
I was born to be a sacrifice
for the tribe.

346
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,532
Can't you change my fate?

347
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:29,147
Haeah! You can do it,
can't you?

348
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,853
Do I have to die?

349
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,727
Can't you save my life?

350
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,563
I will make more paper

351
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,797
and stay outside the village!

352
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,634
I won't break my words
until the moment I die!

353
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,173
Save me!

354
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:56,046
Help me live!
Haeah!

355
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,389
Does Dahn know?
Have you told him yet?

356
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,528
Not yet.
Vee wants to do it herself.

357
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,758
Dahn won't buy it.
He won't let her go.

358
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,899
But there's nothing that
Haeah can do.

359
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,107
Mt. Holy has decided it,

360
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,842
- and it was predicted long ago.
- She knew?

361
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,449
Haeah believes in the prophecy
of the mural painting.

362
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:38,654
Don't go!
Give them time alone.

363
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,707
Let me.

364
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:04,383
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's just the paper.

365
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,616
Are you sure?

366
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,449
The paper looks so heavy today.

367
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,796
Cause everybody feels down.
It will be okay

368
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:24,698
when the fury of Mt. Holy subsides.

369
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,676
I hope so.

370
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,456
Juk and Yun will get married
in a few days.

371
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:24,727
Will you stay with me?

372
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,305
I don't know.

373
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,042
The life has never worked
in favor of me.

374
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,217
It made everything I wanted
turn away from me.

375
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,222
Because I wasn't with you.
It'll be different from now.

376
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:55,327
No matter what happens...

377
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:02,127
...I'll stay by your side
and help you out.

378
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:09,871
You can lean on me.
Okay?

379
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,893
Your ancestor painted it.

380
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:34,260
I'm the new patriarch.
Tell me everything about it.

381
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,703
It's the holy sword you saw
in the painting.

382
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:46,407
Long ago, Hwasan and Mae
went to a severe war.

383
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,250
Having been exiled from Mt. Holy...

384
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:54,247
...Mae tribe tried to make
the holy sword...

385
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,557
...with blood and bones
of a 1,000 alive people.

386
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,523
...in order to kill Mt. Holy
and exterminate our tribe.

387
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,162
To do so,

388
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:09,728
they needed the seed
of Hwasan Royal Family.

389
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:15,804
Soo, the chief of Mae, tempted
the King of Hawsan, Han...

390
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,373
...and gave a birth to Vee
who's to complete the sword.

391
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:24,683
But it wasn't easy.

392
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,317
Han brought

393
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:33,660
her here...

394
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,057
...to protect our tribe and Mt. Holy..

395
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,234
If Vee is here to protect us,

396
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,264
why sending her to Mt. Holy?

397
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,867
When the black moon
appears in a few days...

398
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,445
...it'll be the last chance
for Mae to perfect the sword.

399
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,778
They'll try to get hold of Vee

400
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:01,614
and complete the holy sword.

401
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:11,298
So Mt. Holy is using her
as the sacrifice.

402
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:16,467
It's the wisdom of Mt. Holy
to protect our tribe.

403
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,697
Can't we save her?

404
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,241
Does Vee have to die

405
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:25,971
for the tribe?

406
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,512
We have to live up to Mt. Holy?

407
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,623
What are you talking about?

408
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,395
Leave.
The time has come.

409
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,696
- Out of the way!
- Be reasonable.

410
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,396
I won't let you stop me.

411
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,624
It's for the tribe!

412
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,758
How can you do this?

413
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,502
As the patriarch,
I have to protect the tribe.

414
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,704
For the safety of the tribe,

415
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:33,740
I'm willing to die.

416
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,437
I bet you wouldn't do this
if you were in my place.

417
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,011
You made a big mistake,
refusing the position.

418
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,430
Why didn't you tell me?

419
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,011
We could've run away.

420
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,739
Sorry

421
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,388
Don't go.
Don't!

422
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,694
I'm begging you.
Don't go.

423
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,735
Lock him up.
I'll punish him later.

424
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:55,082
Open it!
Let me out!

425
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:19,409
Let me out!
Let me out!

426
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,656
What did you just say?

427
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:37,461
We're not going to Mt. Holy.
I'm taking Vee.

428
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,428
I've made up my mind.
Go back.

429
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,734
I'll ask you who are the patriarch.

430
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,805
If you let Vee live,
our tribe will perish.

431
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,372
Don't you know that?

432
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,082
I don't care about the tribe.

433
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,446
I'm no longer the patriarch.

434
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,582
I changed my mind.

435
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,615
Don't try to stop me.
I won't let you!

436
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,561
You've betrayed the tribe...

437
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:15,599
...and deserted your friends
including me and Dahn.

438
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,634
You'll be sorry.

439
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,678
Change your mind, man.

440
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,552
It's not too late.
Come with us.

441
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,018
Sorry.

442
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,283
We're friends!
Quit it!

443
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,198
- Give it up.
- I won't regret it. Go ahead!

444
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,270
Why?

445
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,576
- Don't do it!
- Out of the way!

446
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,310
It's the only and last thing

447
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,677
that I can do for the tribe.

448
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,755
I'm the only one

449
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,452
who can do this!

450
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:43,525
I'm coming

451
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:45,759
And you're ruining it!

452
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,419
If you care about me,
don't do this.

453
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:59,069
Nothing ever happened.
Consider it as a dream.

454
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:08,509
To Mt. Holy...
Take me there.

455
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:20,787
Will you?
Come with me.

456
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,107
Go!

457
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,605
You've betrayed the tribe
and killed your friends.

458
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,506
Wasn't it for Vee?

459
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,849
Get her out of here.
Save her!

460
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,393
You deserted me
and that's painful enough.

461
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,198
I can't hold them back long

462
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,799
with only 6 arrows.

463
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,330
Consider it as a farewell gift!

464
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:19,172
Nothing to be done now.

465
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:23,680
Mt. Holy will bring a disaster.

466
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,449
Juk knows it very well...

467
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,856
...that the holy sword of Mae

468
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,292
is the only thing to save Vee.

469
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:40,961
He'll go to Mae for it.

470
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,748
You've got only 3 days.

471
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,861
If you fail to take Vee
to the Mt. Holy...

472
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:11,423
...the sword will be perfected

473
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,090
and used to harm Mt. Holy.

474
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,103
If that's the case,

475
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,205
it'll be the end of our tribe.

476
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,978
The density of our tribe is
in your hands.

477
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,314
Find Vee and go to Mt. Holy.

478
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:34,183
Any other ways to save Vee?

479
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,986
The curse of Mt. Holy is
already hitting her.

480
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,222
She'll eventually bleed to death.

481
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,489
The fate of the tribe should
come before her life.

482
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,101
Dahn!

483
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:54,674
I know how painful that is.

484
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,135
But you'll meet her again

485
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:03,414
for the pain you're in.

486
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:08,549
That's the nature's way.

487
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:13,857
I put dews from Mt. Holy on it.
Good luck.

488
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,804
We've got only 2 days.

489
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:05,010
I'm worried Mae might
find Vee before us.

490
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,110
What are you thinking about?

491
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:13,478
Would I do the same
if I were Juk?

492
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,918
Then he would be after you.

493
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:23,563
- You hate him?
- I did.

494
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:29,865
Not any more, though.
I forgot about him.

495
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,971
Sorry it didn't work out.

496
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,540
Stop taking about him.
Think only about the tribe.

497
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,039
That's what counts.

498
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,916
If not, you can go back.
I'll let you go.

499
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:52,755
I've chosen this way,
and it was me who Juk go.

500
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:59,324
And I failed to protect Vee.

501
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,795
It's still warm.

502
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:31,923
- Don't come closer!
- Don't move!

503
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,291
- Take me to Mt. Holy.
- You'll die if you go.

504
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:39,764
That's the fate that
Mt. Holy has given me.

505
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:43,359
It's my fate to protect you.
You won't die!

506
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,665
Don't be silly.

507
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,604
Soon after I'll get the holy sword.

508
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,233
Then, Mt. Holy can't kill you!

509
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,343
I can save you!

510
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:54,505
If you save my life with it,
what about others?

511
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,512
They're sacrificing you
for their own lives!

512
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,243
They are deserved to die!

513
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:07,554
That's where Dahn is.
If I live, he dies.

514
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,757
The day you showed up,

515
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,868
you occupied my mind.

516
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,430
But I had to give up on you
for Dahn.

517
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,904
Why? He's my friend.

518
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,975
Returning from Mt. Sunghwa,

519
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,138
I thought I could have you.

520
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,516
But, unfortunately,
Dahn came back alive.

521
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:35,782
I tried to forget about you,

522
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,956
but I couldn't.

523
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,423
The more I tried, to forget you,

524
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:44,765
The more I wanted you.

525
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:48,592
I won't do that any more.

526
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:54,008
I will save you. And it will be me,
not Dahn, by your side!

527
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:07,547
Let me go.
Let me go.

528
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,627
Wait...
Wait!

529
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:24,732
Stop looking for Vee.
Mae has nothing to do with her.

530
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,103
You're desperate, aren't you?

531
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:29,905
If you want to beg,

532
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,545
do it right.

533
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,812
I guess the hunting won't be
as boring

534
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,283
I'll let you live this time.

535
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:43,847
If you get in the way again,
you will be sorry.

536
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:50,761
Let them live.
We can use them as bait.

537
01:22:55,937 --> 01:23:00,806
Vee is nearby.
We'll find her soon.

538
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:37,435
When we first met,
we became good friends.

539
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:44,980
You were brave, warm-hearted,

540
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,246
and loved the tribe.

541
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:52,825
Let me remember you
as the man I know.

542
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:58,828
That's best for all of us.

543
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,661
You can't satisfy everybody.

544
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,135
It's dog-eat-dog out there.

545
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,334
Nothing's more important

546
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:11,272
than my love for you.

547
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:20,946
Even if you save my life,
I will never forgive you.

548
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:40,565
Send her.

549
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,677
No, not so fast.

550
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:48,375
- You've got more to give me than Vee?
- Why don't we become friends?

551
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,713
- What do you want?
- Vee!

552
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,455
I don't care what you do
with the holy sword.

553
01:24:56,224 --> 01:25:00,354
Cause Vee will resurrect
after you get what you want.

554
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,859
So?

555
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:06,660
Promise me you'll let her go.
Then, I'll help you.

556
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,065
You know what my wish is?

557
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:12,762
It's killing every single soul
from the Hwasan tribe.

558
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,602
And you're one of them.

559
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,745
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to run?

560
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:24,909
- Not with your head.
- Is that right? Here's your chance.

561
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:48,495
My baby...

562
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,474
You have grown up
beyond recognition.

563
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,679
You look just like your dad.

564
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Do you know who I am?

565
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,205
No.

566
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:32,037
You're not the person I missed,

567
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,344
and I won't ask who you are.

568
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,616
All I want to know is

569
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,152
why you're doing this to me.

570
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,493
You have no idea

571
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:51,392
what curse Mt. Holy put on us.

572
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:56,429
For hundreds years..

573
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,835
In the land of hell
where no weeds grew...

574
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:01,669
...our ancestors had to eat

575
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,300
their own flesh to survive.

576
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,505
We worked very hard with our bare hands.

577
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:10,047
They couldn't die
with their bodies festering...

578
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,652
...and had to endure the pain
of bugs eating them alive.

579
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:16,084
It was all due to the curse
Mt. Holy put on us!

580
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:24,890
But, with the holy sword,
we can destroy them.

581
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,761
We're giving them back

582
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,994
the pain they gave us.

583
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,803
My baby...

584
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:45,953
You can sooth the pain
that our ancestors had.

585
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:51,182
That's your fate.
Consider it as an honor.

586
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,560
Don't be scared.

587
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,287
You'll sleep for a short time.

588
01:28:57,432 --> 01:29:00,367
Then, you'll be reborn

589
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:04,029
as a daughter of Mae tribe.

590
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:09,534
Go!

591
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:15,245
It's no use.
She can't get away!

592
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:56,547
Hadn't you saved me then,

593
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:00,209
Had I died then...

594
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:05,189
...this wouldn't be happening.

595
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:11,895
l have to die.

596
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:18,367
I'm too much burden on you.

597
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:25,411
If there's anything left
that I can do for you...

598
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:27,839
...I'll be by your side.

599
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:40,257
- Can we meet again?
- Sure. I promise.

600
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:18,531
I'm sorry.
I can't take you with us.

601
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:10,981
Let's go back to the altar.
He wants the holy sword.

602
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,280
He will come to the altar
to save Vee.

603
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:19,556
We have to get back
before him.

604
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,144
Stopping the holy sword is

605
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:42,214
the only way to expiate my sin.

606
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:45,952
So I stuck around Vee

607
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,778
and got to know you.

608
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,895
It was you who saved me
in Mt. Sunghwa.

609
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,988
You protected Vee.

610
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:02,598
The moonlight is dimmer.

611
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:07,398
The black moon will be up soon.
We've got to hurry.

612
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:51,784
Wake up! Wake up!

613
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:57,318
If the black moon is ours,
it will bring Vee here.

614
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:58,551
We'll see

615
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:14,865
Can you hear it?
It's calling the holy sword.

616
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:19,173
The curse of Mt. Holy can
no longer torture you.

617
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:25,548
Hang in there.
Just a little longer.

618
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:40,893
The girl of a fate, the spirit of Vee...

619
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:45,097
...will bring the holy sword to us!

620
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:49,399
The spirit of Vee!
Destiny!

621
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,650
Mt. Holy...
You have to go there.

622
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:10,260
Dahn is waiting for you.
Be strong. You can do this.

623
01:36:46,937 --> 01:36:51,033
Where's Vee?
Where is she?

624
01:36:54,144 --> 01:36:57,204
With the black moon up,
the holy sword will appear.

625
01:36:59,683 --> 01:37:02,880
It will be useless, though,
if you don't have Vee.

626
01:37:04,588 --> 01:37:11,892
You and your tribe will die.
How sad!

627
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:15,396
It's only the holy sword
that can save her.

628
01:37:15,532 --> 01:37:17,124
I'm taking it with me.

629
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,291
You think I'll let you have it?

630
01:37:19,503 --> 01:37:20,697
You'll have to.

631
01:37:22,339 --> 01:37:25,331
Either to save her or your tribe,

632
01:37:25,475 --> 01:37:28,808
one of us has to kill Mt. Holy.

633
01:37:29,379 --> 01:37:38,583
- And I have Vee.
- Say it! Where is she?

634
01:37:38,822 --> 01:37:41,552
Right here.
Inside me!

635
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:43,556
Don't mess up with me.

636
01:37:43,727 --> 01:37:47,595
I'll tear you apart
and find Vee!

637
01:37:47,798 --> 01:37:51,598
Go ahead.
Thrust it in me!

638
01:37:54,004 --> 01:37:58,004
Why?
Are you afraid?

639
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You want to see the holy sword?

640
01:38:14,024 --> 01:38:17,024
I'll tear your heart out.

641
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
At last, you're back.

642
01:38:44,988 --> 01:38:48,617
Bring it!
Bring it to me!

643
01:38:48,792 --> 01:38:53,593
Or you'll kill her?
Can you do that?

644
01:38:54,231 --> 01:38:55,255
I don't think so.

645
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,267
But I can
cause that's my fate.

646
01:39:01,304 --> 01:39:02,293
Kill him!

647
01:43:29,072 --> 01:43:32,337
It's over.

648
01:43:33,877 --> 01:43:35,936
Should I kill you

649
01:43:36,212 --> 01:43:40,239
with this holy sword?

650
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:44,251
Or should I let you have her?

651
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:50,989
You listen to me.
I'll let you have this sword.

652
01:43:56,366 --> 01:44:00,132
- On one condition!
- Say it.

653
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:04,104
You become one of us, Mae.

654
01:44:05,442 --> 01:44:07,933
Anyway, destroying the Mt. Holy...

655
01:44:08,278 --> 01:44:10,610
...is one thing we have in common.

656
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:14,416
I'll let you live to take revenge for our tribe...

657
01:44:14,751 --> 01:44:18,585
...and you can have Vee.
Can you do it?

658
01:44:21,157 --> 01:44:23,921
With the black moon gone,

659
01:44:24,227 --> 01:44:26,787
the holy spirits will kill me...

660
01:44:27,864 --> 01:44:30,697
...but you'll be protected

661
01:44:34,103 --> 01:44:38,005
...cause you'll be the last
descendant of our tribe, Mae.

662
01:44:55,095 --> 01:45:02,861
As the descendants,
if we wreck vengeance...

663
01:45:03,666 --> 01:45:05,600
...we won't be breathe as alive

664
01:45:06,569 --> 01:45:08,935
and close our eyes as dead.

665
01:45:09,539 --> 01:45:13,908
Forever, Mae!

666
01:46:09,532 --> 01:46:12,000
You'll come back to me.

667
01:46:20,677 --> 01:46:21,974
Stop it!

668
01:46:22,178 --> 01:46:23,736
You think you can stop me?

669
01:46:23,913 --> 01:46:25,073
Let Vee rest in peace!

670
01:46:25,281 --> 01:46:26,248
That's our only help for her!

671
01:46:26,449 --> 01:46:27,609
How dare you say that,

672
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:31,115
you two-faced prick!

673
01:46:31,387 --> 01:46:33,548
When you let her go...

674
01:46:33,756 --> 01:46:36,190
...when you tried to get her
for the tribe...

675
01:46:36,392 --> 01:46:38,383
Vee was with me!

676
01:46:38,728 --> 01:46:43,028
Everybody wanted her dead,
but I protected her for my life!

677
01:46:43,232 --> 01:46:46,133
That's how we're different!

678
01:46:46,269 --> 01:46:49,466
Nonsense!
Vee didn't want any of this!

679
01:46:49,672 --> 01:46:51,640
You cheated yourself

680
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:54,309
and left yourself dream!

681
01:46:54,644 --> 01:47:00,844
No way. Dream isn't painful.
It's over when you wake up.

682
01:47:02,485 --> 01:47:05,477
But there's something that

683
01:47:05,822 --> 01:47:10,691
you can't get yourself out.

684
01:47:11,995 --> 01:47:14,520
That's love!

685
01:47:15,498 --> 01:47:17,796
I can't let that love die.

686
01:47:18,134 --> 01:47:21,126
How can you love a ghost?

687
01:47:21,437 --> 01:47:25,703
- That's all I want!
- I don't want to let her go, either,

688
01:47:26,643 --> 01:47:29,703
but that's her fate!

689
01:47:29,946 --> 01:47:34,076
Her fate my butt!
I won't let her go!

690
01:47:34,317 --> 01:47:37,309
Kill me and let Vee go,

691
01:47:37,587 --> 01:47:40,750
or die to let her live!

692
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:43,684
I'll be with her!

693
01:47:43,893 --> 01:47:47,761
No matter where she is,
I'll be with her!

694
01:47:48,531 --> 01:47:50,590
That's how we're different.

695
01:48:12,021 --> 01:48:13,921
And you didn't love her.

696
01:48:14,123 --> 01:48:15,283
You were obsessed with her.

697
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:30,703
It wasn't an obsession!

698
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:40,513
Vee wanted you, but it was me
who loved her! lt was me!

699
01:48:58,668 --> 01:49:03,799
Stop right there.

700
01:49:03,973 --> 01:49:09,104
I'm begging you.
Don't let me kill you. Please...

701
01:49:24,193 --> 01:49:31,895
There's something
I always wanted to say to you.

702
01:49:37,707 --> 01:49:43,236
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

703
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:18,900
I wanted to see you
once for all. Goodbye.

704
01:51:19,542 --> 01:51:26,209
- Let me go with you.
- No.l don't want you to.

705
01:51:26,449 --> 01:51:30,579
I promised you
that l'd always be by you.

706
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,180
Remember?

707
01:51:33,656 --> 01:51:37,456
You said you'd help me
live a life that I choose.

708
01:51:39,295 --> 01:51:40,785
Please let me.

709
01:51:51,908 --> 01:51:57,312
Play it when you feel down.

710
01:51:59,849 --> 01:52:03,751
It'll cheer you up.

711
01:52:06,255 --> 01:52:08,450
It worked for me.

712
01:54:31,333 --> 01:54:35,963
When the black moon rises
after a 3-day-long sun...

713
01:54:37,273 --> 01:54:42,905
...a dragon with its soul lost
will look for a hidden tree...

714
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:48,674
The tree greeting the dragon,
a golden snow will fall.

715
01:54:49,718 --> 01:54:53,347
And the soul trapped in the tree...

716
01:54:53,856 --> 01:54:57,292
...will meet the dragon again
with the blessings of God.

717
01:54:57,693 --> 01:55:00,628
Then, nothing on earth can
separate them again.
