1
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,632
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,671
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,756
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,440
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,358
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

6
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,198
<i>The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

7
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,117
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,231
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,476
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,589
Steady.

11
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,077
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,312
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,195
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,629
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,389
Solo.

16
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,159
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,953
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,753
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,236
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,191
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,390
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,272
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,188
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,673
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,357
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,269
That's right.

28
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,315
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,349
Han.

30
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,032
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,879
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,150
Han, we need you.

33
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,271
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,755
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,235
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

36
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,716
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,150
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,748
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,314
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,998
Come on.

41
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,151
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,111
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,356
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,948
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,116
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,714
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,116
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,992
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,429
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,709
Oh, switch off!

51
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,798
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,956
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,036
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,549
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,750
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,633
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,910
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,713
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,068
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,589
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I-

61
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,392
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,316
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,874
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,275
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,595
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,631
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,672
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,475
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,591
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,553
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,636
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,595
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,676
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,677
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,756
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,871
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,674
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,439
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,030
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,999
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no-

83
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,919
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,953
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,311
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,476
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,830
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,429
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,431
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,109
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,631
from time to time.

92
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,512
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,874
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,673
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,752
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,794
Luke.

97
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,479
Ben?

98
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,114
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,912
Dagobah system?

100
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,350
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,075
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,031
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,995
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,315
Hang on, kid.

105
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,516
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,232
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,391
Yoda.

108
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,798
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,876
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,551
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,432
on the outside.

112
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,309
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,271
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,870
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,797
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,480
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,319
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,110
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

119
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,992
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,078
<i>Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

121
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,912
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,508
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,076
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,794
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,276
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,153
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,909
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,314
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,398
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,317
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,954
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,911
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,234
That's a good story.

134
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,114
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,391
<i>I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.</i>

136
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,836
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,918
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,190
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

139
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,389
My-

140
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,796
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,876
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,917
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

143
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,391
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,713
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

146
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,918
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

147
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,917
Take it easy.

148
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,996
Excuse us, please.

149
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,156
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,033
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,310
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,069
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,714
There's something
very weak coming through.

154
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,832
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,952
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,676
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,678
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

158
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,356
<i>- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?</i>

159
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,436
<i>Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

160
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,870
<i>- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.</i>

161
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,753
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

162
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,549
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,673
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,553
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,638
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,593
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,870
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead-

169
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,912
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

170
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,310
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,875
That's it.
The rebels are there.

172
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,270
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,039
- It could be smugglers-
- That is the system.

174
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,435
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,438
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

176
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,869
General Veers,
prepare your men.

177
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,274
Admiral.

178
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,796
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,672
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,756
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,472
Right, sir.

182
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,516
All right. That's it.

183
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,993
Try it.

184
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,314
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,871
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

186
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,470
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,556
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,832
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,998
Okay, okay.

190
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,799
Hi, kid.

191
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,878
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,353
Wait a second.

193
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,709
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,750
Be careful.

195
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,632
You too.

196
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,317
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,590
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

198
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,553
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

199
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,638
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,716
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,237
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,351
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

203
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,948
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,435
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,915
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

206
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,998
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,270
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,391
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,956
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,638
Yes, my lord.

211
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,389
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

212
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,398
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to-</i>

213
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,399
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,795
<i>- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?</i>

215
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,798
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,753
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,917
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

218
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,792
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

219
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,278
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,036
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,118
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,629
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,751
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,836
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

226
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,952
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,071
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

228
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,156
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

229
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,111
Understood?

230
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,753
Good luck.

231
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,235
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

232
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,638
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,512
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,190
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

235
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,311
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,236
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,235
Fire.

238
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,792
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

239
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,559
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

240
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,597
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,517
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

242
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,438
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,516
I know what you mean.

244
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,271
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,755
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

246
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,155
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

247
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,271
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

248
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,436
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

249
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,959
Steady, Dak.

250
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,832
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

251
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,038
I'm coming in.

252
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,389
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,236
That armour's too strong for blasters.

254
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,670
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,870
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

256
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,354
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,153
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,191
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,117
Just hang on.

260
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,913
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,030
Dak?

262
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,998
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,078
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,995
Rogue Three.

265
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,473
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,433
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.</i>

267
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,198
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

268
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,550
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,591
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,759
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,709
Activate harpoon.

272
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,033
Good shot,Janson.

273
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,035
One more pass.

274
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,550
Cable out.
Let her go!

275
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,829
Detach cable.

276
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,629
Cable detached.

277
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,758
Come on!

278
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,748
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,236
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,555
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

281
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,238
We have no choice.

282
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,720
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,790
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,230
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,036
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,033
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,110
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

288
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,595
Prepare to target
the main generator.

289
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,430
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,312
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

291
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,638
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

292
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,758
Set for position three.

293
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,108
Steady.

294
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,629
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

295
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,474
Hobbie!

296
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,999
I've been hit!

297
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,558
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,956
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,038
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,118
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,676
<i>Imperial troops
have entered the base.</i>

303
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,358
<i>Imperial troops have entered-</i>

304
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,277
Come on. That's it.

305
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,630
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,436
And get to your transports.

307
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,629
Wait for me.

308
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,159
Begin retreat!

309
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,952
Fall back!

310
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,477
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,071
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,828
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,791
<i>I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.</i>

314
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,276
Where are you going?
Come back!

315
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,271
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,152
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,718
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,512
Wait! Wait!

319
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,757
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,996
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Sir, might I suggest that you-

322
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,512
It can wait.

323
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,989
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,076
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

325
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,598
Come on! Come on!

326
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,553
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,151
See?

328
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,475
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,309
Punch it!

330
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,635
R2.

331
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,196
Get her ready for take-off.

332
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,470
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,155
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

334
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,236
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,553
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,239
Yes, R2.

337
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,873
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,195
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,390
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

340
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,193
- Sir, might I suggest-
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,876
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,796
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.

343
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,837
Take evasive action!

344
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,593
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

345
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,198
They're getting closer.

346
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,356
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

347
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,918
Watch what?

348
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,795
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

349
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,275
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

350
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,358
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

351
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,674
Horizontal boosters!

352
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,711
Alluvial dampers.

353
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,000
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

354
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,920
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

355
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,669
Chewie!

356
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,156
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

357
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,633
Han, get up here.

358
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,673
Come on, Chewie!

359
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,435
Asteroids.

360
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,708
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

361
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,276
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

362
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,072
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

363
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,991
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

364
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,157
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

365
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,397
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

366
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,232
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

367
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,918
I take it back.

368
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,998
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

369
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,838
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

370
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,712
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

371
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,592
- Closer?
- Closer?

372
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,397
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

373
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,397
There. That looks pretty good.

374
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,317
What looks pretty good?

375
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,715
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

376
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,559
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

377
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,236
I hope you know
what you're doing.

378
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,713
Yeah. Me too.

379
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,310
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

380
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,796
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

381
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,075
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

382
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,156
Massive life form readings though.

383
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,156
There's something alive down there.

384
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,513
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

385
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,558
I know! I know!

386
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,240
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

387
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,272
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

388
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,714
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

389
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,189
R2?

390
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,069
Where are you?

391
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,828
R2!

392
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,919
You be more careful.

393
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,513
R2, that way.

394
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,714
R2!

395
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,673
Oh, no.

396
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,836
Are you all right?
Come on.

397
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,196
You were lucky
to get out of there.

398
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,118
Anything broken?

399
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,718
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

400
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,910
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

401
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,600
R2, what are we doing here?

402
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,073
It's like...

403
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,076
something out of a dream or-

404
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,956
I don't know.

405
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,036
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

406
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,399
Yes, Admiral?

407
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,511
<i>Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

408
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,598
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk-

409
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,393
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

410
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,910
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

411
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,758
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

412
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,668
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

413
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,756
<i>No. I need you
to talk to the Falcon...</i>

414
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,030
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

415
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,916
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

416
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,837
Not entirely stable?

417
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,916
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

418
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,476
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

419
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,989
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

420
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,350
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

421
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,593
Let go.

422
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,555
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

423
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,229
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

424
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,112
Sorry, sweetheart.

425
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,800
I haven't got time
for anything else.

426
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,116
Ready for some power?
Okay.

427
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,313
Let's see now.

428
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,635
Put that in there.
There you go.

429
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,279
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

430
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,595
if he even exists.

431
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,678
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

432
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,832
This place gives me the creeps.

433
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,953
Still...

434
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,111
there's something familiar
about this place.

435
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,998
I don't know.

436
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,076
- I feel like-
- Feel like what?

437
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,678
Like we're being watched.

438
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,678
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

439
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,440
I am wondering,
why are you here?

440
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,958
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

441
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,594
Found someone you have,
I would say.

442
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,239
Right.

443
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,435
Help you I can. Yes.

444
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,429
I don't think so.

445
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,594
I'm looking for a great warrior.

446
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,278
Great warrior.

447
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,390
Wars not make one great.

448
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,078
Put that down.

449
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,031
Hey! That's my dinner.

450
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,834
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

451
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,076
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

452
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,634
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

453
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,751
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

454
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,472
Get out of there.

455
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,795
Hey, you could have broken this.

456
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,316
Don't do that.

457
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,996
You're making a mess.

458
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,396
Hey, give me that.

459
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,954
Mine, or I will help you not.

460
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,991
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

461
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,759
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

462
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,916
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

463
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,993
R2, let him have it.

464
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,194
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

465
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,191
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

466
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,312
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

467
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,913
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

468
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,235
Jedi master. Yoda.

469
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,828
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

470
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,516
Take you to him I will.

471
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,712
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

472
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,400
Come.
Good food. Come.

473
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,358
Come, come.

474
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,515
R2...

475
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,510
stay and watch after the camp.

476
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,476
Where is R2 when I need him?

477
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,160
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

478
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,111
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

479
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,596
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

480
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,075
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

481
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,270
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

482
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,596
Here. And, Chewie...

483
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,760
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

484
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,800
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

485
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,275
Would you please
stop calling me that?

486
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,277
Sure, Leia.

487
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,676
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

488
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,870
You could be a little nicer though.

489
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,560
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

490
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,990
Occasionally, maybe...

491
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,475
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

492
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,953
Scoundrel?

493
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,398
I like the sound of that.

494
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,113
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

495
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,310
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

496
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,510
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

497
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,676
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

498
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,591
I'm not trembling.

499
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,355
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

500
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,789
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

501
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,876
I happen to like nice men.

502
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,560
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

503
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,315
Sir, sir!

504
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,193
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

505
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,509
Thank you.

506
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,473
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

507
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,312
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

508
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,238
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.</i>

509
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,511
No, Captain, they're alive.

510
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,792
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

511
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,311
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

512
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,590
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

513
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,790
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

514
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,070
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

515
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,758
Yes, my lord.

516
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,114
What is thy bidding, my master?

517
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,239
<i>There is a great disturbance
in the Force.</i>

518
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,310
I have felt it.

519
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,874
<i>We have a new enemy-</i>

520
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,834
<i>the young rebel who destroyed
the Death Star.</i>

521
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,952
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

522
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,278
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

523
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,550
How is that possible?

524
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,911
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

525
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,112
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

526
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,595
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

527
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,711
He's just a boy.

528
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,195
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

529
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,756
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

530
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,790
<i>The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.</i>

531
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,990
If he could be turned...

532
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,839
he would become a powerful ally.

533
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,478
<i>Yes.</i>

534
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,393
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

535
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,670
<i>Can it be done?</i>

536
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,588
He will join us or die, master.

537
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,314
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

538
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,069
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

539
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,237
Eat. Eat.

540
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,354
Hot.

541
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,677
Good food. Good.

542
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,598
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

543
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,870
Not far. Yoda not far.

544
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,639
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

545
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,520
Root leaf. I cook.

546
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,635
Why wish you become Jedi?

547
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,240
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

548
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,318
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

549
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,432
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

550
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,919
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

551
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,396
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

552
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,955
I cannot teach him.

553
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,036
The boy has no patience.

554
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,310
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

555
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,235
Much anger in him...

556
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,112
like his father.

557
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,789
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

558
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,030
No.

559
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,032
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

560
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,792
I am ready.

561
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,718
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm-

562
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,515
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

563
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,428
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

564
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,155
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

565
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,669
AJedi must have
the deepest commitment...

566
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,552
the most serious mind.

567
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,438
This one a long time have I watched.

568
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
All his life
has he looked away...

569
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,152
to the future,
to the horizon.

570
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,670
Never his mind on where he was...

571
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,916
what he was doing.

572
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,515
Adventure.

573
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,398
Excitement.

574
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,670
AJedi craves not these things.

575
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,318
You are reckless.

576
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,273
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

577
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,356
He is too old.

578
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,350
Yes, too old to begin the training.

579
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,311
But I've learned so much.

580
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,957
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

581
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,032
I'm not afraid.

582
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,316
You will be.

583
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,396
You will be.

584
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,116
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion-
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

585
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,151
There's something out there.

586
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,157
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

587
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,233
There it is. Listen!

588
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,157
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,714
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

590
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,876
Then I'm going with you.

591
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,038
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

592
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,115
Oh, no.

593
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,556
This ground sure feels strange.

594
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,076
It doesn't feel like rock.

595
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,868
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

596
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,549
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

597
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,829
Yeah.

598
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,716
Watch out!

599
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,155
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,635
Yeah, that's what I thought- mynock.

601
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,752
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

602
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,677
chewing on the power cables.

603
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,313
Mynocks?

604
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,556
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

605
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,715
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

606
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,472
Wait a minute.

607
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,596
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

608
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,676
No time to discuss this
in committee!

609
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,476
I am not a committee!

610
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,439
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

611
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,915
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

612
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,794
- Look!
- I see it.

613
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,195
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

614
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,117
- This is no cave.
- What?

615
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,599
Yes, run.

616
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,199
Yes.

617
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,517
AJedi's strength
flows from the Force.

618
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,916
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression-

619
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,110
The dark side
of the Force are they.

620
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,676
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

621
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,916
If once you start down
the dark path...

622
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,235
<i>forever will it dominate
your destiny.</i>

623
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,148
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

624
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,032
Vader.

625
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,118
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

626
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,677
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

627
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,511
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

628
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,790
You will know...

629
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,070
when you are calm,
at peace...

630
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,473
passive.

631
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,513
AJedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

632
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,392
never for attack.

633
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,990
- But tell me why I can't-
- No. There is no why.

634
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,759
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

635
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,757
Clear your mind of questions.

636
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,797
There's something not right here.

637
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,873
I feel cold.

638
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,199
- Death.
- That place...

639
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,636
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

640
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,591
A domain of evil it is.

641
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,831
In you must go.

642
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,149
What's in there?

643
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,995
Only what you take with you.

644
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,789
Your weapons...

645
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,039
<i>you will not need them.</i>

646
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,075
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

647
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,839
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

648
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,471
<i>Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

649
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,079
Right.

650
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,752
<i>There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.</i>

651
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,792
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

652
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,956
but I want them alive.

653
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,389
No disintegrations.

654
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,272
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

655
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,311
My lord, we have them.

656
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,558
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

657
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,068
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

658
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,316
One, two...

659
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,509
three!

660
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,030
It's not fair.

661
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,233
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

662
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,158
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

663
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,671
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

664
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,950
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

665
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,718
Turn her around.

666
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,354
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

667
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,391
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

668
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,351
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer-

669
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,311
Shut up!

670
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,437
They're moving to attack position.

671
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,595
Shields up.

672
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,388
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

673
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,795
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

674
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,390
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

675
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,195
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

676
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,036
Get a shuttle ready.

677
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,914
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

678
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,998
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

679
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,670
Use the Force.

680
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,755
Yes.

681
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,832
Now, the stone.

682
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,398
Feel it.

683
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,358
Concentrate!

684
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,352
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

685
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,118
So certain are you.

686
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,112
Always with you
it cannot be done.

687
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,197
Hear you nothing that I say?

688
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,311
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

689
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,192
This is totally different.

690
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,470
No. No different.

691
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,591
Only different in your mind.

692
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,792
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

693
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,078
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

694
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,273
Do...

695
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,913
or do not.

696
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,632
There is no try.

697
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,078
I can't. It's too big.

698
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,156
Size matters not.

699
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,158
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

700
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,553
And well you should not...

701
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,194
for my ally is the Force.

702
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,595
And a powerful ally it is.

703
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,915
Life creates it...

704
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,996
makes it grow.

705
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,513
Its energy surrounds us...

706
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,238
and binds us.

707
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,432
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

708
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,597
You must feel
the Force around you.

709
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,908
Here, between you, me...

710
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,910
the tree, the rock-

711
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,031
everywhere.

712
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,513
Yes...

713
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,269
even between
the land and the ship.

714
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,150
You want the impossible.

715
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,236
I don't believe it.

716
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,720
That is why you fail.

717
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,317
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

718
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,392
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

719
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,397
<i>If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...</i>

720
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,351
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

721
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,232
Alert all commands.

722
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,433
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

723
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,791
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

724
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,631
Admiral.

725
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,871
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

726
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,317
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

727
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,398
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

728
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,476
The fleet's beginning to break up.

729
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,353
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

730
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,511
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

731
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,950
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

732
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,071
The Empire may be
gracious enough-

733
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,509
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

734
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,471
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

735
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,750
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

736
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,758
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

737
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,233
Then what?

738
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,477
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

739
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,919
Any ideas?

740
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,315
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

741
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,908
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

742
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,759
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

743
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,633
- Lando.
- Lando system?

744
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,196
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

745
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,470
Card player, gambler.

746
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,068
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

747
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,760
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

748
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,112
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

749
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,996
Lando conned somebody out of it.

750
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,714
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

751
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,640
- Can you trust him?
- No.

752
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,513
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

753
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,074
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

754
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,479
You do have your moments.

755
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,039
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

756
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,231
Concentrate.

757
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,432
Feel the Force flow.

758
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,118
Yes.

759
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,072
Good.

760
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,519
Calm.

761
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,914
Yes.

762
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,274
Through the Force,
things you will see.

763
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,710
Other places.
The future. The past.

764
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,149
Old friends long gone.

765
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,639
Control, control.

766
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,876
You must learn control.

767
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,598
I saw a city in the clouds.

768
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,670
Friends you have there.

769
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,190
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

770
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,315
Future?

771
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,313
Will they die?

772
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,431
Difficult to see.

773
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,915
Always in motion is the future.

774
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,673
I've gotta go to them.

775
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,512
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

776
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,393
If you leave now,
help them you could...

777
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,830
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

778
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,993
No, I don't have a landing permit.

779
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,590
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

780
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,756
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

781
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,757
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

782
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,474
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

783
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,953
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

784
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,670
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.</i>

785
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,119
Thank you.

786
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,753
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

787
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,472
Who's worried?

788
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,673
No one to meet us.

789
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,270
I don't like this.

790
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,119
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

791
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,834
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

792
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,518
Trust me.

793
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,036
See? My friend.

794
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,236
Keep your eyes open.

795
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,398
Hey.

796
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,433
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

797
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,599
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

798
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,990
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

799
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,032
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

800
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,118
Yes. Very friendly.

801
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,798
What are you doing here?

802
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,831
<i>Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.</i>

803
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,474
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

804
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,990
<i>Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.</i>

805
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,159
How you doin', Chewbacca?

806
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,640
Still hanging around with this loser?

807
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,790
Hello.
What have we here?

808
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,630
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

809
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,558
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

810
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,238
Welcome, Leia.

811
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,679
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

812
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,270
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

813
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,073
My facilities are at your-
Well, really!

814
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,475
<i>- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.</i>

815
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,556
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

816
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,636
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

817
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,194
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

818
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,835
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

819
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,635
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

820
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,718
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

821
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,910
I've had labour difficulties.

822
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,157
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

823
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,953
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

824
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,877
Who'd have thought that, huh?

825
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,798
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

826
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,069
Yeah.

827
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,236
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

828
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,640
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

829
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,716
Nice to see a familiar face.

830
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,398
How rude!

831
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,876
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

832
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,513
I wonder if- Hello?

833
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,159
How interesting.

834
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,238
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

835
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,316
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

836
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,508
Luke, you must complete the training.

837
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,233
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

838
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,396
You must not go.

839
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,478
<i>- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.</i>

840
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,920
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

841
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,679
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

842
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,870
But you cannot control it.

843
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,310
This is a dangerous time for you...

844
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,318
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

845
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,512
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

846
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,713
The cave.

847
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,831
Remember your failure at the cave.

848
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,791
But I've learned
so much since then.

849
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,480
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

850
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,477
You have my word.

851
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,273
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

852
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,994
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

853
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,960
That's why I have to go.

854
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,232
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

855
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,793
You won't.

856
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,076
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

857
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,230
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

858
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,828
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

859
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,951
If you end your training now...

860
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,198
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

861
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,834
<i>you will become an agent of evil.</i>

862
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,870
Patience.

863
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,998
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

864
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,075
yes.

865
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,158
<i>If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.</i>

866
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,191
I cannot interfere.

867
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,349
I understand.

868
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,313
R2, fire up the converters.

869
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,357
Don't give in to hate.

870
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,119
That leads to the dark side.

871
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,878
Strong is Vader.

872
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,389
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

873
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,753
I will.

874
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,235
And I'll return. I promise.

875
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,952
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

876
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,593
Now...

877
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,392
matters are worse.

878
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,476
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

879
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,398
No, there is another.

880
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,391
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

881
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,476
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

882
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,556
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

883
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,796
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

884
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,558
Relax.

885
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,433
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

886
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,915
I don't trust Lando.

887
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,237
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

888
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,920
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

889
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,276
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

890
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,313
What happened?

891
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:29,997
Where?

892
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,991
Found him in a junk pile?

893
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,554
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

894
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,996
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

895
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,272
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

896
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,269
Not really.

897
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,591
You look absolutely beautiful.

898
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,871
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

899
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,399
Thank you.

900
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,318
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

901
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,113
Everyone's invited, of course.

902
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,231
Having trouble with your droid?

903
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,874
No. No problem. Why?

904
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,749
You see, since we're
a small operation...

905
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,997
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

906
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,554
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

907
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,750
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

908
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,836
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

909
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,192
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

910
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,029
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

911
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,311
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

912
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,034
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

913
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,311
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

914
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,313
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

915
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,195
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

916
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,712
I'm sorry.

917
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,354
I'm sorry too.

918
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,919
No, 3PO's with them.

919
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,271
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

920
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,755
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

921
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,757
No, please don't get up.

922
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,591
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

923
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,188
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

924
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,438
Lord Vader.

925
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,835
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

926
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,871
after I have Skywalker.

927
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,797
He's no good to me dead.

928
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,071
He will not be
permanently damaged.

929
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,834
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

930
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,554
They must never again leave this city.

931
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,752
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

932
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,634
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

933
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,235
No.

934
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,750
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

935
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,355
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

936
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,795
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

937
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,794
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

938
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,356
That's much better.

939
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,038
Wait. Wait.

940
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,116
Oh, my!
What have you done?

941
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,719
I'm backwards!

942
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,637
You flea-bitten furball!

943
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,320
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough-

944
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,197
I feel terrible.

945
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,796
Why are they doing this?

946
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,760
They never even asked me
any questions.

947
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,790
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

948
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,878
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

949
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,797
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

950
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,956
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

951
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,389
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

952
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,751
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

953
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,314
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

954
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,192
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

955
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,236
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

956
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,475
My friend.

957
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,509
Stop!

958
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,830
I've done all I can.

959
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,269
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

960
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,628
Yeah.

961
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,512
You're a real hero.

962
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,235
You certainly
have a way with people.

963
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,792
This facility is crude...

964
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,878
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

965
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,150
for his journey to the emperor.

966
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,158
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

967
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,511
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

968
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,516
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

969
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:24,393
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

970
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,478
We will test it on Captain Solo.

971
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,319
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

972
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,000
<i>Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...</i>

973
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,758
so don't do anything foolish.

974
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,236
What's going on, buddy?

975
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,151
You're being put into carbon freeze.

976
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,636
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

977
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,991
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

978
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,915
Chewbacca, stop!

979
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,951
No, Chewie, stop!

980
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,958
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

981
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,957
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

982
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,469
Chewie, this won't help me.

983
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,068
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

984
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,438
The princess.

985
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,232
You have to take care of her.

986
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,311
Do you hear me?

987
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,473
- I love you.
- I know.

988
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,916
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

989
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,356
They've encased him in carbonite.

990
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,277
He should be quite
well-protected...

991
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,231
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

992
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,749
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

993
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,438
Yes, he's alive.

994
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,077
And in perfect hibernation.

995
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,036
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

996
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,518
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

997
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,592
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

998
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,429
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

999
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,317
Calrissian...

1000
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,749
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1001
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,916
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

1002
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,996
I am altering the deal.

1003
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,714
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1004
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,434
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1005
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,915
It's a trap!

1006
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,715
<i>The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.</i>

1007
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,996
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1008
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,038
Well done.

1009
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,433
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1010
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,152
Move.

1011
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,591
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1012
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,392
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1013
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,239
Do you think that
after what you did to Han-

1014
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,351
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1015
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,358
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1016
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,959
I'm just trying to help.

1017
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,594
We don't need any of your help.

1018
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,953
What?

1019
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,471
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1020
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,517
at the east... platform.

1021
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,596
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1022
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,392
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1023
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,880
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1024
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,630
R2, where have you been?

1025
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,557
Wait. Turn around, you woolly-

1026
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,359
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1027
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,309
<i>Well, at least
you're still in one piece.</i>

1028
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,670
Look what's happened to me.

1029
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,628
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1030
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,310
You have learned much, young one.

1031
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,476
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1032
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,558
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1033
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,755
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1034
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,794
All too easy.

1035
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,195
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1036
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,798
Impressive.

1037
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,033
Most impressive.

1038
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:35,115
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1039
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,872
Now, release your anger.

1040
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,468
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1041
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,911
The security code
has been changed.

1042
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,191
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1043
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,758
R2, hurry.

1044
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,115
<i>Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1045
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,117
<i>The Empire has taken control
of the city.</i>

1046
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,959
<i>I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1047
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,758
This way.

1048
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,996
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1049
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,873
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1050
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,398
<i>We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!</i>

1051
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,873
<i>Just open the door,
you stupid lump!</i>

1052
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,429
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1053
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,554
<i>That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless- Ow!</i>

1054
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,719
Go!

1055
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,553
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1056
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,477
Of course I've looked better.

1057
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:41,475
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1058
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,956
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1059
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,678
There is no escape.

1060
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,556
Don't make me destroy you.

1061
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,039
<i>You do not yet realize
your importance.</i>

1062
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,720
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1063
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,592
Join me...

1064
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,995
and I will complete your training.

1065
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:20,395
With our combined strength...

1066
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,318
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1067
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,635
and bring order to the galaxy.

1068
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,149
I'll never join you!

1069
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:32,193
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1070
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,359
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1071
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,833
He told me enough.

1072
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,112
He told me you killed him.

1073
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,831
I am your father.

1074
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,871
That's not true.

1075
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,278
That's impossible!

1076
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,517
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1077
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,959
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1078
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,833
It is your destiny.

1079
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,598
Join me...

1080
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,838
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1081
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,598
Come with me.

1082
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,510
It is the only way.

1083
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,399
Ben.

1084
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,992
Ben, please.

1085
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,313
Hear me.

1086
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,956
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1087
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,310
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1088
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,550
Chewie, just do it.

1089
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,318
All right, all right!

1090
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:41,079
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1091
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,156
Look, someone's up there.

1092
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,715
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1093
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,991
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1094
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,510
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1095
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,436
<i>- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.</i>

1096
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,033
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1097
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,912
I'll be back.

1098
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,759
Stardestroyer.

1099
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,155
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1100
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,236
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1101
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,590
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1102
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,119
Punch it!

1103
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,555
They told me they fixed it.

1104
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:11,477
I trusted them!

1105
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,989
It's not my fault!

1106
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,914
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1107
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,430
<i>Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1108
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,471
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1109
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,070
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1110
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:34,078
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,751
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1112
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,393
We can't?

1113
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,795
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1114
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,713
The city's central computer told you?

1115
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,479
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1116
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,751
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1117
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,675
Father.

1118
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,516
Son, come with me.

1119
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:15,793
Ben.

1120
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,831
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,469
It's Vader.

1122
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:46,516
Luke, it is your destiny.

1123
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,070
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:05,874
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1125
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,839
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1126
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,316
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1127
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,672
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1128
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,119
You did it!

1129
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,358
<i>- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.</i>

1130
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,148
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1131
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,794
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1132
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,196
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1133
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:35,436
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1134
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:37,198
Take care, you two.

1135
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,276
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>
