{2478}{2502}Riggs, Homicide.
{2508}{2547}- Nobody's dead.|- The night's young.
{2553}{2587}This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
{2593}{2629}- Threat or a scare?|- Real thing.
{2635}{2663}He saw the device.
{2669}{2747}It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.|I wrote the license plate number.
{2753}{2791}That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
{2797}{2847}- You evacuated the building?|- It's clean.
{2853}{2892}- Where's the bomb squad?|- Coming.
{2898}{2948}Good. It's under control. Let's go.
{2954}{3008}I think we ought to check this out.
{3014}{3055}- Hey, Riggs.|- What?
{3061}{3109}- Bomb squad's coming.|- There's no bomb.
{3115}{3172}- How do you know?|- Because it's a full moon.
{3178}{3229}Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.
{3235}{3280}- Is that Greek?|- No, Latin.
{3286}{3328}You surprise the shit out of me.
{3334}{3385}There's no bomb.|It's probably a false alarm.
{3391}{3452}It happens. He probably saw a radio|on the back seat.
{3458}{3515}Let's not mess with it.|Wait for the bomb squad.
{3521}{3596}You're right. You sit tight,|I'll be right back.
{3602}{3636}What's the matter with you?
{3642}{3692}- There's a bomb in there!|- No, there's not.
{3698}{3744}- There's a bomb in there!|- There is not.
{3750}{3781}There's a bomb in there!
{3787}{3818}- You know how I know?|- How?
{3824}{3903}I've got eight days till retirement|and I won't make a stupid mistake.
{3909}{3978}There is no bomb.|I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy.
{3984}{4026}Look.
{4032}{4101}Trust me. Okay?
{4173}{4264}That's usually my first mistake.
{4275}{4321}Hey, wait. I'm coming.
{4327}{4353}Rog?
{4359}{4425}- Is your insurance paid up?|- Of course. Why?
{4431}{4534}- There could be a bomb in here.|- Oh, God!
{4563}{4646}- I hate it when I'm right.|- Learn to trust your instincts more.
{4652}{4686}Oh, God.
{4692}{4793}The first impression|can often be the right one.
{4844}{4863}Drive shaft...
{4869}{4955}- I wonder if there's a bomb.|- Just don't touch it.
{4961}{5032}Just looking.
{5123}{5250}What are you doing? Don't open the door!
{5311}{5357}Son of a bitch, just look at it.
{5363}{5446}That's all I'll do, just look.
{5485}{5543}There's more plastic than Cher.
{5549}{5596}I love this job. This is amateur night.
{5602}{5643}Open the door. I can't hear you.
{5649}{5681}Open the door.
{5687}{5745}Don't do nothing.
{5751}{5787}Not that one!
{5793}{5823}You son of a bitch.
{5829}{5898}This is a pretty shonky job.|I think I can dismantle it.
{5904}{6001}It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!
{6042}{6133}Everybody's outside. Just me, you|and the cat are dumb enough to be here.
{6139}{6215}Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?
{6221}{6261}- Relax, Rog. Relax.|- Right.
{6267}{6292}Don't do nothing.
{6298}{6373}We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.|You know what we can do?
{6379}{6411}We could drive it out.
{6417}{6459}Fine, it's your turn to drive.
{6465}{6519}No keys. I could hot-wire it.
{6525}{6579}Don't even say "hot-wire"|around this stuff!
{6585}{6605}You're right.
{6611}{6658}Why am I doing this? Why?
{6664}{6731}We're going to have to do it|the old-fashioned way.
{6737}{6775}What are you thinking?
{6781}{6837}What are you thinking?
{6843}{6899}- I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.|- Wait!
{6905}{6965}- That's not what I think.|- You think maybe the red?
{6971}{6997}No! No!
{7003}{7054}I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.
{7060}{7139}We can go upstairs, wait for|the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.
{7145}{7231}The bomb squad never gets here on time.|And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.
{7237}{7257}Rog, please.
{7263}{7294}Forget the cappuccino.
{7300}{7374}- You know what they'll say?|- "Get the fuck out of here!"
{7380}{7480}But then they'll say: "Let's cut|the blue wire", which I'll do right now.
{7486}{7522}- Wait, wait!|- What?
{7528}{7562}How can you be so sure?
{7568}{7593}It's just a hunch.
{7599}{7619}A hunch?
{7625}{7668}Remember the bomb under your toilet?
{7674}{7735}- How could I forget?|- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
{7741}{7809}This is more simplified,|but a bit more powerful.
{7815}{7857}From where I sat, I couldn't see.
{7863}{7901}Forget it. Come on, trust me.
{7907}{7929}Trust you?
{7935}{8034}Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
{8063}{8087}What? What?
{8093}{8161}A minute ago you said blue.
{8167}{8185}I did?
{8191}{8228}You said blue.
{8234}{8273}- I meant red.|- Sure?
{8279}{8313}We can do it your way if you like.
{8319}{8369}- My way? I don't have...|- Quiet!
{8375}{8397}I'm sure, okay?
{8403}{8472}Ah, shit!
{8505}{8547}Ready?
{8553}{8566}Rog?
{8572}{8601}What?
{8607}{8675}Won't you miss all this good stuff|when you retire?
{8681}{8768}Won't you miss it a little bit?
{8802}{8847}I'm cutting the wire.
{8853}{8936}Snip. All done.
{9019}{9041}Grab the cat!
{9047}{9075}Grab the cat?
{9081}{9169}Get out of there! Take cover!
{10593}{10662}Where are they?
{10753}{10814}Bravo.
{10905}{10966}Whoops.
{10975}{11058}Right. "Whoops."
{11077}{11162}Right.
{11245}{11314}Seven days till retirement,|I'm busted down to patrolman.
{11320}{11373}I should've cut the red wire.
{11379}{11431}- You did.|- No, I cut the blue wire.
{11437}{11472}That's what I meant.
{11478}{11561}- We should've waited for the bomb squad.|- Must I hear this every day?
{11567}{11657}- Every day until I retire!|- That'll be a week too long.
{11663}{11722}- My feet are killing me.|- They're killing me, too.
{11728}{11787}- How?|- I have to listen to you bitch about them!
{11793}{11886}- Because you should've cut the red wire!|- I did cut the red wire!
{11892}{11911}What's this?
{11917}{11967}It's kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.
{11973}{12008}It won't keep anything out.
{12014}{12047}It'll keep my stomach in.
{12053}{12109}What have you got under there?
{12115}{12145}It's a girdle.
{12151}{12200}What?
{12206}{12247}It's a girdle.
{12253}{12275}Does Trish know?
{12281}{12313}It's a man's girdle.
{12319}{12351}They make girdles for men?
{12357}{12407}- Yes, they make girdles for men.|- They do?
{12413}{12475}Yeah, they do.|I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.
{12481}{12549}- Cleaners must have shrunk it.|- You should take it to Chin.
{12555}{12643}I did take it to Chin. Look at it.|It shrunk all up in here.
{12649}{12687}I have to hold my breath.
{12693}{12717}Did you see that?
{12723}{12784}- See what?|- Jaywalker.
{12790}{12824}Jaywalking?
{12830}{12885}Hold it right there, pal.|Step up here, please.
{12891}{12921}- Me?|- Yes, you.
{12927}{12959}- What'd I do?|- Stand there.
{12965}{13033}Jaywalking. I saw you.|I'll have to cite you.
{13039}{13098}Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!
{13104}{13186}- Should I radio for backup?|- Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?
{13192}{13253}There are crimes in the city|and you're hassling me...
{13259}{13333}Shut up!
{13371}{13457}- Do you know how to fill one of these out?|- A long time ago.
{13463}{13551}I can't read it. The print is too small|without my glasses.
{13557}{13631}Can we speed this up?|You may have nothing to do, but I do.
{13637}{13711}No, we can't, so will you shut up?
{13717}{13763}- Jaywalking.|- Ask for his license.
{13769}{13809}- License, for jaywalking?|- Yeah.
{13815}{13881}I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.
{13887}{13949}I was walking.|Do I need a walking license now?
{13955}{13997}- Let's just shoot him!|- Is he crazy?
{14003}{14070}I'm going to drill him!|We'll make it look like suicide!
{14076}{14135}- Get out of the way!|- No, the video cameras!
{14141}{14178}I don't care! I'll drill him!
{14184}{14231}Get out of here, before he kills you!
{14237}{14297}- Go that way! Not that way!|- This way! Over here!
{14303}{14325}- Run!|- Now!
{14331}{14402}Run!
{14627}{14663}Wait a minute!
{14669}{14744}You forgot to sign.
{14769}{14807}What was that?
{14813}{14880}Wait a minute.|You forgot to sign the form.
{14886}{14907}Who are you?
{14913}{14944}You're not the regular guy?
{14950}{15007}- He's on vacation.|- On vacation?
{15013}{15067}Well, who the hell is that?
{15073}{15145}Get in the truck.
{15293}{15366}You fucking prick!
{15517}{15550}Are you a cop?
{15556}{15627}Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.|Will continue transmission.
{15633}{15655}Call 911.
{15661}{15733}Okay, honey. Let me drive.|We're in pursuit.
{15739}{15822}I'm driving! Don't worry.
{15951}{16023}This fool picked the wrong time|to mess with the wrong lady.
{16029}{16102}Just stay close.
{16220}{16266}Right behind you, baby!
{16272}{16300}Take a good look!
{16306}{16415}Delores the Road Warrior|is dead on your raggedy ass!
{16589}{16656}Ram him!
{16774}{16838}- Watch out, Riggs!|- Come on!
{17031}{17065}Are you married, sugar?
{17071}{17116}What? Yes, 24 years. 24 years!
{17122}{17194}Yeah, but is it working?
{17297}{17402}- You can't get closer?|- I am. I'm getting closer.
{17427}{17488}Hold on, Riggs!
{17702}{17745}Hold on! We got you!
{17751}{17800}Hold on!
{17806}{17853}- I told you I could do it!|- Closer!
{17859}{17902}- Get me up there!|- Go!
{17908}{17973}I am!
{18064}{18126}Back off!
{18390}{18422}If he falls, don't hit him.
{18428}{18516}Don't worry, I've got something for you.
{19409}{19520}Thanks for the interest, sugar,|but one thing at a time.
{19830}{19902}- Catch him!|- All right!
{19933}{20022}Keep singing. Just stay close.
{20163}{20200}Relax, baby. Relax.
{20206}{20253}Keep your hands off my thighs!
{20259}{20354}- He's in trouble. Watch out!|- I got him!
{20631}{20667}I'm getting too old for this.
{20673}{20758}Not for me, you're not, sugar.
{20803}{20869}You have the right to remain unconscious.
{20875}{20972}Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
{21034}{21075}Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?
{21081}{21177}I'm okay. I think we've got to book|this guy for not wearing his seat belt.
{21183}{21227}That was dynamite driving.
{21233}{21329}- She's a dynamite driver.|- I'll show you dynamite.
{21335}{21397}Sho 'nuff!
{21403}{21447}What have you two been up to?
{21453}{21496}What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
{21502}{21550}- I saw you kiss her.|- I didn't. She kissed me.
{21556}{21627}It looked mutual to me.|Wipe that lipstick off...
{21633}{21720}Hey, go spit, Riggs.
{21727}{21753}Are you okay?
{21759}{21799}Are you all right?
{21805}{21854}Back to bed. Back to bed.
{21860}{21911}Good morning, guys. Daddy.
{21917}{22008}How about treating your dad|to breakfast today?
{22014}{22123}- You've got six more days to go.|- Laundry service.
{22127}{22159}Hold this. Hangers?
{22165}{22245}I'm springing for the soap.|Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.
{22251}{22289}It's a Westie.
{22295}{22335}'Morning, Trish.
{22341}{22384}'Morning, Rog.
{22390}{22428}- Good morning, Nick.|- Spare me.
{22434}{22495}- What, you didn't brush your teeth?|- Hold it, mister.
{22501}{22543}Just looking for some orange juice.
{22549}{22636}Don't get any fingerprints on the door|and put the glass in the dishwasher.
{22642}{22679}Did somebody commit a murder?
{22685}{22725}Someone's coming to see the house.
{22731}{22811}A little mess adds to the charm.
{23033}{23075}How's this?
{23081}{23151}Isn't this great? Okay?
{23157}{23187}Kelly's Pool Hall.
{23193}{23261}Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.
{23267}{23359}Hi, honey. How are you?|I thought I asked you not to call me here.
{23365}{23449}- It's for you.|- Me?
{23475}{23514}Who is it? Hello?
{23520}{23607}{y:i}Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you|{y:i}going to come by and wish me luck?
{23613}{23687}- Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.|- Beautiful lawn.
{23693}{23721}It's great.
{23727}{23776}See how quiet it is here? Listen.
{23782}{23817}Isn't that great? Come on.
{23823}{23871}- It's quiet.|- The inside's even better.
{23877}{23990}- It's the people to look at the house.|- And our broker.
{24035}{24072}Just want to make sure.
{24078}{24180}I'll show you this room first.|It's my favorite.
{24184}{24226}Is that it? Does that say it all?
{24232}{24253}It's very nice.
{24259}{24328}I love that picture window.
{24334}{24391}- It's just been completely replaced.|- Why?
{24397}{24469}A drug dealer came through with his car|and crashed right in.
{24475}{24512}Shot up the whole place.
{24518}{24619}Son of a bitch!|I'm going to cut him off at the knees.
{24625}{24704}It's true. It's true. True.|Okay, anyway, look.
{24710}{24767}Do you like the drapes?|Maybe she'll leave them.
{24773}{24815}- I thought you quit.|- I did.
{24821}{24909}- You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.|- I'm itching to.
{24915}{24957}Here.
{24963}{24997}Chew on these.
{25003}{25095}I have to tell you this. It's the law.|It's called "full disclosure".
{25101}{25185}Anything else you want to disclose|before we go on?
{25191}{25271}Now that you mention it, the bathroom|has been completely remodeled...
{25277}{25318}...due to unexpected bomb damage.
{25324}{25357}Hey, come on. It's okay.
{25363}{25395}Son of a bitch!
{25401}{25502}Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.
{25585}{25661}Okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.|I'll show you the upstairs.
{25667}{25773}Wait till you see it.|It's beautiful. You'll love it.
{25867}{25930}They're gone. Leo Getz,|I'm going to kill him.
{25936}{25991}Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him!
{25997}{26082}You have to let me, Riggs!
{26094}{26135}They weren't going to buy it anyway!
{26141}{26214}- You scared them away!|- They couldn't afford to buy it!
{26220}{26277}- Oh, I see.|- Okay, relax.
{26283}{26363}I had to tell them everything.|It's the law. "Full disclosure."
{26369}{26443}- You must have heard of it?|- I'm a cop. I'm the law!
{26449}{26537}- Get off me! What is it with you?|- Hold it!
{26543}{26568}Okay, okay.
{26574}{26670}At least he didn't tell them|about the nail-gun incident.
{26676}{26751}I forgot. Did you have a permit|when you built over the garage?
{26757}{26781}Permit?
{26787}{26844}Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.
{26850}{26921}I'll make some calls.|We'll get some back-dated permits.
{26927}{27024}- Which phone can I use?|- Sunroom.
{27051}{27113}- It must be easier than this.|- Count on Leo Getz.
{27119}{27199}You need less aggravation.|Come to work with me.
{27205}{27295}Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch.
{27590}{27663}Did you forget something?
{27767}{27789}This.
{27795}{27847}You wear it. You sleep in it. You eat in it.
{27853}{27869}Okay?
{27875}{27923}Six more days.
{27929}{27955}And you...
{27961}{28006}...keep an eye on him.
{28012}{28066}Sure.
{28173}{28199}She loves me.
{28205}{28260}Stop fronting yourself.|You know what I'm saying?
{28266}{28350}Swing with me and my crew.
{28420}{28500}- I got school.|- Forget school.
{28534}{28599}Here comes your pops.
{28605}{28672}- Later.|- All right, gotcha.
{28678}{28754}Next time.
{28792}{28880}- 'Morning, Rog.|- How are you doing?
{28892}{28940}Hey, Nick?
{28946}{28985}- Wasn't that Darryl?|- Yeah.
{28991}{29056}I haven't seen him around in a while.
{29062}{29098}He dropped out of high school.
{29104}{29153}Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
{29159}{29217}Yeah, I know.
{29223}{29270}Hey, Nick?
{29276}{29299}Yeah, Dad?
{29305}{29345}Be good.
{29351}{29410}Word.
{29439}{29475}"Word", Nick.
{29481}{29546}Word.
{29585}{29609}"Word", Riggs.
{29615}{29654}"Word", Rog.
{29660}{29700}- What are we talking about?|- "Word."
{29706}{29782}Four letters. Starts with a "W",|"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.
{29788}{29841}Oh, yeah, that word.
{29847}{29908}"Word."
{30197}{30267}- Tyrone, my man, how are you?|- Jack, how's it going?
{30273}{30322}- Let's take a walk.|- Wait here for me.
{30328}{30391}Look around. This is my dream|and it's all coming true.
{30397}{30506}You sank your money into this,|out here in the middle of the desert?
{30512}{30567}- Know why it'll be a gold mine?|- Do tell.
{30573}{30661}Because no one wants to live|next door to a menace like you.
{30667}{30742}I came to do business,|not to be insulted by you.
{30748}{30782}Relax, Tyrone.
{30788}{30850}Like houses,|friendships need strong foundations.
{30856}{30952}Smitty, come here. Come here.
{30977}{31052}What's wrong with you?|Don't I pay you good and take care of you?
{31058}{31139}- Sure you do.|- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?
{31145}{31219}- It was a good plan. It worked.|- It worked? It didn't work.
{31225}{31263}You got nailed, first time out.
{31269}{31336}Nobody who works for me|goes into business for themselves.
{31342}{31412}Do you understand me?|See how that can jeopardize everything?
{31418}{31471}- Right?|- Whatever.
{31477}{31539}Especially trying to pop an armored car.
{31545}{31628}Okay, Billy got caught.|There's nothing I can do about that now.
{31634}{31695}He'll have to face the music on his own.
{31701}{31738}But you and me...
{31744}{31778}...we're gonna start over.
{31784}{31842}You know what I mean?
{31848}{31891}- Whatever you say.|- Good.
{31897}{31995}Glad you understand|what I'm talking about.
{32106}{32203}Now we've got a relationship|we can build on.
{32217}{32295}- Employee problems. You know how it is?|- Yeah, right.
{32301}{32359}You invest time and energy|into training somebody.
{32365}{32452}Then they get greedy and do something|stupid that jeopardizes everything.
{32458}{32484}It's a bitch!
{32490}{32541}Stick around. This is the good part.
{32547}{32624}We can put our initials in there.
{32630}{32701}Jesus Christ!
{32750}{32811}Lankershim and Vineland.|Where are we going?
{32817}{32904}Right here. Rianne's got a new job.|I promised her I'd stop by.
{32910}{32963}That's a good reason.
{32969}{33070}All right. Here we are.
{33181}{33256}- You got any silver, any change?|- We're cops.
{33262}{33382}That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.|I'll get change.
{33578}{33658}Get down! All of you!
{33715}{33785}Get down!
{34153}{34182}How do you like me?
{34188}{34243}What are you doing with a rubber gun?
{34249}{34277}This is a film.
{34283}{34355}Cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?
{34361}{34420}- Get him off my set.|- This isn't part of the story.
{34426}{34508}- Where did you come from?|- Can we get a cop on set?
{34514}{34591}Rianne, I'm so sorry.|I feel like a microbe right now.
{34597}{34663}- You really thought I was in trouble?|- I did.
{34669}{34732}A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
{34738}{34790}- Are you a fucking idiot?|- I apologize.
{34796}{34873}He's a friend of mine, a policeman.|He thought I was in trouble.
{34879}{34904}We're both...
{34910}{34940}He's a friend of yours?
{34946}{35022}Let me tell you something:|You're fired. Have a nice day.
{35028}{35086}Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?
{35092}{35120}You're not fired.
{35126}{35179}No, you're not. Just take it easy.
{35185}{35235}You can't fire her for something I did.
{35241}{35293}I don't care whose mistake it was.|She's fired.
{35299}{35329}I apologize to everyone.
{35335}{35360}Don't push him!
{35366}{35394}All of you, go!
{35400}{35442}Just take it easy. Don't push him.
{35448}{35524}Get off my set, all right?|What are you, deaf?
{35530}{35550}Get off my set!
{35556}{35611}On any normal day,|I'd smack you in the mouth.
{35617}{35637}Is that so?
{35643}{35659}Don't!
{35665}{35707}It's a normal day.
{35713}{35778}I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.
{35784}{35861}I'm all thumbs. He fell down.|Let me help you.
{35867}{35902}I said don't hit him!
{35908}{35951}- Is she fired?|- Yes, she's fired.
{35957}{35985}- Is she fired?|- No, no.
{35991}{36031}- It's okay.|- Does she get a raise?
{36037}{36087}- Yes. I said, "yes".|- Good.
{36093}{36180}Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.
{36186}{36270}We'd like you to come back.
{36349}{36395}You can't settle every problem|with your fists.
{36401}{36473}- I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.|- Six more days.
{36479}{36518}I don't want to hear that anymore.
{36524}{36588}Did Rianne get her job back?|Did she get a raise?
{36594}{36639}I don't hear a "thank you".
{36645}{36743}Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.|What do you think?
{36749}{36789}- It won't work.|- Why?
{36795}{36843}You don't have that killer instinct.
{36849}{36895}Son of a bitch!
{36901}{36998}- We should've put a bag on the meter.|- I'll put it in the glove compartment.
{37004}{37038}I don't do that anymore.
{37044}{37075}Oh, yeah? Good man.
{37081}{37171}It's full. Put it in the back seat.
{37229}{37343}- You really like those things?|- These? They're good.
{37368}{37478}You can eat a box of them|and still be dying for a cigarette.
{37530}{37600}- Did you cut yourself shaving?|- Yeah.
{37606}{37647}Old razor?
{37653}{37719}Old face.
{37733}{37821}You're letting this retirement thing|get you down.
{37827}{37895}Spend a few more years|getting used to the idea. Why quit?
{37901}{37965}- I've got plans for my retirement.|- Oh, yeah, plans.
{37971}{38010}- I do. Big plans.|- Big plans?
{38016}{38066}- I've had them for a long time.|- Like what?
{38072}{38131}Like...
{38137}{38192}- Things, man.|- Things.
{38198}{38218}Things.
{38224}{38262}Things I've put off for too long.
{38268}{38336}Oh, those things. I've got those, too.
{38342}{38438}I see you've given this a lot of thought.
{38463}{38509}Yeah.
{38515}{38602}I've given it a lot of thought.
{39026}{39063}Goddamn it!
{39069}{39142}- What's going on?|- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?
{39148}{39239}- I thought I heard gunfire.|- Get your hearing checked! Put that away!
{39245}{39274}What are you looking at?
{39280}{39355}Hey, man. Peace.
{39853}{39942}Why'd you call us down here?
{39961}{39991}How are you doing, son?
{39997}{40090}Does your mother know you're here?
{40141}{40195}- Did you do this?|- Nice shooting.
{40201}{40251}Better than Billy the Kid.
{40257}{40302}Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
{40308}{40381}Give it to your mom.|Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
{40387}{40434}- Can I borrow your glasses?|- Yeah.
{40440}{40465}Who's wearing?
{40471}{40500}Roger, you are.
{40506}{40548}Why me? You guys should be wearing.
{40554}{40592}Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
{40598}{40667}I don't need help.|I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
{40673}{40723}- Okay, man, just trying to help.|- Get back.
{40729}{40768}All you perverts, turn your heads.
{40774}{40859}- Take it off, baby.|- Hold this shirt.
{40863}{40903}You're wearing a girdle.
{40909}{40959}- He's got a girdle.|- This is not a girdle.
{40965}{41007}This is not a girdle. It's my back.
{41013}{41081}My back went out on me.
{41083}{41177}I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.|What are you talking about?
{41183}{41211}I saw him do it.
{41217}{41249}Everybody, listen up.
{41255}{41321}I want you all to look at these.|Lovely bullets.
{41327}{41341}Cute.
{41347}{41469}Notice the smooth jacket.|Pay particular attention to the tip.
{41545}{41672}Now, you've all seen these vests stop|a.357 Magnum bullet.
{41738}{41809}Observe.
{42126}{42194}Son of a bitch.
{42210}{42304}- Armor-piercing bullets?|- Yeah, cop killers.
{42310}{42402}Those bullets came from the gun|of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
{42408}{42454}They're out there on the streets.
{42460}{42535}Vests are optional, boys and girls.|Especially boys.
{42541}{42610}See you, Riggs.
{42637}{42706}Cop killers.
{42726}{42799}Son of a bitch.
{42824}{42969}I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.|I'll have him brought in for interrogation.
{43137}{43195}I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.
{43201}{43267}- Can I see your ID, please?|- Sure.
{43273}{43353}William Phelps, armored car suspect.|He's been moved to Interrogation.
{43359}{43467}- Do you know where that is?|- Sure. I've been there a lot.
{43658}{43734}Same floor.
{43741}{43866}I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss|bank account will come in pretty handy.
{43872}{43936}How much you got in there, $1 million?|$1.5 million?
{43942}{43983}- $5 million.|- $5 million?
{43989}{44031}Well, you deserve it.
{44037}{44146}It's better than those|miserable drug dealers getting it.
{44207}{44252}What are you talking about?
{44258}{44351}Don't sweat it. You laundered it,|didn't you? They can't trace it.
{44357}{44398}- They can't trace it.|- What?
{44404}{44480}So long as I get an invite|to "casa de" Murtaugh, I'm happy.
{44486}{44511}"Casa" what?
{44517}{44571}- I've never been to Portugal.|- Stop joking.
{44577}{44599}She's a cop.
{44605}{44698}I know she's a cop.|She's probably on the take, too.
{44704}{44747}The whole Force is bent.
{44753}{44815}She may be wearing a skirt,|but we're all brothers.
{44821}{44901}You know I have nothing.|I ain't been to Portugal.
{44907}{44994}Listen to me.
{45029}{45086}Son of a bitch.
{45092}{45135}- How are you doing?|- Fine.
{45141}{45227}- Who is it today?|- Billy Phelps.
{45228}{45250}Who are you?
{45256}{45333}Fly me. I'm your friendly|Portuguese airline.
{45339}{45369}She's Infernal Affairs.
{45375}{45395}How'd you know?
{45401}{45487}I took the liberty|of looking at your file folder.
{45493}{45538}Lorna Cole.
{45544}{45611}- And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.|- I used to be.
{45617}{45687}What's Infernal Repairs|want with our collar?
{45693}{45726}We're taking over, thanks.
{45732}{45776}Nobody told us they were taking over.
{45782}{45833}Nobody has to tell you anything,|Patrolman.
{45839}{45882}I want to go and see the captain.
{45888}{45950}You want to see the captain?|Let's go see the captain.
{45956}{46017}- And put on a vest.|- Oh, are you wearing one?
{46023}{46110}Just take it easy, man.
{46365}{46438}Hey, guys. Phelps, William.|Actually, his name's Billy.
{46444}{46472}You, too?
{46478}{46524}- Popular guy today.|- Somebody with him?
{46530}{46603}No, not really.|He's down the hall to the right.
{46609}{46668}Want to sign in here, Sarge?
{46674}{46705}Miss.
{46711}{46797}- What's Internal Affairs doing here?|- Don't start. I just found out myself.
{46803}{46857}This is Herman Walters,|Chief of Intelligence.
{46863}{46911}You haven't met his daughter,|Lorna Doone.
{46917}{46944}Pleased to meet you.
{46950}{47018}The Phelps case has been transferred|to Internal Affairs.
{47024}{47041}Why?
{47047}{47092}- I can't tell you.|- That's classified.
{47098}{47157}We busted our buns busting this guy.|We busted him.
{47163}{47223}Busted is right.|He spent the night in the hospital.
{47229}{47276}- He didn't buckle up.|- We even cited him.
{47282}{47325}I know, I read your report.
{47331}{47388}Our cases have, unfortunately,|crossed paths here.
{47394}{47449}That's all I can say.|We'll take over from here.
{47455}{47507}Captain, what is she talking about here?
{47513}{47574}- That's classified.|- No, I'm talking to him.
{47580}{47606}I'm telling you...
{47612}{47672}No, I said, "Captain".|I'm talking to the captain.
{47678}{47747}- That's classified.|- I'm talking to him.
{47753}{47824}That's bullshit!
{47839}{47903}Maybe these guys|can contribute something to this case?
{47909}{47978}From their records,|they only contribute mayhem and chaos.
{47984}{48038}No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.|We're a double act.
{48044}{48095}What are we,|required reading or something?
{48101}{48137}As a matter of fact, you are.
{48143}{48206}It's a cross between "Police Gazette"|and "Mad" magazine.
{48212}{48279}- What's wrong with "Mad"?|- Nothing, I used to read it...
{48285}{48319}You've got some taste.
{48325}{48380}...when I was 12.
{48386}{48420}- Riggs, let's go.|- I'm out of here.
{48426}{48471}We busted him, we can talk to him.
{48477}{48528}- Captain.|- Riggs. Murtaugh.
{48534}{48621}Get your asses back here.
{48660}{48715}You'll be needing these.
{48721}{48775}I'm reinstating both of you.
{48781}{48839}- Don't you just love him?|- Yeah.
{48845}{48907}God!
{48919}{48959}You really are a beautiful man.
{48965}{48996}Just get rid of the blues.
{49002}{49107}- They don't go with your ponytail.|- Absolutely not.
{49111}{49132}Yeah, right.
{49138}{49159}Get a haircut!
{49165}{49192}Of course, I won't.
{49198}{49245}You've exceeded your authority, Captain.
{49251}{49320}- That's not how I see it.|- That's how the chief will see it.
{49326}{49373}- Take it up with him.|- I think I will.
{49379}{49460}Catch up with them. We don't want this|screwed up with cowboy tactics.
{49466}{49531}Son of a bitch.
{49550}{49614}Hi, Billy.
{49650}{49670}Jack.
{49676}{49739}'Bye, Billy.
{49886}{49962}See you, Billy.
{50086}{50130}Sergeant, did you get what you need?
{50136}{50231}Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
{50237}{50284}How long has Phelps been doing this?
{50290}{50356}- Doing what?|- This armored-car thing.
{50362}{50470}I wouldn't know.|I'm not interested in armored cars.
{50756}{50808}I don't think she's telling us everything.
{50814}{50842}I think you're right.
{50848}{50907}Boy, these six days are going to be rough.
{50913}{50994}God, be good to me, please.
{51013}{51108}Shit, son of a bitch knew there was|a camera in the wall.
{51114}{51131}Damn it!
{51137}{51198}He didn't know there was one|in the interrogation room.
{51204}{51246}There isn't.
{51252}{51293}We installed them six months ago.
{51299}{51335}- Every station.|- That's great.
{51341}{51385}Six months and we don't know about it?
{51391}{51434}This is the "police police", Captain.
{51440}{51529}"Police police." Very good. Can you say|that three times in a row, real fast?
{51535}{51596}- Why? Am I getting to you?|- Are you trying to bait me?
{51602}{51630}I'm a master at it.
{51636}{51658}That figures.
{51664}{51724}Baiting master. Great, man,|try all the tricks.
{51730}{51768}Freeze that. Stop it.
{51774}{51807}Jack Travis.
{51813}{51832}Who?
{51838}{51913}Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
{51919}{51943}He was one of us.
{51949}{52022}Hell of a brutal cop.|He could beat a confession out of anyone.
{52028}{52060}One hell of a dirty cop.
{52066}{52153}I've never seen so many suspensions|and reprimands and charges of misconduct.
{52159}{52215}He's also as tough as they come.
{52221}{52249}What happened to him?
{52255}{52279}I don't know.
{52285}{52376}His partner and him were on a stakeout.|He went for coffee, never came back.
{52382}{52441}Looks like he's had|one cappuccino too many.
{52447}{52489}We'd better brief Walters.
{52495}{52544}Excuse me, cute stuff.
{52550}{52626}- That's harassment.|- "Cute stuff." That's you.
{52632}{52713}- Captain.|- Boys. It's just the captain.
{52719}{52800}Your involvement in this case ended|when Phelps hit the floor.
{52806}{52880}Why don't you just go back|and beat your street?
{52886}{52955}- Now's the time to buy.|- Not now.
{52961}{53007}- Hey, Roger.|- Not now, Leo.
{53013}{53071}- Not now!|- We got to talk, babe, okay?
{53077}{53127}You're in trouble. You've got termites.
{53133}{53159}Termites?
{53165}{53213}- Oh, God!|- You're infested!
{53219}{53277}The only thing holding up your house|is the paint.
{53283}{53305}We should go.
{53311}{53357}Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
{53363}{53416}We should pull every file on this guy.
{53422}{53475}I know this guy.|Are you watching "Geraldo"?
{53481}{53513}- What?|- I know the guy.
{53519}{53580}- How do you know him?|- I've seen the guy before.
{53586}{53636}- Where?|- I don't know. I recognize him...
{53642}{53720}His name is Jack Travis.|Does that ring a bell?
{53726}{53776}Hands off the clothes. Okay?
{53782}{53840}I'm thinking. Let me think.
{53846}{53880}It was a big party.
{53886}{53963}Someone brought a monkey|that knocked over the salad bar.
{53969}{54045}And this guy comes in|and introduces me to another guy...
{54051}{54100}...who wants a favor.
{54106}{54144}- I got it!|- What?
{54150}{54176}He's got it!
{54182}{54229}- I remember!|- You remember!
{54235}{54307}Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.
{54313}{54364}- We're back. We're back!|- Yeah.
{54370}{54466}Listen. Can I have a gun this time?
{54698}{54810}Okay, this is it! These guys always|wanted me to do favors for them!
{54816}{54904}Like, some guys wanted broads,|another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
{54910}{54950}Your guy, hockey.
{54956}{55038}The best seats in the house.
{55064}{55131}- Where're the seats?|- Yeah?
{55137}{55193}Probably by the glass.
{55199}{55258}Does "needle in a haystack"|mean anything to you?
{55264}{55296}Why don't we spread out?
{55302}{55409}If we all take a different direction,|it'd be like old times.
{55415}{55481}Don't push, lady.|I'm on police business here.
{55487}{55567}Just take it easy.
{56201}{56275}{y:i}Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.
{56281}{56324}{y:i}Two minutes for high-sticking.
{56330}{56418}{y:i}Time, 5:15.
{56831}{56897}{y:i}Mr. Jack Travis?
{56903}{56997}{y:i}Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.
{57003}{57036}{y:i}We know you're in here.
{57042}{57093}{y:i}We know where you are.|{y:i}Just stay in your seat.
{57099}{57131}{y:i}Don't be stupid.
{57137}{57190}{y:i}I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.
{57196}{57271}{y:i}There's a policeman at every exit,|{y:i}so it's no use trying to run.
{57277}{57301}Smart son of a bitch.
{57307}{57339}{y:i}Just stay where you are.
{57345}{57434}{y:i}Thanks for your cooperation.|{y:i}Play on, boys.
{57743}{57808}Come on, let's go!
{58029}{58111}Get out of my fucking way!
{58369}{58434}Excuse me.
{58705}{58778}You can't be on the ice!
{58910}{58986}I got him!
{59007}{59115}You have the right... You're under arrest!
{59289}{59311}Fucking weasel!
{59317}{59359}What the hell's going on here?
{59365}{59403}I'm LAPD!
{59409}{59502}I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
{59618}{59645}I got him!
{59651}{59738}You're all right, pal. Stay calm.
{59766}{59807}Make sure you tell my mother.
{59813}{59840}Where'd he go?
{59846}{59913}Down there.
{60118}{60198}Son of a bitch!
{60235}{60310}He thinks I don't know I'm dying.|I know it.
{60316}{60391}- You'll be okay.|- I'm dying, Roger.
{60397}{60436}I'm choking, see?
{60442}{60488}This is what they do when they die.
{60494}{60578}Leo, it's going to be okay.
{60578}{60627}My body's numb. I can't feel it.
{60633}{60704}I'm going to die, I know it. What?
{60710}{60790}You're lying on the ice.
{60798}{60851}- That's why I'm cold?|- That's why you're cold.
{60857}{60912}- That's why I'm numb?|- That's why you're numb.
{60918}{60963}But he shot me. Look at all the blood.
{60969}{61066}- It's just a flesh wound.|- So it's okay.
{61158}{61282}He's okay. He's going to make it.|He's alive!
{61374}{61483}- Bring him this way.|- I can't believe this.
{61487}{61535}- I can't believe I got shot.|- Calm down.
{61541}{61567}Riggs, are you here?
{61573}{61636}We're all the same now. We all got shot.
{61642}{61680}You'll be fine.
{61686}{61702}Relax.
{61708}{61775}I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.|I can take this.
{61781}{61856}Calm down. We'll take care of it.|You'll be out of here tonight.
{61862}{61885}It's no big deal.
{61891}{61953}That's not a good idea.|You shouldn't rush this, Doc.
{61959}{61984}You should rest up.
{61990}{62035}A dum-dum wound can be serious.
{62041}{62085}What's a "dum-dum wound"?
{62091}{62183}You don't know? A guy on the Force|got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.
{62189}{62240}From the shock,|he was dead two days later.
{62246}{62279}"Dead two days later"?
{62285}{62318}He died from dum-dums?
{62324}{62380}- We'll keep you overnight.|- Make it two.
{62386}{62407}Two days?
{62413}{62455}Okay, we'll keep him in two days.
{62461}{62498}Is that Leo's chart?
{62504}{62579}- Two days, then you'll be as good as new.|- I should be with them.
{62585}{62639}I should be with...
{62645}{62684}How do you spell, "proctological"?
{62690}{62732}Rectal exam?
{62738}{62804}- No, you can't do that to Leo.|- Sure, we can.
{62810}{62829}Why's she...
{62835}{62876}Please, Mr. Getz.
{62882}{62960}You've been shot in the arm?|Let her take it. You'll get it back.
{62966}{63051}There's a clock in your room.
{63052}{63098}Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?
{63104}{63160}- It sounded like one when it happened.|- Shit.
{63166}{63259}- Take it easy. Two days.|- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.
{63265}{63330}- I'll see you guys.|- We won't make a move without you.
{63336}{63385}I thought that bullet sounded different.
{63391}{63454}- Relax. They'll be there when you get out.|- I'm fine.
{63460}{63504}- You own your house, Doc?|- What?
{63510}{63554}- You don't recognize my face?|- No, sir.
{63560}{63602}Watch.
{63608}{63620}It's about time.
{63626}{63692}These doggy treats are okay,|but I need some human food.
{63698}{63779}Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing|you've ever had.
{63785}{63846}Good.
{63852}{63952}- You ever eaten one of my hamburgers?|- I've been lucky so far.
{63958}{63984}Hey, Fast Eddie.
{63990}{64042}- How's business?|- Booming. Can't you tell?
{64048}{64105}Yeah, I'm looking at it.|Did you meet my partner?
{64111}{64172}I want to cook one|of those monster burgers for him.
{64178}{64211}- Go for it.|- All right.
{64217}{64245}You'll let him cook?
{64251}{64314}- Do I have a choice?|- No, because it's Wednesday.
{64320}{64360}He's too big to argue with.
{64366}{64411}In that case, give me a MacRog.
{64417}{64458}Hold the hair.
{64464}{64493}Did you wash your hands?
{64499}{64583}Keep joking. But I guarantee|you're gonna like this burger...
{64589}{64680}...and you're gonna come back|with your friends.
{64686}{64768}I haven't got any friends,|you know that, except you.
{64774}{64836}He's a comedian in his spare time.
{64842}{64889}When is he gonna say something funny?
{64895}{64928}Are you gonna put that out?
{64934}{64972}You're finished with it, yeah?
{64978}{65057}Do you mind? Thanks.
{65070}{65121}Sorry. I was just looking at it.
{65127}{65190}Chew on this onion.
{65196}{65256}He's quitting, so help him.
{65262}{65341}I was only looking at it.
{65374}{65412}The first thing is the fat.
{65418}{65476}Everyone says, "Cut the fat".
{65482}{65555}My uncle said, "You cut the fat,|you kill the burger". Right?
{65561}{65573}Yeah.
{65579}{65697}There's an art to it.|You just can't plop this on the grill.
{65718}{65810}Gently coax the flavors out.
{65830}{65913}Hey, what's the problem?
{66039}{66122}A little pepper,|then you massage it a little bit.
{66128}{66155}Just a little bit.
{66161}{66257}"Sweet, sweet meat"
{66284}{66365}Shit, man, feel it.
{66416}{66446}Okay, guys!
{66452}{66492}LAPD. Let me see your hands.
{66498}{66551}Let me see your hands. Get them up!
{66557}{66683}In the car! Get them up there!|Let me see both of them! Come on!
{66751}{66814}Hey, Riggs!
{67033}{67127}Don't you love me? Five days.
{67282}{67314}Don't do that to me.
{67320}{67363}- Riggs, are you okay?|- Yeah.
{67369}{67437}Who did it?
{67458}{67488}All right, asshole!
{67494}{67585}I want to see your hands, right now!
{68178}{68249}Back me up, Riggs.
{68828}{68897}Darryl?
{69047}{69110}Fuck, no!
{69153}{69238}Call an ambulance!|Call an ambulance! Breathe!
{69244}{69286}Please, breathe.
{69292}{69320}Breathe!
{69326}{69390}Call an ambulance!
{69396}{69447}Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!
{69453}{69528}Fuck, it's Darryl!
{69539}{69584}Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!
{69590}{69648}- He's dead.|- Breathe!
{69654}{69712}- God, don't do this!|- He's dead.
{69718}{69771}Rog, he's dead!
{69777}{69840}He's dead, Rog.|Don't mess with the corpse.
{69846}{69920}He's dead. Come on, man,|it was a clean shoot.
{69926}{69972}It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
{69978}{70028}He was gonna do you|and he was gonna do me.
{70034}{70085}It's okay. Are you okay?
{70091}{70152}It's not okay.
{70158}{70231}I know that kid.
{70260}{70319}I know that kid.
{70325}{70403}He's Nick's friend.
{70788}{70843}- I got it, Mom.|- I'll get it.
{70849}{70878}Hello?
{70884}{70926}Hi, Martin.
{70932}{71001}He's not here.
{71146}{71225}Oh, my God!
{71260}{71329}Thanks.
{72006}{72069}Fuck!
{72180}{72224}How are you doing? Taking your vitamins?
{72230}{72312}- Riggs, how's Murtaugh?|- He's good. He's fine.
{72318}{72387}- I'm sure he's anything but fine.|- Really, he's okay.
{72393}{72474}- I'd really like to talk to him.|- That's not such a good idea.
{72480}{72531}The best thing to do is to leave him alone.
{72537}{72648}- Let's get something for your cold.|- I know what I'm talking about.
{72654}{72723}- We have to talk.|- Talking to you is bad for my image.
{72729}{72776}- I'm afraid I insist.|- Oh, you insist?
{72782}{72913}In that case, let's find someplace private.|Step into my orifice.
{73022}{73088}- Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?|- Hey, Riggs.
{73094}{73192}- Clip any wrong wires lately?|- I haven't done that for a couple of days.
{73198}{73246}Next time, wait for the bomb squad.
{73252}{73276}Yeah, it's our job.
{73282}{73340}I'll remember that.|We saved a cat, though.
{73346}{73426}Great. I love cats.
{73435}{73474}Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
{73480}{73579}You purposefully withheld information|concerning a case under my investigation.
{73585}{73613}Damn right, I did.
{73619}{73665}Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
{73671}{73738}You had a tip on Travis.|You should have shared it with me.
{73744}{73771}No, I take that back.
{73777}{73835}You were required to share it with me.
{73841}{73899}I was "required" to share it with you?
{73905}{73951}I don't have to share shit with you.
{73957}{74036}Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch|my back, I don't throw you...
{74042}{74112}- Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!|- Yes, you can!
{74118}{74171}Why don't you cut out|this classified bullshit!
{74177}{74225}Right now! It's giving me the shits!
{74231}{74315}We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.|We're both on the same side, right?
{74321}{74343}- Right?|- Right!
{74349}{74410}Good! Why don't we start to act like it?
{74416}{74469}There are kids out there.|Babies. No brains.
{74475}{74515}But they got automatic weapons.
{74521}{74636}- Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...|- I know about Murtaugh.
{74656}{74727}And I'm sorry, Riggs.
{74733}{74793}Yeah.
{74884}{74940}Why don't you let me in on this?|I can help you.
{74946}{75022}I really want to help you,|if you'll let me. Let me.
{75028}{75115}What do you say? Have we got a deal?
{75174}{75243}Wash your hands...
{75271}{75361}...and meet me in my office.
{75387}{75459}I'll be right there.
{75464}{75510}I'll be right there.
{75516}{75559}MAC-10, 9-mm, semi-automatic...
{75565}{75638}...converted to automatic|with 36 rounds in the magazine.
{75644}{75686}"On a sesame seed bun."
{75692}{75724}Very illegal.
{75730}{75780}That gun has a history.|Wanna know about it?
{75786}{75845}Tell me.
{75878}{75952}"Killed a convenience store clerk|in LA County, July 1990."
{75958}{76062}"Used in a drive-by shooting|in San Bernardino County, August 1990."
{76068}{76184}"Confiscated by a truant officer|of the LA School Board, October 1990."
{76190}{76248}Scheduled for destruction by the LAPD|six weeks ago.
{76254}{76312}"Scheduled" for destruction.
{76318}{76397}But it never got there.
{76407}{76478}Instead, it found its way|into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...
{76484}{76541}...who fired it on a police officer,|your partner.
{76547}{76582}I thought it looked familiar.
{76588}{76633}That gun and 15,000 others like it...
{76639}{76726}...were stolen from a police storage facility|before they could be destroyed.
{76732}{76796}They should be paper clips right now,|or license plates.
{76802}{76886}Anything but a gun. Here we are|busting our asses on the streets...
{76892}{76989}...getting these weapons out of circulation|and now they're headed back out.
{76995}{77106}By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto|something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.
{77112}{77198}That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.|They think this is an inside job.
{77204}{77255}That's right. They knew police procedures.
{77261}{77322}They knew where the guns were stored|and how to get in.
{77328}{77390}They even knew the sorting codes|on the containers...
{77396}{77466}...because they took the automatics|and left the junk behind.
{77472}{77524}- It all pointed to a cop.|- Or an ex-cop.
{77530}{77549}Right.
{77555}{77616}Travis.
{77638}{77712}And you let him slip through your fingers.
{77718}{77760}That's closer than you ever got.
{77766}{77799}Close, Riggs?
{77805}{77913}Close is a lingerie shop|without a front window.
{77937}{77976}Do you want to go for a ride?
{77982}{78027}Sure, where are we going?
{78033}{78103}It's a surprise.
{78184}{78233}Oh, I love surprises.
{78239}{78262}What is this place?
{78268}{78330}I accessed Billy Phelps'phone records|on my computer.
{78336}{78383}He made a dozen calls to this address.
{78389}{78445}That was nice of you|to steal that information.
{78451}{78488}- Semantics, Riggs.|- "Semantics"?
{78494}{78554}I'm always up for some antics.
{78560}{78604}Let's go on three.
{78610}{78630}One.
{78636}{78686}- On three, or three and then go?|- What?
{78692}{78779}Never mind. One, two, three.
{78806}{78870}I've got you.
{79167}{79222}It looks like Billy's grandmother|owns a big dog.
{79228}{79271}It's not a dog. It's a horse.
{79277}{79330}I hate dogs, Riggs.
{79336}{79363}I don't get it.
{79369}{79452}You don't get what?|It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
{79458}{79566}I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop|without a front window." I don't get it.
{79572}{79635}Later.
{79721}{79755}What are you doing?
{79761}{79834}I can't shoot a dog.|People, okay, but not dogs.
{79840}{79894}I should try to make friends with him.
{79900}{79952}"Make friends"?
{79958}{80081}Now don't run, because he'll only|chase you down and kill you.
{80102}{80132}Here, boy.
{80138}{80201}Here, boy.
{80346}{80364}Shit!
{80370}{80437}Good boy.
{80597}{80661}Riggs?
{80748}{80819}You're crazy.
{81264}{81299}Want some?
{81305}{81367}Are you hungry?
{81372}{81409}You're a hungry boy.
{81415}{81508}Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
{81542}{81594}Here's one. Leave some for me.
{81600}{81685}Very slowly, as if you're not here,|just walk away.
{81691}{81718}You want me to go?
{81724}{81764}Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
{81770}{81804}"Guy sort of thing"?
{81810}{81879}Are you all alone in here?
{82062}{82126}Stay, stay.
{82140}{82217}Come on, let's go.
{82688}{82716}How many is that?
{82722}{82814}- Fifty-five.|- Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.
{82820}{82905}We'll get these later. Let's go.
{82963}{83006}Hi, fellas.
{83012}{83091}What's in all these boxes?
{83302}{83442}Easy, let's not kill him, yet.|Let's see who he is first, all right?
{83454}{83495}You have the right to remain silent.
{83501}{83546}Shut him up!
{83552}{83637}"Sergeant Martin Riggs."
{83657}{83696}- Get the truck ready.|- Right.
{83702}{83741}So, Sergeant Riggs...
{83747}{83782}...how did you find us?
{83788}{83846}Freeze! Police!
{83852}{83888}Another one?
{83894}{83932}We need a new fucking dog.
{83938}{83982}Get your hands up, asshole.
{83988}{84056}Get them up!
{84105}{84135}A little bit higher.
{84141}{84192}That's better.
{84198}{84267}Very good.
{84326}{84393}Drop it, miss.
{84410}{84473}Now, look!
{85606}{85680}Okay, I'm on! No, wait!
{85686}{85761}Wait, wait!
{85804}{85835}Sergeant Cole!
{85841}{85919}Get down!
{85974}{86062}Get those cases and kill that dog!
{86301}{86331}Stop!
{86337}{86352}The dog.
{86358}{86432}- Where'd you learn to fight?|- Catholic school. Forget the dog!
{86438}{86482}Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!
{86488}{86511}Hold it.
{86517}{86546}Come on, dog!
{86552}{86646}Good dog. Good puppy. Go!
{86668}{86698}Stop!
{86704}{86723}What?
{86729}{86766}- It's full of guns.|- Grab one!
{86772}{86810}- You grab one!|- Chicken.
{86816}{86875}Step on it.
{86941}{87035}Get that crate! Come on!
{87130}{87235}{y:i}Hatchett, you said not to worry about|{y:i}the police, but the cops are all over you!
{87241}{87300}They got my guns.|They'll come after me, next!
{87306}{87357}As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!
{87363}{87433}Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.|We have a deal.
{87439}{87463}Nobody backs out.
{87469}{87518}{y:i}You said you had the cops under control.
{87524}{87574}I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...
{87580}{87623}{y:i}... why I should do business with you.
{87629}{87665}I'll give you a good reason.
{87671}{87710}Tyrone, this is Travis.
{87716}{87816}You back out now, and I'll make sure|only your dentist can identify the body.
{87822}{87919}Is that a good enough reason for you?
{87936}{87972}But I need ammo.
{87978}{88025}I'm out of business without ammo.
{88031}{88063}I need the good stuff.
{88069}{88150}You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
{88156}{88191}"The good stuff." Jesus.
{88197}{88289}Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.
{88296}{88381}You look like I feel.
{88665}{88715}Have you got anything|I can put on my head?
{88721}{88753}There's a hat in the closet.
{88759}{88875}You're all heart. Here, I thought|you'd get all tender and maternal.
{88881}{88925}I was raised with four brothers.
{88931}{89039}We got hurt often, but if no bones were|broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.
{89045}{89076}Look, blood. See? Blood.
{89082}{89115}It's not gushing.
{89121}{89179}It was free flowing earlier.
{89185}{89335}Could you bring me a needle and thread?|Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.
{89367}{89401}Don't touch anything.
{89407}{89476}I wasn't.
{89481}{89558}What's with you?
{89925}{89961}What are you doing?
{89967}{90028}- I said not to touch anything.|- It came on by itself.
{90034}{90081}All by itself? What are you, a wise guy?
{90087}{90133}You don't like to share your toys, do you?
{90139}{90181}- This isn't a toy.|- What is it?
{90187}{90229}- This is a weapon.|- A weapon?
{90235}{90287}Used properly, a very effective weapon.
{90293}{90337}What, do you throw it at people?
{90343}{90407}You'll give yourself a hernia.|Come here. Sit down.
{90413}{90437}Right here.
{90443}{90546}- Take a little off the top...|- Right here.
{90641}{90690}Do you bring all your interrogations home?
{90696}{90751}- What are we talking about?|- It's back here.
{90757}{90796}- Careful, careful.|- Turn your head.
{90802}{90833}- Careful.|- This?
{90839}{90899}- This scratch?|- It feels like the Grand Canyon.
{90905}{90945}Oh, God.
{90951}{91004}Hold still.
{91010}{91085}Oh, God. We haven't even started.
{91091}{91133}Be gentle with me.
{91139}{91221}I see this isn't virgin territory.|What is this? A knife?
{91227}{91297}That's an ax.|Some guy mistook my head for a log.
{91303}{91366}- That's a natural mistake.|- What, I have a wooden head?
{91372}{91404}- Look at that.|- A knife.
{91410}{91453}Knife? That's very nice.
{91459}{91484}This is all right.
{91490}{91547}That's a pavement,|dragged down Crenshaw.
{91553}{91623}That's great. Look at that texture.|Look at this.
{91629}{91676}Same thing. Third and Highland.
{91682}{91746}- Dragged for about half a block.|- That's a good one.
{91752}{91803}Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.
{91809}{91854}- Moving truck.|- Moving truck?
{91860}{91880}Moving bullet.
{91886}{91959}- Moving bullet?|- Here. This is the best.
{91965}{92030}- It goes all the way through to the back.|- Right through?
{92036}{92073}You're lucky. Was it a.22?
{92079}{92113}It's a.38.
{92119}{92185}- It's a.38.|- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.
{92191}{92258}Yours is bigger than mine?|I don't think so.
{92264}{92293}Maybe not, but look.
{92299}{92368}A whole family of.44s on the back.
{92374}{92395}There they are.
{92401}{92427}That's impressive.
{92433}{92511}One hit my lung. I was breathing|blood bubbles. It was disgusting.
{92517}{92545}Blood bubbles. Okay.
{92551}{92595}You got one?
{92601}{92679}Pump-action. 12-gauge.
{92695}{92750}Right down here. Went through.
{92756}{92790}- That must have hurt.|- Right.
{92796}{92816}Not too close.
{92822}{92874}Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
{92880}{92936}I can beat it.
{92942}{92999}- I'll take your word for it.|- You gotta see this.
{93005}{93049}- I believe you.|- This guy had a knife.
{93055}{93153}You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg|and ran it around eight times.
{93159}{93207}- I'll take your word for it.|- Look!
{93213}{93244}No, I said forget it.
{93250}{93284}This is a blue-ribbon event.
{93290}{93335}Forget it.
{93341}{93368}You started this.
{93374}{93435}- Yeah, I can end it.|- You know what?
{93441}{93511}You're a very poor loser.
{93514}{93537}I didn't lose.
{93543}{93596}- Yes, you did.|- No, I didn't lose.
{93602}{93631}- You lost.|- I conceded.
{93637}{93693}There's a difference between losing|and conceding.
{93699}{93742}You conceded or you're conceited?
{93748}{93788}- You think I'm conceited?|- Yeah.
{93794}{93839}Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
{93845}{93874}I'll get you a Band-Aid.
{93880}{93981}- Tell me you lost.|- I said don't touch anything...
{94235}{94311}You're going to smack|the shit out of me, right?
{94317}{94399}I can do better than that.
{94773}{94846}This could be a serious ethical breach here.
{94852}{94907}I never made it|with another sergeant before.
{94913}{94979}Shut up, Riggs.
{95814}{95909}{y:i}I'm as hungry as a whale.|{y:i}Bring on the food.
{95922}{95965}He's got a sense of humor.
{95971}{96054}Watch this. This is a good bit.
{96151}{96239}I think you're gonna get on just fine.
{96357}{96442}If you could pry yourself away|from doggie heaven, I'm finished out here.
{96448}{96559}- You wanna take a look?|- Sure. Let's go outside for some air.
{96611}{96643}One for you.
{96649}{96681}One for you. No favorites.
{96687}{96740}I just have to finish the flashing here...
{96746}{96806}...and the roofing shingles|about another few bundles.
{96812}{96864}Unless it rains, it should hold up all right.
{96870}{96935}That's comforting.
{97003}{97071}I like a man who takes pride in his work.
{97077}{97118}Do you know where I can find one?
{97124}{97175}Like trying to find a cop|when you need one.
{97181}{97215}We're not mind readers.
{97221}{97263}You have to have a mind to read.
{97269}{97293}Read it and weep.
{97299}{97359}With these prices|you're promoting graft in the port.
{97365}{97466}If there's anybody|who knows about graft, it's you.
{97467}{97540}- Hi, Martin.|- How are you doing?
{97546}{97578}- Hi, Mickey.|- Hi, Rianne.
{97584}{97638}What are you doing here?
{97644}{97676}Or shouldn't I ask?
{97682}{97728}You got a sink to unplug?
{97734}{97773}- I got your sink.|- Good. Go do it.
{97779}{97849}I'll see you next week.
{97958}{98000}What's up?
{98006}{98049}Dad didn't come home last night.
{98055}{98129}He always comes home.
{98857}{98939}Oh, damn, Riggs.
{98961}{98987}What do you want?
{98993}{99043}I just wanted to see how you were doing.
{99049}{99094}Who sent you? Trish?
{99100}{99154}You're doing pretty well.|Trish didn't send me.
{99160}{99218}Rianne came to see me.|She asked me to find you.
{99224}{99246}To your place?
{99252}{99281}Well, that's where I am.
{99287}{99379}- My daughter came to your trailer?|- Yeah.
{99385}{99487}- My daughter came to your trailer?|- Come on, she was worried.
{99493}{99534}Get off of my boat, Riggs!
{99540}{99582}- Come on.|- Get off my boat!
{99588}{99621}You're drunk.
{99627}{99677}That's something you should know about.
{99683}{99745}- This isn't going to do you any good.|- Give me that.
{99751}{99773}Give me that.
{99779}{99821}Roger, please don't do this.
{99827}{99901}You got three days until you retire.|This won't do you any good.
{99907}{99969}You self-righteous bastard! Give it...
{99975}{100016}Don't do this, okay? Please?
{100022}{100077}Give it to me, damn it.
{100083}{100167}What are you going to do now, shoot me?
{100173}{100192}There.
{100198}{100259}Take your finger out of my bottle.|Give me that gun.
{100265}{100319}The bottle's going sailing.
{100325}{100399}Son of a bitch!
{100468}{100501}Not bad for an old man.
{100507}{100533}Are you finished?
{100539}{100603}No, I got another bottle in the galley|and I'll get it.
{100609}{100633}No, you're not.
{100639}{100686}Don't do this to yourself.
{100692}{100757}You gotta cut this out.
{100763}{100821}Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
{100827}{100903}Come on. Sit down.
{100914}{100951}- You hit me.|- Cool it, will you?
{100957}{100999}Cut it out. Give it up, okay?
{101005}{101029}Go ahead.
{101035}{101077}Go ahead. Hit me again.
{101083}{101142}I don't want to hit you.|You think I like this shit?
{101148}{101209}Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you...
{101215}{101273}- I know you're not.|...and that kung-fu shit?
{101279}{101331}Please, Rog.
{101337}{101417}That kid was a killer, all right.|That wasn't a toy in his hand.
{101423}{101506}That was a machine pistol|with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
{101512}{101595}He would have drilled you, me,|anybody that came along.
{101601}{101637}You had no choice.
{101643}{101695}It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.
{101701}{101733}It happened to me!
{101739}{101789}My God, I killed that kid!
{101795}{101825}I killed that boy.
{101831}{101875}You've killed a lot of people.
{101881}{101961}You've killed a fucking lot of people!|You don't kill a baby.
{101967}{102042}You've got ice in your veins.|You don't kill a boy like Nick.
{102048}{102083}You selfish bastard!
{102089}{102129}You selfish bastard!
{102135}{102189}You're just thinking about yourself.
{102195}{102237}What about me?
{102243}{102313}We're partners. We are partners.
{102319}{102359}What happens to you, happens to me.
{102365}{102441}After all the shit we've been through,|don't you get it?
{102447}{102497}Don't you get it?
{102503}{102582}When you retire, you're not just|retiring you, you're retiring us.
{102588}{102639}- You're retiring us.|- That's not my problem.
{102645}{102663}Yes, it is.
{102669}{102732}- It's not my problem.|- You're the only family I've got.
{102738}{102808}I've got three beautiful kids.|I love them and they're yours.
{102814}{102889}Trish does my laundry.|I live in your icebox. I live in your life!
{102895}{102929}What am I going to do?
{102935}{102969}- I don't care.|- Yes, you do.
{102975}{103007}- I don't care.|- Yes, you do.
{103013}{103038}I don't care!
{103044}{103067}Yes, you do!
{103073}{103117}- I don't care.|- You do so.
{103123}{103195}I don't care!
{103281}{103387}I don't know what I'm saying anymore.|I don't know what I'm thinking.
{103393}{103483}I had three days, and now this.
{103487}{103513}I'm sorry.
{103519}{103614}- That's all right.|- No, I'm really sorry.
{103620}{103703}I didn't realize that my retirement|was gonna screw you up.
{103709}{103818}Forget it. I haven't got any problems.|I was out of line saying that shit.
{103824}{103877}Look, man...
{103883}{103951}Riggs, look...
{103952}{104001}You know I love you.
{104007}{104133}You know I love you, Riggs.|And your problems are my problems.
{104139}{104205}Like you said, "What happens to you...
{104211}{104263}...happens to me." So try me.
{104269}{104312}I'm here for you.
{104318}{104380}I haven't got any problems.
{104386}{104482}Yes, you do. We all have problems.|You help me...
{104488}{104565}...and I'm gonna help you.
{104599}{104685}I do have a little problem.
{104685}{104747}You don't want to hear it.|This is piddly shit.
{104753}{104794}Yes, I do. I want to hear it.
{104800}{104846}- Tell me.|- This is ridiculous.
{104852}{104921}- You don't want to hear it.|- No. I'm here.
{104927}{104971}Well...
{104977}{105109}I think maybe I slept with someone|that I probably shouldn't have.
{105119}{105191}You son of a bitch!
{105327}{105350}Help me.
{105356}{105409}I ought to let you drown, you traitor.
{105415}{105440}Help me.
{105446}{105520}Come on in.
{105582}{105612}What did you hit me for?
{105618}{105694}'Cause you slept with Rianne.
{105700}{105720}I did not.
{105726}{105807}- Who did you sleep with?|- I slept with Sergeant Cole.
{105813}{105849}Sergeant Cole from Traffic?
{105855}{105902}No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.
{105908}{105978}Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic|is her uncle.
{105984}{106083}- Okay. That's okay.|- Oh, I don't know.
{106113}{106141}Sheriff's Department.
{106147}{106167}Sheriff...

{106237}{106297}What are you boys doing down there?
{106303}{106361}- We're in the middle of a case.|- Yeah.
{106367}{106431}Of Scotch.
{106448}{106525}Let's get out of here.
{106851}{106931}Go with the grain.
{106976}{107053}I'll show you. Here.
{107075}{107159}You're going against the grain.
{107235}{107305}- Like that.|- Okay.
{107439}{107503}Are you okay?
{107545}{107631}Darryl was my friend, Dad.
{107635}{107712}I know. I'm sorry, son.
{107718}{107793}I hope you don't blame me.
{107799}{107857}I don't blame you, Dad.

{108001}{108075}What's this right here?
{108189}{108263}I love you, Dad.
{108299}{108379}I love you, son.
{108835}{108919}"May he find the peace in Heaven|that eluded him on Earth."
{108925}{108965}"And may the scourge of violence...
{108971}{109054}...claiming the lives of our children|be lifted by Your grace...
{109060}{109115}...and infinite wisdom."

{109823}{109887}Wait here.
{109995}{110026}Mrs. Smithers...
{110032}{110095}Ma'am?
{110143}{110217}I just don't know...
{110339}{110395}You want to do something,|Sergeant Murtaugh?

{110439}{110529}...that put the gun in my son's hand.
{110933}{111011}Take your mama to the car.
{111095}{111134}Are you okay?
{111140}{111178}Yeah.
{111184}{111254}Who's got the gun?
{111263}{111341}- You got it.|- Yeah.
{111479}{111579}- Where did this gun come from?|- Fuck you!
{111585}{111665}Ever heard of the word "genocide"?|Have you, stupid motherfucker?
{111671}{111710}Have you ever heard of genocide?
{111716}{111776}You fools are killing yourselves!|You're killing us!
{111782}{111825}I'm tired of it!
{111831}{111911}You'd better tell me where this|comes from or I'll blow your head off.
{111917}{112009}I want to know, now!|Where did it come from?
{112124}{112234}Do you see this gun? I want to know|where it came from. Now!
{112240}{112268}I want a name!
{112274}{112344}Do you see that car?|I want a name, asshole!
{112350}{112402}I want a name! I want a name now!
{112408}{112422}One!

{112463}{112516}Ready?
{112525}{112611}Watch your hands.|That tire will rip them right off.
{112617}{112659}- Two!|- I'm getting excited.

{112715}{112840}- Your face is going to be a skidmark!|- No!
{112840}{112885}It's Jack Travis!
{112891}{112925}That's what I wanted, baby.
{112931}{112985}Three!
{113025}{113090}Wrong...
{113132}{113209}Women drivers, baby.
{113306}{113353}We're looking for your friend, Travis.
{113359}{113410}I've never heard of him.
{113416}{113449}Wrong answer.
{113455}{113500}You're pulling on the wrong string.
{113506}{113548}That's not a very professional attitude.
{113554}{113582}Who the fuck are you guys?
{113588}{113613}Sorry, LAPD.
{113619}{113720}We're doing a few routine inquiries.|Have you been checked for lumps recently?
{113726}{113758}Give me my fucking wallet!

{113802}{113830}My fucking wallet!
{113836}{113914}Get up! We don't need this.
{113920}{114020}We have a license that belongs to Hubert|Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.
{114026}{114044}Fuck you!
{114050}{114127}Hey, there's a lady here.
{114146}{114220}What the hell's going on here?
{114226}{114277}- Maybe they know something.|- I'll go find out.
{114283}{114379}- Want me to come with you?|- No, I got it.
{114391}{114427}Maybe I should go with her.
{114433}{114510}No, I want you to see something.|She has a gift. Watch this.
{114516}{114565}Good morning, gentlemen. LAPD.
{114571}{114601}I've got a few questions.
{114607}{114636}Are you on parole?
{114642}{114703}- I got a job...|- Who asked you?
{114709}{114752}Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?
{114758}{114788}You got a warrant?
{114794}{114829}No, but I can get one.
{114835}{114861}Until you do...
{114867}{114898}...fuck off.
{114904}{114956}That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.
{114962}{114994}Fuck you.
{115000}{115070}I don't think so.
{115116}{115183}Backspin kick.
{115379}{115407}Are you okay, honey?
{115413}{115476}Just great.
{115598}{115638}- "Honey"?|- How are you doing?
{115644}{115681}This guy's on parole.
{115687}{115729}This guy's an asshole!
{115735}{115827}- Riggs, there's five of them.|- I know.
{115847}{115912}Look at that.
{116075}{116147}Grabbed his clusters!
{116164}{116206}Let me help her.
{116212}{116275}Stay still.
{116554}{116618}My girl.
{116634}{116724}This PMS is murder.
{116724}{116756}I know what you mean.
{116762}{116822}I've been married 25 years.
{116828}{116872}So, tell me about Travis.
{116878}{116945}I told you before, moron,|I don't know Jack Travis.
{116951}{116991}I didn't say his name was Jack.
{116997}{117086}You better start telling me|more than jackshit.
{117134}{117216}- Men cross the street when they see me.|- I didn't have enough time.
{117222}{117310}I'm not your enemy, Captain.|I'm just trying to do my job.
{117316}{117384}- Have you eaten?|- I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.
{117390}{117439}- What, do you eat alone?|- I'm used to it.
{117445}{117479}It's bad for the digestion.
{117485}{117590}Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,|but I'm not paying.
{117714}{117764}Are you all right?
{117770}{117836}Two fingers, Murph.
{117842}{117964}- Jack, what the fuck?|- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.
{118086}{118150}After watching Lorna|handle herself so well...
{118156}{118209}...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.
{118215}{118257}Want to try it sometime?
{118263}{118302}- No.|- Come on.
{118308}{118365}You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
{118371}{118420}"Old dog", my ass.
{118426}{118506}Let's try something. Watch this.|It's called a backspin kick.
{118512}{118561}Pivot on the right, kick with your left...
{118567}{118638}...and you whip that head around|to catch the target over there.
{118644}{118703}Like this. Get that head around|and follow through.
{118709}{118730}Like so.
{118736}{118796}So you whip the head.
{118802}{118836}All right?
{118842}{118910}Thank you. Now you try it.
{118916}{118960}Here's your target. All right?
{118966}{119064}Remember, pivot right, kick left,|get that head around, spot that target.
{119070}{119125}- Like that.|- Yeah. Follow the head around.
{119131}{119197}Back up a bit. We don't want you|to bump into the pole.
{119203}{119269}Just back up a little bit.|A little bit more. Okay, good.
{119275}{119320}Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.
{119326}{119362}Okay.
{119368}{119424}Go.
{119577}{119606}He can't hold his water.
{119612}{119654}Get back to work!
{119660}{119706}Okay, back to work, everybody.
{119712}{119810}Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.
{119811}{119889}Sergeant Murtaugh,|you could be experiencing...
{119895}{119981}...some transitional anger|caused by the shooting.
{119987}{120046}Do you want to talk about it?
{120052}{120117}- He's okay for a change.|- Are you sure?
{120123}{120204}You look good in red. That's your color.
{120210}{120330}- I've got a little extra time now.|- I'm fine, Doctor.
{120427}{120452}Oh, shit!
{120458}{120502}Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
{120508}{120528}What?
{120534}{120568}It's her.
{120574}{120672}Can you tell me where I can find|the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?
{120678}{120714}Hi, skinny!
{120720}{120771}- Delores. Remember me?|- I remember you.
{120777}{120848}Can you tell me where I can find|the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
{120854}{120978}Actually, he's cowering down|on all fours right behind this counter.
{121008}{121081}- Where is the sergeant?|- He's not here right now.
{121087}{121141}But he's talked of nothing but you all week.
{121147}{121170}Shut my mouth.
{121176}{121206}The man's on fire.
{121212}{121264}- What's the matter, baby?|- A little sciatica.
{121270}{121330}You tell him Delores was here.
{121336}{121375}You tell that man...
{121381}{121453}...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.
{121459}{121530}I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.
{121536}{121596}See you.
{121601}{121669}Delores says|you're "the jam in her jellyroll".
{121675}{121714}I heard.
{121720}{121762}That's a lot of woman.
{121768}{121800}She calls me all the time.
{121806}{121858}She leaves me notes.|What am I going to do?
{121864}{121902}You shouldn't have led her on.
{121908}{122003}Led her on? I didn't do anything.
{122055}{122115}Sergeant, we have got to talk.
{122121}{122184}You've got to come see me.
{122190}{122248}We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.
{122254}{122339}- Thanks anyway, for your concern.|- Thanks, Doc. You're a beauty.
{122345}{122423}- Coming?|- Yeah, I'm coming.
{122583}{122659}Good afternoon, Captain.
{122671}{122767}That's good. See how easy that was?
{122837}{122880}I love it down here. Don't you?
{122886}{123008}This place is better than the swap meet.|Best bargains in town.
{123079}{123130}Give me the lock-up keys.
{123136}{123198}Those guys from the garage,|they're all ex-cons.
{123204}{123305}They were all busted by the same|police officer, Jack Edward Travis.
{123311}{123365}Early paroles|on the work-furlough program.
{123371}{123446}Employed by a company called|Mesa Verde Construction.
{123452}{123514}You can't go in there.|You don't have a pass.
{123520}{123561}- May I see your pass?|- My pass?
{123567}{123589}Here's my fucking pass.
{123595}{123658}- I got shot in the line of duty.|- He's with us.
{123664}{123697}- "He's with us"?|- I said that?
{123703}{123734}Where'd you get her from?
{123740}{123777}Why aren't you in the hospital?
{123783}{123842}Don't mention it.|I told you not to leave me there.
{123848}{123916}They tried to take my appendix out.|They gave me a lapotomy.
{123922}{123961}- Brain surgery?|- A lapotomy.
{123967}{124018}Not a lobotomy.|Cut your hair so you can hear.
{124024}{124058}What's the difference?
{124064}{124145}The difference is, for a lapotomy,|they shave your nether regions.
{124151}{124183}Nether what?
{124189}{124243}Nether... I can't say it in front of her.
{124249}{124296}Point to it.
{124302}{124331}- Here.|- It must be itchy.
{124337}{124397}It is itchy. These doctors are savages.
{124403}{124519}Where does it say that a gunshot wound|requires a rectal exam?
{124543}{124605}Yeah. With a telescope big enough|to see Venus.
{124611}{124654}I guess all they saw was Uranus.
{124660}{124709}That's great. Thank you.
{124715}{124746}You know what I say?
{124752}{124837}They fuck you in the hospital.|First they drug you, then they fuck you!
{124843}{124873}When they're done...
{124879}{124952}...the insurance company comes|and fucks you some more!
{124958}{125033}$10 for a fucking aspirin|and it isn't even covered!
{125039}{125063}That's enough!
{125069}{125101}We're trying to work here.
{125107}{125177}So, what's new on our case?|Anything new? You got Travis yet?
{125183}{125215}Did you guys advertise?
{125221}{125281}- He's family.|- Who's she?
{125287}{125335}- Sergeant Cole.|- How are you? Leo Getz.
{125341}{125398}- Anything you need, Leo "gets". Get it?|- I get it.
{125404}{125433}It's real estate now...
{125439}{125495}Listen, come on, you guys,|give me a break.
{125501}{125551}I owe this guy one.|Give me something to do.
{125557}{125593}You can get us a cup of coffee.
{125599}{125685}That's great. I take one for you|and that's what you tell me?
{125691}{125783}- He could check this out.|- That's all I'm good for?
{125789}{125828}We've got something for you to do.
{125834}{125925}Check out Mesa Verde Construction.|Find out all the information you can.
{125931}{125990}- Sure, I can do this.|- Can you remember that name?
{125996}{126033}Mesa Verde, I got it.
{126039}{126133}- Wait. What are you doing?|- If there's any shit there, he'll find it.
{126139}{126222}- Who is that guy?|- It's a long story.
{126343}{126392}Here are your keys, Captain.
{126398}{126422}You motherfucker!
{126428}{126472}- Don't be stupid.|- What the fuck?
{126478}{126583}Take the elevator, get the other guys.|Keys. Give me those fucking hands.
{126589}{126683}Goddamn you, Travis. What the fuck?
{126687}{126768}Stand there.
{126821}{126887}I can get faster results|than that real estate broker.
{126893}{126949}Leo's not just a real estate broker.
{126955}{127044}He's a pain in the ass|with a lot of connections.
{127050}{127133}This is what we came for.|Load everything on the elevator.
{127139}{127198}- How'd you know where to find them?|- We got it all.
{127204}{127241}The world of computers.
{127247}{127317}You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.
{127323}{127398}You know what future a cop has? None.
{127404}{127475}Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
{127481}{127518}Pension.
{127524}{127546}Nothing to do.
{127552}{127632}Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain|by evening. Not for this kid.
{127638}{127687}Police Department's got it all:
{127693}{127729}Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.
{127735}{127817}It's a one-stop shopping center|if you've got the balls and the brains.
{127823}{127864}Not a thing anybody can do about it.
{127870}{127922}You're already fucking history|and you know it.
{127928}{127983}Sorry. I'm just getting started.
{127989}{128035}Something's wrong.
{128041}{128103}The program's been accessed|by someone from the outside.
{128109}{128142}What's been accessed?
{128148}{128238}After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs|moved the confiscated ammunition.
{128244}{128274}Armor-piercing bullets?
{128280}{128350}Thousands of rounds|to a more secure location.
{128356}{128414}- That's what's been accessed.|- Someone else knows.
{128420}{128489}Where's this store? Where'd they move it?
{128495}{128529}Let's go.
{128535}{128597}- I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.|- That's a switch.
{128603}{128646}- Right here in the building.|- Where?
{128652}{128698}- I'm showing you.|- Something's going down.
{128704}{128754}- Nothing's going down.|- I'm going with you.
{128760}{128814}- How old are you?|- Twenty-two today.
{128820}{128841}Come on.
{128847}{128881}Have you got protection?
{128887}{128950}- Right here in my wallet.|- No, your vest, you dummy.
{128956}{128988}Should we take him?
{128994}{129063}- Okay, but keep your head down.|- Stay behind me.
{129069}{129150}Come on, let's go. Quiet!
{129417}{129462}You were my ticket in.
{129468}{129564}It's too bad you won't be coming with me.
{129657}{129719}They got it all.
{129725}{129780}- He's dead.|- How'd they get it out of here?
{129786}{129836}- I don't know.|- Not upstairs.
{129842}{129912}Elevator.
{129948}{129980}Shit. It's down.
{129986}{130015}The subway's down there.
{130021}{130069}- Let's take the stairs.|- LA has subways?
{130075}{130158}- Where've you been?|- Read something besides the comics.
{130164}{130252}All right. Come on, let's hustle!
{130279}{130351}Hurry up, guys.
{130629}{130661}LAPD! Come here!
{130667}{130723}Come here! Step on it!
{130729}{130759}Son of a bitch!
{130765}{130815}Did you see anybody or anything strange?
{130821}{130933}- Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.|- Split now. Just get out of here.
{130939}{131017}- I'm going across.|- I got it.
{131144}{131228}Get rid of Murphy, now!
{131327}{131432}Where the fuck do you think you're going?|Let's go.
{131676}{131750}Let's get out of here.
{131752}{131815}Cover me.
{132271}{132335}Let's go.
{132547}{132619}Stay still.
{132823}{132897}Happy birthday, kid.
{133490}{133560}Another baby.
{133832}{133870}Is he dead? Check the body.
{133876}{133946}Get me out of here!
{134020}{134090}Stupid son of a bitch!
{134345}{134366}Stop that.
{134372}{134393}Cut it out.
{134399}{134438}- Don't shoot.|- LAPD!
{134444}{134472}Where does this lead?
{134478}{134511}- Pico Station.|- Thanks.
{134517}{134541}Not that way.
{134547}{134635}Take the stairs, it's faster.
{134928}{134992}Gangway!
{135144}{135224}Get out of the way!
{135259}{135293}Holy shit!
{135299}{135337}Son of a bitch!
{135343}{135408}Police!
{135539}{135620}Step on it. There he is.
{135628}{135692}Goddamn!
{135779}{135864}Put your foot down!
{136471}{136501}Police!
{136507}{136531}I need your bike.
{136537}{136572}This is bullshit.
{136578}{136695}Sergeant Riggs, call it in.|I need a couple of clips, too.
{137031}{137107}Okay, we lost him.
{137244}{137301}Where's Riggs?

{142324}{142408}- Are you okay?|- I'm okay.
{142495}{142530}- I'm having that.|- You quit!

{143050}{143093}- How'd you find us?|- Police scanner.
{143099}{143169}What are you doing with a police scanner?
{143175}{143258}Hello, Car 54, where are you?|I cracked this case for you guys.
{143264}{143305}Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
{143311}{143367}They got a housing project,|called Rancho Arroyo.

{143962}{143990}Where's Lorna?
{143996}{144080}I can't believe you did that!
{144099}{144125}I can't believe it.
{144131}{144201}How could you do that to me?
{144207}{144233}Did you see that?
{144239}{144321}They're my partners.|I can't believe they did that!
{144327}{144401}Do you own your own home?
{145172}{145234}- Looks like we came to the right place.|- Yeah.
{145240}{145286}Move on out to Travis Town.
{145292}{145349}Great place to raise a family.
{145355}{145405}Built on guns and bloodshed.
{145411}{145468}One hell of a retirement plan|this asshole's got.
{145474}{145545}Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
{145551}{145603}- Say, is that...|- Darryl's gun.
{145609}{145672}- I've been saving it for the right occasion.|- This is it.
{145678}{145733}- How many men do you think he has?|- Who knows?
{145739}{145786}Maybe I should run over there|and ask him?
{145792}{145821}That'd be too easy.
{145827}{145886}Wish I had some grenades|or a rocket launcher.
{145892}{145946}Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
{145952}{146048}I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.
{146060}{146125}It's obvious Murphy|was never a Boy Scout.
{146131}{146216}Not even a good spare.
{146263}{146297}Put your hands down...
{146303}{146377}...it's embarrassing.
{146387}{146414}How are you doing?
{146420}{146440}Kissing.
{146446}{146476}Fresh ones?
{146482}{146522}Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
{146528}{146561}No points for those.
{146567}{146631}- How'd you get here?|- Drove.
{146637}{146715}I ran into Leo at the police station.|He talked to me first.
{146721}{146773}- Any ideas?|- Lucky thing we've got a plan.
{146779}{146813}Lucky thing. What is it?
{146819}{146874}I want it to be a surprise.
{146880}{146955}I like surprises.
{147051}{147119}Move it!
{147139}{147220}- Check it out.|- Let's go.
{147609}{147679}- Look what they did to Murph's car.|- It could've been worse.
{147685}{147765}- It could've been yours.|- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.
{147771}{147800}- On three.|- Three.
{147806}{147857}Three?
{147863}{147912}One...
{147918}{147942}...two...|- Three!
{147948}{148011}Police! Freeze!
{148020}{148083}Oh, shit!
{148295}{148375}- Let's go!|- Right now!
{148523}{148589}What's wrong with you?|I said go on three, not two.
{148595}{148623}On three.
{148629}{148657}It's always three.
{148663}{148702}Boys!
{148708}{148815}What are we doing here?|Losing our heads in a crisis?
{148855}{148927}Cover me!
{149359}{149424}Exxon.
{149499}{149537}- What?|- Count to 20.
{149543}{149556}What?
{149562}{149651}Count to 20 and then light me.
{149724}{149783}Shit!
{149812}{149895}Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!
{150190}{150266}- Cover me.|- Cover you?
{150275}{150306}Cover you, cover Riggs.
{150312}{150407}When's someone gonna cover me|for a change?
{150491}{150590}What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it.
{150945}{151042}It's the cops. They're burning everything.
{151283}{151304}Son of a bitch!
{151310}{151386}Crazy motherfucker!
{151454}{151472}Damn!
{151478}{151567}Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!
{151920}{151972}You crazy son of a bitch!
{151978}{152039}Yeah!
{152387}{152479}Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.
{152541}{152573}Stay there.
{152579}{152651}Shit, where's Riggs?
{152954}{153031}Son of a bitch! No clip.
{153051}{153123}Lorna, no, don't!
{153252}{153294}Come on in, bitch.
{153300}{153364}The door's open!
{153906}{153991}I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!
{154610}{154684}Son of a bitch.
{154774}{154832}Shit!
{155135}{155180}Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.
{155186}{155243}Cop killers.
{155249}{155327}You're coming with me!
{155494}{155564}Fuck you, asshole!
{155974}{156025}Get up!
{156031}{156060}Get up!
{156066}{156165}Killed in the line of duty.
{156211}{156322}You'll get a great funeral|from the Department.
{156430}{156506}Cop killers.
{156753}{156829}Ex-cop killers.
{157043}{157110}Go to hell, Riggs.
{157116}{157182}You first.
{157402}{157472}Crazy son of a bitch!
{157578}{157674}Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
{157694}{157736}Just hold still.
{157742}{157795}Get a chopper, man.
{157801}{157853}She had two vests on.|She's gonna be okay.
{157859}{157912}A couple of bad ones.|We need to get a chopper.
{157918}{158013}You're all right, partner. Hang on.
{158019}{158089}It's okay. Just lie still.
{158095}{158172}Just a romantic evening by the fire,|just the two of us.
{158178}{158243}Just be still.
{158447}{158517}Honey, open your eyes.
{158523}{158591}Open your eyes.
{158647}{158697}What are you trying to prove out there?
{158703}{158745}Why do you do that?
{158751}{158831}- Can I take this off?|- Yeah.
{158843}{158975}You're supposed to grow old|with someone, not because of them.
{159079}{159125}I'm gonna be with you.
{159131}{159182}I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.
{159188}{159274}We're both here, right? Right.
{159278}{159322}Come on, I want to be with you.
{159328}{159392}What have you got to lose?
{159398}{159458}You.
{159471}{159539}Not likely.
{159631}{159705}- Hey, Lorna.|- Yeah?
{159742}{159826}Let's live to regret this.
{159902}{159941}- We've got to go, sir.|- Okay.
{159947}{160019}She's gonna be fine.
{160078}{160141}Can you hear me?
{160147}{160211}I love you.
{160592}{160704}"Happy retirement, Daddy"
{160710}{160809}"Happy retirement, Daddy"
{160815}{160881}This is it. This is the day.
{160887}{160911}Everybody? Daddy?
{160917}{160988}I want you to know there's a candle|for every year in the Force.
{160994}{161044}Yes! A lot of years.
{161050}{161142}- You have to blow it out.|- Come on.
{161163}{161181}I can't.
{161187}{161253}- Come on, blow it out.|- That's not what I mean.
{161259}{161294}What?
{161300}{161368}I can't retire.
{161374}{161453}I thought I could. I wanted to.
{161459}{161523}But I can't.
{161593}{161648}That means you're gonna|stay with the Force?
{161654}{161750}That means I'm staying|with the Force, baby.
{161774}{161889}This cake's about to explode,|so you'd better blow out these candles.
{161895}{161976}I want you to know|that I'm behind you all the way.
{161982}{162022}- Me, too.|- So am I, Dad.
{162028}{162050}It's okay.
{162056}{162176}Well, the streets will be safer|for another couple of years.
{162183}{162216}"Word", Nick?
{162222}{162287}"Word", Dad.
{162322}{162377}Blow them out!
{162383}{162409}Hello?
{162415}{162468}Hello! In here!
{162474}{162555}Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.
{162559}{162589}Oprah should see this.
{162595}{162648}I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
{162654}{162689}What is it?
{162695}{162781}Where's Riggs? I didn't know|he could hold his breath that long.
{162787}{162824}I'm taking a bath, Leo.
{162830}{162930}I can see that. And it's cold water, too.|There goes your image.
{162936}{162973}Listen, I got great news.
{162979}{163046}Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.
{163052}{163113}Okay, I have sold this turkey.
{163119}{163223}This termite-infested dump is now gone.|Okay?
{163229}{163322}All you have to do is sign the contract|before the suckers change their mind.
{163328}{163379}Okay? I did it!
{163385}{163420}The house is off the market.
{163426}{163515}We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested turkey"|for another ten years.
{163521}{163593}- At least.|- Maybe I'll get married here.
{163599}{163643}- Come on, out.|- You can't do this.
{163649}{163713}- Out.|- No, you can't do that.
{163719}{163783}You can't do that. I have contracts signed.
{163789}{163843}Because we're partners,|no commission. Okay?
{163849}{163866}Partners?
{163872}{163924}You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
{163930}{163949}Why?
{163955}{164030}Because bullets aren't covered|in normal road hazard. That's why!
{164036}{164084}I want those tires. No conditions.
{164090}{164122}Leo, get out of here!
{164128}{164177}- Don't tell me to get out!|- Out!
{164183}{164288}Okay, I'm going.|You're lucky your wife's here.
{164343}{164378}Don't come crying to me if...
{164384}{164401}Get out!
{164407}{164510}- Termites get...|- No more!
{164534}{164602}Your friends.
{164611}{164706}Ten more years till forced retirement.
{164707}{164809}That's 3,650 days.
{164815}{164897}- Forty-nine.|- Oh, yeah.
{165139}{165224}I gotta improve my image.
{165464}{165534}'Bye, Daddy!
{165559}{165627}'Bye, baby.
{165813}{165864}What are you smiling at?
{165870}{165908}Why weren't you at my party?
{165914}{165953}I knew you weren't going to retire.
{165959}{166050}I've been wrong about a few things|in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
{166056}{166101}Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
{166107}{166168}I'm smoking to forget|my dog-biscuit problem.
{166174}{166214}What dog-biscuit problem?
{166220}{166264}I've been chasing more cars lately...
{166270}{166348}...and when I try to lick my balls,|I keep falling off the couch.
{166354}{166382}Jesus Christ.
{166388}{166423}I'm driving. Other side.
{166429}{166501}I've got no dispute. I just came over|to open the door for you.
{166507}{166537}Thank you for opening it.
{166543}{166605}An old fella like you|needs all the help he can get.
{166611}{166637}I'll show you.
{166643}{166712}- Who's a grumpy bastard?|- I'm a grumpy bastard.
{166718}{166750}- You know something?|- What?
{166756}{166847}When I do retire,|I hope your next partner is just like you.
{166853}{166944}There's winners and there's losers,|and God wouldn't do that to me.
{166950}{166995}He did it to me.
{167001}{167052}I know.
{167058}{167128}See what I mean?
{167139}{167171}My point exactly.
{167177}{167249}Son of a bitch!
{167298}{167331}Stay away from my daughter!
{167337}{167393}You can't be serious?|What are you talking about?
{167399}{167431}I saw you kiss Rianne.
{167437}{167488}She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
{167494}{167564}- That's not the point!|- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
{167570}{167631}If it's just friendship,|try shaking hands next time.
{167637}{167719}- Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?|- I'm getting enough fiber!
{167725}{167752}I'm spoken for, okay?
{167758}{167826}I'm gonna pick Lorna up|from the hospital this afternoon.
{167832}{167862}We're practically...
{167868}{167925}- You're serious?|- We've got a dog and everything.
{167931}{167986}I figure I can make ends meet.
