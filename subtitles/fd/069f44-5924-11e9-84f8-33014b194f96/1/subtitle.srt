1
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,478
- Bull's-eye!
- You bet, Dad!

2
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,948
You go straight home.

3
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,030
Okay!

4
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,518
Bombs away!

5
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,990
JEDEDIAH:
Sayonara, sucker!

6
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,597
WATERSELLER:
No preservatives, just pure water!

7
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,110
WATERSELLER:
Cool, clear water.

8
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,755
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.

9
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,911
H20, that's my go.

10
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,068
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

11
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,993
What's a little fallout, huh?
Have a nice day!

12
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,553
COLLECTOR:
You get a sack of grain...

13
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,190
...or a woman for two hours.

14
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,716
COLLECTOR: What are you trading?
MAX: I'm looking for someone.

15
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,279
COLLECTOR:
Are you trading or not?

16
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,669
He had a team of camels.

17
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,631
COLLECTOR: People come here to trade,
make a little profit, do some business.

18
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,108
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

19
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,349
An hour inside.

20
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,594
- Next!
- I got skills I can trade.

21
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,237
Sorry. The brothel's full.

22
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,314
One hour.

23
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,472
- And if you find him?
- I'll ask him to return what's mine.

24
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,320
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

25
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,549
He will be.

26
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,672
You're that good?

27
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,799
Perhaps you have something to trade
after all.

28
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,269
Keep talking.

29
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,950
24 hours of your life.

30
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,994
In return,
you'll get back what was stolen.

31
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,073
Sounds like a bargain.

32
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,353
It's not. Let's talk.
Come inside.

33
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,429
COLLECTOR: Leave your weapons here.
It's the law.

34
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,152
DR. DEALGOOD: Remember, this is the
vehicle that sent Detroit broke.

35
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,512
MAX:
Where did you get these animals?

36
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,558
DR. DEALGOOD: The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

37
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,556
They've got independent suspension,
power steering and no emission control.

38
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,068
Ride them away now.

39
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,480
(SAXOPHONE PLA YS)

40
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,833
(SAXOPHONE PLA YS)

41
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,308
COLLECTOR:
A warrior, Aunty.

42
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,038
COLLECTOR: Lost everything.
Looking for a deal.

43
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,270
But he's just a raggedy man.

44
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,554
He's quick.

45
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,070
Ironbar...

46
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,959
...can he do it?

47
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,036
Maybe.

48
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,592
AUNTY:
What did you do before this?

49
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,990
I was a cop, a driver.

50
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,711
But how the world turns.

51
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,520
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

52
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,479
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

53
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,198
Do you know who I was?

54
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,035
Nobody.

55
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,877
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

56
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,274
This nobody had a chance to be somebody.

57
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,834
So much for history. Anyway...
Water? Fruit?

58
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,558
Congratulations. You're the first
to survive the audition.

59
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,035
Drink.

60
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,509
It's okay.

61
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,995
AUNTY:
Come with me.

62
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,359
AUNTY:
Look around. All this I built.

63
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,308
Up to my armpits in blood and shit.

64
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,590
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

65
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,431
Where there was robbery,
there's trade.

66
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,919
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

67
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,839
It's civilization.

68
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,715
I'll do anything to protect it.

69
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,676
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you say?

70
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,875
What do you pay?

71
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,112
I'll re-equip you...
Vehicles, animals. Fuel, if you want.

72
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,719
It's a generous offer.

73
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,077
Why me? You've got warriors,
weapons. Give the order.

74
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,034
We are dealing with subtleties here.

75
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,670
This is no enemy.
It's almost family.

76
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,072
I see, real civilized.

77
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,269
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

78
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,518
First, no one knows
you're working for Aunty.

79
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,910
You hit him, you go.

80
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,510
Second, it's a fair fight.

81
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,030
And third, it's to the death.

82
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,399
Who's the bunny?

83
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,395
It's called Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.

84
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,239
Oil, natural gas?

85
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,954
AUNTY:
Pigs.

86
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,112
MAX:
Pigs like those?

87
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,550
- Bullshit.
- Pigshit.

88
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,749
Pigshit. The lights,
the motors, the vehicles...

89
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,430
...all run by a high-powered gas
called methane.

90
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,589
Methane comes from pigshit.

91
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,634
Have a look.
Tell me what you see.

92
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,757
MAX: I see a big guy
giving a little guy a piggyback.

93
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,715
AUNTY:
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

94
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,916
They even share the same name.

95
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,755
COLLECTOR: The little one is called
Master. He's the brains.

96
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,957
He runs Underworld.

97
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,075
COLLECTOR: The other one is Blaster.
He's the muscle.

98
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,949
Together they can be very powerful.

99
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,750
They are also arrogant.

100
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,916
We want to keep the brain,
dump the body.

101
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,912
He's big. Is he good?

102
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,680
He can beat most men with his breath.

103
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,480
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?

104
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,553
- lt's a factory. Ask for work.
- I know nothing about methane.

105
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,711
You can shovel shit, can't you?

106
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,999
Hey, you!

107
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,914
MAX:
Let's talk!

108
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,593
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You don't want to end up like me.

109
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,513
MAX:
How long are you in for?

110
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,512
The big one. Life.

111
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,910
For killing a pig?

112
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,277
PIGKILLER:
I had to feed the kids.

113
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,599
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

114
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,757
MASTER:
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?

115
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,878
BLACKFINGER:
We got a real problem.

116
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,668
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.

117
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,155
You expert! Disarm!

118
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,709
Right.

119
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,718
It's a class job. One mistake,
it'll blow the crap out of this place.

120
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,309
- Literally.
- Think what to do!

121
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,555
Now...the dynamite is connected
to the timing device...

122
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,752
...which is connected to the switch,
which I can't find...

123
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,838
...which is connected to the...

124
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,235
...battery.

125
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,632
- I'll disconnect the battery!
- I wouldn't do that.

126
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,518
MASTER:
Who you?

127
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,352
- Me Max.
- You smart.

128
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,154
That's my vehicle.

129
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,350
Disarm!

130
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,830
How much?

131
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,991
No trade. Do!

132
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,675
Fetch!

133
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,911
Me order. Me Master!

134
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,516
Me run Bartertown!

135
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,998
That's why you live in shit.

136
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,271
Not shit! Energy!

137
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,474
Call it what you like,
it still smells like shit.

138
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,753
Not shit! Energy!
No energy, no town!

139
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,276
Me King Arab!

140
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,078
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

141
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,159
Embargo, on!

142
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,473
MASTER:
Embargo on! Main valve off!

143
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,077
Four, three, two...

144
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,518
(AUNTY OVER SPEAKER)
For God's sake, what now?

145
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,470
Who run Bartertown?

146
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,468
Damn it!
I told you, no more embargos.

147
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,916
More, Blaster.

148
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,719
Who run Bartertown?

149
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,113
(MASTER OVER SPEAKER)
Who run Bartertown?

150
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,392
You know who.

151
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,955
Say.

152
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,513
MasterBlaster.

153
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,435
Say loud.

154
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,228
MasterBlaster.

155
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,634
(MASTER OVER SPEAKER)
MasterBlaster what?

156
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,719
(AUNTY OVER SPEAKER)
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

157
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,393
(MASTER OVER SPEAKER)
Louder!

158
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,353
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

159
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,870
Lift embargo.

160
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,036
You want foot in face?

161
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,919
Disarm.

162
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,632
Good boy.

163
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,518
Over here, Blaster.

164
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,549
- What are you laying for?
- Nothing.

165
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,995
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

166
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,994
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!

167
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,476
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

168
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,431
- Deal.
- You said a fair fight.

169
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,956
- What does that mean?
- As provided by law.

170
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,595
Thunderdome.

171
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,032
AUNTY: Two men, hand-to-hand.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.

172
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,277
Two men enter, one man leaves.

173
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,309
Weapons?

174
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,672
Anything's possible.
Chance decides.

175
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,874
Thunderdome.
How do I get in there?

176
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,475
That's easy. Pick a fight.

Fighting leads to killing,

356
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,591
Then Captain Walker picked them
of an age and good for a long haul.

357
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,517
They counted twenty, and that were them.
The great leaving.

They said bidey-bye to them

And from the nothing
they looked back...

363
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,669
...and Captain Walker hollered,
"Wait, one of us will come."

364
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,919
"Wait, one of us will come."

365
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,275

(KIDS CHANT)
Walker.

367
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,390
We's heartful to you,
Captain Walker.

368
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,234
We's ready now. Take us home.

369
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,273
We kept it straight!
Everything marked, everything 'membered!

370
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,120

You ain't been slack.

MR. SKYFISH: Quit joshing!

373
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,954
- Catch the wind.
- We got to see Tomorrow-morrow Land!

374
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,390
Home! Tomorrow-morrow Land!

375
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,040
There were places like these.
Cities.

376
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,350
They were called cities.

377
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,919
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers...

378
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,870
...videos and they had the sonic.

379
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,319
Then this happened.

380
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,639
This Pox-Eclipse happened, and it's
finished. It isn't there anymore.

381
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,557
You got to understand
that this is home...

382
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,914
...and there's no Tomorrow Land...

383
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,152
...and I ain't Captain Walker.

384
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,312

TUBBA:
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.

386
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,638
MR. SKYFISH: We got the wind
up our arse, Captain. Let's go!

387
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,436
Who's coming?
We's pulling a leaving.

388
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,788
There ain't gonna be no leavings.
All that's just jerking time.

389
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,268
We's working it different.

390
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,638
Ain't you seen nothing?
He couldn't catch the wind.

391
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,838
There weren't no skyrafting.
There won't be no salvage.

392
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,833
This is our Tomorrow-morrow Land.
He's proof of that.

393

Program! All of you program.
If he ain't Captain Walker, who is he?

394
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,239
SA VANNAH: He ain't no different
to us. He slogged it on foot.

395
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,070
If he can get here,
we can get back.

396
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,992
He ain't much bigger than us.

397
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,629
Copilot did it.
So why can't we?

398
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,110
That's the trick of it.
Who's coming?

399
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,117
Across the nothing?
Don't you 'member?

400
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,632
When you finded him,
he were half jumped by Mr. Dead.

401
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,553
Nobody's saying
it ain't a hard slog.

402
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,479
If we wants the knowing,
it ain't an easy ride.

403
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,517
SLAKE:
There ain't no knowing!

404
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,958
There ain't no skyraft and no sonic.
You slog out there to nothing!

Worse than nothing.

406

The first place you'll find
is a sleaze pit called Bartertown.

that place will.

who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket.

414
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,869
And I say we're gonna stay here.

and we'll be thankful.

One...

526
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,234
What happened to two?

This is a stickup!

528

Anybody moves, and they're dead meat!

529

I think we're all dead meat!

Which way did he go?

533
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,798
I warned you, Dad!

534
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,632
- You!
- Me?

535
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,232
You. It's your lucky day.

I have?

539
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,473
It might save your life.

540
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,908

SA VANNAH:
This you knows. The years travel fast.

557
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,719
And time after time
I've done the Tell.

558
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,988
But this ain't one body's Tell.
It's the Tell of us all.

559
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,080
And you got to listen it and 'member.

560
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:23,037
'Cause what you hears today,
you got to tell the newborn tomorrow.

561
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,554
I's looking behind us now,
into history back.

562
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,833
I sees those of us that got the luck
and started the haul for home.

563
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:37,035
It lead us here and we was heartful
'cause we seen what there once was.

564
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,311
One look, and we knewed
we'd got it straight.

565
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,072
Those what had gone before had knowing
of things beyond our reckoning...

566
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,351
...even beyond our dreaming.

567
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,513
Time counts and keeps counting.

568
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,878
And we knows now...

569
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:59,034
...finding the trick of what's
been and lost ain't no easy ride.

570
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,877
But that's our track.
We got to travel it.

571
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,919
And there ain't nobody knows
where it's gonna lead.

572
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,715
Still and all, every night
we does the Tell...

573
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,874
...so that we 'member who we was
and where we came from.

574
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,036
But most of all we 'members
the man who finded us...

575
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,591
...him that came the salvage.

576
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,957
And we lights the city.
Not just for him...

577
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,834
...but for all of them
that are still out there.

578
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,874
'Cause we knows
there'll come a night...

579
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,316
... when they sees the distant light...

580
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,511
...and they'll be coming home.
