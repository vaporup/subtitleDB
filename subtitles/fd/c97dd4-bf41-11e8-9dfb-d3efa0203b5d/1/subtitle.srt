1
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:18,240
Work harder! Keep on!

2
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:18,399
Cut!

3
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:22,866
Wake up! Even extras are actors.

4
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,170
We're not making a ghost film now.

5
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:27,940
Though you guys
play the roles of pedestrians,

6
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,845
but your roles still have life an soul.

7
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:35,614
Especially we've chance to act with
the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu...

8
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:37,620
so we should grasp this chance.

9
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:39,520
Act smartly, OK?

10
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:43,386
Action!

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Cut!

12
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,431
- Who are you?
- I'm an actor.

13
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,834
Aunt Ha!

14
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:54,869
Yes.

15
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:55,999
- Who is this guy?
- An extra.

16
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,073
I'm an actor.

17
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,074
Are you mistaken?

18
00:01:58,178 --> 00:01:59,839
How can you let him touch my machine?

19
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,742
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
I just went to toilet.

20
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,711
so I asked him to do the rehearsal.

21
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,308
Find someone who knows how to act,
we need one urgently.

22
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:08,954
- Let me do it.
- You?

23
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,752
Show me the expression of "nervous".

24
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,459
There're several kinds
of nervous expression.

25
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:16,526
The one on the face of a husband
whose wife is delivering a baby.

26
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,762
The baby is given birth.
But the wife is dead.

27
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,767
The baby calls him dad, he's a genius.

28
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,366
His dick is on his head, he's abnormal.

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,607
He wins Mark Six... first prize!

30
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,673
His son is dead...

31
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:34,875
His wife comes back to life.

32
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,482
His wife comes back to life.

33
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:38,810
No more response,
if one is struck too hard emotionally...

34
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:42,681
he will enter a state of mental coma,
he'll show no response.

35
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:44,714
Is there another guy?

36
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,658
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,918
I don't know what you were doing.

38
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,192
Was there anything wrong
with my expression?

39
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,025
I've said I didn't know
what you were doing.

40
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:56,693
Aunt Ha, none of your extras
is smart enough.

41
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:58,098
All these extras are above standard.

42
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:01,002
Sunny, is it done?

43
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,335
Everyone is waiting.

44
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,568
OK... Director, it'll soon be done...

45
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,873
- You, go and change your clothes.
- Thanks.

46
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,148
- Stand in this position.
- Got it.

47
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:12,742
- Lighting.
- Lighting is ready.

48
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,284
- Settings.
- Settings ready.

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,782
Actors.

50
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:17,785
Stand-by.

51
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:18,958
Sorry, Director.

52
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,093
According to the character of my role.

53
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:24,287
I want to play my role
with a bit naughtiness...

54
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,329
But contradiction. Will this be better?

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,661
OK, Speed.

56
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:31,261
Speed.

57
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,264
- Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1.
- Action!

58
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,304
Cut!

59
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,880
What is it?

60
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,541
What's wrong with the guy behind.

61
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:50,876
He's supposed to be dead.

62
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:54,179
- What are you doing? Aunt Ha!
- What is it? Brother Sunny?

63
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,652
What is your extra up to?

64
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,350
How come you are still alive?

65
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:02,119
As I said I'd play my role
with a bit naughtiness.

66
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,662
So subconsciously
I don't want to die yet.

67
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,699
You must pretend to be dead.

68
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,536
Actually, I was dying.

69
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:14,764
If you give me a bit more time,
I'll die eventually.

70
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,205
Do you know how many frames of film
are there in one second?

71
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,878
24 frames, Sister Cuckoo.

72
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,243
Do you know
how long is the shot just then?

73
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:23,909
I guess it about one minute.

74
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,342
Do you know as you didn't want to die...

75
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:29,319
that you've wasted how many seconds,
how many frames and how much money

76
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:32,049
and how much time
and effort of everyone here?

77
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:33,890
Are you fooling around here?

78
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:37,954
I'm begging you, you'd better
find a professional extra for this role.

79
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,189
Get someone smarter and shoot again!

80
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,928
You'd better be smart!

81
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:43,729
Go home and think about
when exactly you want to die.

82
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:44,700
OK, Brother Sunny.

83
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,537
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?

84
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:50,506
Don't ask me again, I really don't know
what you were doing.

85
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,075
- Then I...
- Get lost.

86
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,475
You remind me I must go to a meeting
of Neighbour Welfare Association.

87
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,342
I'll be right back.

88
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,846
You don't have to come back.

89
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,112
I'm begging you, stop making trouble.

90
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,255
Let the director watch your performance?

91
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,088
Director, what kind of performance?

92
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,286
You are shot to dead, ready.

93
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,394
Action!

94
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,468
Was it OK, Director?

95
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,570
This is it, go and change your clothes.

96
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,136
- Go ahead.
- Thanks...

97
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,673
Where did you learn acting, man?

98
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,209
- I've never learnt it.
- You're a real genius.

99
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:29,012
You can make it if you work hard.

100
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:33,247
Why are you still standing here?
Fuck off!

101
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:38,819
What are you doing here?

102
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,222
Unit manager,
I want to get a lunch box only.

103
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,487
It's not yet lunch time.

104
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,397
- As I'm leaving now, so I...
- Then you just go!

105
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,534
Do you know why it's not yet lunch time?

106
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:52,098
Just because of you, bastard,
you didn't want to die!

107
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,738
And now everyone is working
and starving.

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,398
I haven't eaten as well!

109
00:06:56,676 --> 00:07:00,635
Do you want to have lunch?
Share your lunch with that puppy!

110
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:10,521
Shit, you're a dump of shit.
Your life is cheaper than ants.

111
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:14,384
I ride a Mercedes,
you pick your nostril.

112
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,994
You want to have lunch?
You better eat shit!

113
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:33,167
Why did you just come back now?

114
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,148
- You guys have lunch already?
- Shut up, get me a ping pong racket.

115
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,785
OK!

116
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,585
Where's the ping pong ball?
Get me one now.

117
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,084
Quick.

118
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:50,388
- Right away.
- Hurry.

119
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,989
This is Neighbour Welfare Association.

120
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,933
You mustn't be late,
many people are waiting for you.

121
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,365
Hello, Aunt Ha?

122
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,403
Nothing, I want to check the time
for tomorrow notice.

123
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,473
You haven't for tomorrow.

124
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,303
What about the day after tomorrow?

125
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,842
Nothing for the day after tomorrow
and so on.

126
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,909
Aunt Ha, where are you?

127
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,317
None of your business, what do you want?

128
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,753
I check with you again, is there notice
for role without dialogue?

129
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,324
No.

130
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,827
- Any role that can't be seen clearly?
- No.

131
00:08:57,964 --> 00:08:59,829
Any role that can't he seen completely?

132
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,059
I can't see you now. Don't trouble me.

133
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,628
- Aunt Ha, where are you?
- Go to hell!

134
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:40,825
Dear fellows.

135
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,732
The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from
a well-known Chinese classic literature.

136
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,565
You guys all know it well.

137
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:50,267
Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor,
you guys want to see it, right?

138
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,534
So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then.

139
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:55,778
Kelly, is there anything to do
after dinner tomorrow?

140
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:57,213
Taking a dump.

141
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,881
Come and watch Uncle San's play
after taking a dump, it'll be fun.

142
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,114
Remember to bring your dad and mom too.

143
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:06,952
If they don't come, you can cry,
spit around.

144
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,094
Do whatever you can until they come,
then you'll be a good girl.

145
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,889
I pamper you, Kelly.

146
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,097
Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow.

147
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,568
You'll result like this doll.

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,600
You get that?

149
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:29,312
Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm"
will be on show tomorrow night.

150
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,608
Have you studied the script well?

151
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:33,345
Yes, don't worry.
I can even compose a song.

152
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,614
Old Master sings
whenever he sees the maid.

153
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:40,886
You're beautiful...

154
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:43,290
Uncle Chi, I'm the one
who sing the theme song.

155
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,158
And the role of "Old Master"
you play is a Chinese as well.

156
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,731
When the maid sees the Old Master,
she will sing...

157
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:54,168
You're so handsome, you're so smart...

158
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,505
- Thank you much, please to...
- Uncle Chi, please don't...

159
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,543
- I accept you...
- Are you OK?

160
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,375
Think positive, Uncle Chi.

161
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,845
Someone helps me, come on.

162
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,977
Master Hung, morning.

163
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,554
My play "Thunder Storm"
will soon be showing.

164
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:11,620
Shall we make another rehearsal?

165
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,885
Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm"
is about righteous, I knew it.

166
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,562
We're triad society member,
we only talk about two things.

167
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,893
First, about righteous,
second, about money.

168
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,261
I'll talk about righteous first.

169
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,861
"Righteous" is good, but we mustn't
ignore the love line of the story.

170
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:31,033
Because the role you play
will finally be struck to death.

171
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,838
Talking about "struck" (chopping),
let me tell you...

172
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,436
There are two kinds of "struck"
(chopping) in our world.

173
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:41,578
First, it is "dragging".
Second is "stabbing".

174
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:48,421
Look, this scar was dragged by knife.

175
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,388
While "stabbing" is like this.

176
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,259
This scoundrel is new comer, sorry,
he shows no expression.

177
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,394
"Stabbing" is like this.

178
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:02,767
Be serious,
let us know if you feel the pain, OK?

179
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:06,907
Your acting is lousy.

180
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,976
Brother Sau, teaching him for me.

181
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,314
Talking about "pain"...

182
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:15,820
according to Stanisslavski,
master of acting from Russia.

183
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:20,152
Pain is transmitted from your body to
the inside, and outside again.

184
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,224
Let try one more time.

185
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,894
Look, it's much better this time.

186
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,668
Isn't it? He acts much better now.

187
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,298
Let's try one more time.

188
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:38,541
Right, a little bit more, more,
being stabbed.

189
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,145
Maybe I can help you this way.

190
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,790
This is working, tears come out now.

191
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:06,431
Look clearly, remember this expression,
remember this feeling.

192
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:09,872
Do remember this, get it?

193
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,200
Let's go.

194
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:12,539
What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow.

195
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:13,871
No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm".

196
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:17,413
We will come for sure,
promise is a promise!

197
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,315
I'll bring hundreds of people
to watch your play as well.

198
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,819
- It's a deal.
- Just don't worry.

199
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,047
Faster.

200
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,087
Get into position.

201
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,427
Granny, you stepped on someone.

202
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,394
I didn't step on anyone.

203
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:39,595
You just couldn't feel when you
stepped on him, look at his foot.

204
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,031
Yes, he's sweating as well.

205
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:44,735
Give me some money and I'll
send him to the hospital.

206
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,206
I have no money.

207
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,243
Look at him, he's dying.

208
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,041
I only have $100 left.

209
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,444
Give me, that $100.

210
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,178
Let's move!

211
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,690
Granny, you've dropped some money.

212
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:03,489
Really good luck.

213
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,959
Sir...

214
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,099
- Are you free tomorrow?
- What is it?

215
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,359
"Thunder Storm" is on show
at Neighbour Theatre.

216
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,935
"Thunder Storm"? Good!

217
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:29,471
Miss, what's your name?

218
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,479
Piu, and you?

219
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:33,117
This is your name, really?

220
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,253
Whatever I told you,
just call me Piu, idiot?

221
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,012
You're really a student?

222
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:40,557
Sure I am, I'm still a virgin,
isn't that great?

223
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:42,053
It's your luck, Uncle.

224
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,523
Let's play 'Chai Fist'?

225
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:44,724
I don't know how to play it.

226
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,024
You don't know 'Chai Fist'?
Have you been educated?

227
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,190
Fanny, come here.

228
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:52,795
Your belly is really big!
Mind you can't get into the coffin.

229
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,599
'Chai Fist', Bingo!

230
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,004
Come on, relax, have some fun.

231
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:58,667
Cheer up, why did draw your face?
Your parents are dead or something?

232
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:00,242
Chai Fist', Bingo!

233
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:02,880
Triangle, rectangle, four!

234
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:04,306
Good, I'll drink!

235
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:19,228
Tonight is College Girls'
First Love Evening.

236
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:22,461
So please mind your words,
do behave like a student girl.

237
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:25,236
If clients complain about you again,
then I can't help you anymore.

238
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,131
What College Girl? Just a damned trick.

239
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,205
If I can be a college girl,
I won't be working here.

240
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,569
You believe you did nothing wrong?

241
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:33,904
Mamasan, the man at Table 7
is really ugly.

242
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,673
I can't stand it and
I am not doing business with him.

243
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:38,113
Do you all want to
be selecting on clients?

244
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,479
No...

245
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,348
You're too much.

246
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:45,250
You are not professional,
you can concentrate on one single.

247
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,619
One single spot?

248
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,352
If that man is ugly,
you needn't look at him.

249
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,029
If his ears are pretty,
just stare at his ears.

250
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,065
If his mouth is ugly but the teeth
are nice, just look at his teeth.

251
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,396
So you new comer are really ignorant.

252
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,938
Let me deal with him.
Come on, watch what I'll do.

253
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,404
Be smart.

254
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:06,975
Hi!

255
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,748
You're pretty.

256
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,181
What's your name, Boss?

257
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,087
My name is Pierre.

258
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,854
It's a French name.

259
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:25,328
Are everyone says I look like
a Frenchman, so I get a French name.

260
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:31,061
If you can't pronounce that well,
just call me Pi or Erre.

261
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,271
What's on?

262
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,967
You used to be proud,
now you get a lesson.

263
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:43,346
You can't blame me, he's a real rarity.

264
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:45,380
Have you seen anyone
put a cockroach on his head?

265
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,451
What's the problem?

266
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:49,314
Look at LuLu,
she's playing with that cockroach now.

267
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:54,985
I admit failure.

268
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,560
OK, from now on,
you won't have clients to sit at.

269
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,630
You'll be bored to death.

270
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,527
You're all like this.

271
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,597
Connie, come and teach her for me.

272
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,628
You're not amateur, you should know
you must act in front of clients.

273
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,538
But your problem is: you acting stinks.

274
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,837
I can do nothing about it.

275
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,005
I hear someone teaches acting for free.

276
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,375
I'll take you to see him.

277
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:19,377
Teaches acting?

278
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,621
- Hey, men.
- Yes!

279
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,694
Hurry up, start working.

280
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:34,062
You again?

281
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:34,894
Morning, Brother Sunny.

282
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,661
Aunt Ha!

283
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,028
I'm looking for him too.

284
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,171
I haven't given you a notice,
what brings you here?

285
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,206
Remember last time that you asked me
to think about the ways to die.

286
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,471
I've thought over and
I have some new ideas now,

287
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:49,647
and I believe my performance
will make you satisfied.

288
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:52,941
I would have killed you in the past.

289
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,346
Talking about knife,
it's different from a gun.

290
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,182
The position of the wound
is usually under the armpit, here.

291
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,282
The wound is a bit bigger,
and the face will twist more.

292
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,258
If you're betrayed by your own friends,
you will even...

293
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:09,094
I didn't expect... it's you...

294
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:10,568
Get lost!

295
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:12,331
Brother Sunny, I...

296
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,938
I just want to act,
give me a chance please.

297
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,008
Do you love standing here?

298
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:19,110
OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime.

299
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:22,042
I'll act even if you don't pay me,
I only want a lunch box.

300
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:24,308
But lunch box costs money too, beat it!

301
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,543
Sunny.

302
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,576
What is it, Martial Art Director?

303
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:31,382
It's bad to use this mannequin
to disguise as a dead man.

304
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,217
Figure it out, we're in a hurry!

305
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:34,859
Yes, OK... got it.

306
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,295
Thank you, Brother Sunny.

307
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,396
Only a lunch box.

308
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,465
No problem,
should I put some make up on?

309
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:44,535
Put it on now.

310
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:48,935
Director, the actors are ready.

311
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,174
Actors are all ready.

312
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:51,567
Action!

313
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:32,843
Cockroach...

314
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:34,109
Let's help sister Cuckoo.

315
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,483
Cockroach!

316
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,523
Go to hell!

317
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,094
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid.

318
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,391
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid,
it's OK now.

319
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:48,499
Director, can we cut now?

320
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,860
It's still running?

321
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:51,360
Cut!

322
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:53,094
- OK.
- Are you OK?

323
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,831
Must you do all these
to kill a cockroach!

324
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,570
Let's see if he's alright?

325
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,309
I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo,
thanks for your concerns.

326
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:01,906
Why don't you move at all?

327
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:07,284
I didn't move
since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

328
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,113
So I mustn't move.

329
00:22:10,922 --> 00:22:13,584
Do you hear that...

330
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,961
He keeps on acting since the Director
hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.

331
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:20,122
This is what I always tell you:
professionalism.

332
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:23,696
What's your name?

333
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:25,827
I'm called Wan Tin Sau.

334
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,670
- Yee, give him a cup of coffee.
- Yes.

335
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:30,341
- Get his phone number for me.
- Yes.

336
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:33,309
You... work in my team from now on.

337
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,244
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

338
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,575
- Is this shot OK?
- Yes.

339
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,374
Weapon comes.

340
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:41,547
- Sunny.
- Yes.

341
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,520
I am telling you,
even extras are important.

342
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:48,389
The one who played the father,
we mustn't use him again.

343
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,424
Got it, Sister Cuckoo.

344
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,952
Sister Cuckoo,
I am the one who played the Father.

345
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:57,868
In fact, it is like this...

346
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:01,832
Fine...

347
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,805
Let me clean it for you,
towel, get the towel.

348
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:08,346
- Sister Cuckoo!
- Watch out!

349
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:18,753
Sister Cuckoo, are you alright?

350
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,048
Don't touch.

351
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,095
Don't touch!

352
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,134
Very pretty.

353
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:37,141
Sister Cuckoo!

354
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:41,365
Security guard, is there someone here
who teaches acting?

355
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,907
I've been in the field of art for ages.

356
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:48,477
Whether it's movie or TV,
I'm experienced.

357
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,673
I was the creative director
in Amusement Park Theatre.

358
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:54,785
So I can sing and dance.

359
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,854
You mean you are the instructor here?

360
00:24:57,055 --> 00:25:00,718
Well, many people here
love theatre and play.

361
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:03,225
They love studying plays with me.

362
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,056
Those people introduce us here indeed.

363
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,492
OK, this way please.

364
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,457
It's you?

365
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,467
Didn't you play in that film... that...

366
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:12,467
The stupid man standing behind, falls
after stepping on a banana peel?

367
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,838
You noticed my performance too?

368
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:21,275
You idiot! Only an idiot will fall
after stepping on a banana peel.

369
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,448
- Why don't you go dying?
- Thanks.

370
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:27,743
- Are you really that stupid?
- You're flattering me.

371
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,387
You damned extra, you are...

372
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:34,116
In fact, I am an actor. That way please.

373
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,450
Damned extra.

374
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,892
What can I do for you?

375
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,262
Frankly,
we're hostesses of a night club.

376
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,558
I can tell.

377
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,565
We're holding "College Girls'
First Love Evening" right now.

378
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:50,504
These girls dare to say they don't
have the feeling of first love at all.

379
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:53,237
How can you work like this?

380
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,571
First love was shown at the stage
when we where babies.

381
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:01,550
Say, when a baby sees a comforter,
he wants to suck it.

382
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,154
This is a kind of love.

383
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:07,692
Why did you suck a comforter?
You damned extra.

384
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,187
In fact, I am an actor.

385
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,959
Well, so why did you talk about
sucking a comforter?

386
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,298
I'm going to explain everything to you.

387
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,331
OK, let's explain it.

388
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:22,734
First, you must dress up
like a college girls,

389
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,105
about dialogue, at some vital points...

390
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:28,610
such as: I love you, I hate you, etc.

391
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:34,411
It'll be more impressive
if you have some tears in your eyes.

392
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:36,051
Just like this.

393
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:44,362
Do you see? That teardrop...

394
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,729
Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes.

395
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:51,557
Where is the teardrop? You damned extra.

396
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,669
In fact, I am an actor.

397
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:01,310
You might need something to help you
since you've no experience,

398
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,639
and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi.

399
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:07,251
Wasabi? What are you talking about?

400
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:10,045
Must we be fooled by this damned extra?

401
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,687
Miss, if you must call me an extra,

402
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,724
you don't need to add 'damned'
in front of it.

403
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,462
In fact, being club girls...

404
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:23,932
If you can show some respect
to the others, then...

405
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,967
- What are you calling us?
- Excuse me.

406
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:28,805
Forget it, we are club girls indeed.

407
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,338
I just don't like him
calling me that way.

408
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,269
She's always like this, never mind her.

409
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:41,049
It's OK...

410
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,356
I've asked you not to stir up trouble!

411
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,521
It's OK...

412
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:57,463
It's OK...

413
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:01,138
Why must you still behave like this?
Don't panic, it's alright.

414
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:05,204
- Don't panic, it's alright.
- Club girls?

415
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:08,604
It's alright... Don't panic,
take it easy, it's alright.

416
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,745
How could l know he's so amusing?

417
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,610
I brought you there as I thought
he charged for nothing.

418
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,478
If you hadn't block my way, I'd have...

419
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,519
Please, beware what you say
to the clients.

420
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,187
- Go out...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,153
What's going on?
This is a big night club.

422
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,621
Get lost, I'm sorry.

423
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,692
- Are there other hostesses?
- Yes, they're coming soon.

424
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:25,887
Connie, come here.

425
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:26,826
What is it, Mama Debra?

426
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,498
Master Lung is here and he's drunk.

427
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,966
He thought he's being dumped
and he wants his first lover back.

428
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,899
All the girls here are college girls,
they'll suit him.

429
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:36,071
Look,
he has scanned almost all my girls.

430
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,968
But none of them suits his taste,
he's nuts.

431
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:42,011
Look at his money, it's piled up.

432
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,738
- Have you gone inside?
- Not yet.

433
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:46,508
Wait here for a while.
Go and send some more girls here.

434
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,811
I have so much money.

435
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,220
Come and get it if you can.

436
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:55,817
I want my first lover.

437
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,154
First lover!

438
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,234
You wanna try?

439
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,902
I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard
to tell the taste of a rich man.

440
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,300
Get lost.

441
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,874
Hurry up, be smart.

442
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:21,748
Master Lung, here come the beauties.
Say Hi to Master Lung.

443
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,278
Boss.

444
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,092
Get lost!

445
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,124
- Master Lung, don't get mad.
- Go away!

446
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,396
None of them is pretty!

447
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:38,433
They are not sincere,
I want my first lover!

448
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:45,508
First lover...

449
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:52,877
They're all here for money!

450
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,090
I am sincere.

451
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:05,990
I really love you.

452
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:12,494
Mary, I'll give you anything you want.

453
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:16,037
I can give you
all the money on the table...

454
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:22,404
as long as you don't leave me, Mary.

455
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:50,067
- What is it?
- Are you alright?

456
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:52,774
I've hit you hard, sorry.

457
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:55,412
If that table wasn't there
and I could kick you,

458
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,909
I wouldn't have been defeated by you.

459
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:59,916
I'm not here to fight with you,
I'm here to learn acting from you.

460
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:01,278
Go away.

461
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,287
To some honest friends
who have the same interest as I do.

462
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:11,826
I'll be more than willing to teach them.
Just a second.

463
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,638
I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3.

464
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,697
Must it take you so long for make up?
You damned...

465
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,836
Don't again!

466
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:55,768
- Your tie is high-classed.
- Thanks.

467
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,500
Since I've taken your money,
I should act accordingly.

468
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,673
- Where's the ping pong racket?
- Under the table.

469
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:02,570
There're many people here,
let's go over there.

470
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:06,381
I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you?

471
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,416
Lau Piu Piu.

472
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,915
What do you want to learn?

473
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:11,784
How to pamper
those bastards in the night club.

474
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,427
The first love feeling of college girls
must be built from the base.

475
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,121
You can take me as your client,
and greet me first.

476
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,490
Boss, want some fist games?

477
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:22,862
Don't call me "Boss",
you're college girl now.

478
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,559
You can say Good Morning,

479
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:26,296
or Morning, Sir.

480
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:27,931
Good morning, Sir.

481
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,503
Try to lower your head a little bit,
pretend to be shy.

482
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,303
Let your client touches your chin
and raise your head and then say.

483
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,074
Morning, Sir.

484
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:37,875
Your regards are bad, again.

485
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,246
Give me glistened regards.

486
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:41,950
Morning, Sir.

487
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:46,917
Too glistened now, I'll faint, again.
Take it easy.

488
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:51,421
Morning, Sir.

489
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:54,030
These are eyes of dead body,
you'll scare others to death.

490
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:59,101
Again. Be natural.

491
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:01,403
Morning, Sir.

492
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:11,012
Good!

493
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,949
Now let's discuss about your action,
say, hugging.

494
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,221
Hug me with your way.

495
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:25,429
What for?

496
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,190
What for?

497
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:29,866
You needn't lock others
with your thigh every time.

498
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,694
- Sorry, my job requires this.
- You must stop doing that.

499
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:38,003
Being a college girl,
you needn't always take initiation.

500
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:43,010
You can act shyly
so that men will hug you.

501
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:44,748
What do you mean by shy?

502
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,016
Like this.

503
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,687
- Like biting a quail?
- Act on.

504
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:55,784
Right, when men see you biting a quail,

505
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,858
they'll naturally hold and hug you.

506
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:02,659
Now you can put your head
on their shoulders.

507
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:14,108
What for?

508
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,771
Excuse me, my job requires this.

509
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,609
You must stop doing that!

510
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:20,541
Superficially it's all.

511
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:24,052
If we go further, I must then ask you
about your first love.

512
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,485
I never have first love.

513
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:28,452
Everyone has first love.

514
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:29,855
I said I never have one.

515
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:33,763
You must have some unforgettable memory.

516
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,065
No.

517
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,377
Or you must have heard someone
say something you can never forget.

518
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:49,804
Never!

519
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:51,812
I hope I can be with you forever.

520
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,245
Promise me, let me take care of you
for the rest of your life.

521
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,398
Then you must have
unforgettable experience.

522
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,266
Never!

523
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,872
Being club girl? Didn't say
you'll take care of me?

524
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:27,882
How come I have money
if you don't work as club girl?

525
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:30,111
How can I take care of you
if I have no money?

526
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:35,848
Now, imagine
I'm your first boyfriend lover.

527
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:52,404
Sau, on the night of your play,
I was engaged in a transaction.

528
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:55,137
So I was too busy to come, sorry.

529
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:57,347
- Was there good response?
- Sure.

530
00:35:57,548 --> 00:36:00,517
It's good then.
I will surely come next time.

531
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:07,189
Someone're shooing kids karaoke,
you aren't one of them?

532
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:09,384
I've things to see you, excuse me.

533
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:12,654
Take me new boy
to collect protection money for me.

534
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:15,764
Help me improve his appearance...
About the way he speaks?

535
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,462
Right, that's it,
you won't refuse my request, right?

536
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,298
Thanks for teaching me.

537
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:26,734
Over there.

538
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,946
Being a triad member...

539
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,139
you must have a unique appearance.

540
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,010
It's right
you have a gold chain with you.

541
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:37,553
You must try to look furious and severe.
Try it.

542
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:42,186
More furious. Show some anger.

543
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:45,159
Wrath.

544
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,031
Throw that nibble away.

545
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:55,398
This is it,
you know what you're going to say?

546
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:56,268
I seem to know.

547
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,740
Good, I'll remind you from time to time
in this dim place.

548
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,712
Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up.

549
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,718
- Shooting a movie?
- What is it?

550
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:13,915
I forget already.

551
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,865
You know, HK is in economic recession.

552
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,595
And being hit by financial storm,
it's all because of the 'Ross'.

553
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:27,738
There are many factors.

554
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:30,066
Now the S.E.
Asia collapses in economics...

555
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,709
and that infects HK too.

556
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,470
Those enterprises suffer much.

557
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,276
The worse is there'll be
global economics recession soon.

558
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:41,816
You have a view in economics.

559
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:44,078
I majored Economics in HKU.

560
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:45,620
Did you? I graduated this year.

561
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,486
Did you? I graduated in 1996,
this is my name card.

562
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,018
- You're my senior, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

563
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:53,755
- How come you shoot kids karaoke?
- I can't help.

564
00:37:58,903 --> 00:37:59,870
What are you doing now?

565
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:02,268
Nothing, I fool with triad members.

566
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,670
Seeing you shooting movie here,
I come to collect protection money.

567
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:07,944
Brother Kei,
someone collects protection money.

568
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,945
Who collects protection money?

569
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:22,087
- Economics in HK is now...
- Is it you?

570
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:25,855
Good.

571
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,767
Bastard,
what triad groups are you come from?

572
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,325
Dare you to fool me?

573
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:09,098
Fix him!

574
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,868
Kill you!

575
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:17,505
Go to hell! Bastard...

576
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:23,248
Dare you play with my bird?
Don't you know me?

577
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,853
Don't come near...

578
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:27,921
It hurts...

579
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,424
Don't talk with me,
pretend we're at a duel.

580
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,464
Make a call... pretend calling for help.

581
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:40,361
I want to go home.

582
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,472
You must act on until I shout cut.

583
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:45,769
- You must be profession.
- I want to go home.

584
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,774
It's a day.

585
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:49,470
They're gone.

586
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:51,281
Don't be afraid, they're gone, all gone.

587
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:54,582
Take a chopper and a rush there,
get some fame.

588
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:07,893
What's wrong?

589
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,499
That scoundrel is still there.

590
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:13,034
Concentrate! you're scoundrel too,
show some anger!

591
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,035
I want to eat ice-cream.

592
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,872
Bastard! Show some anger!

593
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,252
You needn't do that.

594
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,533
Forget it, I fear you now.

595
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,473
What's up? You acted very well.

596
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:03,012
What has happened?

597
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,155
He acted really well to get this.

598
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,223
He managed to collect $20.

599
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:08,791
Why are you still crying?

600
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,258
You managed to get $20 protection money
in front of a temple.

601
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:13,020
You're making a fame for yourself.

602
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,495
You do look like a hero.

603
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:17,861
Keep the image and use it
to collect protection money now.

604
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:20,166
Brother Sau, you're competent, great!

605
00:41:20,337 --> 00:41:21,099
You're flattering me.

606
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,935
Let's get a feast, with this $20.

607
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,977
What are you laughing at?
Keep this image, got it?

608
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:32,239
- Stop laughing! Cry!
- Stop laughing! Cry!

609
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:34,780
Be good, cry, cry now!

610
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,181
What are you laughing at! Cry now!

611
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:37,914
That under-graduate hold two choppers.

612
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,886
And rushes over
while crying and shouting.

613
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:43,822
He's crying loudly.

614
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:47,091
He is capable
to play the spirit of a triad member.

615
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:48,856
Thanks for his persistence,

616
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,230
He managed to get $20
as a protection money.

617
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:52,393
What are you talking about?

618
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:54,366
Persistence, Aunt Ha.

619
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,473
I believe that I'm a good actor,
do me a favour please.

620
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:58,472
I have new experience
about holding choppers.

621
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,007
I'd play well in a kung fu movie.

622
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,670
What?
You've brought enough trouble to me.

623
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,577
How dare you asking me for help?
Go away!

624
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:09,784
Sorry, Brother Sunny, he's leaving now.

625
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:12,514
I've looking for you.
Make up and get ready.

626
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:13,814
Thanks!

627
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,221
Director, we've found the stunt man.

628
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:18,156
You said you can't find one just then?
You're wasting my time!

629
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:19,262
I've found one now.

630
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,294
You have no problem?

631
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:23,433
No problem, I'll try my best to be
the stunt man for Sister Cuckoo.

632
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:24,659
Director, no problem.

633
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:26,400
Light the fire.

634
00:42:26,537 --> 00:42:27,299
Director.

635
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,766
Beside responding with the hot fire,

636
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:30,907
Can I show an expression
of cool loneliness?

637
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,142
As you like,

638
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:34,971
As long as you don't turn your face
to the camera, get it?

639
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,046
Got it.

640
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,479
Light the fire, just don't move.

641
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,013
Ready.

642
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:44,049
Who put the pigeons here?

643
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:45,279
Director, I put them here intentionally.

644
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:47,083
There're pigeons here in our last shot.

645
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:50,193
If the pigeons fly,
they'll stir up the fire.

646
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,226
- Take them away.
- Director...

647
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,596
The mood of this shot will be better
if the pigeons are there.

648
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:56,995
How much better?

649
00:42:58,302 --> 00:43:01,465
It's hard to say,
it's something abstract.

650
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:03,037
Anyway, the mood will be better.

651
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,802
Put them up and let's see the effect.

652
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:08,909
That stunt man mustn't turn his head!

653
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:10,675
Director, how do you like it?

654
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,241
It's a bit better.

655
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,814
Let's try the effect
with the pigeon's head towards me.

656
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,956
Now put the pigeon's tail towards me.

657
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:26,589
Take it away. Ready.

658
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:28,555
It's better without the pigeons,
take it away.

659
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,326
Ready.

660
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,469
Where's my lighter?

661
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,732
Man, bring me a lighter?

662
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:37,841
Director, here it is.

663
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,135
- Really?
- Yes.

664
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:40,708
- It works?
- Yes.

665
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:44,712
Hurry, quick, ready!

666
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:47,341
Ready, keep your posture, don't move.

667
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:49,486
Roll, action!

668
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:52,148
What is it?

669
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:59,325
What's wrong with you?
You screwed up every time!

670
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,025
Sorry, Brother Sunny,
it's very hot here.

671
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,257
I've told you already,
and you said no problem.

672
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,401
Shall we try again?

673
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:06,363
Again? Get a smarter guy.

674
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,935
It's your fault, Sunny?

675
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,638
Sorry, Director. Get lost!

676
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,870
I've tried my best to help you,
don't ever come again.

677
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,947
Just then...

678
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,776
Do you smell BBQ chicken wing?

679
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,545
I've sacrificed my arm
just for this movie.

680
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,585
Unit Manager, give him an over-cooked
chicken wing rice lunch box.

681
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:25,586
OK.

682
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,051
You, don't ever let me see him again...

683
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:28,315
Or I'll fire you instantly as well!

684
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:29,459
Aunt Ha...

685
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:32,153
Don't ask me anymore. Brother Sunny!

686
00:44:32,396 --> 00:44:33,761
Chicken wings rice.

687
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:38,723
Let me see which is over-cooked,
the chicken wing or your arm.

688
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,001
Not over-cooked, go away now.

689
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,704
- Brother Sunny said I have a lunch box.
- Go away!

690
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:47,837
Extras are human being as well.

691
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:49,443
What? Repeat it loudly!

692
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:50,580
Aren't extras human?

693
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:51,908
Why must you always jump in me?

694
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:54,916
- You want to know the reason?
- I want to know the reason.

695
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:57,213
Because you're not entitled
to eat this lunch box!

696
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:02,183
You thought you're talented
and teach others acting.

697
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:04,020
You always talk about theory.

698
00:45:04,194 --> 00:45:06,958
You teach someone to be a triad member
and collect protection money.

699
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:10,362
You're indeed insulting
the word 'acting'!

700
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,699
Don't shout on, let's get to work.

701
00:45:14,104 --> 00:45:18,268
You talk about 'acting' in front of me?
Shit!

702
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:21,806
Damn it!

703
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,077
They dare to collect protection money
from those 2 ice-cream cars?

704
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,114
I'm the protector
of those 2 ice-cream cars.

705
00:45:27,284 --> 00:45:29,047
They don't respect me at all.

706
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:30,982
Men, get some weapons
and teach them a lesson.

707
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:32,622
Sau, come with us.

708
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,915
You can experience
how we fight for our right,

709
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:36,821
and keep guard for us as well.
Men, let's go.

710
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:39,654
Little Hung, where are you going?

711
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,195
Granny, where are you doing here?

712
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:42,627
You're getting better
with you tuberculosis.

713
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,961
So mind you catch a cold,
have you taken your medicine?

714
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:47,730
Yes, you're going to
fight with someone again?

715
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:48,702
No.

716
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:49,964
Don't go.

717
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:51,165
I'm not fighting with anyone.

718
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:54,369
- Don't go fighting.
- I'm not.

719
00:45:54,578 --> 00:45:58,639
Granny, he isn't going to fight,
he's going to act in a play.

720
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:01,818
That Neighbour Theatre,
we're playing "Thunder Storm".

721
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:03,450
"Thunder Storm"? It's a good play.

722
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,679
Bruce Lee, Bark Yin,
Ng Chor Fan did it years ago.

723
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:07,051
There was great response,

724
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:08,556
so we're putting up one more show.

725
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,226
We're hurrying for the rehearsal.

726
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:12,322
You're acting in a play?

727
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:13,758
Yes.

728
00:46:13,864 --> 00:46:19,734
Good, my grandson is an actor,
how smart he is!

729
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:22,403
I'm very happy!

730
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,837
OK, come on, go home now.

731
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:29,401
She's put much saliva on my face.

732
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,145
Your granny brought you up alone,
she's a real heroine.

733
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,510
You're not.

734
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:39,451
See how happy she is.

735
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:45,390
Stop fighting anymore,
come and join our rehearsal.

736
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:53,696
If you can defeat me,

737
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:56,237
I'll swallow this plate.

738
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:58,169
You aren't convinced?

739
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:01,637
You should speak with stressing tone
"You aren't convinced?"

740
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,042
This is raise my wrath from the inside.

741
00:47:04,214 --> 00:47:06,182
No need, as no one is watching.

742
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:08,477
You suddenly want to play
"Fist of Fury".

743
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:11,212
And make us to wear this costume,
this way is too much.

744
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:14,017
I'm doing you a favour, right?

745
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:16,490
- I only want to change the wig.
- Let's leave.

746
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:33,576
That girl is pretty, your girlfriend?

747
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:34,641
Sure.

748
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:36,743
- Let's get serious, try again!
- Coming.

749
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,172
If you can defeat me.

750
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:42,443
I'll swallow this plate.

751
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,121
You aren't convinced?

752
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:54,864
Change the position, hurry.

753
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:43,875
We're concentrated
when acting on the stage.

754
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,208
It's dangerous if you suddenly rush up.

755
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,110
I want to join you as you guys
were fevering up there.

756
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:52,049
I chose "Fist Of Fury"
for some commercial reasons.

757
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:54,521
Because there're fighting scenes,
audience will like it.

758
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:56,285
The story is consisted
of blood and tears.

759
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:57,551
Speaking of blood and tears,

760
00:48:57,694 --> 00:48:59,457
I wonder if my spine is injured.

761
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,557
Last time I was in a bad mood
and I slapped at your face.

762
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:03,265
So I came here to apologize.

763
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,961
I'm grateful
as you watched our play tonight.

764
00:49:07,304 --> 00:49:08,771
- Thanks.
- You mean it?

765
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,003
Thanks...

766
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,145
Thanks.

767
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,811
Thanks for your encouragement,
I'll remember it.

768
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:25,079
You'll make it!

769
00:49:25,288 --> 00:49:27,848
Last time you taught me
pretending to be shy...

770
00:49:28,058 --> 00:49:30,822
and men really lift up my chin
and I said...

771
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:32,421
Morning, Sir.

772
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,793
They're all enchanted by me
and I'm making lots of money.

773
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:35,693
Really?

774
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,734
Surely,
I've made a fame in the night-club now.

775
00:49:37,868 --> 00:49:38,630
Congratulations.

776
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:40,930
You will become an excellent club girl.

777
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:41,800
Thanks.

778
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:43,940
You will become
an excellent damned extra too.

779
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:45,199
Thanks.

780
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:57,652
Looks, it's so dark out there,
I can't see anything.

781
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,455
No, it'll become scenic when dawn comes.

782
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:08,798
I got to go.

783
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:12,493
Those 3 guys are dead beat.

784
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,029
What's wrong with you?

785
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:17,037
What's wrong with me?

786
00:50:17,274 --> 00:50:20,437
Your lips are chapped,
you need lip balm?

787
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:21,611
Thanks.

788
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,915
I only have this, is it better?

789
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:33,182
Yes, it's better.

790
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:38,158
- You want some more?
- No, thanks.

791
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:41,228
Forget it then.

792
00:50:42,365 --> 00:50:44,731
Go to hell, asshole!

793
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:45,699
What's wrong with you?

794
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,834
I hate people with chapped lips.

795
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,602
But I don't want to have chapped lips.

796
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,271
Why don't you
put some more lip balm then?

797
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,542
OK, I'll put on some more!

798
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,508
Go to hell, don't force yourself to!

799
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,651
I do want to put some more on.

800
00:51:02,986 --> 00:51:03,748
I'm warning you,

801
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:05,855
don't nag when I put it on your lips.

802
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:09,356
I've said I want to put on some more.
Wait.

803
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:10,755
You asshole!

804
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:14,795
Put it on for me
like professional beautician, OK?

805
00:51:14,998 --> 00:51:16,158
OK.

806
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:38,080
- Master Hung.
- What is it?

807
00:52:38,248 --> 00:52:41,843
How much is a night-club hostess
charge for overnight?

808
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:44,318
Around $1000 to $1200
with a fair appearance.

809
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:46,751
- What if she's pretty?
- How pretty is she then?

810
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,788
I mean she's a real beauty.

811
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:51,427
About $1 million to $10 million.

812
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:56,282
Thanks, Boss.

813
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,147
What is it?

814
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:20,249
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

815
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,280
- Where are you going?
- Going home.

816
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,779
- And then?
- Going to work.

817
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:28,586
Is it possible if you don't go to work?

818
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:30,521
Are you supporting my living
if I don't go to work?

819
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:51,308
What now?

820
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,553
I'll support your living!

821
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:10,330
Take care of your living first, nuts.

822
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:57,880
Whether you despite me or not.

823
00:55:58,047 --> 00:56:00,413
I'm an actor.

824
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:03,714
You're talking to me?

825
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,088
You're calling yourself an actor,
fuck you!

826
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:11,961
You owe me 3 lunch boxes,
I want to take them back now.

827
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:19,364
Take them!

828
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:23,401
Dare you take them!

829
00:56:53,803 --> 00:56:55,065
Thanks.

830
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,404
- Wan Tin Sau!
- Stand there!

831
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:06,106
Don't run!

832
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,613
Aunt Ha, this is my lunch box.

833
00:57:08,785 --> 00:57:10,252
As you like, someone's looking for you.

834
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:11,317
Come on.

835
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:24,595
Mandy, you may go now.

836
00:57:25,935 --> 00:57:28,699
Go inside. Put down the lunch box.

837
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:43,343
Close the door!

838
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:54,888
Sister Cuckoo, director.

839
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:56,858
Take this seat.

840
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,594
I want you to do an audition now.

841
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:00,927
We're lovers.

842
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:03,368
Here is the dialogue before I die.

843
00:58:03,506 --> 00:58:04,370
Take a look.

844
00:58:07,677 --> 00:58:08,837
And my role is...

845
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:12,944
You play the role of Wan Tin Sau,
and I'll play the role of Cuckoo.

846
00:58:14,984 --> 00:58:15,951
OK.

847
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:19,555
- Call "Action" now.
- Action.

848
00:58:22,492 --> 00:58:23,550
Tin Sau...

849
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,359
Cuckoo...

850
00:58:33,102 --> 00:58:35,263
Tin Sau... I...

851
00:58:36,706 --> 00:58:40,665
You will be alright, Cuckoo...

852
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:43,276
I don't think I can make it...

853
00:58:44,013 --> 00:58:51,681
Cuckoo, I've encountered too much
failure in my life.

854
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,517
I'm very tired.

855
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,854
If I lose you too.

856
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:03,023
I can't hold on anymore.

857
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,366
You... take care.

858
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:09,803
Don't go, Cuckoo...

859
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,303
Cuckoo, answer me...

860
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:19,006
Speak to me, Cuckoo, speak something,
Cuckoo...

861
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:24,543
Cuckoo...

862
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:27,354
Cut.

863
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,953
- Sister Cuckoo, clean it first.
- Get lost.

864
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:33,153
What's wrong? A running nose?

865
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:34,763
You were really absorbed in the role.

866
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:37,125
Not only absorbed in it,
very stunning too.

867
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,439
Let me tell you,
I won't wait for Big Brother.

868
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:45,369
You can compromise on the schedule
with Big Brother.

869
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:46,305
Who will compromise?

870
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,407
I've had it, I want a new partner.

871
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,372
You rather use this guy
than Big Brother?

872
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:53,175
Don't fucking, sorry.
Don't bullshit me, OK?

873
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:54,407
Cause I'm not doing business like this.

874
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:55,779
"Oh", don't you bullshit me.

875
00:59:55,952 --> 00:59:57,419
We need some new blood.

876
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,780
New bloods are all around,

877
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:00,286
but we're making a big budgeted movie.

878
01:00:00,456 --> 01:00:01,923
So you can't just introduce
a common guy like him to me.

879
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:03,025
He's not a common guy.

880
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:04,922
Mr. Shaw,
I've noticed him for quite some time.

881
01:00:05,028 --> 01:00:06,188
He's a real professional actor.

882
01:00:06,362 --> 01:00:08,728
What professional?
We're talking about business here.

883
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,160
Don't mix your personal feeling into it,
Sister Cuckoo.

884
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:11,495
Let me tell you something man.

885
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:13,669
I'm not going to work with these people
and that bitch.

886
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:15,394
I'm not gonna work with this man,

887
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:17,769
I don't want to see him,
I don't want to talk about it!

888
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:23,002
Mr. Shaw.

889
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,017
I want you to be the leading actor
in my next movie.

890
01:00:28,151 --> 01:00:29,413
What do you think?

891
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,280
Good.

892
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:33,717
Here're the character,
background relationship.

893
01:00:33,856 --> 01:00:34,914
Scenario, script...

894
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,185
And the novel,
you may take them home for reference.

895
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:38,588
I think they'll help you a lot.

896
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:41,559
Here're the schedules
and the character's images.

897
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:43,596
We'll get your measurement
as soon as possible.

898
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:44,995
Any problem?

899
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,531
I'll surely have a lunch box everyday?

900
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:45,023
Mama, I don't want
to do any business tonight.

901
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:46,924
What? You fool me again.

902
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:48,121
I'm not fooling you.

903
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,199
No? You're fooling me right now.

904
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,867
Master Lung comes to see you,
he's willing to pay a lump sum.

905
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:55,130
You must treat him nicely tonight.

906
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:56,738
Stop fooling now.

907
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:58,571
I don't want to work anymore?

908
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,370
You don't want to work?
You think you're a virgin.

909
01:02:02,478 --> 01:02:03,945
Why don't you just quit.

910
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,845
I've fallen in love with someone.

911
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,946
I don't know how to thank you
for giving me this chance.

912
01:02:09,585 --> 01:02:11,052
Just try your very best.

913
01:02:11,354 --> 01:02:15,313
I'll input all my strength
and time into this movie.

914
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:19,558
I hope your girlfriend won't complain
if you can't accompany her.

915
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:21,987
I don't have girlfriend.

916
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:24,395
You'd rather choose love than money?

917
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:29,300
You're nuts! I don't care.

918
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:31,268
You must treat him tonight,
whatever you do.

919
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:32,965
We'll talk about it after that.

920
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:34,476
Miss, get up and get your handbag.

921
01:02:34,644 --> 01:02:38,307
Master Lung, sorry,
I feel sick suddenly.

922
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:40,778
I'm afraid
I can't accompany you tonight, sorry.

923
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,583
Forget it, don't pretend like a virgin.

924
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,988
I have lots of money.

925
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:50,888
Take it, how's that?

926
01:02:53,296 --> 01:02:56,060
I'm really feeling sick, I can't.

927
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:00,262
I don't want to hear "I can't".

928
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,102
Is that clear? Say again.

929
01:03:04,841 --> 01:03:06,001
I really can't.

930
01:03:08,878 --> 01:03:10,038
Is it hurt?

931
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,247
Didn't you say you're a dancing master?

932
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:14,383
Yes, I can dance very well.

933
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:15,949
Then what make you step on my feet?

934
01:03:16,118 --> 01:03:18,279
Is it because your pace
is a bit too fast?

935
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,420
Can you slow down your beat,
just for me?

936
01:03:20,556 --> 01:03:22,717
OK, just for you.

937
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:30,362
Bitch! Last time I spent over
thousands of dollar on you.

938
01:03:30,533 --> 01:03:32,296
And now I came here and...

939
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:34,162
you turn me down?

940
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,238
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody here.

941
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:37,804
I'll give you another chance.

942
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:40,567
Say it again in front of everybody,
can you?

943
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:43,636
I can't.

944
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,443
Master Lung, stop beating her.
She's a little girl.

945
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:05,925
Master Lung, stop beating her.

946
01:04:06,402 --> 01:04:07,664
Can you?

947
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:15,904
I can't!

948
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:27,753
Let's go.

949
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:33,121
Call someone for help!

950
01:04:36,098 --> 01:04:37,156
- Morning!
- Morning!

951
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:46,207
- Morning!
- Morning!

952
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:49,876
- Are you Cuckoo Tu?
- Hello.

953
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:52,207
It's you? I'm Lau Piu Piu.

954
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:55,145
I'm your fans,
can I've your autograph, please?

955
01:04:55,318 --> 01:04:56,683
You're very beautiful,

956
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:57,910
I love watching your movies.

957
01:04:59,455 --> 01:05:02,219
It's Cuckoo, ask for her autograph,
she's leaving now.

958
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:05,418
In today's movie, You play the role
of a waiter at a Chinese restaurant?

959
01:05:05,561 --> 01:05:07,927
Or a bell boy a hotel?

960
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:11,831
What's happened at your face?

961
01:05:12,935 --> 01:05:14,095
Don't bother.

962
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:16,464
Cuckoo,
who are you dating with recently?

963
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:17,806
You guys are neighbours?

964
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:19,134
You know him?

965
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:22,102
Sister Cuckoo helps me,
she wants me to be leading actor.

966
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,270
- Go to hell.
- It's true!

967
01:05:24,413 --> 01:05:26,074
Sau, let's go.

968
01:05:26,182 --> 01:05:27,843
Mr. Shaw doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

969
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:29,847
- Really?
- Yes!

970
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:32,487
I've said
you can make it someday, remember?

971
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:34,613
I've said
he'll make it, he will make it.

972
01:05:34,757 --> 01:05:36,122
Cuckoo, ask him if you don't believe me.

973
01:05:36,258 --> 01:05:38,226
Sau, Mr. Shaw is flying
to the States this afternoon.

974
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:39,191
Let's hurry.

975
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:41,126
I think he wants to talk with you
before he departs.

976
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,890
Do you remember,
I've said you'll make a fame.

977
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:46,034
Didn't I say this
to you that night on the beach?

978
01:05:46,202 --> 01:05:47,863
I really said that to him
on the beach that night.

979
01:05:48,037 --> 01:05:49,095
The producer has reserved
the shooting range for you.

980
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:50,705
You must practise shooting.

981
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,601
He'll also teach you somersault,
and spring board.

982
01:05:52,775 --> 01:05:55,141
And also fly with wire,
you have underwear on?

983
01:05:56,145 --> 01:05:57,510
You must wear underwear
when flying with me.

984
01:05:57,646 --> 01:05:58,408
I have.

985
01:05:58,614 --> 01:06:00,081
- OK.
- Let's go.

986
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:06,988
Is your friend looking for you?

987
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:08,688
No.

988
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:11,557
I've something to give you back.

989
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:16,357
You took it.

990
01:06:16,565 --> 01:06:18,829
Yes, I took it for fun.

991
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:20,862
For fun? Is it funny?

992
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,434
No, so I'm giving it back to you.

993
01:06:32,715 --> 01:06:35,479
- Anything else?
- No.

994
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:38,511
Goodbye.

995
01:06:47,063 --> 01:06:48,428
That's all.

996
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:02,776
You said you'll support my living,
are you serious?

997
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:09,484
Yes!

998
01:07:15,391 --> 01:07:17,154
You mustn't cheat me.

999
01:07:17,893 --> 01:07:20,862
I've said yes,
I'm only waiting for you to say "yes".

1000
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,933
Why don't you go aside and chat,
just don't be late.

1001
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:32,074
OK.

1002
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,536
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Never mind, come there.

1003
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:04,468
Let me introduce.

1004
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:05,972
This is Peter, our Producer,

1005
01:08:06,108 --> 01:08:07,973
And Johnny, our Associate Producer.

1006
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:10,209
Mr. Wan, morning.

1007
01:08:10,412 --> 01:08:12,380
- Morning!
- Morning.

1008
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:14,144
- Sit down.
- Please sit down.

1009
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:17,545
I've analysed the character.

1010
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,388
I've found there are 3 levels,
4 stages...

1011
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:22,648
And 5 different ways to act it.

1012
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:25,692
I've written it all down,
maybe we can discuss it.

1013
01:08:25,861 --> 01:08:26,919
Very good.

1014
01:08:27,196 --> 01:08:32,429
In order to let foreign audience
to accept me as a new actor...

1015
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:35,661
I'll have to
get an English name, Number.

1016
01:08:36,038 --> 01:08:38,199
Number? Number One?

1017
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,898
Yes, Number One.

1018
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:42,067
Good, excellent.

1019
01:08:42,178 --> 01:08:44,544
About the image, I also have...

1020
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,046
Tin Sau, the leading actor
was played by Big Brother.

1021
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:50,643
As he is too busy,

1022
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,582
we've decided to use a new actor.

1023
01:08:52,755 --> 01:08:53,915
Just then he called us up,

1024
01:08:54,056 --> 01:08:55,421
saying he has time for this movies.

1025
01:08:55,558 --> 01:08:58,425
So he'll be the leading actor.

1026
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:02,128
Then...

1027
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,461
If so,
I can play the role of the scoundrel.

1028
01:09:08,537 --> 01:09:11,404
For me, this is also a challenge.

1029
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:14,607
Sorry, we've chosen the actor
who plays the role of scoundrel.

1030
01:09:15,377 --> 01:09:20,940
Then... I think... there is...

1031
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:24,210
Mr. Wan, just as Cuckoo has said...

1032
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,614
we all know you're a professional actor.

1033
01:09:26,755 --> 01:09:27,517
Don't worry.

1034
01:09:27,656 --> 01:09:30,420
We'll get you another role.

1035
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:31,719
Thanks.

1036
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,988
What role is it?

1037
01:09:41,837 --> 01:09:43,202
You play the role of the lawyer.

1038
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:46,772
Read the script,
and remember your lines.

1039
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:48,672
Get prepared.

1040
01:09:49,044 --> 01:09:50,807
How many lines are there?

1041
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,313
You've three.

1042
01:09:58,454 --> 01:10:00,319
What are they?

1043
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:08,828
- The first is: "What".
- What?

1044
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:11,931
- The second is: "Yes".
- Yes...

1045
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:16,026
The third is: "Go away".

1046
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:24,239
I understand. I'll study them well.

1047
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,543
Mr. Wan, mind giving us back the script?

1048
01:10:54,276 --> 01:10:55,538
Tin Sau.

1049
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:05,219
- Don't be like this.
- Sorry.

1050
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:09,953
Mr. Wan, please take off the costume.

1051
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:11,526
We have clothes for you to change.

1052
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:12,887
This way please.

1053
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:14,453
Tin Sau.

1054
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:18,466
Sorry.

1055
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:24,537
Sister Cuckoo,
about the schedule of Big Brother...

1056
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,800
Go out first.

1057
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:27,270
It's usual in movie business.

1058
01:11:27,443 --> 01:11:28,705
Get out!

1059
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:48,761
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1060
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:54,433
My life is cheaper than ants.

1061
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:01,076
You ride a Mercedes,
while I pick my nose.

1062
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:06,318
It's worse than dying.

1063
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:11,891
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.

1064
01:12:37,752 --> 01:12:40,721
Kid, still want to play a character?

1065
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,791
- How may lines?
- Definitely more than 3.

1066
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,993
- What kind of role is it?
- A good guy.

1067
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:47,525
What movies is it?

1068
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:49,527
Don't ask so much, are you interested?

1069
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,996
- Yes.
- Come here.

1070
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:02,371
What is the situation?

1071
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:03,804
I'm working on it.

1072
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,274
Frankly.

1073
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,310
I'm not a real Unit Manager.

1074
01:13:07,482 --> 01:13:10,451
I'm Police Officer, he's my supervisor.

1075
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,779
We're from Criminal Intelligency Bureau.

1076
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,046
Or short-formed as C.I.B.

1077
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,181
To make it simple, I'm an undercover.

1078
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:17,453
You're an undercover?

1079
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,321
You don't believe that? I'm much better
than those so-called actors.

1080
01:13:20,495 --> 01:13:22,656
I'm more skillful.

1081
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:24,832
Because I'm acting every day
when I work here.

1082
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:27,830
Though I have no script,
I never make any NG.

1083
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:30,130
Because any NG
will cause the death of me.

1084
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,570
So I should be the Best Actor in Oscar.

1085
01:13:34,075 --> 01:13:35,337
Mighty!

1086
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:39,976
Today I should be going on
a mission with my informant.

1087
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:43,108
But he suffers from epilepsy suddenly,
be can't go with me.

1088
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:45,510
I want you to substitute him,

1089
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,315
We'll pay you $800
for being our informant.

1090
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:51,286
Money is not important,
I only want to practise my acting.

1091
01:13:51,426 --> 01:13:52,586
You surely can.

1092
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,899
Big Brother, policemen are outside,
you'd better run away.

1093
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,437
Buddy, just left, I'll stay behind.

1094
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,674
You betray me?

1095
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:16,477
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1096
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:21,511
What make me pull the trigger?

1097
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:23,624
I'll go to the robber's place
in an hour.

1098
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:26,727
And I want to install bugs
to collect their criminal evidence.

1099
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:29,022
But every time I got there,
they'll search me thoroughly.

1100
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:32,961
So, I want you to deliver a lunch box
to me, with the bugs inside.

1101
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:33,932
Then you go away.

1102
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:35,702
- You mean I am...
- The delivery boy.

1103
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:36,766
I have no...

1104
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,465
Your role is important,
grasp the chance.

1105
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,867
What about the character,
the relation and background?

1106
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,978
The character,
the relation and background...

1107
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,943
are all on the menu of the coffee shops.

1108
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:48,310
Study them now.

1109
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,783
But you must act accordingly
when you are on the scene.

1110
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,887
Why choose me?

1111
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:55,022
We need a professional actor.

1112
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:56,418
I think that person is you.

1113
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,421
You're the leading actor this time.

1114
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,671
What is there in a Mixed Grill?

1115
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:14,365
Pork chop, beef steak, chicken wing,
sausage, egg.

1116
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:15,567
And Set Lunch A?

1117
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,975
Sunny-side-up-egg, minced beef rice,
chicken corn soup.

1118
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:18,236
Coffee or tea.

1119
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:19,108
And Set Lunch B?

1120
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,975
Vegetable and pork rice, Chef'ss soup,
tea or coffee.

1121
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:23,047
- The charge for a cold drink is...
- $2.

1122
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,378
What is served all day round?

1123
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:25,644
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger.

1124
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,787
How much?

1125
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,254
- $20.
- Study it better, man.

1126
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:32,486
Chicken thigh salad, hamburger...

1127
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,856
What is there for in a Mixed Grill?

1128
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:35,963
You're a delivery boy now.

1129
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,429
Remember to play the role well.

1130
01:15:37,565 --> 01:15:39,226
I'll go into their place soon.

1131
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,097
I'll order the steamed rice with tomato
and egg at once.

1132
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,804
You must deliver it to me
in exactly 10 minutes.

1133
01:15:45,006 --> 01:15:46,064
Let's start.

1134
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:48,139
- It's formal?
- Yes.

1135
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,311
- No more rehearsal?
- No.

1136
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,506
- Could you say "Action" first
- Action.

1137
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,064
- Ben.
- Mao!

1138
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,739
Why didn't you ask me
to go to Macau with you?

1139
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:19,771
I did page you for that.

1140
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:21,134
When did you page me?

1141
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:22,038
I think you didn't turn the pager on.

1142
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,611
How come? I turn it on 24 hours.

1143
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,348
No wonder you're so poor.

1144
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:28,811
Hey, check my dick...

1145
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:32,012
This bastard takes advantages of
others all the time.

1146
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,187
Feel free to check it.

1147
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,190
Chu, greet Brother Mao.

1148
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:38,757
Just call me Mao, Brother Chu.

1149
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:42,221
Leather jacket again? Is it a gathering
for leather jacket wears?

1150
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,556
We've the same design too.

1151
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:47,459
I'm here to deliver food...

1152
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,227
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5, please.

1153
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:50,599
- Kee.
- Yes.

1154
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,330
His jacket is worn out naturally.

1155
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:53,532
Look at the texture.

1156
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,904
His jacket must be worn
for at least 20 years.

1157
01:16:57,378 --> 01:16:59,938
- Your grandpa left it to you?
- I bought it recently.

1158
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,311
Bastard.

1159
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,023
I want one too.

1160
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,395
Order some food now.

1161
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:25,038
Time for meal.

1162
01:17:25,673 --> 01:17:27,334
- Come over, help me.
- Time to eat.

1163
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,807
Mao, come here.

1164
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:36,584
Let's chat while eating.

1165
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:39,150
OK, good dishes!

1166
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,847
Good dishes? We can eat something
much better after the project.

1167
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,248
Project?

1168
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:45,655
Wait... no tomato and egg?

1169
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,420
I want tomato and egg,
I want rice with tomato and egg.

1170
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:50,927
No need, want tomato and egg?
Here it comes.

1171
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:52,190
How come?

1172
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:56,027
It's really tomato and egg, bingo.

1173
01:17:58,139 --> 01:17:59,299
Scrambled egg?

1174
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,568
No, I want sunny-side-up.

1175
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:03,744
Let me order sunny-side-up with tomato.

1176
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,980
Sunny-side-up? Chu,
make one for him now.

1177
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:10,311
Why making trouble?
Delivery service is convenient.

1178
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,281
You're asking for trouble indeed.

1179
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:14,512
Is it Kuen Fat?

1180
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,353
How come the delivery is so fast?

1181
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:22,827
Yeah, I haven't ordered yet.

1182
01:18:27,468 --> 01:18:28,730
Why is it taking so long?

1183
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:30,768
I still have something else to deliver,
men.

1184
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:32,234
Have you ordered anything?

1185
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,204
I ordered it, mutton stew.

1186
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:36,810
How come it is here so quick?

1187
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:37,875
Is it well done?

1188
01:18:38,112 --> 01:18:40,672
Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please!

1189
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,514
- I'll pay.
- No need.

1190
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,877
Why not? Let me pay.

1191
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,417
- I've said I'll pay.
- It's alright.

1192
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:46,747
I will pay.

1193
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:49,220
You pay next time, it's my bill.

1194
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,893
No... don't do that.

1195
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,690
Let me treat you this time!

1196
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:58,023
Just $40
and you two push around and around.

1197
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,564
Why don't you pay by credit card,
asshole!

1198
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,029
What did you say, bastard?

1199
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:04,195
Don't move, either you pay now
or I'll take it back.

1200
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,430
Or I'll pay for you.

1201
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:09,905
What are you doing?

1202
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:12,942
I've said many times,
why don't you walk closer?

1203
01:19:13,147 --> 01:19:14,614
Walk closer and shoot him from the top.

1204
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:16,784
Then blood won't splash on the wall.

1205
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:19,918
You never listen to me.
Can't you be a professional?

1206
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:31,356
But delivery boys
are very rude these days.

1207
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:32,828
They are always like this.

1208
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,526
Let's eat.

1209
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,832
Who is it?

1210
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:40,338
I'm here to deliver some food.

1211
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,976
Go and take a look, Chu...

1212
01:19:54,522 --> 01:19:55,989
How are you,
I'm here to delivery some food.

1213
01:19:56,257 --> 01:19:57,417
OK.

1214
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,859
Steamed rice with tomato and egg,
$25.5 please.

1215
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:01,824
You ordered that?

1216
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:04,464
No, I haven't.

1217
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:07,735
You haven't ordered?

1218
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,131
Have you come to the wrong place?

1219
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,735
- N0.7.
- N0.7?

1220
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:19,146
It's N0.1, send it to N0.1.

1221
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,482
Do you still want it?

1222
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,585
Are you out of your mind,
I didn't order it.

1223
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:25,846
Rice with tomato and egg?

1224
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:34,988
What do you mean? Are you nuts, Go away.

1225
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:39,195
You want rice with tomato and egg,
I'll take it.

1226
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,925
No, someone else ordered it.

1227
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,232
I said I want it, come here.

1228
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,440
Come here!

1229
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:50,337
Can you give it to us first?

1230
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:00,081
What a coincidence! N0.1 also
ordered rice with tomato and egg.

1231
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,352
Is tomato and egg good?

1232
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:04,184
The egg and tomato are both nutritious.

1233
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,154
What do you mean nutritious?

1234
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,158
It contains a lot of Vitamin C.

1235
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,455
Other fruits contain that too.

1236
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:10,257
Other fruits don't contain
as much as tomato.

1237
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:11,693
You don't want the money?

1238
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:14,427
$25.5 please.

1239
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:15,499
How come it's so expensive?

1240
01:21:15,703 --> 01:21:17,261
- It's one and a half order.
- How much for one order?

1241
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,530
$36.8.

1242
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:19,799
How come it is more expensive?

1243
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,239
It's 12.2 for one order.

1244
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,171
And how much for one and a half order?

1245
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,274
$36.8.

1246
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,469
You just said $25.5.

1247
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:26,206
It's $25.5.

1248
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,540
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1249
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:28,344
What?

1250
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,950
What was served
for breakfast this morning?

1251
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:31,051
Ham and egg.

1252
01:21:31,285 --> 01:21:32,343
How much is it?

1253
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,351
$12.2.

1254
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:34,488
How much if I want one and a half order?

1255
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:35,586
$25.5.

1256
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,052
How come there is
one and a half order for breakfast?

1257
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:39,219
You can order two extra sausages.

1258
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,225
How much if I want 3 extra sausages?

1259
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:42,224
Don't do that.

1260
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,692
How much is it?

1261
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,530
I'm only a delivery boy.

1262
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,962
I ask you how much it is.

1263
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:49,767
I don't know.

1264
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:50,962
How much?

1265
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,970
I'm really a delivery boy!

1266
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,337
You are not!

1267
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:59,838
Kid, tell us frankly,
are you a delivery boy?

1268
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,316
- I've just started work today!
- Just started work today?

1269
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,418
I didn't know being delivery boy
must answer so many questions.

1270
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:05,643
Don't fucking fool me?

1271
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,421
What are you doing? Are you a cop?

1272
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:09,681
Yes, what's wrong?

1273
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,156
I'm really a delivery boy.

1274
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,724
Nothing... he's an idiot.

1275
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:19,432
Search him if you don't believe.
Search him!

1276
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:26,229
Kid, I let you go now,
be smart in future!

1277
01:22:31,946 --> 01:22:33,208
What is it?

1278
01:22:37,718 --> 01:22:39,583
Why did you do this?

1279
01:22:45,793 --> 01:22:47,454
What do you want?

1280
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,396
What is it?

1281
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,806
Want to harm me?

1282
01:23:39,313 --> 01:23:42,874
Sorry, I'm an undercover.

1283
01:23:55,696 --> 01:23:56,958
Cut.

1284
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:00,498
How's that?

1285
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,600
I'm fine, I'm still alive.

1286
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,136
I mean my performance.

1287
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:08,967
Very well, as this is your first time
being the leading actor.

1288
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,672
Good take.

1289
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:13,371
Thanks.

1290
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,110
I'll call to police.

1291
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:21,246
- Police!
- Freeze!

1292
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,482
He's on my side...

1293
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,350
Call the ambulance!

1294
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:34,659
Piu Piu.

1295
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,568
What's going on? It's dark already,
and you didn't give me a call?

1296
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,334
- Shall l cook dinner for you?
- Just then I...

1297
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,467
What's happen to you?
Didn't you play as the leading actor?

1298
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,838
I don't care whether
you're a leading actor or an extra.

1299
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,344
You must support my living forever.

1300
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,639
Come on, try it
and see if it suits or not.

1301
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,119
Red? Is it lipstick?
You're dating someone else?

1302
01:24:52,553 --> 01:24:53,815
I forgive you but...

1303
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:56,581
I won't cook for you
if you dare next time, go!

1304
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,595
What are you looking at?
Fight back, nuts!

1305
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:07,626
Piu Piu, I love you.

1306
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,478
Wait

1307
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,248
You two mustn't get married!

1308
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,425
Why?

1309
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,925
Because you guys are brother and sister.

1310
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:38,294
Sister, I'm sorry.

1311
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:41,363
It's not your business,
I'm willing myself.

1312
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,231
Your mood is wrong for this situation.

1313
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:45,372
I've told you before.

1314
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:48,940
Mood begins from your heart,
then goes to the outside of your body...

1315
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,872
and returns to the heart, got it?

1316
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,571
- Yes, got it.
- Don't be nervous.

1317
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,109
I'm not nervous.

1318
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,245
Sau, I think
the role of Master suits you more.

1319
01:25:58,386 --> 01:25:59,853
Why don't you play it?

1320
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:03,184
Forget it, I'm not talented in acting.

1321
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,187
I'd better be audience.

1322
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,918
Not at all.

1323
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:07,858
You're good.

1324
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:09,963
Brother Sau,
audience are waiting outside.

1325
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:11,064
- Are they?
- Hurry up.

1326
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:12,928
- Take off your clothes first.
- For what?

1327
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:13,862
I'll play it.

1328
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,502
- Oh, no.
- Give it to me.

1329
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:16,898
But you're not talented.

1330
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:18,062
I'm not? Are you talented then?

1331
01:26:18,172 --> 01:26:19,230
I am.

1332
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,034
Give it to me!

1333
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:24,369
- No.
- Sau, stop fighting.

1334
01:26:24,545 --> 01:26:27,309
Stop fighting, eat potato chips,
why fighting for?

1335
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:46,232
There're really many audience.

1336
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,062
Sure, as we have special guests today.

1337
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,931
Sister Cuckoo comes to help us today.

1338
01:26:52,506 --> 01:26:53,564
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.

1339
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:55,470
You're welcome, we finally have
the chance to act on the same stage.

1340
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:56,643
Thanks!

1341
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,638
Kung Hei Fat Choi! Thanks!

1342
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:01,782
Happy New Year.

1343
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:04,213
Congraduation! Everybody cheers up.

1344
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:05,979
Thanks! Kung Hei!
