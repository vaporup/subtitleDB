1
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,485
What?

2
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,779
I said I just wanted to speak

3
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,886
What the hell? What's with
the way you fucking talk?

4
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,799
Who the fuck are you?

5
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,601
My...

6
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,605
name is...

7
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:26,676
Oh Daesu

8
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,380
Why are you picking on
someone else's girlfriend?

9
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,784
Hold on

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,391
Am I picking on you? Mr. Oh Daesu!

11
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,392
Am I picking on you? Fuck!

12
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,393

00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,093
Fuck!

15
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,602
Oh Daesu please sit down

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,302
Oh boy Must have drunk a lot

17
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,201
Who the hell did I pick on?
Hold on, let me piss first

18
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,212
Hey, this is a police
station I didn't do anything!

19
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,078
Hey! You son of a bitch!

20
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,685
We really have to do something about him

21
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,787
Asshole! Mr. Oh Daesu

22
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,582

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,694
Cute, huh? Yeah I saw it Now go sit down

26
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,096
Today's my daughter's birthday

27
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,103
I got her a present for her birthday

28
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,300
Snatches of clouds
floatin the sky Ah, great

29
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,207
A pleasure boat floats in the river

30
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,077
My name Oh Daesu, means...

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:37,188
"Getting along with people"
That's why I'm Oh Daesu

32
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,689
But, shit...

33
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:46,187
Why can't I get along
today? Set me free!

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,996
Huh! Shut the hell up! Shush!

35
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,000
Set me free!

36
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,488
Let go of me, damn it!

37
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,182
That son of a bitch really
needs some prison time

38
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,191
Get away from me!

39
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,796
Hey, get him! Ow, fuck, ouch!

40
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,896
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk

41
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,006
and cause trouble again

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,108
Have a nice day Officer

00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,902

47
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,286

00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,094
Hello?

61
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,493
Oh hello, Ja hyun I'm sorry

62
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,497
I know it's very late

63
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,899
Daesu is on his way now I'm sorry

64
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,495
Yes? Hold on Daesu, it's your wife

65
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,804
Daesu!

66
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,313
Daesu!

67
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,573
Daesu!

68
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,382
Hey, Daesu!

69
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,183
Daesu!

70
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,600
Hey, Daesu! Couldn't you hurry up a bit

71
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,095
Hey, stop fooling around and let's go

72
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,600
Ah, great

73
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,603
Daesu!

74
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,207
Daesu!

75
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,782
Hey, Daesu!

76
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,197
Sir, sir Wait come here

77
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,702
Come talk to me

78
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,605
I won't tell you to let me go

79
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,211
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?

80
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,006
I should know the reason at least

81
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,012
Shit, I've been locked up here

82
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,676
for two months already

83
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,379
Sir, wait, come here

84
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,686
Sir, wait What is this place?

85
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,294
Sir, just tell me how
long I have to stay in here

86
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,294
Just tell me that, huh?

87
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,390
Sir! Fuck you!

88
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,899
Come here, you asshole! Son of a bitch

89
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,405
I saw your face, asshole

90
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,909
You're dead if I get
out Come here, asshole

91
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,706
I'm sorry I won't curse

92
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,579
Just tell me One month, two

93
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,778
or three? Hey!

94
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,980
Hey, where are you going?

95
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,490
Just tell me how long
you son of a bitch!

96
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,996
I said tell me how long

97
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:18,300
you asshole! You son of a bitch!

98
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,306
You fucking assholes!
If they had told me

99
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,104
it was going to be 15 years

100
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,605
could it have been easier to endure?

101
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,576
Or could it have not?

102
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,091
When the melody turns on gas comes out

103
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,300
When the gas comes I fall asleep

104
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,581
I found out later

105
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,179
that it's the same Valium
gas Russian soldiers used

106
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,485
on the Chechen terrorists

107
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,193
When I wake up my hair has been cut

108
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,901
I don't like the style really

109
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,603
But they change my clothes
and clean the place up

110
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,714
Grateful bastards

111
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,875
One

112
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,385
two

113
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,381
three

114
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,793
It's too spicy

115
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,897
I don't want spinach You eat it

116
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,999
I won't eat spinach

117
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,594
I don't want to eat spinach

118
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:57,998
Kim Jahyun's body was found

119
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,605
deeply stabbed in the neck

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,800
Seeing that it was a cold blooded murder

121
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,207
with nothing valuable stolen

122
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,905
police suspect that the
motive was out of hatred

123
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,485
Her husband who disappeared
a year ago is a prime suspect

124
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,986
According to witnesses
her husband, Oh Daesu

125
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,489
drank often causing
trouble with his wife

126
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,083
and neighbors said
they fought frequently

127
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,392
Blood samples found at the scene

128
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,091
matched Oh Daesu's

129
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,701
Fingerprints found on a cup

130
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,895
also matched Oh Daesu's

131
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,099
It was confirmed by sources that

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,608
Oh Daesu visited his wife recently

133
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,608
The stolen family album

134
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,182
also backs their theories

135
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,877
After three years

136
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,881
many wrinkles have formed on his face

137
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,090
Ah, that is around 8
million wons 8 million wons?

138
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,197
For a knife 8 million wons...

139
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,799
Of course for a sushi master
you need the best tools

140
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,095
If you stand aimlessly

141
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,603
at a phone booth on a rainy day

142
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,608
and meet a man whose face is
covered by a violet umbrella,

143
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,708
I'd suggest that you get close to the TV

144
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,576
The television is both
a clock and calendar

145
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,085
It's your school, home

146
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,090
church, friend

147
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,285
and lover

148
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,095
But...

149
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,885
But,

150
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,785
my lover's song

151
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,282
is too short

152
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,895
This morning around 7:30 the top 50m of

153
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,904
the Sungsoo Bridge in Seoul
suddenly collapsed in the middle...

154
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,099
I wrote down all the people

155
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,201
whom I fought with, bothered, and hurt

156
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,874
This was both my prison journal

157
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,181
and autobiography of my evil deeds

158
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,383
I thought I had lived an average life

159
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,196
but I've sinned too much

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,706
All I thought about at that moment

161
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,005
was that the guy next door

162
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,082
probably ate with one chopstick

163
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,679
But...

164
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,479
But

165
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,089
who would've imprisoned me?

166
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,299
Was it Yoo Heung sam?

167
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,496
Lee So young or Kang Changsuk?

168
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,104
Whoever it was, just wait

169
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,711
Wait a bit more

170
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,813
I'll rip your whole body apart

171
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,975
and no one will be able
to find your body anywhere

172
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:11,178
Because I'm going to chew it all down

173
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,213
One line for one year

174
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,182
I have to sew six lines

175
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,184
at first

176
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,785
I guess next year will be easier

177
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,589
The more the tattoos
the shorter the chopstick

178
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:57,198
The shorter the chopstick the
bigger the wall's hole gets

179
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,098
Anyway,

180
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,706
time passes well

181
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,709
9 years

182
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,182
10 years

183
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,390
11 years

184
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,202
Enforcement of an arrest warrant

185
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,798
Handover of Hong Kong
Yesterday's convention center

186
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,910

198
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,612
I'll be out in a month

199
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,080
I'll be out

200
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,879
I'll be out after a
month I'll be out of here

201
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,080
I'll be out in a month
In exactly one month

202
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,485
I'll be out

203
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,591
I'll need money when I get out

204
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,389
So what should I do?

205
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,499
Should I steal or rob?

206
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,399
What shall I eat first?

207
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,301
Anything will be fine
except for fried dumplings

208
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,101
Where am I anyway?

209
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,210
With all the cars honking
it must be the city

210
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,803
The most important thing
is what floor I'm on

211
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,782
What if I pierce through the
wall and it's the 52nd floor?

212
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,685
Even if I fall to my
death I'm still getting out

213
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,590
I'm getting out I'm getting out
In one month, I'm getting out

214
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,190
Right now

215
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,987
you're lying on a plain

216
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,997
When you hear the bell

217
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:19,295
you will turn your head and look down

218
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:27,702
You will see an endless
field of green grass

219
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,479
The sun is shining bright

220
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,086
and there's a cool breeze

221
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,101
It's a human being

222
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,983
Don't stop me!

223
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,193
Mister

224
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,792
Even though

225
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,492
I'm no worst than a beast

226
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:37,303
don't I have the right to live?

227
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,707
Mister

228
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,679
Even though

229
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:51,984
I'm no worst than a beast

230
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,086
don't I have the right to live?

231
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,891
Yes

232
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,393
That phone booth alley was just here

233
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,395
Now there's an apartment building

234
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,291
So he throws me on the
roof What a numskull

235
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:42,896
I want to tell you my
story Delay your death

236
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,100
What?

237
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,486
I see

238
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,487
Of course

239
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,893
Now I'll tell you my story

240
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,098
You see

241
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,000
the reason why I want to die...

242
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,809
Hey!

243
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,475
It's a woman being

244
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,798
That lunatic... Hurry, go!

245
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,304
Hey, Mr! Come over here!

246
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,979
Laugh and the world laughs with you

247
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:03,486
Weep and you weep alone

248
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,985
My home is gone

249
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,595
I can't call either
my friend or relatives

250
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,796
Since I'm the one who murdered my wife

251
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,903
Since I'm a fugitive

252
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,209
Really Come on, you will lose

253
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,377
Yeah, I agree You little piece of shit

254
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,900
You dickshit!

255
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,378
Dickshit...

256
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,483
Never heard of it

257
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,384
Since the TV doesn't
teach you curse words

258
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,489
Can imaginary training

259
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,202
for 15 years be put to use?

260
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,211
It can

261
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:43,882
Oplegnathus fasciatus

262
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,480
Lives in the warm waters

263
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,491
of coastal reefs

264
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,788
A fish with weak reflexes

265
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,693
but can resist unyieldingly
once it's caught in a hook

266
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,995
In Kyungsang Province its offspring...

267
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,296
What's this smell?

268
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,675
Don't even think about
asking me any questions

269
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,984
I don't know a thing

270
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,900
Yes?

271
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,610
I said I want

272
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,374
something alive

273
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,185
Oh, right

274
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,883
Long time no see This is my first time

275
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,189
Maybe not? But she looks familiar

276
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,998
You look very familiar

277
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,396
Have I seen you somewhere?

278
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,903
"Searching for the Best Chefs"

279
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,701
"On Ch 11 every Thursday at 6:30"

280
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,310
"The youngest female
chef of Japanese food"

281
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,413
Oh that?

282
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,675
They said the ratings are
low but I guess it's popular

283
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,480
Women's hands are usually
warm so they can't make sushi

284
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:26,079
Wow, you sure do know a lot

285
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,199
Who are you?

286
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,107
Do you like your clothes?

287
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,983
Why...

288
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,384
Why did you imprison me?
Who do you think I am?

289
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,695
Yoo Heungsam? Wrong

290
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,595
Did Lee Soyoung hire
you? No, wrong again

291
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,598
Lee Jongyong?

292
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,703
Kang Changsuk?

293
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:17,103
Hwang Jooyeun? Kim Nasung? Park Ji woo?

294
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,008
Im Dukyoon? Lee Jaepyung? Kuk
Suran? Who the hell are you?

295
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,980
Me? I'm sort of a scholar

296
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,175
And my major is you

297
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:33,189
A scholar studying Oh
Daesu An expert on Oh Daesu

298
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,385
Who I am isn't important
Why is important

299
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:41,090
Think it over Review your whole lifetime

300
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,702
Since school is over it's
time for your homework Right?

301
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,803
Keep this in mind

302
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,209
"Be it a grain of sand or rock,

303
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,313
in water they sink as the same"

304
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,979
Let me ask you one thing

305
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,985
You hypnotized me in there didn't you?

306
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,881
What did you do to me?

307
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:11,189
I miss you... Hurry and come to me

308
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,300
Here you are

309
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,509
It's alive, right?

310
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,981
I'll slice it up now

311
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,583
I must be a different breed of
women My hands are very cold, you see

312
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,689
What's with her?

313
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,391
Sir

314
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,893
Sir

315
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,695
Keep this in mind

316
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,902
"Be it a grain of sand or rock,

317
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:38,379
in water they sink as the same"

318
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,282
Awake now?

319
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,999
Is this true?

320
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,082
That fever remedy really works

321
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:27,596
Why'd you faint if you trained so much?

322
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:34,702
A lack of needed sunlight
depletes you of vitamins A and E

323
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:40,200
So I'm not immune to influenza

324
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,176
Do you usually talk that way?

325
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,292
The bathroom door is
broken and doesn't lock

326
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,091
Don't get any bright ideas

327
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,700
Or else I'll slice you like sushi

328
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,601
What's this?

329
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,904
Suppositories

330
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,703
How else could I feed you
medicine if you fainted?

331
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:31,385
Can imaginary training
for 15 years be put to use?

332
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,702
It can't

333
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,589
That was very bad of me

334
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:07,792
After bringing you
here and rejecting you,

335
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,400
I understand why you're mad

336
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,503
I do

337
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,207
I brought you here
because I like you, too

338
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,313
But...

339
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,284
You even don't know my name

340
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,477
I'm Mido

341
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,883
You see

342
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,288
Later

343
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,794
When I'm really ready later,

344
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,696
I swear on my life that I will

345
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:47,600
That song, "The Face I Miss"
in your diary, That's the sign

346
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,502
When I sing it

347
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,906
then get yourself ready

348
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,409
When it actually happens...

349
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:02,076
I could resist again at
the heat of the moment

350
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,688
But no matter what don't ever back out

351
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,280
Just give it to me!

352
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,297
Give it

353
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,695
to me?

354
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,205
The ants...

355
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,909
Do you still see them?

356
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,205
Do you still feel that way?

357
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,775
Yeah, if you're alone you see the ants

358
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,580
Very lonely people that I met

359
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,088
they all hallucinated ants at one time

360
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,684
After I thought about it

361
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,990
ants move around in groups

362
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:51,896
you know So I guess very lonely
people keep thinking about ants

363
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,899
Even though I never did

364
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,302
She called from overseas
five or six years ago

365
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,406
asking if her dad showed up

366
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:07,109
She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother

367
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,875
Since she has few relatives she calls us

368
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,577
Her Korean has gotten bad

369
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,484
I think her foster
parents are both doctors

370
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,295
Anyhow, Miss Reporter

371
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,895
Daesu really hasn't been caught yet?

372
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:42,607
Your daughter's address is on the front and
on the back is a map to your wife's grave

373
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,985
Eva...

374
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,577
Stockholm... Eva...

375
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,983
Do you want to call her?

376
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,800
Want me to call her?

377
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,105
Wanna go to the grave together?

378
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,176
No, after I kill

379
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,286
that bastard first

380
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,883
Blue Dragon Is it right?

381
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,986
I haven't chewed it yet

382
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,892
Blue Dragon So?

383
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,696
Is that the taste?

384
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,911
Be it 10 or 100 restaurants
it doesn't matter

385
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,683
I can never forget that taste
for 15 years, Blue Dragon

386
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,078
Want me to make you an ID to log in?

387
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,986
Do you have a favorite movie or song?

388
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:11,294
I talked to him

389
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,196
The Count of Monte Cristo?

390
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,000
There's no one by that name here

391
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,489
How's life in a bigger prison Oh Daesu?

392
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,990
Who are you?

393
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,696
Who are you?

394
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,095
The lonely prince in the
high tower, Don't forget me

395
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,701
Who's this bastard?

396
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,802
I don't know him I just
chat with him sometimes

397
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,209
And talk about sushi, too

398
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,281
Where are you going?

399
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,500
Where are you going? I can't trust you

400
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,986
Magic Blue Dragon

401
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:50,089
Magic Blue Dragon! What could that mean?

402
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,301
Why the hell did they order
from a restaurant this far away?

403
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,007
I've gone by five Chinese
restaurants already

404
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,383
My lungs feel like exploding

405
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,185
Tell your cooks to put

406
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,890
less scallions in the dumplings

407
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,895
Sure

408
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,209
Set it down and go Okay

409
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,284
We don't work on anyone
being protected by bodyguards

410
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,287
There are other people
who specialize in that

411
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,789
You can hire them

412
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,292
We just work on the small fries

413
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,993
If it's over six months
transportation fee is free

414
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,000
Yes, of course

415
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,604
Why'd you lock me up, you...

416
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,770
Dickshit

417
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,082
In our 7.5 floor business,

418
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,188
our clients' info is top secret

419
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,902
I'm going to pay you
back for all 15 years

420
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,272
Each one I yank out will
make you age one year

421
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,505
Ready to talk?

422
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,590
I don't know

423
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,399
I didn't see his face

424
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,697
I recorded it

425
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,685
AB blood types raise your hand

426
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,707
Go, he lost a lot of blood

427
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,306
Damn, look at him Is he dead?

428
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,878
You little piece of shit... Damn

429
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,390
Hey, you piece of shit!

430
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,600
Go, motherfucker! Get the fuck out!

431
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,082
Hey, fuckface!

432
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,480
What, you fucked up son of a bitch!

433
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,003
Just kill him damn asshole

434
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,303
Fucking goddamn asshole!

435
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,379
I'm almost done Stay still

436
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,585
As expected

437
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,988
I can't get along today either

438
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,887
I've now

439
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,793
become a monster

440
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:46,096
When my vengeance is over,

441
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,704
can I return as the old Daesu?

442
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,611
Mister, are you alright?

443
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,182
Look at all this blood

444
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,878
Mister, what happened to you?

445
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,488
Saewoon Apartments
in Eung am, building 8

446
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,595
Please take care of him

447
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,196
Thank you Not at all

448
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,394
Well, then...

449
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,703
Farewell Oh Daesu

450
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,202
Farewell Oh Daesu

451
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,276
Oh Daesu

452
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,483
Farewell

453
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,879
Farewell

454
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,907
Any bastard you hate,

455
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,775
but can't dare to kill
Any bitch you detest,

456
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,883
but want more than kill
We are at your service

457
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,182
Wouldn't he go crazy if he's
locked up for a long time?

458
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,686
Well, if you prefer he doesn't

459
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:49,690
we can mix drugs into his drink

460
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,192
Ristedal Solution

461
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,993
It's a well trusted drug
used to treat schizophrenia

462
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,592
Well, the duration is important

463
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:04,696
so how long will he... 15 years

464
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,773
Too long? What did he do?

465
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,576
Oh Daesu, you see

466
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,981
talks too much

467
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,382
Go to sleep

468
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,687
Time to visit Joo hwan at
the Internet cafe tomorrow

469
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,597
Sit wherever you'd like

470
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,807
Joo hwan

471
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,380
Oh Daesu, you see

472
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,889
talks too much

473
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,595
Have you heard this voice before?

474
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,902
Is there anyone who hates me this much?

475
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:17,675
I don't know all the 260 names

476
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,679
of your women's husbands

477
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,287
Who's Mido? This girl
who cries over nothing

478
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,804
Joo hwan

479
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,000
Did I

480
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,079
really talk too much?

481
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,278
My friend,

482
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,284
I'd like for you

483
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:02,984
to find that criminal
among people you're close to

484
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,333
Congratulations

485
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,105
Your case was automatically
dismissed yesterday

486
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,873
But remember this by all means

487
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,483
Open quote

488
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,278
Like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter...

489
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,585
Like a bird from the
snare of the fowler...

490
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,285
Free yourself

491
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,898
Close quote Who are you?

492
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,197
What about you you rotten bastard?

493
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,805
I made up my mind when I was imprisoned

494
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,704
That I won't trust anyone if I get out

495
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,209
If there's anyone who I find suspicious

496
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,576
then I'll create a secret that
person and I will only know

497
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:03,584
That ID, Monster, is a trap
that I made to catch you

498
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,588
You lead a stranger to your
place Who the hell are you?

499
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,197
Who's Evergreen?

500
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:30,270
I tracked down that Evergreen
ID and found the owner's name

501
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,778
Ready to jot it down?

502
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,079
It's Su Daeoh, That's
a strange rare surname

503
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,278
Address? In Eungam

504
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,982
Saewoon Apartments Building 7, room 407

505
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,392
I'm not doing fine Within
life in a bigger prison...

506
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,480
"Evergreen"

507
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,991
"Who are you?"

508
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,988
You meant to ask this, right?

509
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:27,602
You must find out on your
own Come on, it's a game

510
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:31,696
First, who? Then, why?

511
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,309
If you figure it out come see me anytime

512
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:39,381
I'll raise your score
You have until July 5th

513
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,778
Oh no, only five days left

514
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,381
Too short?

515
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:53,588
Hang in there If you succeed
I'll kill myself and not Mido

516
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,495
That's right, Mido

517
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,697
I'm going to kill every woman

518
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,602
you love until you die

519
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,101
Well, you're notorious

520
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,905
for not protecting your women

521
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:19,587
Wow, you're strong Mr. Monster

522
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,692
Yes, you are the very monster I created

523
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,290
But you won't find out

524
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,398
the "why?" if you do this
15 years of being curious

525
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:35,903
would go to waste So
is that okay with you?

526
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,280
Sit down there

527
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,289
Oh, the famous teeth torture

528
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,188
You won't have enough time to torture me

529
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:03,095
Since I have a weak heart I
have a pacemaker in my chest

530
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,292
When it was put in

531
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,699
know what I asked the doctor?

532
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:16,411
Doctor Hopkins give me a remote control

533
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,273
to turn that motor off

534
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:23,284
Pardon? Why?

535
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:29,786
So that I can kill
myself easily at anytime

536
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,089
I'll give you $100,000 more

537
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,405
Oh, what will you do?

538
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,276
You want to kill me right away

539
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,282
but you won't know
why you were imprisoned

540
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,087
You want to torture me but
I say I'll kill myself first

541
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:06,885
Do you seek revenge or
do you find the truth?

542
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,094
Oh, you're in a tough spot

543
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,795
I've been watching over you for 15 years

544
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,805
I faired well thanks to you

545
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:23,470
I wasn't bored or lonely

546
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:29,074
Seeking revenge is the best
cure for someone who got hurt

547
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,380
Try it

548
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:37,990
The loss of 15 years the pain of losing

549
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,892
your wife and child
you can forget all this

550
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:47,196
Once again revenge is
good for your health

551
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:51,304
But... What happens after
you've revenged yourself?

552
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:56,203
I bet that hidden pain will
probably come back again

553
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,276
Are you there, Daesu?

554
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,478
Daesu,

555
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,384
long time no see

556
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,994
Hasn't she been tied up for too long?

557
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,192
I think you also left the door open

558
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,979
Please save me

559
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,384
But I could die first
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer

560
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,582
had a very shiny nose

561
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,290
This dentist is really good

562
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,206
Don't move

563
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,811
Don't move

564
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,476
What's with you?

565
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,486
Now...

566
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,590
Here we go

567
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,811
You see

568
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,376
they say that people

569
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,077
shrivel up because
they have an imagination

570
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:47,280
So do not imagine

571
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,483
You'll become brave as hell

572
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,687
Now, here comes the real thing

573
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,490
Yes?

574
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,288
You know I'm glad

575
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:29,694
you told me about this place

576
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,698
but I haven't even started

577
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,201
What?

578
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,581
Let's go

579
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,699
Let's really go

580
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,605
Let's fight

581
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,404
Let's fight

582
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:24,182
What a roughneck Your hand

583
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,289
I'm going to chop off your hand

584
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:31,689
You touched Mido's breasts

585
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,996
Then what about my tongue?

586
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:57,780
You still don't trust me

587
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,586
you rotten bastard?

588
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,789
It looks hard to accomplish

589
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,392
I looked into it,

590
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,587
and the reason why the bank
refused to pay $270 m; Il; on

591
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,494
isn't because our building
has any irregularities,

592
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,601
They have an internal
problem at their bank

593
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:18,783
So I think there won't be any problems

594
01:01:18,923 --> 01:01:24,054
Although Chairman Choi's

595
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:25,753
equity share is at 25 percent...

596
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:34,262
Daesu

597
01:01:35,407 --> 01:01:36,874
Yeah

598
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,477
Did he really say that he'll kill me?

599
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,181
Yeah

600
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:50,276
Because you love me?

601
01:01:55,427 --> 01:01:56,951
Daesu

602
01:01:58,596 --> 01:01:59,756
What?

603
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:04,362
I wonder where my love is

604
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:09,669
The night is getting lonelier

605
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:16,879
The words we spoke through our eyes

606
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:21,076
can be felt through the hands

607
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,286
So many nights have passed

608
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:30,656
Yet my feelings are constant towards you

609
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:35,364
Tears flood out from my eyes

610
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,460
But there is a face that I miss

611
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:49,476
They packed their stuff
and left in a rental car

612
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:56,585
Mido called the restaurant and quit

613
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:02,086
Let's go after this is done

614
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:06,161
You should get some rest today

615
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,159
I can't even sleep

616
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:12,667
Since I am forlorn

617
01:03:13,304 --> 01:03:15,363
Mr. Han

618
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:18,367
Do you really think

619
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,568
Mido has fallen in love with Daesu?

620
01:03:23,815 --> 01:03:26,375
Already?

621
01:03:45,603 --> 01:03:50,267
Daesu, it really hurts

622
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:54,169
But I'm enduring it

623
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:56,280
You must know this

624
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:14,053
How'd you hold out? For 15 years?

625
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:16,367
There's always a way

626
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:19,361
Do you like it?

627
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:22,964
You really like it, right?

628
01:04:23,107 --> 01:04:26,167
I want to be good to you

629
01:04:54,105 --> 01:04:56,573
Do not worry about future

630
01:04:57,909 --> 01:04:59,968
Don't imagine anything

631
01:05:10,922 --> 01:05:14,585
I feel like thanking all
those years in that prison

632
01:05:16,694 --> 01:05:18,662
If I wasn't in there,

633
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:21,856
could Mido have liked me still?

634
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:59,156
He could only know that I wanted

635
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:02,664
to chop off Mr. Park's
hand by putting a bug on us

636
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,462
and he knew our whereabouts

637
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:08,572
by tailing us

638
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:10,571
I've been bugged Please find it

639
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:15,270
You know maybe he freed you

640
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:17,278
because he has fun watching you

641
01:07:17,415 --> 01:07:20,179
run wild seeking revenge

642
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:23,184
And never tell you why

643
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:25,789
so he can toy with you forever

644
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:28,886
You think that's why?

645
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:32,854

Welcome to Evergreen Old Boys

654
01:07:57,321 --> 01:08:01,690
The Sangnok High School Alumni Homepage

655
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:19,970
But it's time to close up

656
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:25,071
Can't I look at the
records of Class '79?

657
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,582
It's dark so turn on the lights

658
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:36,959
Take your time

659
01:08:40,398 --> 01:08:43,856
Joo hwan? Let me ask you something

660
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:47,569
Do you know Lee Woojin of Class '79?

661
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:50,265
I think he went to America to study

662
01:08:50,608 --> 01:08:52,473
Lee Woojin?

663
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:56,774
Don't know him So is
that the bastard's name?

664
01:08:56,914 --> 01:08:58,882
How'd you find out?

665
01:08:59,016 --> 01:09:01,780
I looked through all the
school's albums and found his face

666
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,979
I don't know who someone
is just with a name

667
01:09:05,123 --> 01:09:06,681
Got anything else?

668
01:09:06,824 --> 01:09:09,691
Why don't you look for the
school records or something?

669
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:12,853
Do you know Lee Soo ah?
She was in the same grade

670
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:14,464
Lee Soo ah?

671
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:17,868
She died What class was she in?

672
01:09:18,002 --> 01:09:21,062
Homeroom two of our senior
year She was in my room

673
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:25,073
Next to yours So what about her?

674
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:28,778
Why is there no photo?

675
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:33,075
Ah, she died so that's why

676
01:09:33,217 --> 01:09:35,583
How did Soo ah die?

677
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,278
That's right, you wouldn't know

678
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:40,879
She died after you transferred

679
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:45,762
She went alone to the Habchun

680
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:48,957
and fell into the river

681
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:53,761
She croaked like a dead fish

682
01:09:53,905 --> 01:09:56,965
A week later they found her
bloated body in the water

683
01:09:57,108 --> 01:09:59,576
What was she like? Her?

684
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,769
She was a total slut

685
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:05,576
On the outside she acted like a prude

686
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:09,083
but she was a filthy whore on the inside

687
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,187
Rumors had it that

688
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:14,087
that slut fucked everyone at school

689
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:18,355
I should've gotten in there

690
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:24,962
I also heard that her
family was really rich

691
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:27,070
Her grades were good, too

692
01:10:27,205 --> 01:10:29,867
But the bad thing was
that she was a slut

693
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:31,668
Man

694
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:34,676
Wow, this is such an old story

695
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:35,779
Daesu!

696
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:38,381
Daesu, I don't remember
since it was so long ago

697
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:42,680
but that Soo ah, you see...
Wait, Daesu, you also...

698
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,259
Hey what's going on? Hey!

699
01:10:58,603 --> 01:11:00,662
Joo hwan!

700
01:11:01,005 --> 01:11:03,974
Joo hwan, what's with you?

701
01:11:04,108 --> 01:11:05,769
Joo hwan!

702
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,577
Joo hwan!

703
01:11:08,512 --> 01:11:10,571
Daesu

704
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:12,273
Daesu?

705
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:17,586
My sister wasn't a slut

706
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:21,382
You must accept this

707
01:11:24,595 --> 01:11:27,120
Since you got rid of your bug

708
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:28,665
I had to come all the way here

709
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,662
To eavesdrop

710
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:33,661
So that's why Joo hwan

711
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:37,565
died because of you

712
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:39,776
Okay?

713
01:11:52,023 --> 01:11:54,890
I'm going to kill you!

714
01:11:55,026 --> 01:11:57,256
You son of a bitch!

715
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:00,261
I am going to rip you into little pieces

716
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:22,385
You motherfucking cocksucker!

717
01:12:42,206 --> 01:12:46,267
We're not open yet Please
come back in an hour

718
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:50,676
Someone who got six gold
teeth recommended this place

719
01:12:58,723 --> 01:13:00,588
Mr. Park?

720
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,650
I had to move because of you

721
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:06,256
As a commemoration

722
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,363
I installed a new TV Do you like it?

723
01:13:12,503 --> 01:13:15,870
There are so many channels Great, huh?

724
01:13:16,006 --> 01:13:18,474
There are even some
who prefer to stay here

725
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:22,568
You lived in a place
like this for 15 years?

726
01:13:22,713 --> 01:13:25,978
It felt like home after 11 years though

727
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:30,486
Come on I don't need money

728
01:13:30,621 --> 01:13:34,079
An enemy's enemy is a friend

729
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:42,464
We threw away the hand 'cause it rotted

730
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:49,762
Damn sons of bitches
I'll kick their asses

731
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:53,970
So why'd you bring me here?

732
01:13:55,112 --> 01:13:56,272
Huh?

733
01:13:56,414 --> 01:13:59,281
Let me go!

734
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:03,979
If I don't return after
July 5th then let her go

735
01:14:07,425 --> 01:14:08,790
While I was locked up here

736
01:14:08,926 --> 01:14:12,259
I remember someone visiting me

737
01:14:12,396 --> 01:14:16,162
What did that person
do? Was it three times?

738
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:20,862
I put a hypnosis inducing
drug in your water

739
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:22,973
Sodium Barbiturate?

740
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:25,469
TV Man knows it all

741
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,579
Hey Mr!

742
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:48,965
That's nonsense

743
01:14:49,099 --> 01:14:51,567
Even though it was a Catholic school

744
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:54,364
she wouldn't die because of
rumors that she was a slut

745
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:56,473
There's probably another reason

746
01:14:58,008 --> 01:15:02,468
Could she have been pregnant?

747
01:15:03,314 --> 01:15:07,580
Yeah, I really don't
think Soo ah was like that

748
01:15:07,718 --> 01:15:09,879
She was such a pure girl

749
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,786
I know she didn't put out for anyone

750
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:19,556
But she did go out
with someone back then

751
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:23,257
So who was that guy?

752
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:27,068
I have no idea

753
01:15:39,717 --> 01:15:43,881
Choon shim You knew Lee Soo ah, right?

754
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:46,683
Who was her boyfriend?

755
01:15:47,024 --> 01:15:48,787
Don't know?

756
01:15:48,926 --> 01:15:50,860
Shut the hell up

757
01:15:50,995 --> 01:15:54,954
What would you know about friendship?

758
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:59,263
Shut your crap Then who'd know?

759
01:15:59,403 --> 01:16:02,668
Who? Joo hwan?

760
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:08,077
What?

761
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:12,471
Yeah, I know him

762
01:16:12,616 --> 01:16:15,380
But how'd he know?

763
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:19,182
Yeah? Really?

764
01:16:19,323 --> 01:16:22,884
Okay, hang up I'll call you in a bit

765
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:30,758
Choon shim said

766
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:34,268
she heard it from Joo hwan

767
01:16:34,405 --> 01:16:37,272
And that you'd know the best

768
01:16:51,822 --> 01:16:56,486
Ring, ring, move aside

769
01:16:59,196 --> 01:17:02,165
You'll get hurt if you hesitate

770
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:06,066
Oh Daesu

771
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,566
Look at you

772
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:41,965
Put it out! I'm transferring today

773
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:44,973
To Seoul

774
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:48,169
So butt out, Miss Kim

775
01:17:48,312 --> 01:17:50,177
You good for nothing!

776
01:18:47,004 --> 01:18:48,972
You're Oh Daesu, right?

777
01:18:50,607 --> 01:18:55,567
And you're Miss... among the girls

778
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:59,482
You know how rumors are

779
01:18:59,616 --> 01:19:03,484
I heard you're really
funny Say something

780
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:09,959
Me being so popular is such a big hassle

781
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:24,363
There's this father and son They
went to the public bath, and...

782
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:26,066
See you later

783
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:56,972
See you later! Third
Grade, Third Class pals

784
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:54,662
Come on Wait

785
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,464
Come here I won't

786
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:05,271
Hurry and come here Okay, okay

787
01:21:13,217 --> 01:21:14,980
Satisfied?

788
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:17,378
Raise this up Come on

789
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,285
Raise it I won't

790
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:35,762
What?

791
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:46,180
It tickles

792
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,880
Give it here

793
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:24,282
What are you doing? Let me see

794
01:22:24,421 --> 01:22:26,480
What are you doing?

795
01:22:26,623 --> 01:22:29,387
Let me see Stop

796
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,564
Go away

797
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:26,066
Was it really Soo ah? Are you sure?

798
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:28,268
I don't know her name

799
01:24:28,412 --> 01:24:29,572
All I know is that she's in your room,

800
01:24:29,713 --> 01:24:32,978
and she rides a red bike

801
01:24:40,424 --> 01:24:43,086
Have a good trip See
you in Seoul if I go

802
01:24:43,226 --> 01:24:44,557
Where are you going?

803
01:24:44,694 --> 01:24:47,356
Going on a date with Choon shim

804
01:24:47,898 --> 01:24:50,560
I'll kill you if you shoot your mouth

805
01:24:55,305 --> 01:24:57,068
No way

806
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:02,668
You get locked up for 15
years just for saying that?

807
01:25:04,314 --> 01:25:06,680
Was that such a big crime?

808
01:25:08,919 --> 01:25:15,085
Be it a grain of sand or rock
in water they sink as the same

809
01:25:17,194 --> 01:25:19,662
That's what Lee Woojin believes

810
01:25:21,398 --> 01:25:23,366
Then

811
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,968
what does July 5th stand for?

812
01:25:27,003 --> 01:25:28,971
That's the day

813
01:25:31,508 --> 01:25:33,476
Lee Soo ah died

814
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:40,879
Now it's over

815
01:25:41,017 --> 01:25:42,882
Instead of seeking revenge

816
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:46,682
you wanted to find out why
you were imprisoned, right?

817
01:25:47,824 --> 01:25:52,761
Now we'll run away where
he can never find us, right?

818
01:25:55,699 --> 01:25:57,963
I can't end it like this

819
01:25:58,101 --> 01:26:01,867
Seeking revenge has become a part of me

820
01:26:06,209 --> 01:26:09,770
But you don't even know where he lives

821
01:26:10,413 --> 01:26:13,678
Like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter...

822
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:17,184
Like a bird from the
snare of the fowler...

823
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,185
Free yourself

824
01:26:19,723 --> 01:26:21,884
It's a phrase from "Jamon" 6, verse 4

825
01:26:21,992 --> 01:26:24,051
Jamon in English means Maxim

826
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:26,262
And Evergreen said

827
01:26:26,796 --> 01:26:29,264
he lives in a high tower

828
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:32,859
So six and four

829
01:26:33,303 --> 01:26:35,066
must just be floors

830
01:26:36,206 --> 01:26:37,571
Fourth floor

831
01:26:38,508 --> 01:26:40,066
Sixth floor

832
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,974
Or the sixty forth floor?

833
01:26:45,315 --> 01:26:46,782
P?

834
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,680
Penthouse!

835
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:54,385
Please insert the code

836
01:27:00,397 --> 01:27:03,161
What would you like me to pray?

837
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:10,071
Wrong entry Please insert again

838
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:18,679
Wrong entry Please insert again

839
01:27:18,815 --> 01:27:21,181
Dear Lord

840
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:24,687
please let me meet

841
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:28,288
a younger man next time

842
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:19,971
Please let Woojin

843
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:23,973
bow next to Daesu

844
01:28:24,114 --> 01:28:27,880
and make him beg for forgiveness

845
01:28:40,697 --> 01:28:42,460
You slept with your sister

846
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,971
Let's go up and talk

847
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:19,962
Sic him!

848
01:29:42,726 --> 01:29:45,160
Don't be so violent

849
01:30:15,825 --> 01:30:17,452
Feels great

850
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:23,355
You slept with your
sister I feel so refreshing

851
01:30:29,406 --> 01:30:31,374
And I started the rumors

852
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:34,973
That's why your sister died

853
01:30:42,018 --> 01:30:45,681
Looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day

854
01:30:45,822 --> 01:30:46,789
Doesn't it?

855
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:49,687
Erasing my memory and telling me

856
01:30:49,826 --> 01:30:51,760
to find the truth was unfair

857
01:30:52,796 --> 01:30:55,663
I won,

858
01:30:56,499 --> 01:30:59,764
so die like you promised

859
01:30:59,903 --> 01:31:03,066
You think you forgot that day
because you were hypnotized?

860
01:31:03,606 --> 01:31:05,073
Are you sure?

861
01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:09,972
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

862
01:31:12,615 --> 01:31:14,276
Let me tell you

863
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:20,089
You just, forgot

864
01:31:20,623 --> 01:31:23,091
Is that bland?

865
01:31:23,226 --> 01:31:26,559
But it's true that you just forgot

866
01:31:26,696 --> 01:31:28,960
Why? Since it's not your business

867
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,365
Your rumor grew so out of proportion

868
01:31:32,502 --> 01:31:35,164
that Soo ah being
pregnant became a rumor

869
01:31:36,005 --> 01:31:38,769
My sister got sucked into that rumor

870
01:31:38,908 --> 01:31:40,876
and began believing it

871
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:45,777
So her period stopped and
her belly began to swell

872
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:47,473
Funny, isn't it?

873
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:51,678
Ever thought how'd a girl feel
bearing both her child and nephew?

874
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:53,880
Understand now?

875
01:31:54,424 --> 01:31:56,289
Your tongue

876
01:31:56,426 --> 01:31:59,452
got my sister pregnant

877
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:03,660
It wasn't Lee Woojin's dick

878
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,267
It was Oh Daesu's tongue

879
01:32:11,508 --> 01:32:13,874
Is that why you killed
your sister? What?

880
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:18,572
Ever thought how'd the boy feel
impregnating a child and nephew?

881
01:32:22,318 --> 01:32:23,979
You were probably afraid

882
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:28,186
Afraid that everyone will
know once the baby's born

883
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,057
When you realized that she

884
01:32:30,193 --> 01:32:33,560
imagined it after you killed her

885
01:32:33,696 --> 01:32:36,756
you hating me

886
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,261
is understandable

887
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:47,167
They said Soo ah died alone at the dam

888
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,471
but who took this photo?

889
01:32:50,513 --> 01:32:53,175
And what about the date July 5th?

890
01:33:00,123 --> 01:33:03,251
This is no fun

891
01:33:03,393 --> 01:33:09,354
I'll just finish what I was saying
Listen carefully My story is really fun

892
01:33:09,499 --> 01:33:11,865
Ever heard of posthypnotic suggestion?

893
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:14,265
You suggest something during hypnosis

894
01:33:14,404 --> 01:33:17,771
and then it's acted out
in your wakened state

895
01:33:18,508 --> 01:33:21,375
Still haven't figured it out?

896
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:30,477
You lead a stranger to your
place Who the hell are you?

897
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,589
What about you you rotten bastard?

898
01:33:38,094 --> 01:33:41,461
We hypnotized both of you

899
01:33:42,298 --> 01:33:43,856
One very fortunate thing
was that both of you were

900
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,767
highly receptive to
hypnosis compared to others

901
01:33:50,106 --> 01:33:51,573
Isn't this fun?

902
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:56,771
One word gets you pregnant
one word gets you in love

903
01:33:58,815 --> 01:33:59,782
But no matter how much you two

904
01:33:59,916 --> 01:34:03,079
are receptive to hypnosis

905
01:34:03,219 --> 01:34:06,382
or no matter how good of
a hypnotist Mrs. Yoo is

906
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:10,458
getting people to
fall in love isn't easy

907
01:34:11,995 --> 01:34:13,758
So do you know how we did it?

908
01:34:13,896 --> 01:34:16,160
Oh that?

909
01:34:16,299 --> 01:34:19,359
They said the ratings are
low Your first suggestion

910
01:34:19,502 --> 01:34:25,168
was to go to that
restaurant after your release

911
01:34:25,308 --> 01:34:29,574
Next, to react to the
cell phone's melody

912
01:34:29,712 --> 01:34:34,581
When you heard this you
were to say something

913
01:34:35,218 --> 01:34:37,083
Who are you?

914
01:34:38,221 --> 01:34:42,385
Do you like your clothes?

915
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:43,549
And Mido was to react to the man

916
01:34:43,693 --> 01:34:47,754
who were to say this
When she grabs your hand,

917
01:34:47,897 --> 01:34:52,163
your reaction would be... Of course...

918
01:34:55,505 --> 01:34:58,872
Your gravest mistake wasn't
failing to find the answer

919
01:34:59,609 --> 01:35:05,275
You can't find the right answer
if you ask the wrong questions

920
01:35:05,415 --> 01:35:10,284
It's not "Why did Woojin imprison me?"

921
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,287
It's "Why did he release me?"

922
01:35:13,423 --> 01:35:15,687
Once again

923
01:35:16,225 --> 01:35:21,356
why did Woojin release Daesu after...

924
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:23,859
15 years?

925
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:28,982
Laugh, and the world laughs with
you Weep, and you will weep alone

926
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,254
Mr. Han

927
01:39:20,002 --> 01:39:22,061
Mister Han!

928
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:12,783
Mido... Mido doesn't know right?

929
01:40:17,193 --> 01:40:19,753
Why'd you hide her there?

930
01:40:21,097 --> 01:40:21,961
You thought he'd hate me

931
01:40:22,098 --> 01:40:24,658
because I cut off his hand, right?

932
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,860
Couldn't you figure it
out that it was a trap?

933
01:40:29,405 --> 01:40:33,364
How can you protect your
woman with that brain of yours?

934
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:38,774
I've been secretly raising
Mido since she was three

935
01:40:39,315 --> 01:40:42,478
What's wrong with you?

936
01:40:42,618 --> 01:40:44,882
And Mr. Park's hand?

937
01:40:45,621 --> 01:40:48,181
You moron

938
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:49,791
Know that new prison of his?

939
01:40:49,892 --> 01:40:52,656
He said he had to move so
I bought him that building

940
01:40:52,795 --> 01:40:54,854
for his hand!

941
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:20,980
Daesu!

942
01:41:22,124 --> 01:41:24,058
A box is here

943
01:41:24,193 --> 01:41:28,755
It's that same violet box

944
01:41:28,898 --> 01:41:31,958
He's telling me to open it No!

945
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:33,565
No, Mido, don't

946
01:41:33,702 --> 01:41:37,661
Don't open it no matter what

947
01:41:37,807 --> 01:41:40,071
If you open it something
terrible will happen

948
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:43,770
What's in it? You know, don't you?

949
01:41:43,913 --> 01:41:46,780
Mido My Sweet Pea

950
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:48,178
wait a little longer

951
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:52,583
I'll be there very soon

952
01:41:53,923 --> 01:41:58,053
Can't you come right now?

953
01:41:58,594 --> 01:42:00,061
I'm scared

954
01:42:00,196 --> 01:42:03,654
My Sweet Pea you can wait for me, right?

955
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:07,069
Yes Good

956
01:42:07,703 --> 01:42:12,265
Good girl I'll call you very soon, okay?

957
01:42:26,722 --> 01:42:29,190
I beg you

958
01:42:31,093 --> 01:42:33,561
Please don't tell Mido

959
01:42:35,097 --> 01:42:37,463
What has she

960
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,569
done wrong?

961
01:42:41,704 --> 01:42:45,367
You know it was all my fault

962
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:49,673
I have...

963
01:42:50,412 --> 01:42:53,472
I have committed a terrible sin

964
01:42:53,616 --> 01:42:56,176
to your sister

965
01:42:57,319 --> 01:43:00,584
And I was very wrong to you

966
01:43:00,723 --> 01:43:03,749
I'm really sorry

967
01:43:03,893 --> 01:43:05,758
So what I'm saying is...

968
01:43:06,795 --> 01:43:10,356
So please leave Mido alone, okay?

969
01:43:14,603 --> 01:43:16,468
If

970
01:43:17,206 --> 01:43:20,175
Mido finds out the truth,

971
01:43:20,309 --> 01:43:22,573
you asshole,

972
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:24,176
I'll rip your whole body apart,

973
01:43:24,313 --> 01:43:27,180
and no one will be able

974
01:43:27,316 --> 01:43:31,878
to find your body anywhere

975
01:43:32,021 --> 01:43:33,386
Why?

976
01:43:33,522 --> 01:43:37,049
Because I'm going to chew it all down

977
01:43:38,794 --> 01:43:40,455
Woojin!

978
01:43:40,896 --> 01:43:43,262
Woojin, I made a mistake

979
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:46,459
Please forget what I said

980
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:48,866
Sir! Boss!

981
01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:52,371
Woojin!

982
01:43:52,508 --> 01:43:55,272
We're Evergreen Old Boys

983
01:43:55,411 --> 01:44:02,476
remember? With the energy
from a green pine tree

984
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:10,254
the Great Sangnok High...

985
01:44:11,694 --> 01:44:14,561
I'll do whatever you want

986
01:44:14,697 --> 01:44:17,564
I'll do anything I beg you

987
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,968
Woojin, if you want me

988
01:44:20,102 --> 01:44:23,265
to be a dog, I will!

989
01:44:23,405 --> 01:44:25,066
I'm Woojin's dog from now on!

990
01:44:25,207 --> 01:44:29,166
I'm your puppy!

991
01:44:30,012 --> 01:44:34,073
Woof Woof Woof Wooof

992
01:44:34,216 --> 01:44:37,879
Look, I'm wagging my tail

993
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:44,050
I'm a dog I'll guard the
house I'll be your slave dog

994
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,586
The box...

995
01:46:58,394 --> 01:47:00,259
Just leave it closed

996
01:47:11,006 --> 01:47:13,065
Now,

997
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:17,970
what joy will I live for?

998
01:47:20,015 --> 01:47:21,482
Daesu

999
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:26,272
It really hurts

1000
01:48:27,015 --> 01:48:30,280
But I'm enduring it

1001
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:32,785
You must know this

1002
01:48:47,102 --> 01:48:50,162
How'd you hold out? For 15 years?

1003
01:48:52,708 --> 01:48:56,667
My sister and I loved each other
even though we knew everything

1004
01:49:00,516 --> 01:49:02,177
Could it be the same with you two?

1005
01:49:02,317 --> 01:49:04,785
Do you like it?

1006
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:07,980
You really like it, right?

1007
01:49:08,123 --> 01:49:11,251
I want to be good to you

1008
01:49:45,894 --> 01:49:47,259
Soo ah

1009
01:50:02,411 --> 01:50:04,072
Woojin

1010
01:50:05,714 --> 01:50:08,274
I know you've been scared

1011
01:50:10,419 --> 01:50:14,082
So let go of me, okay?

1012
01:50:14,623 --> 01:50:15,681
Alright?

1013
01:50:30,205 --> 01:50:33,971
Remember me, okay?

1014
01:50:41,617 --> 01:50:44,882
I have no regrets What about you?

1015
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:33,561
This is the whole adventure
I went through until now

1016
01:51:33,702 --> 01:51:37,763
Thank you for listening to
a terrible story till the end

1017
01:51:38,106 --> 01:51:41,974
I hope that you understand
the reason for sending a letter

1018
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:45,978
instead of talking to you in person

1019
01:51:46,314 --> 01:51:48,179
The reason for that is
that I have no tongue

1020
01:51:48,316 --> 01:51:52,275
To be honest I have
no reason to help you

1021
01:51:56,992 --> 01:51:58,960
But you see?

1022
01:51:59,695 --> 01:52:02,459
I was touched by this last sentence

1023
01:52:04,099 --> 01:52:08,763
Even though I'm worse than even a beast

1024
01:52:08,904 --> 01:52:13,568
Don't I have the right to live?

1025
01:52:16,311 --> 01:52:19,769
The hypnosis could go wrong
and distort your memories

1026
01:52:21,116 --> 01:52:22,777
Will that be okay?

1027
01:52:43,705 --> 01:52:45,764
If you're ready

1028
01:52:47,409 --> 01:52:49,877
stare at that tree

1029
01:53:06,394 --> 01:53:07,759
The tree is slowly changing

1030
01:53:08,597 --> 01:53:12,465
into a concrete column

1031
01:53:20,408 --> 01:53:24,674
You're now in Woojin's penthouse

1032
01:53:25,413 --> 01:53:27,779
It's a dreary night

1033
01:53:30,418 --> 01:53:33,285
The sound of your footsteps

1034
01:53:33,421 --> 01:53:35,286
to the window permeates the room

1035
01:53:49,304 --> 01:53:54,071
When I ring my bell

1036
01:53:54,209 --> 01:53:57,872
you'll be split into two persons

1037
01:54:01,316 --> 01:54:05,776
The one who doesn't know
the secret is Oh Daesu

1038
01:54:05,921 --> 01:54:09,789
The one who keeps the
secret is the Monster

1039
01:54:10,192 --> 01:54:12,160
When I ring the bell again

1040
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:15,855
the Monster will turn
around and begin walking

1041
01:54:20,602 --> 01:54:24,868
With each step you age one year

1042
01:54:25,006 --> 01:54:30,069
When the Monster reaches
seventy he will die

1043
01:54:30,212 --> 01:54:32,373
There's no need to worry

1044
01:54:32,514 --> 01:54:35,972
It will be a very peaceful death

1045
01:54:43,124 --> 01:54:44,955
Now, good luck to you

1046
01:55:27,202 --> 01:55:29,670
What's wrong?

1047
01:55:30,105 --> 01:55:32,972
Look at you

1048
01:56:01,303 --> 01:56:02,964
Were you with somebody?

1049
01:56:58,893 --> 01:57:00,861
I love you

1050
01:57:01,496 --> 01:57:02,963
Daesu
