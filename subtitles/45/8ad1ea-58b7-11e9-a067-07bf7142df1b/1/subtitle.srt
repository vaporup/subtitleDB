1
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,745
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,373
<i>Closer.</i>

3
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:42,252
<i>Because the more you think you see,</i>

4
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,754
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

5
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,299
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

6
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:52,387
<i>You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,</i>

7
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,431
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

8
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,684
<i>My job?</i>

9
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,771
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

10
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,735
<i>and use it against you.</i>

11
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:14,075
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,660
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,162
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,872
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,751
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,043
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,128
Okay.

18
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,965
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,050
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,969
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,554
No.

22
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,848
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,975
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,518
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,145
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,796
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,048
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,552
And...

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,306
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,350
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,061
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,650
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,110
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,737
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,947
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,032
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,243
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,869
Florida?

39
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,454
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,623
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,584
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,919
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,546
She can't move, Mack.

44
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,047
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,590
A! B! C!

46
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,925
DI El Fl GI

47
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,134
H, I, J...

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,053
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,346
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,182
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,559
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,562
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,897
Her sister? Oh, my God.

54
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,024
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,860
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,236
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,905
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,533
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,827
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,579
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,581
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,957
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,834
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,003
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,171
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,256
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,008
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,553
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,013
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,556
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,849
And you, Warren Beatty,

72
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,935
every time you see or even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,730
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:49,939
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,024
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,276
And... You're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,865
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,117
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,494
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

80
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,288
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,623
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,458
Just have to hit an ATM first.

83
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,184
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,436
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,855
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,567
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,069
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:39,822
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,409
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,005
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,590
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,927
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,136
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,430
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,598
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,933
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,226
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,310
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,819
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,196
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,952
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,161
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,246
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,047
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,799
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,883
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,011
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,805
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,807
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,601
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,563
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,206
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,260
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,930
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,517
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,394
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,231
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,272
Come on! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,609
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,281
Yes!

121
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,660
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,662
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:33,996
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,665
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,335
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,878
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,296
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,923
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,386
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,554
How much?

131
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,638
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,807
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,016
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,685
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,645
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,146
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,107
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,900
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,445
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:09,866
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:10,950
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,412
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,455
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,749
"45 East Evan Street."

146
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,334
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,919
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,171
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,756
You are such an asshole.

150
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,372
Hey!

151
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,540
Henley.

152
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,918
Danny? Hey.

153
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,796
You got a card, huh?

154
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,007
No,no,no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

155
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,092
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,468
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,761
You wait out here. I will come back

158
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,929
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

159
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,764
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

160
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,349
Nice hair.

161
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,142
So, actually, what have you been up to?

162
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,353
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

163
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,189
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

164
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,524
You have a website. That's good.

165
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,359
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,321
Okay.

167
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,574
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

168
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,285
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

169
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,537
Yeah. Excuse me.

170
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,414
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

171
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,083
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

172
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,751
Helen? No, no.

173
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,294
Henley.

174
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,587
It's on your coffee cup.

175
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,464
Thanks for keeping me honest.

176
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,091
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

177
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,300
It was just an observation.

178
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:36,971
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,180
Thank you.

180
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,975
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,310
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,187
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,272
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,523
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,276
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,114
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

187
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,449
I'm sorry, have we met before?

188
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,950
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

189
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,118
You are a control freak.

190
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,287
Well, I take that as a compliment.

191
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,747
Only he would take it as a compliment.

192
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,832
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

193
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,294
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

194
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,462
A couple? No, no.

195
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,755
We were never a couple.

196
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,631
He used to saw me in half.

197
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,758
She was a very good assistant.

198
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,884
But I was too fat for Danny.

199
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,803
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

200
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,889
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

201
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,474
No one could fit through there. No one.

202
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,725
Rebecca fit through.

203
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,477
Rebecca fit for years.

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,228
Do you know how hard it is to stay

205
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,189
in those tiny little costumes?

206
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,232
No. I'm the main attraction.

207
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,485
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

208
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,489
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

209
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,990
That's a really nice story.

210
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,742
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

211
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,160
No way.

212
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,913
J. Daniel Atlas?

213
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,624
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

214
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,000
You're like...

215
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,335
I idolize you. Seriously.

216
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,920
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

217
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,505
I'm Jack, by the way.

218
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,006
Question. Did you get one of these?

219
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:55,925
Yeah. Death.

220
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,968
The High Priestess.

221
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,303
I'm the Lover.

222
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,513
Three minutes.

223
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,598
Hermit.

224
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,434
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

225
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,061
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

226
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,688
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

227
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,158
What is this place?

228
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,122
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,966
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,677
What's that?

231
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,095
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,349
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,143
"Now you don't."

234
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:52,273
"A rose by any other name..."

235
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,405
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,616
Look at that.

237
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,457
It's gas!

238
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,751
Relax. Just dry ice.

239
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,545
Cool.

240
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,006
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

241
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,841
Hang on. Hang on.

242
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,847
I got nothin'.

243
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,765
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

244
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,976
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

245
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,603
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

246
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,104
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,564
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,191
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,568
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

250
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,486
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,696
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,114
I Wish.

253
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,867
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,036
Oh, great.

255
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,168
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,795
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,105
Blueprints.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,316
They're incredible.

259
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,110
Who do you think did this?

260
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,446
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

261
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,950
It's a show.

262
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,221
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

263
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,307

264
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,977

268
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,076
Thank you.

269
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,328
Tonight we would like to try something

270
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,956
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

271
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,541
For our final trick,

272
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,584
we're gonna do something never before

273
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,670
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

274
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,048
Or any stage for that matter.

275
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,676
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,721
tonight

277
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,765
we are going to rob a bank.

278
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,486
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

279
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,866
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

280
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,582
One, two, three!

281
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,217
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

282
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,552
during the performance.

283
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,637
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,805
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,182
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,726
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,811
Okay.

288
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,649
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,735
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,322
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,575
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,452
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,706
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,959
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,712
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,798
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

297
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,466
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,717
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,887
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,722
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:54,848
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,725
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,685
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,562
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,772
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,691
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,110
Oh. Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,862
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,825
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,078
Could you just confirm for me that this

311
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,205
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

312
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,289
Yes.

313
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,375
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

314
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,793
your name and the name of your bank?

315
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,212
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

316
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,799
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

317
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,175
French. Okay.

318
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,927
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

319
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,263
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

320
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,390
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

321
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,724
Could you please come up to the stage

322
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,059
and we'll rob your bank.

323
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,270
And while he does that...

324
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,646
There is someone here tonight

325
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,481
without whom we would just be

326
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,567
four magicians working the circuit,

327
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,651
trying to get...

328
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,236
Well, actually, trying to get here.

329
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,612
You probably know this man,

330
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,197
if not from one of the many, many

331
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,574
companies he puts his name on.

332
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,742
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

333
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,160
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

334
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,329
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

335
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,414
The only man here with

336
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,624
the Queen's cell phone number.

337
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,168
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

338
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,422
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

339
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,883
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

340
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,092
the biggest name in magic.

341
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,594
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

342
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,679
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

343
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,848
we made sure we put your name on top.

344
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,100
If you turn out to be as good

345
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,019
as you think you are, dear girl,

346
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,271
that won't be necessary much longer.

347
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,772
We haven't done our closer yet.

348
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,024
Why don't you watch it

349
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,442
and then you can decide for yourself.

350
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,986
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

351
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,446
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

352
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,573
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

353
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,035
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

354
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,872
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

355
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,124
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

356
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,128
to literally fold through space and time

357
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,547
to your bank in the...

358
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,757
8th?

359
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,884
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,886
Now, once you are there,

361
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,055
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

362
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,890
NOW if...

363
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,850
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

364
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,144
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

365
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,981
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

366
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,734
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

367
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,402
- Thank you. Thank you...
- it is.

368
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,073
Thank you. Thank you very much.

369
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,784
But before you go anywhere,

370
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,911
could you please, pick a card, any card.

371
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,245
Not that card.

372
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,749
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

373
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,417
Okay. This one?

374
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,586
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

375
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,298
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

376
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,842
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

377
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,678
- That's good.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:39,930
Put it in your pocket.

379
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,683
And now for one tiny detail.

380
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:04,663
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

381
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,124
<i>And</i> I'll <i>step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

382
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,960
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

383
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,295
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

384
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,840
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

385
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,049
One,

386
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,217
two...

387
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,343
Three.

388
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,806
What the fuck?

389
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,641
- Efienne?
- Efienne?

390
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,768
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

391
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,103
Efienne?

392
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,480
I liked that little French guy.

393
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:31,732
Where did he go?

394
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,242
Wait, there he is.

395
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,580
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

396
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,499
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

397
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,834
Etienne? Are you okay?

398
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,002
<i>Yes.</i>

399
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,463
Perfect. What do you see in there?

400
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,507
Money.

401
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,134
Is this real?

402
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,720
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

403
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,515
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

404
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,559
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

405
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,894
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

406
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,437
And I want you to take the ticket stub

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,563
from tonight's show

408
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:12,814
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

409
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,941
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

410
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,196
Now drop it.

411
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,461
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

412
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,879
Don't press it just yet.

413
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,714
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

414
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,550
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

415
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,052
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

416
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,387
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

417
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,847
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,296
Wait a second.

419
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,269
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

420
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,520
We are The Four Horsemen.

421
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,730
And good night!

422
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,398
Good night!

423
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:31,953
Hold up here.

424
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,914
Dylan Rhodes.

425
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,542
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

426
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,085
Did you say magicians?

427
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,087
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

428
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,380
<i>Where are you now?</i>

429
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,466
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

430
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,597
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

431
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,057
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

432
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,143
Let's go. Get 'em up.

433
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,645
Put the book down.

434
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,605
Okay. You got me.

435
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,190
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

436
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,443
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

437
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,028
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,839
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

439
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,968
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

440
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,761
I'm a month, two tops,

441
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,304
away from blowing this whole thing open.

442
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,430
Get Turkelson.

443
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,640
He's in Atlantic City.

444
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,975
What about Cowan? Look at him.

445
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,476
He's just sitting there on his ass.

446
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,769
Hilarious, Rhodes.

447
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,354
I love you.

448
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,730
Asshole.

449
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,482
I don't have time for this magic crap.

450
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,110
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

451
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,361
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

452
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,946
Actually, 3.2.

453
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,617
Who is she?

454
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:54,619
Who are you?

455
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,371
Alma Dray from Interpol.

456
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,998
I'll be working the investigation with you.

457
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,291
You gotta be kidding me.

458
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,917
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

459
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,168
David Copperfield and Friends.

460
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,463
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

461
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,799
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

462
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,844
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

463
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,471
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

464
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,099
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

465
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,311
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

466
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,937
Besides, he's useless.

467
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,814
Oh, really? Why is that?

468
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,150
Because he believes their magic was real.

469
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,901
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

470
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,445
You're right, he probably is useless.

471
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,865
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

472
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,533
Thank you.

473
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,329
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

474
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,789
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

475
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,334
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

476
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,961
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

477
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,589
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

478
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,091
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

479
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,302
With the teleportation helmet.

480
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,429
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

481
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,389
He was hypnotized during the show.

482
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,308
I told you, he's useless.

483
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,517
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm clone

484
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,144
with this other bullshit.

485
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,690
Hey!

486
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,442
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

487
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,818
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

488
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,196
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

489
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,741
Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

490
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,117
You're not in the Philharmonic.

491
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,620
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

492
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,746
Tell him to stop.

493
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:24,084
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

494
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,252
Okay, I need a time-out.

495
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,837
Too many French people in one room.

496
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,464
Agent Rhodes!

497
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,258
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

498
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:35,387
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

499
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,055
So we can work together,

500
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,140
or you can continue to follow behind

501
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,351
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

502
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,644
It's up to you.

503
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,899
I'm not finished.

504
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,778
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

505
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,197
And I do not handle jet lag well.

506
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,702
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

507
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,913
I promise you, you will lose.

508
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,625
Fine. So which one of these idiots

509
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,127
do you want to talk to first?

510
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,253
Him?

511
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,926
Dylan, for the record,

512
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,137
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

513
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,263
Okay.

514
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:19,681
That is to say, that it's not a science.

515
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,099
It's more for entertainment.

516
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,434
All right.

517
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,895
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

518
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,691
Please convey my deepest apologies

519
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,568
to your colleague out there.

520
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,028
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

521
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,280
I was out of line.

522
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,614
Tranny Tuesday?

523
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,366
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

524
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,201
Or might not have, if you believe

525
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,745
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

526
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,457
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

527
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,417
of men wearing dresses?

528
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,838
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

529
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,509
I'm just having fun.

530
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,928
Was this your card? No.

531
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,305
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

532
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,389
and I respect that.

533
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,349
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

534
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,476
but I understand protocol.

535
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,894
Okay, okay.

536
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,563
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

537
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,232
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

538
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,317
Oh, yes. That would be...

539
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,902
What do the kids call it these days?

540
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,153
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

541
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,238
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

542
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,908
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,869
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

544
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,080
It says here you are a mentalist.

545
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,334
What exactly is mentalism?

546
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,378
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

547
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,424
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

548
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,844
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

549
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,181
Voices in my head.

550
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,435
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

551
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,521
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

552
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:52,106
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

553
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,192
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

554
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,862
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

555
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,280
Did your research, did you?

556
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,199
IRS audit. Back taxes.

557
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,034
You've had a long hard slog back

558
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,537
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

559
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,291
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

560
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,460
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

561
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:13,711
put on the magical helmet...

562
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:14,796
Listen to me.

563
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,465
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

564
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,675
Which makes you an accomplice.

565
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,177
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

566
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,303
Now you listen to me, unless you think

567
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,805
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

568
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,348
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

569
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,599
then we have a show to perform.

570
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,850
And you, Agent Rhodes,

571
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,269
have a drawing board to get back to.

572
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,812
Is this your first date?

573
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,022
What?

574
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,901
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

575
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:40,488
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

576
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,407
And before you get involved,

577
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,994
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

578
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,787
And I know the first one is that

579
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,999
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

580
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,875
You should have said something to him.

581
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,128
This is a weird way for you to find out.

582
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,046
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

583
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,507
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

584
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,050
Because if you did, it means that you,

585
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,219
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

586
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:06,764
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

587
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,475
The press would have a field day.

588
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,477
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

589
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,812
And you guys would look like idiots

590
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,188
even more then you already are.

591
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,775
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

592
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,527
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

593
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,029
"nothing up your sleeve."

594
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,280
And you know it.

595
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,449
Don't draw him in and then dump him

596
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,994
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

597
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,662
Mommy?

598
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,581
Daddy.

599
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,374
You have big daddy issues.

600
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,001
- Okay, that's enough.
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what.

601
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:38,379
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

602
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,757
Me? I'll take a tenner.

603
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,385
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

604
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,387
I'll still take a tenner.

605
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,681
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

606
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,892
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

607
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,518
And you know who put them there?

608
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,520
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

609
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:58,566
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

610
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,486
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

611
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,696
And the instant that you even show

612
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,449
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

613
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,825
I'll be there.

614
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,494
I will be all over you like...

615
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,745
Like white on rice?

616
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,538
Sorry. That's unfair.

617
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,706
Let me warn you.

618
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:14,916
I want you to follow.

619
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,459
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

620
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,086
we will always be one step, three steps,

621
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:19,212
seven steps ahead of you.

622
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,505
And just when you think you're catching up,

623
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,964
that's when we'll be right behind you.

624
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,508
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

625
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:24,676
exactly where I want you to be.

626
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,386
So come close. Get all over me

627
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,804
because the closer you think you are,

628
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,263
the less you'll actually see.

629
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,348
I'm gonna nail you...

630
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,146
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

631
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,698
Oh! Shit!

632
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,783
First rule of magic.

633
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,869
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

634
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,853
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

635
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,105
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

636
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,232
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

637
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,067
- What changed?
- I met them.

638
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,152
Hey. Guys.

639
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,946
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

640
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,156
Most of it was just filler.

641
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,907
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

642
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,784
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

643
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,035
filming the whole damn thing?

644
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,162
I don't know.

645
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,705
Thaddeus Bradley.

646
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,418
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

647
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,502
No.

648
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,921
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

649
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,840
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

650
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,008
Get him on the phone.

651
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,760
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

652
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:49,886
Good.

653
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,722
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

654
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,515
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

655
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,976
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

656
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,189
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

657
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,691
That's a man who loves his work.

658
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,944
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

659
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,864
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

660
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,491
I will take one.

661
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,585
That's incredible. That's amazing.

662
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,379
Red dye, palmed.

663
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,132
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

664
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,550
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

665
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,928
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

666
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,223
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

667
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,891
in the last half decade?

668
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,226
About 1.6 million.

669
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:41,646
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

670
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,022
Five million.

671
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,148
Right, so it's about the money.

672
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:45,733
Well, the money is only there

673
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,070
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

674
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:53,449
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

675
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:57,203
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

676
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,788
Cost?

677
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,164
I don't know. Careers.

678
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,374
Lives.

679
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:04,669
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

680
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,963
I'm sorry, who?

681
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,548
Lionel Shrike.

682
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:13,010
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

683
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,848
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

684
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:20,393
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

685
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,936
He was shackled inside a safe,

686
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,813
and dropped into the river.

687
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,022
But he never resurfaced.

688
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,358
You mean he died?

689
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,235
I didn't kill him.

690
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:33,573
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

691
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,867
You do realize this is a game?

692
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,743
Believe me, it's not a game.

693
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,995
It is a game.

694
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,830
You're the game. You're being played.

695
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,375
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

696
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,210
I mean, come on.

697
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,295
You got me.

698
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,629
If you really want to know

699
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,508
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

700
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,552
my special comes out next month.

701
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,761
Or I could just bring you in

702
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,306
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

703
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,932
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

704
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,102
you actually don't know how they did it.

705
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,273
Showmanship and theatrics.

706
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,609
When a magician waves his hand and says,

707
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,319
"This is where the magic is happening."

708
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,988
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

709
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:17,450
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

710
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,910
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

711
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,621
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

712
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,498
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

713
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,000
But don't take my word for it.

714
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,169
How about a trip to Paris?

715
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,756
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

716
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,591
You're joking, right?

717
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,052
You wanna know how they did it or not?

718
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,430
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

719
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,474
Step right up.

720
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,435
There you go.

721
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,773
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

722
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,735
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

723
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,945
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

724
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:57,114
just say the magic word.

725
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:58,616
Blow me?

726
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,369
<i>- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.</i>

727
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,509
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

728
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,136
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

729
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,097
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

730
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,682
My fun.

731
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,267
What?

732
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,727
Nothing.

733
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,647
So they got a vault set.

734
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,815
Yes.

735
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:31,982
And it's the exact replica

736
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,234
of the little French guy's bank.

737
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,360
So he's a plant.

738
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,903
He was a dupe, not a plant.

739
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,155
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

740
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,825
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

741
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:44,412
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

742
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,580
They let them think they picked the seat.

743
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,040
We'll choose one at random then.

744
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,418
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

745
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,211
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

746
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,505
We are looking at row number 5.

747
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,006
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

748
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,508
Lucky number 13.

749
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,635
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

750
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,303
<i>He was selected.</i>

751
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,098
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

752
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,349
Viva Las Vegas.

753
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,478
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

754
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,939
<i>They trailed him.</i>

755
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,149
<i>They studied him.</i>

756
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,984
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

757
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,279
I got his measurements.

758
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,740
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

759
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,992
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

760
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,368
When I snap my fingers...

761
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,037
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

762
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,247
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

763
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,707
- You're kidding.
- Really?

764
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,460
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

765
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,544
Yes.

766
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,337
Like this.

767
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,800
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

768
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,387
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

769
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,389
You ready?

770
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,807
Yes.

771
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,101
Credit card.

772
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,313
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

773
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,356
they left in the vault in Paris.

774
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,441
Very good.

775
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,151
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

776
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,279
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

777
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,906
You said they didn't steal the money.

778
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,657
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

779
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,201
I said they didn't rob the bank.

780
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,329
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

781
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,080
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

782
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:14,084
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

783
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:18,297
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

784
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,050
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

785
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,656
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

786
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,575
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

787
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,829
<i>For our Horsemen,</i>

788
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,164
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

789
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,630
Hey, boys.

790
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,598
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

791
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,433
<i>Flash paper.</i>

792
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,896
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

793
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,863
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

794
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,620
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

795
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,373
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

796
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,917
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

797
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,753
Give your audience $3 million.

798
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,338
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

799
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,631
Best finale ever.

800
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,175
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

801
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,720
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

802
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,847
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

803
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,266
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

804
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,393
<i>- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

805
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,895
Yes. Then the children.

806
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,440
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

807
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,691
And what's that?

808
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:03,861
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

809
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:06,113
Unrequited and misguided,

810
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,991
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

811
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,744
Consequently, you're very tightly...

812
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,454
How should I put it?

813
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,955
Corked.

814
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,040
Oh, lam?

815
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,752
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

816
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,463
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

817
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:27,259
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

818
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,594
Wow. Thanks.

819
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:31,430
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

820
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:35,434
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

821
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,065
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

822
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,232
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

823
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,068
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

824
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,861
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

825
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,405
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

826
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,573
Ego.

827
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,993
Okay, pick your card.

828
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,955
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

829
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,873
No, don't tell me.

830
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,251
Thaddeus was there that night.

832
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,754
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

833
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,506
What are you saying?

834
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,091
You think they could be working together.

835
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,592
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

836
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,135
were a bunch of street magicians

837
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,762
a year ago with no resources.

838
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,390
So, how do they go from doing that to this

839
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,933
without some kind of outside help?

840
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,434
Is this your card?

841
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,938
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

842
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,273
Nice shuffle.

843
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:24,525
You know, this is hard.

844
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,651
According to this book,

845
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:29,780
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

846
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,908
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

847
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,244
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

848
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,579
Or specifically those guys?

849
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,916
I could care less about magicians in general.

850
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,836
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

851
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,045
Exploit them how?

852
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,463
Try again.

853
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,508
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

854
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:52,344
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

855
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,305
in order to make their lives more bearable.

856
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,182
I see it as a strength.

857
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,226
My life is happier when I believe that.

858
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:01,645
Is this your card?

859
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:03,939
Yeah.

860
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:05,858
Yeah?

861
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,484
- Yeah.
- Cool.

862
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,240
That smile on your face. Is it real?

863
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,575
Maybe.

864
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,453
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

865
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:18,954
Do you feel exploited?

866
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,291
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

867
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,794
Guy goes to the doctor.

868
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:26,920
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

869
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:28,088
"have to stop masturbating."

870
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,173
He Says, "Why?"

871
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,716
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

872
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:31,884
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

873
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,510
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

874
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,845
Hey, guys.

875
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,722
We got a show to prepare for.

876
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,141
Do we now?

877
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,267
No, no, no, don't do that.

878
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,518
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

879
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,936
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

880
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,605
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

881
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,065
I know all of your little tricks.

882
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,316
That what they are to you? Tricks?

883
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,109
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

884
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,903
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

885
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,654
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

886
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,490
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

887
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,742
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

888
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,327
No.

889
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,661
Do me.

890
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,163
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

891
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,247
Okay.

892
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,415
Even better.

893
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,500
- Art.
- Yeah.

894
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,376
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

895
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,461
when I want to be.

896
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,755
Just stay with me, okay?

897
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,299
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

898
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,426
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

899
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,428
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

900
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,430
A brutish breed. Like a real...

901
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,682
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

902
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,185
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

903
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,355
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

904
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,191
Sorry.

905
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,484
Wait, let me try one.

906
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,652
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

907
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,820
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

908
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,488
He can do way better than that.

909
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:35,572
Let's do family.

910
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,867
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

911
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,620
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

912
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,956
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

913
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,541
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

914
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:49,795
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

915
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,547
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

916
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,132
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

917
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,635
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

918
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,345
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

919
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,471
That was your childhood?

920
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:01,932
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

921
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,935
Don't worry. Just you wait.

922
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:13,318
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

923
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:14,528
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

924
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,155
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

925
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,157
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

926
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,617
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

927
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,454
Hey, hey! There you are.

928
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,123
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

929
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,249
while she's in New Orleans?

930
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,543
No. In fact, here, speaking French

931
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,336
is actually an asset.

932
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,921
Do you see that woman up there?

933
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:35,090
That's Marie Claire.

934
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:37,426
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

935
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,096
You're welcome.

936
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,723
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,433
We got a place.

938
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:49,605
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

939
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,064
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

940
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:54,234
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

941
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,155
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

942
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:02,117
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

943
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,787
This other guy, Maximillian...

944
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:08,957
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

945
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,877
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

946
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,879
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

947
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,173
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

948
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,051
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

949
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,303
This what? This magic?

950
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,097
Lionel Shrike.

951
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,851
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

952
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,938
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

953
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,522
They saw the tree in half.

954
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,691
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

955
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,610
is the card with the signature.

956
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:37,819
How did he do that?

957
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:41,239
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

958
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,911
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

959
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,579
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

960
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:49,748
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

961
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,583
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

962
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,960
What tracking bracelets?

963
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:54,294
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

964
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:55,963
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

965
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:58,131
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

966
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,383
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

967
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,550
Next.

968
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,718
...our boys can track Atlas

969
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,220
from right here in the mobile command unit.

970
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,263
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

971
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:06,682
Copy that.

972
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,859
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

973
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:22,823
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

974
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,827
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

975
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,870
And I watch the people make a wish

976
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,081
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

977
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,834
Then throw the key into the Seine.

978
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:40,257
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

979
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,467
Watching the key sink into the water

980
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:45,804
and their secret is locked away forever.

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,018
Real and, at the same time, magical.

982
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,358
So,

983
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,863
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

984
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,615
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,957
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

986
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,917
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

987
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:17,669
<i>"The Eye."</i>

988
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,840
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

989
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,009
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

990
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,886
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

991
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,471
<i>Their purpose?</i>

992
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,558
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

993
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:36,772
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

994
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:41,902
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

995
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:46,990
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

996
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,159
get the better of them?

997
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,084
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

998
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,252
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

999
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,630
which you don't, or you should leave.

1000
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,592
If I want something to cease or desist,

1001
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,928
it does.

1002
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,304
Take five.

1003
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:11,431
According to your potential backers,

1004
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,268
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1005
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,978
from your best special.

1006
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,856
I have here a check

1007
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,859
for 3.5 million.

1008
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,111
To walk away?

1009
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:27,948
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1010
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,786
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1011
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:36,456
You're in this to ride them up.

1012
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:38,959
I'm in it to ride them down.

1013
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,295
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1014
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:48,135
And therein lies our conflict.

1015
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:52,806
Let me be blunt.

1016
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:57,686
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1017
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,730
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1018
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:04,151
And they will manacle you

1019
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:07,237
with so many injunctions.

1020
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,739
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1021
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:12,492
everything that you own drain away

1022
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,829
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1023
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,165
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1024
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,042
And I'm still here.

1025
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:25,463
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

1026
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:30,760
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

1027
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:33,221
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1028
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:38,560
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1029
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,189
You shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,108
According to superstition,

1031
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,320
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1032
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:52,866
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1033
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,202
Isn't that funny?

1034
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,038
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1035
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,049
Do me a favor.

1036
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:13,178
Visualize your most adventurous
sexualexpeﬂence.

1037
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,304
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1038
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:18,099
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1039
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,185
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1040
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,145
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1041
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,814
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1042
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,484
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1043
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:28,777
And on demand.

1044
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,821
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

1045
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,908
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

1046
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:40,455
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1047
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,999
Make any magician's wish come true.

1048
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,501
You've come a long way,

1049
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:46,419
much further
than anyone would have expected

1050
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,505
<i>of a bunch of wanna-hes and has-beans.</i>

1051
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,759
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1052
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:56,221
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1053
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:58,473
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1054
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,267
By all means.

1055
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:05,939
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1056
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,942
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1057
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,819
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1058
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:14,990
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1059
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,660
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1060
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,288
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1061
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:26,960
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1062
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:30,463
Okay. Name a card.

1063
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:32,132
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1064
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,425
Okay.

1065
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,727
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1066
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,562
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1067
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:49,357
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1068
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,193
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,655 --> 00:52:00,660
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1070
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:02,912
Break a leg.

1071
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,165
Hey, you break something, too.

1081
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,482
Nice watch.

1082
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,985
It's a family heirloom.

1083
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,908
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1084
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,576
- Who?
- Shrike.

1085
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,912
So, when he was 14,

1086
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,164
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:49,918
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1088
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,629
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1089
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:53,880
And?

1090
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:58,134
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1091
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:01,471
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1092
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,139
and presto!

1093
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,974
The card is in the tree.

1094
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,935
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1095
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,478
The card was in the tree.

1096
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:12,565
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1097
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,568
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1098
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,654
It was to look so far

1099
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:20,532
that you see 20 years into the past.

1100
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:23,493
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1101
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,370
What are you suggesting?

1108
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,598
Thank you. Before we begin,

1109
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,725
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1110
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,270
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1111
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,188
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1112
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:57,986
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1113
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:03,032
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:07,620
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,043
What is magic?

1116
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,629
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,716
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,343
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,471
Because the tricks you are about to see

1120
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,723
may not seem connected.

1121
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,725
But we assure you, they are.

1122
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:32,479
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1123
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:36,483
Or is it one giant illusion?

1124
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:47,118
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,370
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,706
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,919
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,379
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:01,299
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,426
There are two pencils out there.

1131
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,761
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1132
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,304
- Here!
- Yeah!

1133
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:08,723
And now, you will say the magic word.

1134
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,058
Abracadabra.

1135
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,518
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1136
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,186
for no reason. And then...

1137
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,688
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1138
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,275
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1139
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,527
you're about to.

1140
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:21,861
And sleep.

1141
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:24,781
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1142
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,449
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1143
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,576
And now we are gonna debunk

1144
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,787
a few magic myths this evening.

1145
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,040
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1146
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,876
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1147
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,461
As has the mirror

1148
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:40,964
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1149
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,132
When you hear the word "freeze"

1150
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,552
you are all football players.

1151
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:48,555
And your job is to tackle,

1152
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,056
dismantle,

1153
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:51,391
crush,

1154
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,977
tear limb from limb,

1155
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,062
the quarterback.

1156
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,942
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1157
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,028
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1158
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,910
You will know who the quarterback is.

1159
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:14,330
He will be the one saying that word.

1160
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:15,582
Freeze.

1161
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,386
Three, two, one...

1162
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,729
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1163
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,230
Kill the quarterback!

1164
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:40,940
Get on back to your seats.

1165
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,276
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1166
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:17,352
I guess you have lost some weight.

1167
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,077
At the intermission,

1168
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,621
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1169
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,206
and seal it in an envelope.

1170
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,916
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1171
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,125
Everyone take 'em out.

1172
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,045
Now, everybody,

1173
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,090
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1174
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,343
Shout 'em out.

1175
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:54,347
Clement? Frannick?

1176
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,599
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1177
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,643
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1178
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,228
That's me!

1179
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,647
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1180
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,983
Josepha Hickey?

1181
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,068
That's me!

1182
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:10,071
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1183
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,156
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1184
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:13,991
One, two, three, four, five...

1185
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,326
Stop.

1186
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,370
Is the first digit 5?

1187
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,413
Yes.

1188
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,831
Do it again. This time, faster.

1189
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,332
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1190
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,500
Stop.

1191
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,710
Six. Again.

1192
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:25,795
One, two...

1193
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,966
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1194
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,343
Yeah. That's what I got.

1195
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,638
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1196
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:36,848
Okay, Dina,

1197
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:39,809
1 ,

1198
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:41,436
<i>4.</i>

1199
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,146
<i>7.</i>

1200
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,731
- 7.
- Yeah.

1201
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:49,569
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1202
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,820
Clement.

1203
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,865
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1204
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:57,869
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1205
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,665
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1206
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,626
Focus on your number.

1207
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:12,967
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1208
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,261
Oh, this is strange.

1209
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,848
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1210
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,892
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1211
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:23,102
about what you think is in your account.

1212
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:24,604
Okay, you can sit down now.

1213
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,523
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1214
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,526
This evening would not be possible

1215
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:34,113
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1216
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,283
Big applause! Big applause!

1217
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:38,826
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1218
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,077
for the finale?

1219
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:41,954
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1220
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:43,956
There he goes. Okay, good.

1221
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,082
Are we on red?

1222
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,210
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1223
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,753
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1224
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,004
There he goes.

1225
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,840
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1226
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:54,759
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1227
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,221
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1228
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:00,515
North of 140. Am I right?

1229
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,310
That's 140 million, by the way.

1230
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:08,940
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1231
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,025
How can he be right about his balance

1232
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,276
and everyone else be wrong?

1233
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,780
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1234
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:18,074
Everybody, take out your paper.

1235
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:20,785
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1236
01:00:20,952 --> 01:00:22,787
start to warm up that paper.

1237
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:26,123
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1238
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:32,964
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1239
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,340
Yes.

1240
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:42,473
Look.

1241
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,642
What's going on there, Daniel?

1242
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,227
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1243
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:50,231
$144,579,651.

1244
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,315
But now...

1245
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,860
Now it says $70,000 less.

1246
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,615
Josepha, can you stand up?

1247
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:00,741
Yes.

1248
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,660
Now, what is your new number?

1249
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:07,290
$70,562 now in my account.

1250
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:13,796
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1251
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,007
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1252
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,634
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1253
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,094
IS it?

1254
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,848
Wow. It is.

1255
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,351
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1256
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,562
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1257
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:33,566
$281,477.

1258
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,071
We have a confession to make.

1259
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,282
She's right. We lied about something.

1260
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,034
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1261
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,578
All of you have one thing in common.

1262
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,997
Everyone in this room was a victim

1263
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,958
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1264
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:53,628
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1265
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,087
Your businesses.

1266
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,255
Your loved ones.

1267
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,550
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1268
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:01,594
Tressler Insurance.

1269
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,888
You were abandoned.

1270
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,056
You were loopholed...

1271
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,349
...out of your settlements.

1272
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,353
This is all for show. Correct?

1273
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,980
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1274
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,899
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1275
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,693
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1276
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,695
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1277
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:23,074
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1278
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:31,874
Is this for real?

1279
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,250
I don't know.

1280
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,627
<i>Is this happening?</i>

1281
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,379
I don't know! I can't tell!

1282
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,256
Hey! Did you do this?

1283
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:41,676
How could we, Art?

1284
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,927
We don't have your password.

1285
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,553
We'd need access to information

1286
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:46,555
we could never get our hands on.

1287
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,724
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1288
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,476
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1289
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,061
or the name of your first pet.

1290
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,938
Where would we get that information, Art?

1291
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,065
You certainly would never tell us.

1292
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,945
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

1293
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,740
Do not let them get away.

1294
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:06,826
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1295
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,126
You got hell to pay!

1296
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:19,130
Stop!

1297
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,632
Stop! Nobody move!

1298
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,677
Freeze!

1299
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,470
Quarterback!

1300
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:31,350
We are The Four Horsemen.

1301
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:32,935
Good night.

1302
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:46,532
Get 'em off me!

1303
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:48,868
Get off! Get off me!

1304
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,588
Get off me!

1305
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:11,182
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1306
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,899
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1307
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,860
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1308
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:24,528
and bring the tracker.

1309
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:26,989
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1310
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,199
Give me the tracker.

1311
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:29,658
Let's go.

1312
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:35,080
FBI! Clear!

1313
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:36,957
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1314
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,042
What have you got?

1315
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,627
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1316
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,755
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1317
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,258
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1318
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,505
Hey! Move!

1319
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,923
Move! Move!

1320
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,302
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1321
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,263
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1322
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:34,348
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1323
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,486
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1324
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,869
Damn! Where are you?

1325
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,048
Excuse me.

1326
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,140
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1327
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:19,560
Stop!

1328
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:27,902
What are you doing?

1329
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,490
He's going in Napoleon House.

1330
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:37,077
Move! Move!

1331
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,496
Move out of the way!

1332
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,206
Hey!

1333
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,042
Move!

1334
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:47,630
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1335
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,049
No!No!No!

1336
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:53,093
Freeze!

1337
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,220
Lower your weapons!

1338
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:56,555
What?

1339
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:58,807
I'm tracking myself!

1340
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,268
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

1341
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:03,020
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

1342
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,271
<i>calling into question</i>

1343
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:06,649
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

1344
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:09,485
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

1345
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,028
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

1346
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,780
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

1347
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:15,741
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

1348
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:17,368
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

1349
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,286
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

1350
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:22,373
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

1351
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,875
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

1352
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,835
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

1353
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,337
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

1354
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:29,797
Hey.

1355
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,091
What are you doing?

1356
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,550
I'm having a drink.

1357
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,013
I came to get you.

1358
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:39,807
I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,475
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1360
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,726
Atlas. You had him.

1361
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,061
He didn't have a weapon.

1362
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,646
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1363
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,607
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1364
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:49,984
Didn't you?

1365
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,236
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1366
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,029
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1367
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,239
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,991
Who exactly are you anyway?

1369
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,161
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1370
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,459
Not bad.

1371
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:10,379
What is this?

1372
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:14,842
What's the Eye of Horus?

1373
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,012
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1374
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:20,681
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1375
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,350
Find your way back yourself.

1376
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:30,524
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tresslerwould like you
to join him for a drink.

1377
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,993
Sir.

1378
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,453
Thank you.

1379
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:46,040
What is your role with them?

1380
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:47,207
Role?

1381
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:49,126
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1382
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:51,003
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1383
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,880
If it makes you feel any better,

1384
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,214
this wasn't about you.

1385
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,760
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1386
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,096
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1387
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,682
Played out on a global scale.

1388
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:08,020
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1389
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,356
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1390
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:15,736
I was a $140-million distraction?

1391
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:17,738
Yes.

1392
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:22,576
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1393
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:24,578
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1394
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,246
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1395
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,748
Yes, I do know.

1396
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,249
Well, you won't.

1397
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,960
And you won't destroy them.

1398
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,129
Whatever this grand trick is,

1399
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,216
it was designed a long time ago.

1400
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:41,970
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1401
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:47,351
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1402
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,479
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1403
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,731
Whatever you stand to make

1404
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:58,403
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1405
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,988
And destroy them.

1406
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,407
I stand to make five million.

1407
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:04,368
Am I flinching?

1408
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,080
No, you're not.

1409
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:29,995
Hey.

1410
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:33,582
I'm sorry for your arm.

1411
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,250
No. I'm sorry.

1412
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,586
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1413
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:42,174
I'm at a loss.

1414
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:49,473
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1415
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:52,851
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1416
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:57,856
So what's this all about?

1417
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:01,234
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1418
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,694
The Eye are the keepers

1419
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,946
of real magic

1420
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:06,949
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1421
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,951
"Candidates for initiations

1422
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:12,204
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:16,416
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,418
May I?

1425
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:24,508
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:28,011
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,304
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:34,393
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,812
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1430
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,397
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,609
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:45,278
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,159
Ibefieve
that some things are only discovered

1434
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:55,622
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,757
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:08,010
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1437
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,886
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1438
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:15,851
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1439
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:17,185
Shit.

1440
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,896
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1441
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,941
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1442
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:27,738
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1443
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,114
A bug.

1444
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:33,035
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1445
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:34,494
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1446
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:35,454
God damn it!

1447
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,582
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1448
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,459
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1449
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:43,378
Picture's up.

1450
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:45,589
Okay, fast forward.

1451
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:47,424
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1452
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,010
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1453
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:51,928
Play it through.

1454
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:55,348
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1455
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:57,601
There. That's where he took my phone.

1456
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:00,062
Is that thing transmitting?

1457
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,646
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1458
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,814
Plus I removed the bug.

1459
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:04,441
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1460
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,485
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1461
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,695
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1462
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,906
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1463
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:12,657
Find my real phone and track it.

1464
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:16,078
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1465
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,329
Good.

1466
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,414
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1467
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,582
They got power? Cut it.

1468
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:24,086
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1469
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:25,337
Squeeze 'em out.

1470
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,172
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1471
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,757
And get me an airplane!

1472
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,345
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1473
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:34,387
They who?

1474
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,264
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1475
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,641
Who are we working for?

1476
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,851
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1477
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:40,936
Stop being paranoid.

1478
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,229
It really does happen.

1479
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:44,022
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1480
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,732
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1481
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,109
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1482
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,985
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1483
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,278
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1484
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:51,530
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1485
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:53,782
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1486
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,088
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1487
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:09,256
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1488
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:11,800
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1489
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,261
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1490
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,513
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1491
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,849
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1492
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,976
Hey, guys. They're here.

1493
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,813
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1494
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,189
- No.
- What?

1495
01:15:26,273 --> 01:15:27,482
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1496
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,984
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1497
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:30,068
She stays.

1498
01:15:30,152 --> 01:15:31,444
What? What?

1499
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:32,529
Stay in the car.

1500
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:35,991
Let's go.

1501
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,664
Okay. Let's do it.

1502
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:48,128
FBI!

1503
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:53,717
Ladies first.

1504
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:55,510
Don't move!

1505
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,018
Tell me.

1506
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,853
Is my money being well-spent?

1507
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,272
Exceedingly well.

1508
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:10,525
Now you tell me,

1509
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:12,986
how do you like your Horsemen?

1510
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:15,197
Fricasseed or fried?

1511
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:16,489
Shredded.

1512
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,034
I'll tell the Chef.

1513
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:35,610
Freeze!

1514
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:43,785
Dylan!

1515
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:45,912
Hold on!

1516
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:49,291
You little...

1517
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:54,796
Come here!

1518
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,466
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1519
01:17:58,675 --> 01:17:59,843
You little Shit!

1520
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:00,927
You little Shit!

1521
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,221
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1522
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:05,598
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1523
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,726
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1524
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:10,395
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1525
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:12,105
Hey!

1526
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,066
Come here!

1527
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:47,223
Come here!

1528
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:49,017
All right, hold on, hold on!

1529
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,771
- Really?
- Yup.

1530
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:57,942
You...

1531
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,239
You little...

1532
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,340
Shit!

1533
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,776
Shit!

1534
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:42,529
Give me that!

1535
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,473
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

1536
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:11,850
Clear on Evan.

1537
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:13,768
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

1538
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:15,353
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1539
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:18,982
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1540
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,066
What?

1541
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:23,820
Stop! Stop!

1542
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:41,004
Hey!

1543
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:11,743
Good. Follow him!

1544
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,912
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1545
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,330
I didn't have tactical command.

1546
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:17,790
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1547
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,459
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1548
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,586
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1549
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:23,254
No!

1550
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:25,590
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1551
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,558
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1552
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:37,310
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

1553
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,853
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1554
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:39,979
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1555
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,522
Let's go.

1556
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,132
There he is!

1557
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:21,020
Move!

1558
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,442
Left!

1559
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:30,571
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1560
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:32,490
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1561
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,617
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1562
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,786
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

1563
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,789
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

1564
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,791
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

1565
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,126
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

1566
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:49,299
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

1567
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,342
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1568
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:53,469
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

1569
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,056
Come on!

1570
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:13,948
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

1571
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,159
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

1572
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,787
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

1573
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,706
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

1574
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:28,421
Good. Just stay with him.

1575
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:37,055
Go, go, go!

1576
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:42,602
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1577
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,231
Get over!

1578
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:51,861
Oh, shit!

1579
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,552
Come here!

1580
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:19,222
Get back! Get back!

1581
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,016
Dylan, let's go, man!

1582
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,226
Come on, you...

1583
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,771
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1584
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,231
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1585
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:30,233
Let's go! Leave him!

1586
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:36,406
'The Paper!
- Dylan!

1587
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,574
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1588
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:08,020
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,</i>

1589
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:10,106
<i>who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,</i>

1590
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,526
<i>took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown</i>

1591
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,405
<i>developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,</i>

1592
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:20,449
<i>which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,</i>

1593
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:22,827
<i>one of the so-called Four Horsemen.</i>

1594
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:28,124
<i>The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.</i>

1595
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:35,673
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1596
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,049
So they know what it is?

1597
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:38,843
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1598
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,595
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1599
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,221
Let's go.

1600
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:43,598
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1601
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:44,682
What's that?

1602
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,059
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1603
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,811
Rhodes.

1604
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:50,521
You do understand the function

1605
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:52,732
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1606
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,525
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1607
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:55,818
while he sets up the trick.

1608
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,238
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1609
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,407
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

1610
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,493
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

1611
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:07,830
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

1612
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,375
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1613
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,003
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1614
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,339
She was assigned to the case.

1615
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:18,591
Luck of the draw.

1616
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:22,261
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1617
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:26,015
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1618
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,225
What's in it for you?

1619
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,227
Just trying to even the game.

1620
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:33,439
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1621
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:38,361
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1622
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,282
Hey.

1623
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:44,784
We got a problem.

1624
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:47,036
Here's the safe.

1625
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,579
No, no, no. Hey.

1626
01:26:48,663 --> 01:26:49,956
What's he doing here?

1627
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,707
Giving us our first solid lead.

1628
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:53,668
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1629
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,919
called Elkhorn

1630
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,963
- for the last five years.
- And?

1631
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,714
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1632
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,259
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1633
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:03,970
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1634
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,639
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1635
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:08,724
The magician who died on the bridge...

1636
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:12,270
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1637
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:14,647
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1638
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,816
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1639
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,109
How did they get the file?

1640
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:20,403
This is the part you're gonna find

1641
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:22,446
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1642
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,949
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1643
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,326
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1644
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,995
with codes they got from your phone.

1645
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,999
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1646
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:36,002
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1647
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:38,587
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1648
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:40,923
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1649
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,260
Boss, he's taking over?

1650
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:46,804
Let's go, gentlemen.

1651
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,557
Hey.

1652
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,100
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1653
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,351
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1654
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:54,478
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1655
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,731
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1656
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:58,232
Do you understand it?

1657
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,358
Yes.

1658
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:01,736
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1659
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:04,196
If I find out that you are anything other than

1660
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,573
who you say you are, I swear...

1661
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,491
And we French also have an expression.

1662
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:10,995
"Faith can move mountains."

1663
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,747
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1664
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,665
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1665
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,917
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1666
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,754
I just got my ass handed to me.

1667
01:28:19,837 --> 01:28:21,380
I am losing this case.

1668
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:24,800
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1669
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,225
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

1670
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:38,689
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1671
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:40,149
And I can't say he achieved it,

1672
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:44,195
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1673
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:48,282
But the point is... Sorry.

1674
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:49,825
The point is...

1675
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:56,123
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1676
01:28:56,207 --> 01:28:58,751
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

1677
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,669
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

1678
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,805
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

1679
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,391
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

1680
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,725
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

1681
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:22,733
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1682
01:29:26,904 --> 01:29:27,905
What is this?

1683
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,365
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1684
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,325
We just moved it while you were outside.

1685
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:32,576
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1686
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,702
I never said that.

1687
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,121
Sir, you got a phone call

1688
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:36,831
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1689
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,999
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1690
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:39,750
What happened?

1691
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,545
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1692
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:43,712
No!

1693
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,095
Jesus Christ.

1694
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,265
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1695
01:29:54,348 --> 01:29:56,225
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto <i>in</i> D-Major.

1696
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,309
Where's the safe?

1697
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:58,477
His team is loading the truck.

1698
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,442
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1699
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,153
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1700
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:10,322
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1701
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,833
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1702
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:22,668
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1703
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,424
Okay. Here's what I want.

1704
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,759
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1705
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,136
So we stay with it.

1706
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,138
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1707
01:30:34,388 --> 01:30:35,473
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1708
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,809
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1709
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,102
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1710
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,188
You two are with me.

1711
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,076
Guys.

1712
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:59,538
Look. Office just called with this.

1713
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:01,499
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1714
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:05,461
<i>The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...</i>

1715
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,546
<i>We cannot quit now.</i>

1716
01:31:07,713 --> 01:31:10,216
<i>We've started something

1717
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:11,967

1718
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:14,595
<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,</i>

1719
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,555
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

1720
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:17,890
Their show is in a half an hour.

1721
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,225
It's exactly where we're headed.

1722
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,519
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1723
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,687
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1724
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:26,398
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1725
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:31,070
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

1726
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:34,990
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

1727
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:36,492
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

1728
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,744
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

1729
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:42,581
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

1730
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:56,178
<i>All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

1731
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:57,596
Copy that.

1732
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:15,614
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

1733
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,283
Go, for us.

1734
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:20,077
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1735
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:21,662
<i>It's a woman.</i>

1736
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,584
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1737
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:29,878
What the hell's going on?

1738
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:33,299
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1739
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:34,425
Put your guns down.

1740
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:37,469
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1741
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:38,637
Are you kidding?

1742
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:40,556
I'm following them, just like you are.

1743
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,224
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1744
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:44,059
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1745
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:45,769
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1746
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,605
Your ass is mine.

1747
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:49,565
You guys are still idiots.

1748
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:50,816
Yeah?

1749
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:51,984
This happens to be the former

1750
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:54,153
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1751
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:56,447
It's where I did my first show.

1752
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:59,450
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1753
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:00,909
why not open it?

1754
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:02,911
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1755
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,830
would you mind reenacting your look

1756
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:06,957
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1757
01:33:07,124 --> 01:33:09,209
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1758
01:33:10,544 --> 01:33:11,795
Open the safe.

1759
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:13,380
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1760
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:18,761
What the hell?

1761
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,264
What?

1762
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:23,599
Give me that.

1763
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:24,850
No.

1764
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,018
No!

1765
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:31,690
What is this?

1766
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:33,817
Get back!

1767
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:43,535
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1768
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:46,538
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1769
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:51,043
Once again, misdirection.

1770
01:33:58,008 --> 01:33:59,635
The show is starting. Move out!

1771
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:02,221
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1772
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:04,848
"What happened to the real one?"

1773
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:27,246
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1774
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:28,914
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1775
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,209
FBI! Give me a path!

1776
01:34:32,835 --> 01:34:34,420
Clear out! Clear out!

1777
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,046
<i>What is magic?</i>

1778
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,923
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

1779
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:39,758
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

1780
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,677
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

1781
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,221
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1782
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:45,681
<i>It is about belief.</i>

1783
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:46,765
<i>Faith.</i>

1784
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,891
<i>Trust.</i>

1785
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:53,272
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

1786
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:56,775
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

1787
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,194
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

1788
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:01,363
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

1789
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,366
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

1790
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:06,785
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

1791
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,620
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

1792
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:09,872
<i>It's crime.</i>

1793
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,083
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

1794
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:16,003
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

1795
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:21,300
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1796
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:22,718
I don't know.

1797
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:24,970
Showtime.

1798
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,143
Look!

1799
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,399
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1800
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:38,776
Go, go, go!

1801
01:35:39,485 --> 01:35:40,819
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1802
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:43,447
What are you doing here?

1803
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,656
They're going in the wrong direction

1804
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:45,824
and you know it.

1805
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,452
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1806
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:51,914
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1807
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:53,832
Wait.

1808
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:55,292
I'm going to go with her.

1809
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:56,710
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1810
01:35:58,545 --> 01:35:59,588
Go ahead!

1811
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,173
That's on you, Fuller.

1812
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:20,609
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1813
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:32,788
Daniel?

1814
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:34,790
Yeah?

1815
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:39,545
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1816
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:43,090
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1817
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:45,968
I'd like to express a sentiment

1818
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:47,636
to you about our relationship.

1819
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:48,929
Okay.

1820
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:52,808
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1821
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:55,644
dick.

1822
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:58,188
And?

1823
01:36:59,982 --> 01:37:01,650
No, that's it.

1824
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,901
That's very nice.

1825
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:04,486
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1826
01:37:04,653 --> 01:37:06,113
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1827
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:07,906
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1828
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,074
Oh, you!

1829
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,329
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1830
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,664
We're on our own.

1831
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,416
Our instructions run out after the show.

1832
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,210
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1833
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,004
if we were completely played and we spend

1834
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:24,131
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1835
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:26,341
I just want to say that...

1836
01:37:26,592 --> 01:37:28,969
I know. Me, too.

1837
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:32,222
Little too sentimental for me.

1838
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:40,272
There they are!

1839
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,028
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1840
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:47,154
Grab 'em!

1841
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,201
Get up!

1842
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,828
What the hell?

1843
01:37:58,624 --> 01:37:59,791
Shit!

1844
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:10,260
Hello, New York!

1845
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:20,687
Thank you for the magic.

1846
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:21,980
And thank you for being such

1847
01:38:22,064 --> 01:38:25,067
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1848
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:27,486
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1849
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:29,363
it must come to an end.

1850
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:34,576
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1851
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,203
By saying goodbye.

1852
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:38,914
All we wanted was to

1853
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:40,957
bring the world to a magic show.

1854
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,501
And thereby bring a little magic

1855
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:43,752
back to the world.

1856
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:48,924
Clear the way!

1857
01:38:58,684 --> 01:39:01,895
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1858
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,773
But it's time for us to disappear.

1859
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,274
Good night, New York.

1860
01:39:06,525 --> 01:39:07,943
And thank you for believing in us.

1861
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,738
Stop!

1862
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:16,243
Freeze!

1863
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,828
No!

1864
01:39:35,929 --> 01:39:37,222
God damn it!

1865
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:07,043
I'm sorry.

1866
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:09,713
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1867
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:14,760
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1868
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:18,722
So I guess this is it.

1869
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:21,933
IS it?

1870
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,336
Dylan!

1871
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:52,172
Dylan! Dylan!

1872
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,298
Hey.

1873
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:56,593
- You see that?
- What?

1874
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:01,598
Where's the real money?

1875
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:21,785
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1876
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:14,129
I've been framed.

1877
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:16,506
I'm sure you were.

1878
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,883
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1879
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:19,634
I always do.

1880
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,970
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1881
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:24,556
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1882
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:26,975
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1883
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,686
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1884
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,605
Sure.

1885
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:37,611
All right.

1886
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,280
I got information to trade.

1887
01:42:40,405 --> 01:42:41,573
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1888
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:43,408
If it's of some value.

1889
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:49,039
These bars give a man time to think.

1890
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:53,501
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1891
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,087
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

1892
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,090
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

1893
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:02,594
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

1894
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:06,264
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

1895
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,683
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

1896
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:11,186
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

1897
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:13,772
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

1898
01:43:15,357 --> 01:43:17,525
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

1899
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,195
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

1900
01:43:20,445 --> 01:43:21,404
Hey!

1901
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:22,781
Hey! Stop!

1902
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:24,407
Missing the trick. Again.

1903
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:25,533
Which was to make you think

1904
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:27,327
the safe had already been stolen,

1905
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:29,621
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1906
01:43:30,205 --> 01:43:33,166
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

1907
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:35,961
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

1908
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:55,647
<i>Who?</i>

1909
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:58,566
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1910
01:43:59,317 --> 01:44:00,652
Holy shit.

1911
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,238
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1912
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,157
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1913
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:14,749
It's locked.

1914
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:16,751
Weren't you listening?

1915
01:44:17,252 --> 01:44:18,336
Nothing's ever locked.

1916
01:44:19,713 --> 01:44:22,507
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1917
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:24,509
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1918
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:27,053
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1919
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:32,183
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

1920
01:44:32,434 --> 01:44:34,060
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

1921
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:36,062
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

1922
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:38,064
<i>It only took a split second</i>

1923
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:39,149
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

1924
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:40,233
<i>and make the switch.</i>

1925
01:45:02,547 --> 01:45:05,550
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

1926
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,927
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

1927
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,890
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

1928
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:14,976
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

1929
01:45:16,478 --> 01:45:20,148
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

1930
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:22,400
just to frame one guy?

1931
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:23,777
I don't know.

1932
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:25,320
They never kept any of the money they took.

1933
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,822
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1934
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:30,617
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1935
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:32,452
- No. Not really.
- What?

1936
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:37,082
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1937
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:40,126
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1938
01:45:41,086 --> 01:45:44,589
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1939
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:46,007
Tressler Insurance.

1940
01:45:47,926 --> 01:45:50,178
The bank that carried the note?

1941
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:52,931
Credit Republican of Paris.

1942
01:45:53,139 --> 01:45:54,766
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1943
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:57,519
What do you make of that?

1944
01:45:57,602 --> 01:45:59,771
A sucker is born every minute.

1945
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:03,108
What if all this was just leading up to

1946
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:05,902
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1947
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:08,696
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1948
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,864
We just have to find...

1949
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:11,074
That?

1950
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:15,328
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1951
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:18,790
And the card encased in glass.

1952
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,751
What do we do now?

1953
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:39,853
Oh, nice!

1954
01:46:55,702 --> 01:46:57,162
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

1955
01:46:57,662 --> 01:47:01,082
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1956
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:02,917
Waiting

1957
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:07,088
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1958
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:09,841
from the mediocre ones.

1959
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:11,885
Maybe that was you.

1960
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,762
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1961
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:17,473
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1962
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:20,727
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1963
01:47:21,186 --> 01:47:22,687
You pissed them off.

1964
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:27,442
The Eye isn't real.

1965
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:30,612
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1966
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,197
Somebody with an obsession.

1967
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:33,865
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1968
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:37,285
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1969
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,954
Somebody so prepared to lose

1970
01:47:40,038 --> 01:47:42,540
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1971
01:47:42,624 --> 01:47:45,460
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1972
01:47:45,543 --> 01:47:47,212
I don't know who.

1973
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:49,797
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1974
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:51,216
to plant the mirrors.

1975
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,387
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1976
01:47:56,471 --> 01:47:59,724
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1977
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:02,685
Almost as if they were on the...

1978
01:48:15,573 --> 01:48:16,950
The inside.

1979
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,129
You.

1980
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:35,760
Why?

1981
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,930
That is the question, isn't it?

1982
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:41,307
You're right.

1983
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:44,269
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1984
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:46,312
to see the look on your face.

1985
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:50,275
Who are you?

1986
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:52,777
What do you want from me?

1987
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:55,113
What do I want?

1988
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,449
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1989
01:48:58,533 --> 01:49:02,537
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1990
01:49:03,204 --> 01:49:06,291
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1991
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,294
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1992
01:49:09,377 --> 01:49:12,130
when you were always two steps behind.

1993
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:18,011
Dylan?

1994
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:19,971
Wait a minute.

1995
01:49:21,014 --> 01:49:23,141
Dylan! How did this happen?

1996
01:49:30,815 --> 01:49:32,483
Dylan!

1997
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:33,609
Why?

1998
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:35,320
Why?

1999
01:49:39,324 --> 01:49:41,492
Oh, my God.

2000
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:44,370
I did not see that coming.

2001
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:45,747
That's impossible!

2002
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:46,831
No way.

2003
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,334
That was actually pretty good.

2004
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:50,835
Thank you.

2005
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:53,463
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2006
01:49:53,546 --> 01:49:54,589
We were in agreement.

2007
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,007
Okay. Right.

2008
01:49:56,382 --> 01:49:57,383
Henley.

2009
01:49:58,176 --> 01:50:00,011
I've never seen her speechless.

2010
01:50:00,094 --> 01:50:01,679
I take that as a huge compliment.

2011
01:50:02,388 --> 01:50:05,058
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2012
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,352
Hey, listen, for the record,

2013
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:11,022
I have always been a 100% believer.

2014
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,441
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2015
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:15,651
these infidels on point...

2016
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:17,779
Merritt, you're in.

2017
01:50:18,613 --> 01:50:19,697
God bless.

2018
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:20,823
Come.

2019
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:25,036
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2020
01:50:25,244 --> 01:50:27,121
and making them all work together.

2021
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:29,665
And that's exactly what you did.

2022
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:31,709
So welcome.

2023
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:37,090
Welcome to the Eye.

2024
01:51:44,282 --> 01:51:46,367
It was all connected.

2025
01:51:46,993 --> 01:51:49,996
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2026
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,673
And Elkhorn?

2027
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:02,717
What's the connection to Shrike?

2028
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:08,431
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2029
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:10,892
They used cheap steel.

2030
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:13,769
They cut corners.

2031
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:17,064
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2032
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:18,524
And he was trapped.

2033
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:21,652
He was your father.

2034
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:26,866
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

2035
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:32,914
<i>When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

2036
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:40,296
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

2037
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:44,175
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

2038
01:52:44,258 --> 01:52:46,385
And from that moment on,

2039
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:49,013
I created a persona.

2040
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:51,557
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2041
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:54,936
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2042
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:56,520
was you.

2043
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:01,150
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2044
01:53:01,651 --> 01:53:04,403
is to take this case to its resolution.

2045
01:53:04,487 --> 01:53:07,531
And for you to turn me in.

2046
01:53:12,662 --> 01:53:13,704
Yeah.

2047
01:53:15,665 --> 01:53:19,502
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2048
01:53:20,878 --> 01:53:22,213
And you also know

2049
01:53:23,089 --> 01:53:27,426
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2050
01:53:33,933 --> 01:53:35,726
One more secret to lock away.

2051
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:04,797
<i>Come in close.</i>

2052
01:54:05,298 --> 01:54:06,549
<i>Closer.</i>

2053
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:08,884
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

2054
01:54:08,968 --> 01:54:11,304
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

2055
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:15,558
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

2056
01:54:15,641 --> 01:54:18,185
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

2057
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:20,229
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

2058
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,315
<i>One.</i>

2059
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,441
<i>Two...</i>

2060
01:55:55,282 --> 01:55:57,159
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2061
01:55:57,535 --> 01:56:01,247
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2062
01:56:02,248 --> 01:56:03,707
Oh, thank God.

2063
01:56:05,668 --> 01:56:07,753
Where are we?

2064
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:10,256
Great, another shit hole.

2065
01:56:10,339 --> 01:56:12,258
Okay, feeling it.

2066
01:56:12,341 --> 01:56:16,512
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2067
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:19,431
Check out this place.

2068
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:22,309
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2069
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:24,270
This place is awesome.

2070
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:26,814
Is this our new gear?

2071
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:28,440
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

2072
01:56:28,524 --> 01:56:29,567
You know I don't wear spandex.

2073
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:32,027
- It's Locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2074
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:34,655
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2075
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:39,743
Okay.
