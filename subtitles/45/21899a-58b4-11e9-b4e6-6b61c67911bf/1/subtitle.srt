1
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,137
Hey, you got a room?

2
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,142
Hey, man!

3
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,346
You got a room?

4
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,364
You asshole!

5
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:53,576
I'm going down to Mardi Gras
to get me a Mardi Gras queen

6
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,780
Oh, man. Wow, Mardi Gras!

7
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:59,383
That'll be the weirdest, you know?

8
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,427
You know what we
ought to do first thing?

9
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,111
Go and get us a groovy dinner.

10
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:09,754
Break out some of that cash, man.

11
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:19,605
Out here in the wilderness, fighting
lndians and cowboys on every side.

12
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,412
What's the matter? You zonked?
Really zonked, eh?

13
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,215
No, l'm just kind of tired.

14
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:32,060
You're pulling inside. You're
getting a little distance tonight.

15
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,622
You're getting a little distance, man.

16
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,227
Well, l'm just
getting my thing together.

17
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,339
Come on, it's checkout time!

18
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,541
Hey, Billy!

19
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:46,704
Man, don't do that.

20
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,353
Howdy!

21
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,756
What can l do for you?

22
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,761
l'd like to fix my flat,
if you don't mind.

23
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,842
No, l don't mind.

24
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:42,206
ln the barn there,
you'll find any tools you'll need.

25
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,769
Whoa, baby! Whoa, honey!

26
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:48,894
Turn that thing off.
You're making my horse skittish.

27
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:57,544
Sure is a good-looking machine.

28
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:28,018
There you go.

29
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,870
You fellows can sit down here.

30
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:51,565
Would you mind taking off your hat?

31
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:07,061
We thank thee, Lord, for these
thy gifts received from thy bounty.

32
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,504
ln the name of
Thy only begotten Son...

33
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:13,068
...Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

34
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:26,684
Where you fellows from?

35
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,967
L.A.

36
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,289
L.A.?

37
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,932
Los Angeles.

38
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,373
Los Angeles.

39
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,895
ls that a fact?

40
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,137
When l was a young man...

41
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,500
...l was headed for California, but....

42
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,383
Well, you know how it is.

43
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,515
You sure got a nice spread here.

44
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,640
Yeah, l sure got a lot of them.

45
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,923
My wife is Catholic, you know?

46
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,169
Can we have some more coffee?

47
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:15,740
No, l mean it.

48
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,782
You've got a nice place.

49
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:21,145
lt's not every man that
can live off the land, you know?

50
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,188
Can do your own thing in your own time.

51
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,950
You should be proud.

52
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,322
Hey, man, what are you doing?

53
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,927
l got to talk to you, man.

54
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,856
Everything we ever dreamed of
is in that gas tank.

55
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,458
You got a stranger pouring
gasoline on it.

56
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:15,742
All he's got to do is look into it
and he can see--

57
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,985
He won't know what it is, man.

58
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,748
Don't worry, Billy.
Everything's all right.

59
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,071
All right, man. l don't know.

60
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,512
l do.

61
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,355
Everything's fine, Billy.

62
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,772
That's all taken care of.

63
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,175
l like that.

64
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:09,646
- How much further do we got to go?
- l don't know.

65
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:12,649
Not much further.

66
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,253
That's what you said this morning.

67
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:19,897
l sometimes say it all day.

68
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,661
Really? You say it all day?

69
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,464
We don't have much longer.
We'll be there soon.

70
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:29,068
We got to get to Mardi Gras, man.

71
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,471
Your little heart is set on that, huh?

72
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,513
We got a week.

73
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,316
That's a week away, man.

74
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:39,079
lt's a long way to Mardi Gras, baby.

75
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:43,123
lt won't take us a week
to get to New Orleans.

76
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,618
l think l'm going to crash.

77
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:58,100
l think you have crashed, man.

78
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:11,915
l keep seeing things
jumping all over the place.

79
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,719
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

80
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,723
- What is it?
- lt's a moth.

81
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,124
A what?

82
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:21,406
Moth. Bug.

83
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,736
This is a weird place, man.

84
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,140
That smoke's getting to me.

85
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:37,345
But l notice you're not moving.

86
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:44,553
Where are you from, man?

87
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:48,197
Can l have a light?

88
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:50,159
Where are you from, man?

89
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:54,484
Hard to say.

90
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,965
Hard to say?

91
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,768
Where are you from, man?

92
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:01,571
lt's hard to say because
it's a very long word, you know?

93
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,976
l just want to know
where you're from.

94
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,221
The city.

95
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,383
From a city?

96
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,628
Doesn't matter what city.
They're all alike.

97
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,430
That's why l'm out here now.

98
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,592
That's why you're out here now?

99
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,195
Why?

100
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,837
Because l'm a long way from the city...

101
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:26,559
...and that's where
l want to be right now.

102
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:31,806
They know you in this place?

103
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,810
This place we're coming to?

104
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:38,253
The place where we're at now?

105
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:41,417
This place.

106
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,225
You're right on top of them.

107
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:51,427
l'm right on top of them?

108
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,833
The people this place belongs to
are buried right under you.

109
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:01,038
You could be a trifle polite.

110
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,241
''A trifle polite''?

111
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:07,046
A small thing to ask.

112
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:18,378
You ever want to be somebody else?

113
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,864
l'd like to try Porky Pig.

114
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,874
l never wanted to be anybody else.

115
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:30,808
You can't hit me. l'm invisible!

116
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:40,138
Hey, Sarah. How's it going?

117
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:50,430
Rudolph, what are you eating?

118
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,435
Thanks for the stuff you brought.

119
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:55,835
How's it going?

120
00:27:56,116 --> 00:28:00,081
We can't take any more strangers.
Just too many people dropping in.

121
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:03,645
l'm not talking about
you and your friends.

122
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:08,290
Last week, Susan dropped in
with 1 2 people from Easter City.

123
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:11,294
She wanted to take
1 0 pounds of rice with her.

124
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:13,296
Naturally, we had to say no.

125
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,260
So she gets uptight, breaks out
some hash and won't give us any.

126
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,903
They went outside
to start their bus...

127
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,745
...and couldn't get it started.

128
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:25,269
l bet you haven't had anybody around
like me to rap to.

129
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,713
You know l love you
and l want you to rap.

130
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,397
- Oh, God! l want you to rap.
- Cut that out.

131
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:34,079
l guess nobody else here
is interested...

132
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,682
...but l'd sure like
to meet your friend.

133
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,285
l bet you'd like to do more than that.

134
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,728
l think he's beautiful.

135
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:43,170
He's beautiful.

136
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,093
What's that weird thing on the hill?

137
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:49,336
lt looks like a stage.
You got a light opera company?

138
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,219
That's the mime troupe stage.

139
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,661
They've gone down to the hot springs.

140
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,544
Mime troupe?

141
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:58,626
Hey, Lisa?

142
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:01,350
What does this mean?

143
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:04,553
''Starting brings misfortune.

144
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:08,118
Perseverance brings danger.

145
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:12,843
Not every demand for change
in the existing order should be heeded.

146
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,366
On the other hand,
repeated and well-founded complaints...

147
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,770
...should not fail to a hearing.''

148
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,971
Well, when one--

149
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:22,574
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

150
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:26,779
We've come to play for our dinner...

151
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,383
...or should l say,
stay for our dinner.

152
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,465
Or even...

153
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:34,868
...slay for our dinner.

154
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:39,192
Men at war.
How ghastly, ghastly!

155
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,795
We've come to drink your wine...

156
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:45,920
...taste your food
and take pleasure in your women.

157
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,524
The water in that river
is about 80 degrees.

158
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:51,887
You put your hand in a foot away,
it's below freezing.

159
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:54,930
Oh, come on.
l've got to get dinner on.

160
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,652
Who said ''out'' to me?

161
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:59,255
l picked--
Unhand me! l played communes--

162
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:01,137
Out! Out!

163
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,540
Evil eye on this place.

164
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,382
A double whammy for you all.

165
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,588
Come, my dear.
We won't play here.

166
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,275
Get out.

167
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:19,038
l like you.

168
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:30,451
These people got here
late in the summer.

169
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:33,454
Too late to plant.
But the weather was beautiful...

170
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:36,777
...and it was easy living.
And then came that winter.

171
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,382
There were 40 or 50
living in a one-room place.

172
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:45,107
Nothing to eat, out by the side
of the road looking for dead horses.

173
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:47,069
Anything they could get ahold of.

174
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,753
There's 1 8 or 20 left.
And they're city kids. Look at them.

175
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,081
But they're getting this crop in.

176
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,287
They'll stay here till it's harvested.
That's the whole thing.

177
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:11,296
Do you get much rain here, man?

178
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,300
l guess we'll have to dance for that.

179
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:29,917
Look at this, man. A seashell.

180
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:37,566
There's nothing but sand.
They ain't going to make it.

181
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,129
They're going to make it.

182
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,735
They're going to make it.

183
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:18,240
We have planted our seeds.

184
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:22,845
We ask...

185
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:26,449
...that our efforts be worthy...

186
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,053
...to produce simple food...

187
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,856
...for our simple taste.

188
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,061
We ask that our efforts...

189
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:40,664
...be rewarded.

190
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,072
We thank You for the food
we eat from other hands...

191
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,082
...that we may share it
with our fellow man...

192
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:00,286
...and be even more generous...

193
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:03,490
...when it is from our own.

194
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,939
Thank You for a place...

195
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,902
...to make a stand.

196
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:23,873
Amen.

197
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,680
Let's eat.

198
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,927
Hark ye gentles! Hark ye all.

199
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:38,730
Time has come for curtain call.

200
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:45,457
How do you wear your hair
Does your hair hang low

201
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,742
Do you tie it in a ribbon
Do you tie it in a bow

202
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:53,627
Do you wear it over your shoulder
Like a Continental soldier....

203
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:22,419
Are you an Aquarius?

204
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,592
Pisces?

205
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:46,006
l guessed right.

206
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:53,014
Do you like our place here?

207
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,661
Who sent you?

208
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,255
l got to get out of here, man.

209
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:08,900
We got things we want to do, man.

210
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:11,503
l got to get out of here, man.

211
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:17,949
Could you take me and my friend
over across the canyon?

212
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,712
Yeah, anything.

213
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:22,955
lt won't be out of
your way, honest.

214
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,517
lt's all right.

215
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,921
lt's all right.

216
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,364
We're not no traveling bureau.

217
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:33,727
Why don't they get their own ride?

218
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,130
We're eating their food.

219
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:41,776
All right, man.

220
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:52,949
- Get them together though, man.
- Right.

221
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:54,554
When you get to the right place,
with the right people...

222
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,396
...quarter this.

223
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,561
You know, this could be
the right place.

224
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:03,564
Your time's running out.

225
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:05,046
Hey, man!

226
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,770
lf we're going, we're going.
Let's go!

227
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,181
l'm hip about time.

228
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:23,827
But l just got to go.

229
00:42:27,889 --> 00:42:31,609
Parading without a permit?
Do you know who this is, man?

230
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:35,689
This is Captain America. l'm Billy.
We're headliners, baby.

231
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:40,249
We played every fair in this part of
the country. For top dollar!

232
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:10,130
Weirdo hicks, man.
A bunch of weirdo hicks.

233
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:14,850
Parading without a permit, man!

234
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:40,692
Oh, no!
What did l do now?

235
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:47,692
Oh, what am l going to do now?

236
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,653
Oh, my head!

237
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:58,533
All right, George.
What're you going to do now?

238
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:01,293
You promised these people, now.

239
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:05,653
You promised these people
and you promised these people....

240
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:10,453
Hey, would you mind?

241
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,454
You just woke my friend up.

242
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:19,254
l'm real sorry.
l didn't realize l....

243
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:22,455
l didn't realize.

244
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:29,456
My head.

245
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:34,256
lf you don't shut your mouth,
you won't have a head!

246
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:55,656
l see you're up, Mr. Hansen.
You'll feel a lot better after this.

247
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:01,257
Thank you, Bob.

248
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:08,257
l guess l really
tied one on last night.

249
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:11,057
Must've had a hell of a good time.

250
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:13,857
l wish l could remember it.

251
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,978
Could you get me a cigarette?

252
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:25,098
You animals ain't smart enough
to play with fire.

253
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:28,457
They're good boys.
You can give them a cigarette.

254
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:33,059
Thanks, mister.

255
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:37,859
Got a match?

256
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,259
Thank you, Bob.

257
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,380
l'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

258
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,540
There was no misunderstanding.
We're all in the same cage here.

259
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,300
You must be some important dude.
That treatment--

260
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:05,700
'' Dude''?

261
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:09,461
What does he mean, ''dude''?
Dude ranch?

262
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:16,341
'' Dude'' means a nice guy, you know?

263
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,781
'' Dude'' means a regular person.

264
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:22,941
You don't look like you're from
this part of the country.

265
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:26,981
You're lucky l'm here to see
you don't get into anything.

266
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:28,582
Well...

267
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:31,582
...they got this here...

268
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:35,142
...scissor-happy,
beautify-America thing here.

269
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:38,263
Trying to make everybody
look like Yul Brynner.

270
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:43,022
They used rusty razor blades
on the last two longhairs...

271
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:46,224
...they brought in.
l wasn't here to protect them.

272
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:47,622
See...

273
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:51,423
...l'm a lawyer.

274
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:54,024
Done a lot of work for the ACLU.

275
00:46:54,264 --> 00:46:55,784
George Hansen.

276
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:01,903
You think you can help us
get out of here?

277
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:06,983
l imagine that l can
if you haven't killed anybody.

278
00:47:07,944 --> 00:47:10,184
At least nobody white.

279
00:47:14,384 --> 00:47:17,584
See there? $25.
Not too bad for no razor blades.

280
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:18,744
You know?

281
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:21,504
- Very groovy. Thank you.
- Very groovy.

282
00:47:21,746 --> 00:47:24,585
See? l'll bet nobody ever
said that to you.

283
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:27,785
By the way, thanks
for the aspirin before.

284
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,585
l'm getting to....

285
00:47:29,865 --> 00:47:33,385
l'm getting to think you're
a regular '' regular'' here.

286
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,785
l'm not going to tell your dad.

287
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:38,225
You just got to be more careful.

288
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:43,266
That'd be good if the powers that be
wouldn't hear about this.

289
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:47,226
The old man's not feeling good.
Know what l mean?

290
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:51,946
Well, now, George, we won't tell
your dad about that.

291
00:47:52,747 --> 00:47:54,947
- lsn't that right?
- That's right.

292
00:47:56,587 --> 00:48:01,107
What do you say we look at these super
machines we been hearing about?

293
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:02,987
Let's get it on.

294
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:06,387
Thanks a lot, Bob.
See you later.

295
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:14,188
l'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

296
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,627
All right, Carl.

297
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:20,788
Thanks a million.
Say hello to the missus.

298
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,388
Here's to the first
of the day, fellas.

299
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:31,988
To old D.H. Lawrence.

300
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,390
lndians!

301
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:56,990
Thank you.

302
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,791
You know...

303
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:05,591
...l must've started off to Mardi Gras
six or seven times.

304
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:09,191
Never got further than the state line.

305
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:13,791
The governor of Louisiana
gave me this.

306
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:16,991
'' Madame Tinkertoy's
House of Blue Lights.

307
00:49:17,192 --> 00:49:20,311
Bourbon and Toulouse,
New Orleans, Louisiana.''

308
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:25,111
Now this is supposed to be
the finest whorehouse in the South.

309
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:30,151
These ain't no pork chops.
These are U.S. prime.

310
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:31,832
Out of sight, man!

311
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:34,592
Oh, l'd like to get over there.

312
00:49:36,192 --> 00:49:40,632
How long did you boys say
it would take you to get down there?

313
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:43,353
- Two or three days.
- Two or three days?

314
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:45,032
ls that right?

315
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:49,193
Boy, l sure wish
l was going with you.

316
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:52,593
You got a helmet?

317
00:49:55,874 --> 00:50:00,154
Oh, l've got a helmet!
l got a beauty!

318
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:29,522
Well, old buddy, l never thought
l'd ever see you again.

319
00:52:31,082 --> 00:52:34,322
You know, l threw this thing away
one week ago.

320
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:39,082
My mother, of all people, retrieved it.
l can't understand.

321
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:44,123
She didn't want me to play football.
Always afraid l'd get hurt.

322
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:47,524
And here, 1 2 years later,
l find it on my pillow...

323
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:52,524
...with a note pinned next to it
saying, ''Save this for your son.''

324
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:00,965
Fire!

325
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:04,843
Do this instead.

326
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:10,125
No, thanks. l got some
store-bought here of my own.

327
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:13,125
No, man. This is grass.

328
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:16,484
You mean, marijuana?

329
00:53:20,885 --> 00:53:23,925
Lord have mercy!
ls that what that is?

330
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:29,926
Let me see that.

331
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:40,926
Go ahead. Light it up.

332
00:53:41,407 --> 00:53:43,327
Oh, no, no, no...

333
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:47,527
...l couldn't do that.
l've got enough problems...

334
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:51,486
...with the booze and all.
l can't afford to get hooked.

335
00:53:54,008 --> 00:53:55,568
You won't get hooked.

336
00:53:55,808 --> 00:54:00,127
Well, l know.
But it leads to harder stuff.

337
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,488
You say it's all right?

338
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:20,329
Well, all right then.
How do l do it?

339
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:22,128
Here.

340
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,730
That's got a real nice taste to it.

341
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,649
Though l don't suppose it'll
do me much good.

342
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,410
l'm so used to the booze.

343
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:55,731
You've got to hold it
in your lungs longer.

344
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:09,531
What...

345
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:13,651
...was that, man?
What the hell was that?

346
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:18,772
l don't know, man.
l was watching this object...

347
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:20,772
...like the satellite we saw.

348
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:24,132
And it went right across the sky.
And then....

349
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:26,772
l mean, it just suddenly....

350
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:31,892
lt just changed direction and went
whizzing off. lt flashed and--

351
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:34,372
You're stoned out of your mind.

352
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:39,093
Oh, yeah. l'm stoned, man.
But, like, l saw a satellite.

353
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:44,133
And it was going across the sky,
and it flashed three times at me...

354
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,573
...and zigzagged and whizzed off.

355
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:48,734
And l saw it.

356
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:54,734
That was a UFO beaming back at you.

357
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:59,134
Me and Eric Heisman
was down in Mexico two weeks ago.

358
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:02,655
We seen 40 of them
flying in formation.

359
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:06,135
They've got bases
all over the world now.

360
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:09,095
They've been coming here
ever since 1 946...

361
00:56:09,296 --> 00:56:13,536
...when scientists started
bouncing radar beams off the moon.

362
00:56:13,775 --> 00:56:17,535
And they've been living
and working among us ever since.

363
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:20,256
The government knows all about them.

364
00:56:20,776 --> 00:56:22,616
What are you talking, man?

365
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,896
You just seen one of them,
didn't you?

366
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:30,335
l saw something, but l didn't
see it working here.

367
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:33,977
Well, they are people,
just like us...

368
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:36,577
...from within our own solar system.

369
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:40,175
Except that their society is
more highly evolved.

370
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:43,936
They don't have no wars.
They got no monetary system.

371
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:48,176
They don't have any leaders,
because each man is a leader.

372
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,377
Because of their technology...

373
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:55,937
...they're able to feed, clothe, house
and transport themselves...

374
00:56:56,138 --> 00:56:58,738
...equally and with no effort.

375
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:12,658
You know something?
You want to know what l think?

376
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:16,978
l think this is a crackpot idea.
That's what l think.

377
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:19,699
How about that?

378
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,739
Think it's a crackpot idea.

379
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,220
lf they're so smart,
why don't they reveal themselves...

380
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,980
...and get it over with?

381
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,180
Why don't they reveal themselves
is because if they did...

382
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,380
...it'd cause a general panic.

383
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,140
Now, we still have leaders...

384
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,860
...upon whom we rely
to release this information.

385
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:46,781
These leaders have decided
to repress this information...

386
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:48,981
...because of the shock...

387
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,900
...that it would cause
to our antiquated systems.

388
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:57,781
Now, the result of this has been
that the Venusians...

389
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:01,981
...have contacted people
at all walks of life...

390
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:04,141
...all walks of life....

391
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:24,782
lt would be a devastating blow to
our antiquated systems.

392
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:29,383
Now Venusians are meeting with people
in all walks of life...

393
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:31,703
...in an advisory capacity.

394
00:58:32,143 --> 00:58:35,143
For once, man will have
a godlike control...

395
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:39,943
...over his own destiny.
He'll have a chance to transcend...

396
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,663
...and to evolve
with some equality for all.

397
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:53,144
How's your joint, George?

398
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,585
l believe it went out.

399
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:05,345
l got to talking so much,
l clean forgot about....

400
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,344
lt went out.

401
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:19,185
Save it and we'll do it
tomorrow morning.

402
00:59:19,426 --> 00:59:22,345
lt gives you a new way
of looking at the day.

403
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,346
Well, l sure could use that.

404
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:31,706
l sure could use a little of that.

405
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:24,116
What the hell is this?
Troublemakers?

406
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:28,315
You name it,
l'll throw rocks at it, Sheriff.

407
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:32,117
Y'all, check what just walked in.

408
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:35,756
l like the one in the red shirt
with suspenders.

409
01:02:35,957 --> 01:02:37,156
White shirt for me.

410
01:02:37,397 --> 01:02:40,037
l like something
with black pants on.

411
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,957
- What did you say?
- l said--

412
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:46,958
What?

413
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:53,637
l can't believe.
What are they doing here?

414
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,398
- Look at the teeth around his neck.
- Did they drive motorcycles?

415
01:02:57,598 --> 01:02:59,597
They know we're talking about them.

416
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,718
Hot damn!

417
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:03,959
l'll tell you.

418
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:08,119
l'll order kidneys, because
l left mine out on the road somewhere.

419
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:13,319
- l like his hair all down his head.
- And l like his eyes.

420
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,999
You know that girl over there
in the corner?

421
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,319
Don't look too close because
the sheriff's right over there.

422
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:22,799
You know what l mean?

423
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,959
- Check that joker with long hair.
- l checked him.

424
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,520
We might have to bring him
to the Hilton before it's over.

425
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:31,960
- l think she's cute.
- lsn't she though?

426
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:34,121
We'll put him in a woman's cell.

427
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,240
We ought to put them in a cage
and charge admission to see them.

428
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:42,881
Those are what are known as
country witticisms.

429
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:44,881
l can't believe they're here.

430
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:47,441
Let's ask them to take us for a ride.

431
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:48,921
Don't be foolish!

432
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:51,921
They'll think you--
He'll laugh in your face.

433
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:54,881
- Yeah, that'd be good.
- l doubt it.

434
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,121
- l'm going to ask them.
- Be my guest.

435
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:59,361
Not when l'm around.

436
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,242
l don't think you're going to.

437
01:04:01,482 --> 01:04:02,722
Go ahead.

438
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:08,922
l thought at first
that bunch over there...

439
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:11,762
...their mothers were
frightened by gorillas...

440
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:13,962
...but now l think they were caught.

441
01:04:14,163 --> 01:04:16,123
l think one's Alley Oop...

442
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:17,763
...from the beads on him.

443
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,122
One of them darn sure is not Oola.

444
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:24,323
Look like a bunch of refugees
from a gorilla love-in.

445
01:04:24,884 --> 01:04:27,963
- A gorilla couldn't love that.
- Nor could a mother.

446
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:32,322
l wish you could mate him up
with one of those black wenches.

447
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:34,723
Oh, now, l don't know about that.

448
01:04:34,964 --> 01:04:37,724
And that's about as low as they come.

449
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:38,924
He's a biggie.

450
01:04:39,165 --> 01:04:40,324
And they're green.

451
01:04:40,525 --> 01:04:43,644
- No, they're not green, they're white.
- White?

452
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:46,604
You're colour-blind.
l just got to say that.

453
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:48,364
Sure like to get some food.

454
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:53,125
l thought jails were built for
humanity, and that won't quite qualify.

455
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:58,125
- Wonder where they got those wigs.
- They probably grew them.

456
01:04:58,325 --> 01:05:00,965
- Nothing else would grow on them.
- You know...

457
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,925
...l'm not real hungry at the moment.

458
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:06,286
You know what l mean?

459
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:10,126
l saw two of them one time
just kissing away.

460
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:11,565
Two males. Think of it!

461
01:05:15,126 --> 01:05:16,806
What should we do with them?

462
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:20,806
l don't know, but l don't think
they'll make the parish line.

463
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,086
Let's split.

464
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:28,446
Split?

465
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:35,726
Yes, sir.

466
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:38,527
lt certainly has been nice.

467
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:47,568
They got fancy bikes.
That's some Yankee queers.

468
01:05:47,768 --> 01:05:49,928
Check the flag on that bike.

469
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:52,129
lt sure is.

470
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:56,128
l still say they're not going to
make the parish line.

471
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,248
Hey, can l have a ride?

472
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:04,849
You want a ride?

473
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,928
You got a note from your moms?

474
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:09,929
Oh, our mothers won't mind.

475
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:12,328
Please let us have a ride.

476
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,730
l don't mind giving you a ride.

477
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,329
The man is at the window

478
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:26,250
The man is at the window!

479
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,890
l'd love to take
you girls for a ride.

480
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:03,173
You know...

481
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:06,852
...this used to be
a hell of a good country.

482
01:07:07,772 --> 01:07:11,052
l can't understand
what's gone wrong with it.

483
01:07:14,453 --> 01:07:16,493
Everybody got chicken, that's what.

484
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:19,812
We can't even get into
a second-rate hotel.

485
01:07:20,013 --> 01:07:22,773
l mean, a second-rate motel, you dig?

486
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:26,493
They think we'd cut their throat.
They're scared.

487
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:28,493
They're not scared of you.

488
01:07:28,733 --> 01:07:31,693
They're scared of
what you represent to them.

489
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:36,374
All we represent to them
is somebody who needs a haircut.

490
01:07:36,614 --> 01:07:37,693
Oh, no.

491
01:07:38,214 --> 01:07:40,054
What you represent to them...

492
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,454
...is freedom.

493
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:43,734
Freedom's what it's all about.

494
01:07:43,974 --> 01:07:46,894
Oh yeah, that's right.
That's what it's all about.

495
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:49,294
But talking about it and being it...

496
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,534
...that's two different things.

497
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:54,094
lt's real hard to be free...

498
01:07:54,295 --> 01:07:57,655
...when you are bought and sold
in the marketplace.

499
01:08:00,096 --> 01:08:04,255
Don't tell anybody that they're not
free, because they'll get busy...

500
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:08,056
...killing and maiming
to prove to you that they are.

501
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:11,415
They're going to talk to you
and talk to you...

502
01:08:11,656 --> 01:08:14,176
...about individual freedom.

503
01:08:14,536 --> 01:08:18,856
But they see a free individual,
it's going to scare them.

504
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:22,056
Well, it don't make them
running scared.

505
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:26,457
lt makes them dangerous.

506
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:37,457
Swamp.

507
01:08:44,738 --> 01:08:46,058
Swamp.

508
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:55,259
Do you ever....

509
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,458
You ever talk to bullfrogs
in the middle of the night?

510
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:01,259
Not generally.

511
01:09:02,019 --> 01:09:03,259
- You don't?
- No, man.

512
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,859
You know what l used to do?

513
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,779
What did you used to do?

514
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,058
One thing l didn't used to do...

515
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,260
...is talk to bullfrogs
in the middle of the night, foolish.

516
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,660
You're out of your mind!

517
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,660
That's right.

518
01:10:52,906 --> 01:10:54,665
Oh, God.

519
01:10:59,346 --> 01:11:01,866
What are we going to do
with his stuff, man?

520
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:06,466
Get it to his folks somehow.

521
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:13,666
There's not much here, man.

522
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:18,066
There's some money,
and there's his driver's license.

523
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:21,026
Here's his card, man.

524
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:24,467
He ain't going to be using that.

525
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:56,709
We'll go there for
just one drink, man.

526
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,710
No man, now really.
He would've wanted us to, man.

527
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:23,393
'' lf God did not exist,
it would be necessary to invent Him.''

528
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:27,913
That's a humdinger.

529
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:34,314
l'm getting a little smashed, man.

530
01:13:34,554 --> 01:13:36,114
A little smashed.

531
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:55,116
Wow, it's hot in here, man.

532
01:14:00,276 --> 01:14:01,916
Chicks, man.

533
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:08,516
Look at those chicks, man.

534
01:14:35,518 --> 01:14:37,117

This is all just a weird act.

ls this really your hair?
Are you kidding me?

552
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:36,641
- What are these things?
- What are these things, huh?

553
01:15:36,842 --> 01:15:38,402
l'm kind of a freak myself.

554
01:15:39,362 --> 01:15:42,161
l never really thought
of myself as a freak.

555
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:44,522
But l'd love to freak.

556
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:48,161
What's happening outside?

557
01:15:48,403 --> 01:15:49,523

What?

565
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:24,164
You paid for me.

566
01:16:26,324 --> 01:16:29,284
That was for my friend.

01:19:56,697 --> 01:19:58,136
What's that?

575
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,335
Never mind.

Give it to me.

579
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:19,537
