1
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,368
Her name is Kyungjin

2
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:05,616
Yeo Kyungjin... I feel strange
just saying her name

3
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,452
She has something special
that no one else can touch

4
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,050
It's the dream of any man

5
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,525
to go traveling with a woman he loves

6
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,424
I wished for that too,
and we did go on a trip

7
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,667
However, my fate...

8
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,340
no, first let me tell you how we met

9
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,034
Thiefll Thiefll

10
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,113
Thief!! Snatcher, Stop

11
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,882
My purse! Somebody catch him!

12
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,326
Get him! Please help me!

13
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,266
Excuse me!

14
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,769
Hey, stop!

15
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,476
You!

16
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,010
It's not me, it's him!

17
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,679
Why are you chasing me? It's not me

18
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,479
It's not me. I'm a brave citizen!

19
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,185
He's getting away!

20
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,731
He's getting away! Over there!

21
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,898
That's what they all say

22
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,742
What are you doing?
My eyes! My eyes!

23
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,312
Help me! I'm dying here

24
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,215
I can't open my eyes
My eyes! Get this off of my eyes

25
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,490
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law

26
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,684
You have the right to remain silent,
but if you do, you're a dead man

27
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,788
My neck!

28
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,932
"You have the right to consult a lawyer
If you're broke,"

29
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,631
The government will get you one
But I doubt it'll help you any

30
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,173
Sir, a criminal caught red-handed!

31
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,680
Aren't you off duty today?

32
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,043
Sir, a cop's a cop even
if she's off duty

33
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,685
Ma'am! He's the thief, right?

34
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,047
I caught him

35
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,781
Ma'am, you remember me? I'm innocent!

36
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,357
You were robbed at a shoe repair shop,

37
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,187
and I ran after the thief

38
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,363
Hey, shut up

39
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,063
Are you sure this time?

40
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,027
Why don't you trust me, sir?
Well...

41
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,300
Gimme your ID

42
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,897
In my back pocket

43
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,942
Give me a break

44
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,643
Occupation? Physics teacher

45
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,989
At Sunik Women's High
I start next Monday

46
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,089
Cut the crap! Or you might
get in real trouble

47
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,786
I can describe the thief

48
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,298
He was wearing a blue shirt
and black pants

49
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,061
He had curly hair,
and an earring on one side

50
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:16,036
His eyes were narrow, and there were
a few whiskers on his chin

51
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,336
He had a long nose, with white skin...

52
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:24,039
And his shoes were...
suede with gold decoration

53
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,083
You remember in great detail, huh?

54
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,324
Betray your partner,
then you can go free?

55
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:38,259
I can draw a picture of him
Shut up! You could be his accomplice

56
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,325
He doesn't seem like an accomplice...

57
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:46,267
Exactly! It wasn't me
I'm innocent. Really! Truly!

58
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,601
Hey! Come over here

59
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,780
Smile

60
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,287
He looks the same!

61
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,182
Well...

62
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,449
What? I don't look like him at all

63
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,854
Get your ass over there and shut up!

64
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,427
Don't you smell a criminal, sir?

65
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,794
I don't smell like a criminal!

66
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,067
He's got sharp ears, too

67
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,199
Can you draw a picture of him?

68
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,931
These handcuffs... I'll undo them

69
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,846
I've never lied once in my entire life!

70
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,208
So you can draw, huh?

71
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,487
All done

72
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,754
Me next! No way."

73
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,550
No. It's not what you think

74
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,165
My instincts are always right

75
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,861
You're under arrest

76
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,032
Say cheese! One, two...

77
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:09,845
You caught him?

78
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,482
Yes, and he works solo

79
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,419
Well then, I'm outta here

80
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,494
Hey!

81
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,063
You're just going to leave?

82
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,537
Can't you at least say sorry?

83
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,576
"Sorry" is not in my dictionary

84
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,906
If you want to hear it,
change your name to "Sorry."

85
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,480
Then I'll call you "Sorry."

86
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:10,943
You're so pretty

87
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,201
You're doing volunteer

88
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,811
patrol in red light districts? Yes

89
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,110
You're late
Everyone's gone off in pairs

90
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,187
Then should I go alone? No

91
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,614
Wait. Your partner should arrive soon

92
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,423
Let go of me

93
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,035
Shut up! This isn't legal!

94
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,105
Can a cop treat a citizen like this?

95
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,566
Sure, why not?

96
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,642
Hey, it's you again!
Did you get robbed?

97
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:55,516
Please believe me! Please!
You bastard, come on here and sit down

98
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,051
Lots of delinquents at your school?

99
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,418
I don't know, I'm still new

100
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,597
Kids who sniff glue?

101
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,567
I don't know yet

102
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,631
Hey, let's eat something

103
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,768
Welcome

104
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,242
These days kids do Ecstasy

105
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,044
Lots of school violence
and cyber crime, too

106
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,845
But the worst are school gangs
who steal from weaker kids

107
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,456
Need to give those bastards
a taste of real life

108
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,089
There's an old saying...
"Only the wicked see the wicked"

109
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,267
What did you say? Nothing

110
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,034
You pay!

111
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,735
Do you have change for this?
I'll eat more then

112
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,478
A bitch in uniform!

113
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,946
Do they run a beauty pageant
to select cops?

114
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,345
Don't do that, you idiot

115
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,817
She's cute. Yeah, right

116
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,081
Better than your girl
Your standards are too low

117
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,849
You wanna die?

118
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,891
Hey you, get over here!

119
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,533
Oh Come on

120
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,498
She lost her mind

121
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:32,984
What the...?

122
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,117
Gimme a break

123
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,187
You're in the wrong place today, Sister!

124
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,985
Did you throw that?
You're in high school, right?

125
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,827
Pick it up!

126
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,661
How much is the fine? I'll pay

127
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,397
Have you lost your manners?
Pick it up!

128
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,165
What if I won't? Pick it up

129
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,809
Hey Sister, what's the matter?
Are you having your period?

130
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,844
Leave us alone, huh?

131
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,153
Pick it up

132
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,957
Follow me, you bitch!

133
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,365
Take it easy
Don't get mixed up with these kids

134
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,698
Notify their school,
and they'll take care of it

135
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,175
Come on you... Shit!

136
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,879
Let me go

137
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:05,543
You're hopeless. Get off of me!

138
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,282
Shit,

139
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,877
You bitch!

140
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,952
You bitch, you'll regret this

141
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,523
Hurry and pick it up!

142
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,959
Shit! Dad!

143
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,495
Adrug dealer. Drug?

144
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,866
If we follow him
The guy on the left must be the dealer

145
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,398
Let's tail him
We might be able to get the whole gang

146
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,864
No way. We should be looking for kids,

147
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,802
not drug dealers

148
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,309
Those drugs will all end up
in kids' hands, get it?

149
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,482
Let's just call the station and go
That's the DEA's job

150
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,078
Then it'll be too late
You go, I'm going home

151
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,989
Let me go! Uncuff me

152
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,465
Come on

153
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,587
Let me go. I'm not a criminal

154
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,926
Let me go please!

155
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,787
The more you wiggle
the tighter it gets

156
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,957
Gimme the key. I don't have it

157
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,962
Of course you have it!
Where are you touching?

158
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:09,930
Let's go

159
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,198
Get down
What do you think I am?

160
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,929
Get down!

161
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,145
Come on up!

162
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,448
Go over first and get down

163
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,785
What am I? A ladder or something?

164
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,397
Am I stairs?
I'm a teacher! A teacher!

165
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,832
And this isn't even your district

166
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,034
Don't piss on the street

167
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,026
One. Two. Three!

168
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:00,874
Who called the police? Son of a...
We didn't!

169
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,747
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!
Drop the gun you bastards

170
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:15,319
Don't point the gun at us!
You're dead!

171
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,548
We need to get the leader!
Let's get out of here

172
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,056
Freeze!

173
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,505
Who the hell are you?

174
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:24,745
Let me go. I'm an undercover cop

175
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,456
What's an undercover cop?

176
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,726
I don't know. An agent who does

177
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,697
secret investigation

178
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,409
Nice work

179
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,880
Who the hell are you?
You ruined everything!

180
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,279
I could've nailed them all
You ruined it!

181
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,712
Let me go!

182
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,285
You destroyed my masterpiece
Let's go

183
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,823
Do you know how great my plan was?

184
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,025
You threw mud on a Picasso!

185
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,895
Come on up, hurry

186
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,255
Give me the key

187
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,220
It's gone. I must've dropped it
while we were running

188
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:44,830
Let me see. Don't touch

189
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,164
It hurts

190
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,346
Hold my hand. It won't hurt as much

191
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,023
Everyone had to rush out for backup
We don't have any extras

192
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,664
They took all the handcuffs we had

193
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,567
Oh, and did you...

194
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,234
beat up some kids on the street?
Yeah, why?

195
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:28,937
His father is a big shot in our district
He's in a rage!

196
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,545
He's coming here. You'd better hide

197
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:39,554
Why? I didn't do anything wrong
He's the godfather of the nightclubs

198
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,756
He's almost like a gangster

199
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,363
Hurry and go
Nice introduction, Sheriff

200
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,769
So you're the bitch who beat up my son

201
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,772
So what? Wait, sir!

202
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,477
You stay out of this
Sir, let's talk first

203
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,773
Get out! Hey, bitch

204
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:09,113
How dare you hit my son?

205
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:14,050
You want to die? Are you staring at me?
I don't care if you're a cop

206
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,387
Go ahead, bitch!

207
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,333
Take it easy, sir
Let's talk it over

208
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,593
Who the hell are you?

209
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,939
Hey bitch. What did my son do?

210
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,199
Cops shouldn't hit people

211
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,169
He was smoking on the street and
acting rude so I taught him a lesson

212
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,904
If his Dad doesn't care,
I don't care if he smokes

213
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,346
who are you to hit him, bitch?

214
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,049
Stop calling me bitch,
you son-of-a-bitch thug!

215
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,520
What? You're asking for death

216
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,591
Calm down, Officer Yeo
I'll take care of this, sir

217
00:23:55,801 --> 00:24:00,738
She needs to be fired
She's a waste of taxpayer money

218
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,873
Hey you, watch out
when you walk home at night

219
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:09,172
Hey, boys. Remember her
Don't forget her face!

220
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,573
Yes sir!

221
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,411
How about you and
I just step outside

222
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,620
What the hell?
Do you think I have time for this?

223
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,422
You bitch

224
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,796
Why, are you scared?
You ill-mannered bitch!

225
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,695
You asshole!

226
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:39,066
I can't take this shit anymore!

227
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:44,442
So you can yell, huh?
Stop staring at me, punk

228
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,683
You son of a bitch
You're a big guy, huh?

229
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,223
That doesn't mean
you can hit a police officer!

230
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,661
Who the hell is this?
Me? You wanna know about me?

231
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,058
Shit!

232
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:09,932
Murder, arson, rape... I'm a three-peat
offender! You wanna die too?

233
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,337
What's the difference
between three murders or four?

234
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,615
Do you wanna die? On your knees, now!

235
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,652
On your knees! On your knees!"

236
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,484
What are you doing?
Can you do this in a police station?

237
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:34,062
You're one to talk
On your knees, bastard!

238
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:45,099
What are you guys doing?
On your knees!

239
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,747
Rich bastards get away with everything!

240
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:54,009
I'm sick of this world! On your knees!

241
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:03,058
Repeat after me. I'm sorry, officers

242
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,821
I'm sorry, officers

243
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,828
Louder, assholes!

244
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,058
I'm sorry, officers

245
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:14,466
I won't do this again
I won't do this again

246
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,668
And you! Teach your son
some manners, okay?

247
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,142
Teach your son some manners, okay?

248
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,506
Not that, asshole!

249
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,118
Now, beat it while I count to three

250
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,291
Whoever's left is gonna die!

251
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,193
One... Two three! Who's left?

252
00:26:54,579 --> 00:27:01,985
Sorry, sir
I've done a bit of acting

253
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,587
Put this on

254
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,528
Can't you wash your foot
after I wash my face?

255
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,322
Until this process is finished...

256
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,703
Did anyone lose this lunch box?

257
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,740
No one?
Then it must be the teacher's

258
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,115
Take this

259
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:06,537
Ladies. I need to say
something as a police officer

260
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,867
lam officer Yeo
Students need to study. Right?

261
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,235
Yes

262
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,970
So don't go around
beating up weaker kids,

263
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,775
You with the lunchbox!
drinking booze or smoking...

264
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,950
How dare you eat when I'm talking!

265
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,986
You!

266
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,954
And if you hang around
red light districts,

267
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,629
I'm gonna whip your butt, got it?

268
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,065
As for your teacher Mr. Go

269
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,969
He's my boyfriend, so don't you
dare try making eyes at him

270
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,803
Go now

271
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,576
We slept together too

272
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,415
Go, please!

273
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,150
A relationship like this...

274
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,688
This is great!

275
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,360
Which of you is Chundeuk?

276
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,639
Be honest

277
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,476
You need a servant,
not a boyfriend, right?

278
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,582
A boyfriend should help
his girlfriend, shouldn't he?

279
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,194
Which floor are you on?
The top floor

280
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,541
Put these over there. Okay

281
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:07,151
You're a twin?
Nah, that's a composite photo

282
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,227
You're a twin, right?

283
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,730
Guess which one's me
On the right

284
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,633
No, the left

285
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,439
You're really a twin

286
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,634
Who's older? On the right

287
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,818
I don't play the black keys

288
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,250
Why not? Just because

289
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:49,563
What's your sister like?
Is she like you?

290
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,465
Then hook me up with her

291
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,971
Just joking

292
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,379
She's dead

293
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:12,856
We were so similar,
no one could tell us apart

294
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,555
Mom put us in different schools
so people wouldn't be confused

295
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,998
She was like the black keys,
and I was like the white ones

296
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:32,966
She was really playful,
and she liked to switch roles with me

297
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,860
Yeo Kyunjin

298
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeo Minjin

299
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:39,768
She got me to take exams for her, and
made me do things she didn't like doing

300
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,850
I used to hate her for that

301
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,992
Six kings have been born in this land,
so the heaven helped...

302
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,360
This sentence indicates
that our country...

303
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,373
And then one day...
It was the date for graduation photos

304
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,743
I had a piano competition,

305
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:37,032
And while she was going
to school in my place,

306
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,537
she was hit by a car

307
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:49,042
I should've died instead of her
So neither of us has a graduation photo

308
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,447
She wanted to become a cop

309
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,190
Do you still play the piano?

310
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,188
Sometimes...

311
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,864
but I play without the black keys

312
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,534
How about you?

313
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,938
Me? The only memory
I have from high-school

314
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,236
is when I had to go on a trip
with both arms in casts

315
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:26,381
Here, say cheese! One Two Three!

316
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,551
That's funny. Yeah, it was

317
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,721
Let's start

318
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,495
OK!

319
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,205
Myungwoo!

320
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:05,915
Myungwoo's a fool!

321
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,676
Am I late? Just an hour

322
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,708
Is it that late?

323
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,255
I bought you a present
Really? Me too

324
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,423
It's a book that your
student Chundeuk wrote

325
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,032
You should use his full name
to show respect. He's over 90

326
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,792
You have a student who's that old?

327
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,769
Here

328
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,502
Thanks

329
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,104
District 230. This is line 2

330
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,807
We see the suspect...
chasing him now

331
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,086
Faster!

332
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,313
Run! Quick! Hurry!

333
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,426
Let me go! Let me go!

334
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,828
One kidnapper is caught,

335
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,731
two are heading for

336
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,396
district 103 with the hostage
Block nearby roads

337
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,174
Freeze, or we'll shoot!

338
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,944
Request backup! Be careful

339
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,054
Pick her up

340
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,084
Can we leave him like this?
Just go

341
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,955
Suspect heading for District 103

342
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:44,100
I repeat
Suspect heading for District 103

343
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,363
Yeah. I'm running my ass off,

344
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,800
No I'm not
and you're lying in bed?

345
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,703
Officer Yeo in district 103

346
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,244
Wait, Line 2
Officer Yeo in district 103

347
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,246
Two kidnappers ran behind Taeyang
Requesting backup

348
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,713
I'll call you back later!

349
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:23,199
Officer Yeo is still chasing alone

350
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,646
Can you run 100 meters in 11 seconds?

351
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:47,424
What? That's how fast this girl is?
I can only do 15 seconds

352
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,069
Stop. Let's stop here

353
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,335
Get her on her knees
On your knees

354
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,888
What do we do with her?

355
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,923
What should we do?

356
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,493
You decide Let's kill her

357
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,393
Kill her?
Yes. The bitch saw my face

358
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,692
But... even if... How could we?

359
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,234
You kill her. You do it
No, I can't! You do it

360
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:32,569
It's your specialty!
My specialty is welding

361
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,344
Grab her, Grab her!

362
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:40,176
Where? Shoulders
One shot in her head and she's gone!

363
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,908
Should I stab her on the left or right?

364
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,814
No!

365
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,880
Did you kill her?

366
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,725
What the hell?
Let's get him first

367
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,334
What are you doing here, Sir?

368
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,734
No!

369
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,672
You can't kill her

370
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:14,474
Why not, man?

371
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,199
Come closer! Can't reach!

372
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,961
Come a little closer. Come on

373
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,535
Okay

374
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,936
Come on! Just a little bit more

375
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,183
Damn, nothing's going right today!

376
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,250
I'll see you in prison, I'll go first

377
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,081
I'll shoot. Freeze!

378
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,718
Kyungjin!

379
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,519
Quiet! Kyungjin! Kyungjin!!

380
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,166
Got you!

381
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,733
Come on! You!

382
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,131
Hiding in here, huh?

383
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,067
What are you doing here?

384
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:36,132
Can I help you? Is Mr. Go here?

385
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,461
He left already
You didn't you see him on your way in?

386
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,269
No, I didn't...

387
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,205
Bastard

388
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,402
Where'd you get this piece ofjunk?

389
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,978
What do you mean, junk?
She's a beauty!

390
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,444
You bought it? Of course

391
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,679
I'm going off on a road trip
all over the country!

392
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,753
No pavements!

393
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,517
Yeah? I'll go too
I'll take a vacation

394
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,455
Don't you need to stay here
and catch bad guys?

395
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,755
Bad guys are everywhere

396
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,250
Try this. It feels like flying

397
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,057
I must've been the wind
in my previous life

398
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,498
I want to be free as the wind

399
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,397
When I'm not around,

400
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,476
if you feel the wind blowing,
then that will be me

401
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:38,478
Then is this wind you?
It's my friends

402
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:43,714
If I die,
I want to become the wind again

403
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,963
Mmm, the fire smells great

404
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,667
Isn't it nice? It is

405
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:42,135
You know why people join their pinkies
when making a promise?

406
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,480
No, why?

407
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:50,482
Once upon a time, in a huge,
vast country,

408
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,891
there was a princess who was very,
very beautiful

409
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:01,631
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the prettiest of them all?

410
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,863
Of course that would be you,
my lady

411
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:11,405
Really? Do you think so? If you're lying,
I'll break you into pieces!

412
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,405
I never lie, my lady
You are the most beautiful

413
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,078
You're so pretty

414
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,751
Because the princess was
so pretty and wise,

415
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,722
princes came from all over
the world to seek her hand

416
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,527
Finally, five princes were
left in the final round

417
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:40,725
In order to choose the best match
for her, she gave them a test

418
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,766
She hid her right hand
and unfolded one finger

419
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:50,513
The five princes had
to guess which one it was

420
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,893
So that sign came to
represent a vow of marriage

421
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:41,260
The prince and princess
couldn't have been happier

422
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,531
But then the Crusades began,
and the prince had to go to war

423
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:54,873
The prince promised to come back alive,
crossing his pinky with hers

424
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,687
But ten years passed,
and the prince didn't return

425
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,255
She didn't even know
if he was still alive

426
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:20,193
But since the princess
was still so pretty,

427
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:25,000
many people came to ask her
to re-marry

428
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,809
She kept saying no,
believing that he'd return,

429
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,947
but she couldn't turn
them down any longer

430
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:39,454
So she decided to marry a man
who joined pinkies with her

431
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,736
One day,

432
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,108
a filthy beggar came to the palace

433
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,978
Everyone tried to get rid of him,

434
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:14,783
but the princess called him in,
saying everyone deserves a chance

435
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,993
That beggar was her lost prince

436
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:15,077
The truth was, the prince
had been killed on his way home

437
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:20,649
The soul of the dead must
depart after 49 days

438
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:26,419
That day was the 49th day

439
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:33,193
In order to keep his promise,
the prince returned as a ghost

440
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:41,100
Finally the princess found
the body of the prince

441
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,187
Now you know the meaning
ofjoined pinkies, right?

442
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:03,594
Yes. Can I ask you a question?

443
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,766
If I die, will you die

444
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,831
for me like the princess?

445
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,637
Are you crazy? Why should I?

446
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:20,509
Stop putting wood on the fire!
The room is boiling

447
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,253
Are you trying to burn me
to death?

448
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,981
Does it hurt?

449
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:33,781
What happened to your lips?

450
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,788
Forget about kissing her tonight

451
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,122
Aren't you sorry for this?

452
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,090
Like I told you before,

453
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:46,166
if you wanna hear me say that,
change your name to "Sorry"

454
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,827
My name is "Sorry." Call me now
Your name is Myungwoo

455
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,631
I changed my name. Say my name.

456
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,469
I can't approve it
Why not? I changed it

457
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,441
Stop fighting and eat!

458
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,512
You're hurting my ears

459
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,915
Myungwoo! Myungwoo!

460
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,976
Myungwoo! Wake up!
