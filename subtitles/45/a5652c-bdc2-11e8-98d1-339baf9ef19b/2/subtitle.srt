00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:16,246
Please breathe

2
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:26,857
Myungwoo... Please... Please breathe!

3
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,197
Please breathe

4
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,571
Please breathe. You fool. Breathe!

5
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:50,747
Please breathe!!!

6
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:16,132
Why did you save me?

7
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,438
I don't want to die after you

8
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,864
When a golf ball and table tennis ball
is thrown at same speed!

9
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:45,331
We went back to our ordinary lives
Me teaching students,

10
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,470
her chasing criminals

11
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,403
Who can report to jurisdiction 230?

12
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:55,208
Officer Yeo, coming to Nu Karaoke
Jurisdiction 230, this is line 2

13
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,879
Backup requested

14
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:00,411
The criminal is the notorious
jail-breaker Shin Changsoo

15
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:03,178
Block the entrance,
and wait until backup arrives

16
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:06,914
Kyungjin, this is dangerous
Let's not go

17
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,158
It's Shin Changsoo

18
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:15,398
We can't pass this up
This is our chance to get promoted

19
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,908
Jurisdiction 230.

20
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:28,905
This is line 2. We're in front
of Nu Karaoke, district 113

21
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,377
Backup still hasn't arrived

22
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,677
No, Kyungjin!

23
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,410
He's over there!

24
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:24,229
Put your hands up!
Weapon on the table, hands in the air!

25
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,300
Drop your weapon or I'll shoot

26
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,288
Officer Jo, are you okay? Yes

27
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,956
This is Line 2!
Nu Karaoke Changsoo Shin on the run

28
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:54,062
It is the notorious Changsoo Shin
Officer Yeo is chasing by herself

29
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:58,695
It's me. I discovered something
This is really special

30
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:03,365
Where are you? I'll help
I'm chasing a criminal now!

31
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,803
No, it's too dangerous

32
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,013
She sounded different that day

33
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:21,484
I could figure out vaguely
where she was

34
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,193
I know that she's stronger than me
But sometimes she acts without thinking,

35
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,458
so I was worried

36
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:15,840
Damn that bastard. I'll remember this

37
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:22,747
Shit! My big shot daddy
will not like this!

38
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,257
Oh, hello Get down

39
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,139
Quit smoking, punk

40
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:48,342
Got it

41
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,683
When the hell are they going
to use their guns?

42
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:00,251
Let's go. Where?

43
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,525
It's the jail breaker Changsoo
What?

44
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,564
Freeze!

45
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:54,801
Freeze!

46
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:19,194
Shit, we screwed up
Let's get away. Come on

47
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:51,123
Jurisdiction 230. Line 2, line 2

Please call 911!

53
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:51,347
Myungwoo

54
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,334
Don't die. Don't die

55
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:11,135
How can you die when
I saved you once already?

56
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:18,243
Don't die. Don't die

57
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:23,118
This is a dream. This is a dream

58
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:31,287
Jurisdiction 230. Line 2, line 2

59
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:41,097
District 117. A man down

60
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:08,689
Maybe I was destined
to die in that river

61
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,553
Don't do it

62
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,662
Don't do it! Let me die!

63
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:45,267
Let me die! Lie her down

64
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:48,460
Why are you doing this?

65
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:54,110
I killed him. I killed him

66
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:48,293
Hi, this is Myungwoo
Either my battery's out,

67
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,830
or I'm in a non-serviced area

68
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,626
Leave a message after the beep

69
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,528
and I'll call you back ASAP

70
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:06,148
Which non-serviced area is that?
Come back

71
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,280
Hurry and come back

72
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:22,130
No, never mind. I'll come to you

73
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:27,062
I'll come to your side

74
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:48,217
Hey lady!

75
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,861
What are you doing there, lady?

76
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,092
Why do you care?

77
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:02,429
And don't call me lady
I'm not that old

78
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,075
You're trying to commit suicide right,
lady? Jumping off?

79
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:12,138
She says don't call her lady

80
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:13,646
Ask her for some money. I'm hungry

81
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,477
Money? We're not beggars

82
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,050
Then what are we?

83
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:24,654
Hey lady! I mean, Miss
We ran away from home

84
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:30,993
Please give us some money before
you jump. We won't stop you."

85
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:35,160
What? Just 50 bucks

86
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,343
Aren't you a little out of line?

87
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,480
Or a credit card would be fine
You won't be liable after death

88
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:49,948
You guys are really something
Wanna see me get angry?

89
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,283
What's it this time? She seems angry

90
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,755
I'm hungry, dammit
Why can't she give us some money?

91
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,896
Hey, if you got something to say,
speak up. Don't whisper like cowards!

92
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:04,026
Give us some money before you croak!

93
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,031
Your guts will be sprayed
all over the street anyway

94
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,263
bucks will do. Or let's have sex

95
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,600
Make the most out
of your body before you jump

96
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,607
Let's get it on. You little shit!

97
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:19,304
You bastard, get over here
This is unbelievable. She's pissed."

98
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:22,383
You mongrels! You guys are dead!
Come on let's have a hot night!

99
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,847
Hey! Run!

100
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:27,820
You guys are dead when I catch you
She's wild

101
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,522
What? You rude idiots
Catch us if you can!

102
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:32,058
Hey, I can see her panties
Panties! Panties!

103
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,991
They're black! No, she isn't
wearing any! That's why it's black

104
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,664
It's purple, you dirty dogs!

105
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:39,333
Really, she's not wearing any!
No, how could she be

106
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,094
You're dead!

107
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,532
She's still following us. Take this

108
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:49,407
Shit!

109
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:55,546
Don't give me this. Take this yourself!

110
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,016
Why are you giving me this
It smells, I don't want it

111
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,782
Where did you learn
that kind of crap?

112
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,982
What did you say? "Screw till you die"?

113
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,923
You dirty bastards!

114
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,528
We were just hungry

115
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,899
We haven't eaten for three days
It's true

116
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:16,937
What do you want?
What should we have?

117
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,833
Pizza! Pizza?

118
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,676
Watch her eat!

119
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:31,280
I can't believe she was
just trying to kill herself

120
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,978
You said it

121
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:38,320
I haven't eaten for 3 days either
I need to eat to be a pretty ghost

122
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,519
What's the use of that?

123
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,528
If you jump off a building,
your guts will all burst open,

124
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:48,534
1and the pizza will spray in all
directions. What did you say?

125
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:53,505
Cut the crap and bring me more salad
No cucumbers or croutons

126
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,200
You go. No beans

127
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:58,209
Why do you always order him around?
You go!

128
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,285
Damn. Don't eat everything. Got it

129
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,016
More pizza, please!

130
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:15,289
This is cab fare to go home

131
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,696
You better go home
I'm going to check! Ok?

132
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,866
Thanks, Miss

133
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,967
We don't need to thank her
We're the ones who saved her life

134
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,306
What? Give me my money back
No. Thank you very much

135
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:40,723
You have to go home. All right?
You have to live, too

136
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:40,564
Excuse me!

137
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,940
Is this the way out?

138
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:48,275
Well then... Take care

139
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:14,008
If you feel the wind when
I'm not around, that's me

140
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:29,614
If I die, I want to become the wind

141
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,667
Myungwoo

142
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,377
Are you here?

143
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,017
Is this you? Or is it just the wind?

144
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:41,819
Tell me! Tell me, Myungwoo!

145
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,751
Myungwoo!

146
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:54,495
Did you become the wind? Did you really?

147
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,834
I can't believe this

148
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:29,424
This is the day you leave me forever

149
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,396
The 49th day after your death

150
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:51,110
But I'll come and find you
before that day. I'll be sure to

151
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:52,110
Come on! Get in!

152
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:57,551
This place is 30 years old... come in

153
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,184
Doing all right, guys?

154
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,465
Nice work

155
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:09,026
Hey, Park. The guy you caught
Get him in!

156
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:12,234
You can use the desk Min was using

157
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:15,444
Your locker is over there

158
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:19,572
Where's Kim? i @i @i @I don't know, sir

159
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:22,114
Oh come on

160
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,447
What time is it?

161
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:30,716
Detective Kim!

162
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:32,187
Yes, sir?

163
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:35,228
Not you guys
I'm looking for Kim Youngho

164
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:38,694
There are a lot of Kims here, sir
You're not even a detective

165
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:39,993
There he is

166
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,672
What time were you going to meet?
I don't know

167
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:51,074
Hey, Kim! Yes sir

168
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,675
She's your new partner

169
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:59,247
I'll see you guys later

170
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:04,359
Hello, sir!

171
00:27:07,663 --> 00:27:09,255
It's nice to meet you

172
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:28,290
"I'd like to see you play piano
I'd like to see the real you"

173
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:32,551
Who are you? A cop?

174
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:34,989
Don't come closer, or I'll shoot!

175
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:39,423
I'll really shoot! Get out of here!
Detective Yeo!

176
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:43,127
Go! Go! Go! Go!

177
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:50,710
Go away!

178
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:01,512
Learn to shoot straight
Yes, Ma'am

179
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:23,143
If he resurfaces, call me back

180
00:32:25,748 --> 00:32:29,775
And don't let anyone else know

181
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:34,479
I need to get Changsoo myself
Don't worry

182
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:36,424
Did you say Changsoo?

183
00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:38,857
No, nothing
I have some other errands to run

184
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,254
I'll see you back at the station

185
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:57,207
I won't speed
I'll let you. Follow that car

186
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:36,082
Freeze!

187
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,002
Freeze!

188
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:00,203
Shoot him!

189
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,823
Call the ambulance!

190
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:17,816
Careful!

191
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,465
Myungwoo!

192
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:32,062
How can you die after
I saved you once already?

193
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:36,004
I must've been the wind in my
previous life

194
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:38,645
Please don't die

195
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:43,243
Be honest. You need a servant,
not a boyfriend, right?

196
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:46,478
A boyfriend should help his girlfriend,
shouldn't he?

197
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,713
Aren't you sorry for this?

198
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:52,382
If you want to hear me say 'sorry'
you'd better change your name to Sorry

199
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:55,495
Breathe, you fool!
Where are you? I'll help

200
00:34:56,932 --> 00:35:00,800
He's my boyfriend, so don't you
dare try making eyes at him

201
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:04,029
I'm a three-peat offender
Murder, arson, rape...

202
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:07,103
Try this. It feels like I'm flying

203
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:11,040
There's a saying...
"Only the wicked see the wicked"

204
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:14,079
Am I late?
My name is 'sorry'. Call me now

205
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,052
Are you here?

206
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:28,928
Is this you? Or is it the wind?
Tell me. Tell me. Myungwoo

207
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:33,066
Tell me. Tell me. Myungwoo

208
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,032
Did you become the wind?

209
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:45,703
Did you really become the wind?

210
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,812
Don't die, Myungwoo!

211
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,280
I can't believe this

212
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:54,284
I must have been the wind
in my previous life

213
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,320
Line 2 Line 2

214
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:01,992
Call the ambulance! Hurry up!

215
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:09,493
This is the day you leave me forever
The 49th day after your death

216
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:12,799
If you feel the wind
when I'm not around, that's me

217
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:18,878
But I'll go meet you before
that day. I'll be sure to

218
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,561
Call the ambulance!

219
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:37,081
Myungwoo... Myungwoo...

220
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,494
Is that you?

221
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:51,230
Detective Yeo, wake up!
Concentrate on anything

222
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,931
Just try to live

223
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:57,206
Keep talking to her

224
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:59,971
I can't, tears keep coming out

225
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:05,316
Do you remember that time?
You were like Robocop

226
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,389
Robocop can't die from one gun shot

227
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:13,857
I have a confession to make

228
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,758
I have to tell you something

229
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,494
I need to confess something

230
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:28,005
Be quiet, please!
They told me to keep talking

231
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:45,722
Check her vital signs. BP 60

232
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:49,590
Her pulse is weak. Connect the
monitor and call cardiovascular

233
00:38:49,798 --> 00:38:52,858
Call cardiovascular
She stopped breathing

234
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,434
Get the D.C. ready! Intubation!

235
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:04,109
200 joules. Ready! Shoot

236
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:07,174
Check the EKG. No change."

237
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,509
300 joules! Ready! Shoot!

238
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,154
360 joules! Ready! Shoot!

239
00:39:54,863 --> 00:40:00,824
Officer Yeo! Your night shift is over
Go home, okay? i @i @i @Yes, sir

240
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:24,957
Myungwoo!

241
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,367
Myungwoo!

242
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:43,466
Myungwoo!

243
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:15,065
It's you, isn't it?

244
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,750
You were alive

245
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:35,756
Why did you run away?
You know you can't run fast

246
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:39,063
I could've run well

247
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,770
But I only have one lung now

248
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:49,138
How could you pretend
that you're dead?

249
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,745
Didn't you think about
how much it'd hurt me?

250
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:56,179
I didn't want you to see me this way

251
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:59,512
Who cares? I love you no matter what

252
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:04,920
I'm not Myungwoo any longer
And you're not Kyungjin

253
00:42:06,995 --> 00:42:10,123
Myungwoo. Myungwoo's dead

254
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,797
Admit it, will you?
Don't pretend I'm alive

255
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:19,531
But you're alive.
Myungwoo's dead!

256
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:34,980
Myungwoo

257
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:56,435
The EKG's back

258
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:00,510
She's trying to live. What?

259
00:43:00,782 --> 00:43:04,240
She's trying to live. Connect all
the lines. Check her vitals again

260
00:43:04,452 --> 00:43:08,115
Get the chest tubes ready
Prepare some blood

261
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:26,439
Hey, Kim. I can see that
you have the hots for Kyungjin

262
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:28,302
But you're a married man

263
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,204
No love confessions, OK?

264
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,752
You're awake
The operation was successful,

265
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:42,752
1and you're recovering quickly

266
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,360
Get some more sleep

267
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:57,696
What's the date today?
Today? The last day of October

268
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,452
Myungwoo

269
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,433
Myungwoo

270
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:32,544
Myungwoo

271
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:36,455
Myungwoo

272
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,148
Myungwoo

273
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:40,658
Myungwoo

274
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,926
Myungwoo

275
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:44,328
Myungwoo

276
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,430
Myungwoo

277
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:38,301
Somebody must've heard my prayer

278
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,861
I can see you

279
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:38,661
I need to go

280
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,980
I'm glad that I saw you before I left

281
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,949
No! Myungwoo

282
00:50:58,226 --> 00:51:00,956
Myungwoo. Don't go

283
00:51:01,162 --> 00:51:05,963
I'll follow you, if you go

284
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:13,235
No. It's not your time yet

285
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:19,573
You have many days ahead of you

286
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,238
No. No

287
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:28,220
Don't be so sad because of me

288
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:36,355
We'll meet again. Can't you feel it?

289
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,858
When we meet again,

290
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:50,842
tell me all the happiest memories
you experienced from this life

291
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:55,812
And when you hear me
whisper in the wind,

292
00:51:57,185 --> 00:52:02,851
you'll meet someone
who has a soul like mine

293
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:17,102
Now, let me leave with
your love in my heart

294
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:30,206
Myungwoo!

295
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,094
Sorry

296
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:51,998
You don't have to call me that
My name is Myungwoo

297
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:10,551
I won't be so sad anymore

298
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,292
I'll believe that
you're always with me

299
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:20,898
If you miss me,
come back anytime

300
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:28,170
Even as the wind
Come back as the wind

301
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,062
Were you looking for me?

302
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:34,374
Oh, this

303
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:38,636
This just came in at the lost
and found. It's got your name on it

304
00:54:56,964 --> 00:55:01,731
"To my savior Kyungjin, I'm yours"

305
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:32,662
Kyungjin, how are you these days?
I hope you're not hurting anymore

306
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:37,167
I'm always beside you
Remember I told you once

307
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:40,539
that when you hear me
whisper in the wind

308
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:44,502
you will meet someone with
a soul like mine?

309
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,807
Can you feel it? I am near you

310
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:54,045
You will meet him today

311
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:02,524
Do you know who brought this in?

312
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:45,197
Please stand back from the train

313
00:56:50,277 --> 00:56:56,580
Please mind the gap between
the train and the platform...

314
00:57:14,368 --> 00:57:21,001
I could hear his whisper
in the wind. I could feel it

315
00:57:22,443 --> 00:57:27,278
It was him. Standing beside me

316
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:38,416
Let me introduce my girlfriend. She is...

317
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:44,462
someone who shed many tears over me

318
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:49,965
Her name is Kyungjin. Kyungjin Yeo

319
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,198
I feel strange just saying her name,

320
00:57:57,378 --> 00:58:02,782
She has something special
that no one else can touch
