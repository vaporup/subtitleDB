1
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,520
He looks great.

2
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,440
That Al Conti is a genius.

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
I am a genius!

4
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
So, how come you can't
keep track of your receipts?

5
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,920
How am I supposed to do your income
tax with this mess you've got here?

6
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,310
Numbers, taxes, receipts...

7
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,796
I make 'em look better than
they did in real life.

8
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,110
I'm an artistic genius.

9
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,913
Then, how come
you've got butter on your tie?

10
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,240
Give it here!

11
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,720
You know what? I give you this.
You make good coffee.

12
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
You're a slob, but you make good coffee.

13
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,110
Ah, red roses.

14
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,036
Very romantic, huh?

15
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,879
Ah, the guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,389
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money

17
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,476
on something that ends up as garbage.

18
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,034
I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta.

19
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,071
I'd be out of business.

20
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,156
What are you talking? I love flowers.

21
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,876
Thanks, Carmine.

22
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,356
Are you ready?

23
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,436
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

24
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,516
Very good, Mr Johnny.

25
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,074
We will both have the Ticino salad.

26
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,636
And I'll have special fish.

27
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,877
No, it's oily fish tonight.
Not before the plane ride.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,956
Maybe you're right.

29
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,714
OK, we'll have the <i>manicotti,</i> Bobo.

30
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,990
That'll give you a base for your stomach.

31
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,076
You eat oily fish,
you go up in the air,

32
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,760
halfway to Sicily,
you'll be green and sweating.

33
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,472
You look after me.

34
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,437
You'll ruin the evening...
Patricia, please, don't leave.

35
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,516
Do you think I'm a talking doll?!

36
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,519
I was just making a point about
the way you stated your aspirations...

37
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,710
You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

38
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,673
Kiss my aspirations? Very clever.

39
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,756
The height of cleverness!

40
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,870
Waiter.

41
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,878
Yes?

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,195
Would you do away
with any evidence of her

43
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,276
and bring me a big glass of vodka?

44
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,356
But absolutely.

45
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,310
A man who can't control his woman...
is funny.

46
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,113
She was too young for him.

47
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,958
What's up, Uncle Bobo?

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,356
Tonight Mr Johnny's
gonna propose marriage.

49
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,675
- How do you know?
- He arranged it with me.

50
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,756
When he asks, he's gonna wave,

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,235
and then I serve the champagne.

52
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,032
A good bachelor customer for 20 years.

53
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,356
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

54
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,792
- How's things, hey?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

55
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,273
No, no. I...

56
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,596
I wanna see the dessert cart.

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,073
Very good.

58
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,794
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

59
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,876
What's the matter with you?

60
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,998
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

61
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,351
- Have some dessert.
- No, I shouldn't.

62
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,869
- Will you marry me?
- What?

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,796
Will you marry me?

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,276
Bobo, take the cart away.

65
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,356
Very good, Miss Loretta.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,230
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

67
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,670
All right. You know I was married
and that my husband died.

68
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,917
What you don't know is
I think he and I had bad luck.

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,759
- What do you mean?
- We got married at the City Hall.

70
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,952
- It gave bad luck the whole marriage.
- I don't understand.

71
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,631
Right from the start, we didn't do it right.
Could you kneel down?

72
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,957
- On the floor?
- Yeah, on the floor.

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,957
- This is a good suit!
- I know!

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,640
I helped you pick it out.
It had two pairs of pants!

75
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,231
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,788
She's got him on his knees!
He's ruining his suit.

77
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,036
Is that man praying?

78
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,876
- So...
- Where's the ring?

79
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,518
- The ring!
- A ring, that's right.

80
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,598
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me, <i>capisce?</i>

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,912
- You could use your pinky ring.
- I like this ring!

82
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,794
You propose marriage to a woman, you
should offer her a ring of engagement.

83
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,036
Loretta...

84
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,316
Loretta Castorini Clark,

85
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,550
on my knees,
in front of all of these people,

86
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,916
will you marry me?

87
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,917
Yes, Johnny.

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,113
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri,
I will marry you. I will be your wife.

89
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,070
<i>Salute, paesano!</i>

90
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,793
Bobo!

91
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,717
- The check!
- Right away, Mr Johnny.

92
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,196
What about the wedding?

93
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,796
My mother is dying.

94
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,151
When she's dead,
I'll come back and we'll get married.

95
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,236
How near death is she?

96
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,796
A week.

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,956
Two weeks... No more.

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,832
How about we set a date? A month?

99
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,193
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say
we'll be married when I get back?

100
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,799
Where? The City Hall? No.

101
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,836
My mother is dying.

102
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,349
I want a whole wedding,
or we'll have bad luck.

103
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,278
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

104
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,470
All right, all right. A month.

105
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,591
- A month from today.
- In a month.

106
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,950
- A month from today.
- Yes, from today.

107
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,674
- OK, OK.
- From today, right.

108
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,997
I'll take care of the whole thing.
All you gotta do is show up.

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,872
<i>Departure for Paris,</i>
<i>please proceed to gate No.29.</i>

110
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,516
Come on, <i>andiamo.</i>

111
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,313
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call from Mamma's.

112
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,396
OK. You made me very happy.

113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,557
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

114
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,591
I want you to call...

115
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,269
Call this number. It's a business number.
You ask for Ronny.

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,868
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,754
- It's my younger brother.
- You've got a brother?

118
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,030
We haven't spoken in five years.

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,436
There was some bad blood.

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,676
I want you to invite him to the wedding.

121
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,950
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

122
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,949
<i>Flight 604 for Rome with connections</i>
<i>to Palermo is now boarding at gate 43.</i>

123
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,877
I gotta go.

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,150
Have you got your ticket?

125
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,238
OK. Here, I got you these.
Gum and cough drops.

126
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,476
Gum opens your ears when you chew.

127
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,556
I gotta go.

128
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,875
<i>This is the last call</i>
<i>for flight No.604 for</i> Rome...

129
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,036
You have someone on that plane?

130
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,912
Yeah. My fiancé.

131
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,715
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

132
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,994
I put a curse on that plane that it's going
to explode, burn and fall into the sea.

133
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,236
50 years ago, she stole a man from me.

134
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,316
<i>Si ha preso il mio uomo!</i>

135
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,910
Today she tells me
that she never loved him,

136
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,759
that she took him to be strong on me.

137
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,996
Now she's going back to Sicily.

138
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,076
<i>Si torna in Sicilia.</i>

139
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,432
I cursed her that the green Atlantic water
should swallow her up!

140
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,516
I don't believe in curses.

141
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,596
Neither do I.

142
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,916
- Mr Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,956
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

144
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,036
The key's in it.

145
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,153
What do you mean?!
I've seen the way you look at her

146
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,840
- and it isn't right!
- How do I look at her?

147
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,871
- Can I help you?
- A split of Mumm.

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,468
- So, how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf!

149
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,359
- Like a wolf, huh?
- Like a wolf.

150
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,675
You've never seen a wolf in your life.

151
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,756
That's $11.99.

152
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,635
I've seen the wolf in everybody I ever met

153
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,910
and I see a wolf in you.

154
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,350
- That makes $20. Have a nice night.
- You, too.

155
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,875
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,956
The girl I married.

157
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,317
Oh, come on!

158
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,668
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

159
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,072
Goodnight.

160
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,758
Hi, guys! Oh, sweethearts!

161
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,395
How are you, how are you?
Guess what happened to me today.

162
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,598
<i>Ciao, bello.</i>

163
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,870
<i>Ciao, cara, ciao. Buonanotte.</i>

164
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,710
Hey! <i>Venite qua!</i>

165
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,400
Hey! How long must I wait?

166
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,397
Come here!

167
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,397
<i>Che cani sono questi?</i>

168
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,238
<i>Tutti a casa.</i>

169
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,237
- Hi, Pop.
- Oh, hi.

170
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,272
- Where's Ma?
- In bed.

171
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,358
- You're not sleeping?
- I can't sleep any more.

172
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,436
It's too much like death.

173
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,596
Pop, I've got news.

174
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,073
All right.

175
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,156
Let's go into the kitchen.

176
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,513
<i>Ti amo.</i>

177
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,476
<i>Ti amo.</i>

178
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,554
You look tired, Pop.

179
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,716
So what's your news?

180
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,796
I'm getting married.

181
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,797
- Again?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,911
You did it before and it didn't work out.

183
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,996
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

184
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,634
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

185
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,672
You mother and I were married 52 years.
Nobody died.

186
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,839
You were married two years,
somebody's dead. Don't get married again.

187
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,190
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

188
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,958
Jo!

189
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,435
Johnny Cammareri. He's a big baby.

190
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,792
- Why isn't he here telling me this?
- He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.

191
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,593
More bad luck.
I don't like his face, Loretta.

192
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,951
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What does he hide?

193
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,479
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

194
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,830
- I won't come.
- You've gotta give me away.

195
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,793
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

196
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,277
Maybe, if you gave me away and I got
married in a church in a wedding dress,

197
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,790
instead of at the City Hall
with strangers at the door,

198
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,275
maybe I wouldn't have
had the bad luck I had.

199
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,038
Maybe.

200
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,516
Pop, I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

201
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,630
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

202
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,637
- He did?
- Yes.

203
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,274
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well...

204
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,597
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

205
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,156
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.

206
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,510
- It's a man's ring!
- It's temporary!

207
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,359
Everything is temporary!
That excuses nothing.

208
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,198
You're coming?

209
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,596
Let's go tell your mother.

210
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,915
Rose.

211
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,877
Who's dead?

212
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,877
Nobody.

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,150
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

214
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,474
Yeah.

215
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,670
- Johnny Cammareri.
- I don't like him.

216
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,189
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

217
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,276
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- No.

218
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,598
Good. When you love 'em, they drive
you crazy cos they know they can.

219
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,711
- But you like him?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,796
He's a sweet man, Ma.

221
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,435
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

222
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,516
- And who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

223
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,473
- What?
- The father of the bride pays.

224
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
I have no money.

225
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,035
You're rich as Roosevelt.
You're just cheap.

226
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,593
I won't pay!

227
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,029
It's a father's duty
to pay for the wedding.

228
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,116
I won't pay for nothing.

229
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,117
He didn't used to be cheap.

230
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,038
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

231
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,512
Now he's gonna play
that damn Vicki Carr record

232
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,313
and when he comes to bed,
he won't touch me.

233
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,315
<i>Dai! Piano, piano!</i>

234
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,396
<i>Ecco, piano.</i>

235
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,030
Hey! Keep your dogs off my lawn!

236
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,758
Come on.

237
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,356
Don't do that!

238
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,870
She's asleep. Look at all the flowers.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,275
My brother sent her a blue flower.

240
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,315
I can only see things in my house.
And things in my house are very bad.

241
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,396
I don't know what to advise my son.

242
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,114
I think he should pay for the wedding.

243
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,277
But it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

244
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,039
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

245
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,151
I must find the right moment.

246
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,398
- Did you see <i>la bella luna</i> last night?
- <i>Ah, si.</i>

247
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,478
<i>Ah, si, la luna. La bella luna.</i>

248
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,559
The moon uh...
brings the woman to the man, <i>capisci?</i>

249
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,229
<i>La luna attira I'uomo...</i>
<i>la donna verso I'uomo.</i>

250
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,430
<i>Avete capito?</i>

251
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,516
<i>Non avete capito niente.</i>

252
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,993
<i>Andiamo.</i>

253
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,512
<i>Vieni, vieni.</i>

254
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,154
<i>Non tirare. Non tirare. Non tirare!</i>

255
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,756
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo a casa.</i>

256
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,236
<i>Ciao.</i>

257
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,436
<i>Disgraziato!</i>

258
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,236
<i>Andiamo, andiamo, eh?</i>

259
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,153
<i>Come va?</i>

260
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,236
<i>Bene,</i> bene. Upstairs.

261
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,316
Everybody upstairs!

262
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,434
<i>Lo so. Va bene, va bene!</i>

263
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,755
Come on! <i>Andiamo! Insieme.</i>

264
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,711
<i>Tutti! Andiamo a casa.</i>

265
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,751
<i>Ciao, bello.</i>

266
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,030
<i>Ciao, cara. Ciao.</i>

267
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,911
- So, will you live here?
- No.

268
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,871
Why not?

269
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,956
Pop don't like Johnny.

270
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,559
- We can sell the house.
- I got married before, you didn't sell.

271
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,593
Grandma was still alive.
Ciro was still home, going to school.

272
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,154
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

273
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,114
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby...

274
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,595
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

275
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,630
What's 37?
I didn't have Ciro until after I was 37.

276
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,871
It ain't over till it's over.

277
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,833
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

278
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,916
So we'll sell the house.

279
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,792
You know... What?

280
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,595
I wanna live here, I love the house.
Pop don't like Johnny.

281
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,676
No, we don't.

282
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,119
I'll get it.

283
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,196
OK.

284
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,230
- Hello?
- <i>Una chiamata per signorina Loretta...</i>

285
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,113
Yeah, yeah! This is Loretta Castorini.

286
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,549
<i>Si può parlare, signore.</i>

287
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,432
- Johnny!
- Johnny?

288
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,391
<i>Operator?</i>

289
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,671
- Op... Loretta?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

290
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,439
Yes. Sh sh sh! It's me.

291
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm calling from the deathbed
of my mother.

292
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,196
Yeah. How was your plane ride?

293
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,470
The waitresses were very nice.

294
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,275
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

295
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,755
<i>Quanto io devo aspettare?</i>

296
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,995
<i>Stai ferma, stai ferma, mammita!</i>

297
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,993
I can't talk long.

298
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,509
Did you tell her we're getting married?

299
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,596
Oh, no, no. Not yet.

300
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,917
I'm waiting... I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

301
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,031
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

302
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,153
- Have you called my brother?
- No. I'm sorry, no, not yet. I forgot.

303
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,113
- <i>Will you do it today?</i>
- Yes. Yes.

304
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,595
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,117
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

306
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,198
Nothing can replace the family, Loretta.

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,956
I can see that now...

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,719
<i>Loretta? Loretta, are you there?</i>

309
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,150
- <i>Loretta!</i>
- OK, I'm sorry. I'll do it today.

310
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,236
And listen, Johnny, you know,

311
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,351
<i>call me after you tell her, OK?</i>

312
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,959
All right, all right.

313
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,877
And

314
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,719
Don't stand directly under the sun.
Use your hat.

315
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,195
I got my hat, all right, all right.

316
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,435
Bye.

317
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,993
All right, bye-bye.

318
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,836
What did I do with that card?

319
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,511
How's the mother?

320
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,313
She's dying.
But I could still hear her big mouth.

321
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,072
He didn't tell her!

322
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,555
You know, the woman makes him crazy.

323
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,398
Now who are you calling? <i>Uffa!</i>

324
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,269
Cammareri's.

325
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,358
Yeah, is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

326
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,708
Hold on.

327
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,751
Ronny! The phone!

328
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,073
<i>Ronny!</i>

329
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,394
Yeah, this is Ronny.

330
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,717
Yeah. I'm calling for your brother.

331
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,832
He's getting married
and would like it if you would come.

332
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,916
<i>Why didn't he call himself?</i>

333
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,112
- <i>He's in Palermo.</i>
- What's wrong can never be made right.

334
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,071
Let me just come and talk...

335
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,679
talk to you!

336
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,872
Animal! What an animal!

337
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,117
Thanks, Mrs Fugacci.

338
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,992
There you go.

339
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,872
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

340
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,712
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

341
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,400
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

342
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,396
This way.

343
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,677
- Ronny!
- What?

344
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,473
- Somebody here to see Ronny.
- Ronny!

345
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,830
Ronny! Somebody wants to see you!

346
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,029
Have you come from my brother Johnny?

347
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,195
Yeah.

348
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,639
Why?

349
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,071
Well, we're gonna get married.

350
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,757
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny.
- Yeah.

351
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,269
- Shall we go someplace to talk?
- I have no life.

352
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,958
Excuse me?

353
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,036
I have no life.

354
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,833
My brother Johnny took my life from me.

355
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,876
I... I don't understand you.

356
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,070
And now he's getting married.

357
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,358
He has his!

358
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,153
He's getting his.

359
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,796
And he wants me to come.

360
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,396
What is life?

361
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,035
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

362
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,675
And I bake bread... bread... bread!

363
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,031
And I sweat...
and shovel this stinking dough

364
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,549
in and out of this hot hole in the wall

365
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,877
and I should be so happy!

366
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,228
Huh, sweetie?

367
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,794
You want me to come
to the wedding of my brother?

368
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,556
Where's my wedding?

369
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,516
Chrissy! Over by the wall!

370
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,437
Bring me the big knife.

371
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,790
- No, Ronny!
- Bring me the big knife!

372
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,478
I'm gonna cut my throat!

373
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,955
Maybe I should come back another time.

374
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,672
No, I want you to see this.

375
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,997
You can watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny

376
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,714
on his wedding day. OK?

377
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,751
Chrissy! Bring me the big knife!

378
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,393
I tell ya, I won't do it!

379
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,114
She won't do it. Do you know about me?

380
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,958
- Oh, Mr Cammareri...
- What?!

381
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,432
Do you know about me?

382
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,996
OK.

383
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,076
Nothing is anybody's fault.

384
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,516
But... things happen.

385
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,436
Look.

386
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,550
This wood is fake.

387
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,150
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married. And

388
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,236
And Johnny came in here.

389
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,432
And he ordered bread from me.
And I said, "OK, some bread."

390
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,154
And I... I put my hand in the slicer

391
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,875
and it got caught
cos I wasn't paying attention.

392
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,468
The slicer chewed off my hand.

393
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,990
And it's funny, cos when
my fiancée found out about it...

394
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,076
When she found out I had been maimed,

395
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,156
she left me for another man.

396
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,749
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

397
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,518
Yes, that's it.

398
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,756
Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault.

399
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,319
I don't care!
I ain't no freakin' monument to justice!

400
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,192
I lost my hand!

401
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,197
I lost my bride!

402
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,629
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

403
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,435
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget?!

404
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,871
Is it just a matter of time

405
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,670
before a man opens his eyes

406
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,516
and gives up his one

407
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,876
dream,

408
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,794
his one dream of happiness?

409
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,596
Maybe.

410
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,356
Maybe.

411
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,912
This is the most tormented man
I have known.

412
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,996
I'm in love with this man.

413
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,076
But he doesn't know that.

414
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,078
Cos I never told him

415
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,113
cos he could never love anybody
since he lost his hand and his girl.

416
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,316
Where do you live?

417
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,276
Upstairs.

418
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,676
Can't we just talk?

419
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,109
What are we painting here?
The Sistine Chapel?

420
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,549
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,594
Well, Mr Castorini, what do you think?

422
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,471
$10,800.

423
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,909
That seems like a lot.

424
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,072
Look.

425
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,156
There are three kinds of pipe.

426
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,158
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

427
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,396
And you can see where that's gotten you.

428
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,988
Then there's bronze...
which is very good.

429
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,033
Unless something goes wrong.
And something always goes wrong.

430
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,718
And then

431
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,674
there's copper
which is the only pipe I use.

432
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,756
It costs money.

433
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,758
It costs money because it saves money.

434
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,674
I think we should follow
Mr Castorini's advice, heart.

435
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,072
And then

436
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,431
there's copper
which is the only pipe I use.

437
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,916
It costs money.

438
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,955
It costs money because it saves money.

439
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,036
And what did they say?

440
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,952
Well, the man understood me.

441
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,036
The woman wanted to be cheap.

442
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,991
But the man saw I was right.

443
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,195
You have such a head for knowing.

444
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,276
You know everything.

445
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,151
I've brought you something.

446
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,916
It's a present.

447
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh, Cosmo!

448
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,790
Oh, my God!

449
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,630
They're little birds and stars.

450
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,399
Birds fly to the stars, I guess. Huh?

451
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,996
What's that smell?

452
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,076
- I'm making you a steak.
- I don't want it.

453
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,553
You'll eat it.

454
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,830
I like it well done.

455
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,952
You'll eat this one bloody
to feed your blood.

456
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,516
This is good.

457
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,596
Loretta.

458
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,632
- Where did Johnny find you?
- He knew my husband who died.

459
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,352
- How did he die?
- A bus hit him.

460
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,232
- Fast?
- Instantaneous.

461
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,591
- When did you get engaged?
- Yesterday.

462
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,635
So, five years ago, you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

463
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,318
- No woman since then?
- No.

464
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,510
Stupid.

465
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,189
When did your husband get hit by a bus?

466
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,072
Seven years ago.

467
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,589
- How many men since then?
- Just Johnny.

468
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,836
Stupid yourself.

469
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,030
No. Unlucky. I've not been lucky.

470
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,913
I don't care about luck.
You understand me?

471
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,837
It ain't that.

472
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,916
What's the matter with you?

473
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,679
You think you're the only one
who ever shed a tear?

474
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,438
Why are you talking to me?

475
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,876
You got any whiskey? How about
you give me a glass of whiskey?

476
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,676
I'll call you later.

477
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,677
Well...

478
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,360
She was right to leave me.

479
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,755
- You think so?
- Yeah.

480
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,678
You really are stupid, you know that?

481
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,076
You don't know nothing about it.

482
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,317
Look,

483
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,432
you know, I was raised
that a girl gets married young.

484
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,516
I held out for love.

485
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,596
I got married when I was 28.

486
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,154
I met a man, I loved him, I married him.

487
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,718
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

488
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,796
Then he gets hit by a bus.

489
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,798
So what do I got?
I got no man, no baby, no nothing.

490
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,276
How did I know that
that man was a gift I couldn't keep?

491
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,356
My one chance of happiness.

492
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,392
You tell me the story
and act like you know what it means.

493
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,080
But I can see
what the true story is and you can't.

494
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,156
That woman didn't leave you.

495
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,714
You can't see what you are
and I see everything.

496
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,398
You're a wolf.

497
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,436
- I'm a wolf?
- Yeah.

498
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,870
The...
The big part of you has no words and

499
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,558
it's a wolf.

500
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,636
That woman was a trap for you.

501
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,877
You couldn't get away,
so you chewed off your own foot.

502
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,956
That was the price of your freedom.

503
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,198
Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did
what you had to do between you and you.

504
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,108
And now you're afraid because you
know the big part of you is a wolf

505
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,791
that has the courage to bite off its hand
to escape from the trap of the wrong love.

506
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,992
That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. OK?

507
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,271
You're scared of what the wolf will do
if you slip up again.

508
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,595
- What are you doing?
- Telling you your life.

509
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,869
- Stop it.
- No.

510
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,036
Why are you marrying Johnny?
He's a fool.

511
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,276
Because I have no luck.

512
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,954
He made me look the wrong way
and I cut off my hand.

513
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,719
If you look the wrong way,
you could lose your head.

514
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,990
I'm looking where I have to to be a bride.

515
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,078
- A bride without a head.
- A wolf without a foot!

516
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,351
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

517
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,716
What are you doing?

518
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,239
Son of a bitch!

519
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,316
Where are you taking me?

520
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,236
To the bed.

521
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,920
Oh, God! OK, I don't care, I don't care.

522
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,996
Take me, take me to the bed.

523
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,076
I don't care about anything.

524
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,634
I don't believe this is happening.

525
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,236
- I was dead.
- Me, too.

526
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,678
- What about Johnny?
- You're mad at him.

527
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,791
Take your revenge out on me.

528
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,789
Leave nothing left for him to marry,
nothing but the skin over my bones.

529
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,798
All right, there will be nothing left.

530
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,150
- Let's eat while it's hot.
- Where's Loretta, huh?

531
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,238
- She must be eating out.
- She don't know what she's missing!

532
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,316
It's not like her not to call.

533
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,670
Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

534
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,234
We can talk about it, right?
Everybody knows.

535
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,351
I don't wanna talk about it.

536
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,153
Johnny Cammareri.
I think it's a great idea and about time.

537
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,954
What is she gonna do with the rest
of her life if she don't get married?

538
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,230
I don't wanna talk about it.

539
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,870
My father needs another plate.

540
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,871
Cosmo, many years ago,
when they told me

541
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,991
you were marrying my sister,

542
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,872
I was happy.

543
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,151
When I told Rose that I was marrying Rita,

544
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,111
she was happy.

545
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,595
Well, marriage is happy news, right?

546
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,516
Rose, pass the wine.

547
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,793
I never seen anybody so in love

548
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,876
like Cosmo was back then.

549
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,834
He'd stand outside the house all day
looking in the windows.

550
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,555
I never told you this,
cos it's not really a story.

551
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,389
But one time,
I woke up in the middle of the night

552
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,954
cos of this bright light in my face.

553
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,390
Like a flashlight.
I couldn't think of what it was.

554
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,116
I looked out the window

555
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,151
and it was the moon,

556
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,191
as big as a house.

557
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,596
I never seen the moon so big
before or since.

558
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,190
I was almost scared,
like it was gonna crush the house.

559
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,472
Then I looked down, and standing there
in the street was Cosmo

560
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,591
looking up at the windows.

561
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,355
This is the funny part!

562
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,436
I got mad at you, Cosmo.

563
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,155
I thought you had brought
that big moon over to my house,

564
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,271
because you were so in love

565
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,356
and woke me up with it.

566
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,436
I was half-asleep, I guess.

567
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,757
You were altogether asleep.
You were dreaming.

568
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,432
No.

569
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,471
You were there.

570
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,875
I don't wanna talk about it.

571
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,116
Well, what do you wanna talk about?

572
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,231
Why are you drinking so much?

573
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,590
Old man! You give those dogs
another piece of my food,

574
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
I'm gonna kick you till you're dead.

575
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,396
Cosmo.

576
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,956
Cosmo!

577
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,956
You drank too much.

578
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,756
Now you'll sleep too hard and later
you'll be up when you should be down.

579
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,592
What's the matter?

580
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,075
Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.

581
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,116
It's perfect.

582
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,959
I never seen a moon like that before.

583
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,750
It makes you look like an angel.

584
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,196
It looks like a

585
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,716
giant snowball.

586
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,155
- Rita.
- What?

587
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,796
- Rita, dear.
- What?

588
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,559
- Wake up!
- What?

589
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,956
Look.

590
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,674
Oh.

591
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,678
It's Cosmo's moon.

592
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,835
What are you talking about?
Cosmo can't own the moon.

593
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
It's that moon I was talking about

594
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,396
at dinner.

595
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,276
Is he down there?

596
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,152
Is who down there?

597
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,556
Cosmo.

598
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,434
- What would he be doing down there?
- I don't know.

599
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,796
You know something?

600
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,756
In that light,

601
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,113
with that expression on your face,

602
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,190
you look about 25 years old.

603
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,836
- Rita.
- What do you want?

604
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,356
Get out, get out!

605
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,391
- Rita...
- No!

606
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,876
<i>Piano!</i>

607
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,231
<i>Ho detto di non tirare!</i>

608
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,316
<i>Piano.</i>

609
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,796
<i>Piano, piano, piano.</i>

610
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,476
<i>Non tirare. Non tirare!</i>

611
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,196
<i>E guardate la luna.</i>

612
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,276
<i>Guardate la bella luna!</i>

613
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,356
<i>Guarda!</i>

614
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,550
<i>Ah, veramente una luna bella.</i>

615
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,559
<i>Ma guardate.</i>
<i>Ma non giù! Su! Guardate su!</i>

616
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,236
Why do you make me wait?

617
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,112
Come on, come on!

618
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,992
Howl, howl!

619
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,589
Hey, howl, come on!

620
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,236
<i>Guarda la luna!</i>

621
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,074
- Oh, my God!
- What?

622
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,156
- What?!
- Take it easy.

623
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,158
- This time I wanted to do it right.
- Don't become excited.

624
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,590
I thought if I didn't go to the City Hall,
I wouldn't have bad luck.

625
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,473
- You make me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother!

626
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,477
All right, I'm guilty. I confess.

627
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,830
The wedding's in two weeks.
You're invited.

628
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,679
How come you didn't
be with your mother in Palermo?

629
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,756
She don't like me.

630
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,348
You don't get along with anybody,
do you?

631
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,471
- What did you do?
- What did I do?!

632
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,835
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible.

633
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,758
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

634
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,070
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

635
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,156
Oh, yes, you did.

636
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,875
You've got them bad eyes, like a gypsy.
Why didn't I see it yesterday?

637
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,719
Bad luck, that's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

638
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,037
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

639
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,116
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?

640
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,993
Last night never happened.
I'm gonna marry him.

641
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,634
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

642
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,716
- I can't do that?
- Why not?

643
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,831
I'm in love with you.

644
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,072
- Snap out of it!
- I can't.

645
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,156
Then I must never see you again

646
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,431
and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny.

647
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,869
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I will.

648
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,798
- I'm telling you, you can't!
- He wants me to come.

649
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,876
That's because he don't know, OK?

650
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,958
Now wait a minute, honey.
Listen, all right.

651
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,753
I won't come to the wedding
provided one thing.

652
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,872
- What?
- Come with me tonight to the opera.

653
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,594
- What are you talking about?!
- I love two things.

654
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,836
I love you and... and I love the opera.

655
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,350
If I can have the two things I love
together for one night,

656
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,596
I would be satisfied to give up...

657
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,359
Oh, Christ, to give up the rest of my life.

658
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,675
- All right, all right.
- All right.

659
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,755
All right!

660
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,155
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right, all right.

661
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,993
- Where's the Met?
- Well, you gotta...

662
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,432
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's two months since my last confession.

663
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,516
What sins have you to confess?

664
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,676
Twice I took the Lord's name in vain,

665
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,995
once I slept with my fiancé's brother,

666
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,112
and I bounced a check
at the liquor store, but by mistake.

667
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,196
Then it's not a sin.

668
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,276
But,

669
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,075
what was that second thing you said,
Loretta?

670
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,033
You mean the one about
I slept with my fiancé's brother?

671
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,276
That's a pretty big sin.

672
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,755
- I know.
- You should think about this.

673
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,869
I know.

674
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,558
All right.

675
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,478
For your penance, say two rosaries.

676
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,956
Be careful, Loretta.

677
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,716
Reflect on your life.

678
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,796
All right.

679
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,788
<i>Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris,</i>
<i>Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

680
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,433
Amen.

681
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,312
Hi.

682
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,159
- Where you been?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

683
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,236
Just like your father.

684
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,956
I lied to him.

685
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,514
He thinks you came home last night.

686
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,516
Thanks.

687
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,276
What's the matter with you?

688
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,356
Cosmo's cheating on me.

689
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,436
What? How do you know this?

690
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,516
A wife knows.

691
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,349
You don't even know.
You're just imagining it. He's too old.

692
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,676
I won't be home for dinner.

693
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,316
I feel great!

694
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,072
I got no sleep,
but I feel like Orlando Furioso.

695
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,156
You were a tiger last night.

696
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,836
And you were a lamb. As soft as... milk.

697
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,916
Ssh! They'll hear you in the back.

698
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,079
The pleasure of marriage is you sleep
with the woman and worry about nothing.

699
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,158
- Be quiet, Raymond!
- Hey! How about a date tonight?

700
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,431
- What's the matter with you?!
- We'll eat some pasta...

701
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,632
- What's got into you?
- I don't know. I really don't know.

702
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,512
That moon...

703
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,995
That crazy moon Cosmo sent over.

704
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,315
Hi, Rita. Hi, Uncle Raymond.

705
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,873
Hey, there!

706
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,558
- What's the matter with him?
- You got me.

707
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,990
- Did you see that moon last night?
- What... what moon?

708
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,678
- Did you see it?
- No.

709
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,959
I gotta go.
I'll take the deposit to the bank,

710
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,071
but I gotta do the books tomorrow.

711
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,156
Oh, sure. You got a date.

712
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,396
What are you talking about, you fool?

713
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,159
Her fiancé's in Palermo. What date?!

714
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,872
Oh. Right.

715
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,956
I just got a lot of things to do.

716
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,196
- All that wedding stuff, huh?
- Yeah.

717
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,710
Hey! That's romantic, too.

718
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,352
Hey, Frankie!

719
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,471
Make me a bowl of minestrone!

720
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,754
What's the matter with you?
You look crazy.

721
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,914
- I got a lot on my mind.
- What?

722
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,110
- I got a lot on my mind...
- Don't say that.

723
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,357
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

724
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,436
I don't wanna talk about it.

725
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,320
Take out the grey.

726
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,433
I have wanted to do this for three years!
Let me show you some magazines.

727
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,632
And then you need a manicure, yes.

728
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,115
You take her, Bettina. Take out the grey.

729
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,835
- <i>Finalmente, che brutta!</i>
- And someone has to do the eyebrows...

730
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,916
Wait a minute, wait...

731
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,440
- Has anybody here been to the opera?
- Not me.

732
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,674
<i>Bellissima</i> without those ugly greys.

733
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,756
It's fantastic.

734
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,474
- Have you ever been to the opera?
- No. Have you?

735
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,949
Ow!

736
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,514
Bettina, you ever been to the opera?

737
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,909
- I never been.
- You going to the Met?

738
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,519
Yes.

739
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,552
She turned 40 and her husband left her.

740
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,395
- Bye-bye.
- OK, OK, OK.

741
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,709
- Wow.
- Look at that.

742
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,116
Careful.

743
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,196
Hi, I'm home!

744
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,993
Don't everybody answer at the same time.

745
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,076
Hello!

746
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,276
- Hi.
- Hi.

747
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,796
You look beautiful.

748
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,270
- Your hair.
- Yeah, I had it done.

749
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,277
- You look beautiful, too.
- Thank you.

750
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,275
No.

751
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,717
I said I'd go to the opera with you,
but... that's all.

752
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,876
Come on, let's go in.

753
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,714
- Oh, look at that.
- It's something, isn't it?

754
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,310
Wow! Thank you.

755
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,396
For what?

756
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,715
I don't know. For your hair.

757
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,796
For your beautiful dress.

758
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,038
I don't know. It's been a long time
since I've been to the opera.

759
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,476
So where are we sitting?

760
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,352
Come on.

761
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,196
Here we go.

762
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,636
- So. Who's coming?
- Just me. I want to eat.

763
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,512
OK. I got a table for you right now.

764
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,596
- This all right?
- Fine.

765
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,508
- Enjoy your meal, Mrs Castorini.
- Thanks.

766
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,199
Signora Castorini,
you dining alone tonight?

767
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,790
Hello, Bobo, yeah.
Let me have a martini, no ice, two olives.

768
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,875
Ah, very good.

769
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,399
When I tell you how I feel,
you tell me how you feel.

770
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,354
- That's not much of a response.
- It's the only response I've got.

771
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,552
- You want something to eat?
- Not now. I'll wave.

772
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,829
Very good.

773
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,997
I really hate it
when you use that tone with me.

774
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,076
Like isn't it so amusing.

775
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,191
- But it is.
- Not to me!

776
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,835
This is my life, no matter
how comical it may seem to you.

777
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,032
I don't need some man watching
while I roll around in the mud.

778
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,914
I think you like to roll around in the mud
and I don't. That's fair...

779
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,116
Sorry about that, folks.

780
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,435
She's a very pretty mental patient.

781
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,879
No, don't...
No, no, no. Please, don't mind me.

782
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,070
Just do me a favour and clear her place.

783
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,317
Get rid of all evidence of her
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

784
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,192
Absolutely.

785
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,311
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

786
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,193
I'm not disturbed by you.

787
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,840
My lady friend has a personality disorder.

788
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,791
She's just too young for you.

789
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,674
- Ah, thanks, comrade.
- It's nothing.

790
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,313
Too young?

791
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,590
I just got that.
You know how to hurt a guy.

792
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,518
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

793
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,196
I'm sorry. That was rude.

794
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,795
Would you like to join me for dinner?

795
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,076
Are you sure?

796
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,991
I'd be delighted.

797
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,795
I hate to eat alone. It's amazing
how often I end up doing just that.

798
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,674
Signora Castorini... your minestrone.

799
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,756
- Thanks, Bobo.
- <i>Prego.</i>

800
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,473
What do you do?

801
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,795
I'm a professor of communication at NYU.

802
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,912
- That woman was a student of yours?
- Sheila? Yeah, she was.

803
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,792
Is.

804
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,751
Was.

805
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,115
There's an old saying
my mother taught me.

806
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,798
Don't shit where you eat.

807
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,676
OK, I'll remember that.

808
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,990
- What do you do?
- I'm a housewife.

809
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,908
- How come you're eating alone?
- I'm not eating alone.

810
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,279
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

811
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,476
Why do men chase women?

812
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,152
Nerves.

813
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,314
I think it's because they fear death.

814
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,235
Well, maybe.
Do you wanna know why I chase women?

815
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,828
I find women charming.

816
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,316
I teach these classes
I've taught for a million years.

817
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,796
The spontaneity went out of it for me
a long time ago.

818
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,833
At first, I was excited about something,
I wanted to share it. Now it's rote.

819
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,394
A multiplication table.

820
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,476
Except sometimes...

821
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,114
Sometimes, I'll be droning along

822
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,838
and I'll look up and I'll see a fresh,

823
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,996
beautiful young face.

824
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,076
And it's all new to her.

825
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,432
I'm just this great guy
who's brilliant and thinks out loud.

826
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,439
When that happens,
when I look out there among those chairs,

827
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,790
and see a young woman's face

828
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,876
and see me in her eyes,

829
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,798
me, the way I always wanted to be,
maybe once was,

830
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,070
I ask her out for a date.

831
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,156
It doesn't last long.

832
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,236
A few weeks,

833
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,510
a couple of precious months.

834
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,591
Then she catches on that
I'm just this burned-out old gasbag

835
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,990
and she's as fresh and bright

836
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,476
and full of promise
as moonlight in a martini.

837
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,079
And at that moment she stands up
and throws a glass of water in my face

838
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,794
or some action to that effect.

839
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,798
What you don't know
about women is a lot.

840
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,392
Well... that's not what I hear.

841
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,669
- Two white wines, please.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,589
I'd like two glasses of champagne.

843
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,155
Canadian Club with ginger ale
and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.

844
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,317
- What's that?
- This was done by Marc Chagall.

845
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,556
As you can see, he was a great artist.

846
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,717
- It's kinda gaudy.
- He was having some fun.

847
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,400
They get some turnout for this stuff, huh?

848
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,431
It's the best thing there is.

849
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,076
You know, I like parts of it,
but I just don't... really get it.

850
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,789
You haven't once said you like my dress.

851
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,876
I like your dress.

852
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,958
It's very bright. Oh...

853
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,870
Will you hold this? Thanks.

854
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,476
May I walk with you a ways?

855
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,750
Sure. Thanks.

856
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,593
- Do you live far from here?
- Just up there.

857
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,954
- You knew that man?
- Yes.

858
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,796
That was so awful.

859
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,279
- Awful?
- Beautiful! Sad.

860
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,356
- She died.
- Yes.

861
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,233
I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think she would die.

862
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,510
- I knew she was sick, but...
- She had TB.

863
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,029
I know! She was coughing her brains out.

864
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,276
And still she had to keep singing.

865
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,275
Pop.

866
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,271
Pop, what are you doing here?

867
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,076
Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

868
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,278
- Mona?
- Excuse me!

869
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,480
- What did you do to your hair?
- I... had it done.

870
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,073
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

871
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,668
- Who's that? You're engaged.
- You're married.

872
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,109
You're my daughter.
Don't act like a <i>puttana.</i>

873
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,549
- And you're my father...
- All right.

874
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,276
I didn't see you here.

875
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,595
I don't know if I saw you here or what.

876
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,074
Let's get outta here.
I'll buy you a drink.

877
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,350
That woman was not my mother, OK?

878
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,756
That's my house.

879
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,470
- You mean the whole house?
- Yes.

880
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,196
My God! It's a mansion.

881
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,276
It's a house.

882
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,516
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.

883
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,596
What exactly does your husband do?

884
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,472
He's a plumber.

885
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,830
Well, that explains it, then.

886
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,434
Temperature's dropping.

887
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,031
- I guess you can't invite me in.
- No.

888
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,513
People home.

889
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,356
No. I think the house is empty.

890
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,278
I can't invite you in because I'm married.

891
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,356
Because I know who I am.

892
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,400
- You're shivering.
- I'm a little cold.

893
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,918
You're a little boy. And you like to be bad.

894
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,916
We could go to my apartment.
See how the other half lives.

895
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,679
I'm too old for you.

896
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,031
I'm too old for me.
That's my predicament.

897
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,756
Goodnight.

898
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,073
Goodnight.
Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?

899
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,956
Sure.

900
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,431
I'm freezing.

901
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,312
Goodnight.

902
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,796
Goodnight.

903
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,596
Anything else, folks?

904
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,472
- Loretta?
- No.

905
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,990
- I think that's it, Al.
- See you, Al!

906
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,397
- What do you wanna do now?
- I wanna go home.

907
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,995
- Goodnight, Al.
- Take it easy, Ronny.

908
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,636
God, it's cold.

909
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,716
It smells like snow.

910
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,991
You know, my mother guessed
my father was seeing somebody.

911
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,192
That Mona, I mean,
she's some piece of cheap goods.

912
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,636
Who am I to talk?

913
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,708
- What's the matter?
- How can you ask me that?

914
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,116
- You're making me feel guilty.
- You are guilty! I'm guilty.

915
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,312
Of what?
Only God can point the finger, Loretta.

916
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,591
- Yeah, well, I know what I know.
- And what do you know?

917
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,916
OK, you tell me my life.
I'll tell you yours.

918
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,670
I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.
That don't make you no lamb.

919
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,756
You're gonna marry my brother.

920
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,034
Why do you wanna sell your life short?

921
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,756
Playing it safe's the most dangerous
thing a woman like you could do.

922
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,838
I mean, you waited for
the right man the first time.

923
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,873
- Why didn't you wait for him again?
- Because he didn't come.

924
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,230
- I'm here.
- You're late.

925
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,517
This is your place.
So this is where we were going.

926
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,789
Yeah.

927
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,876
You know, we had a deal.

928
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,230
You said if I came with you to the opera

929
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,272
you'd leave me alone for ever.
And I came with you!

930
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,110
I'm gonna marry your brother and you're
gonna leave me alone for ever, right?

931
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,028
A person can see
where they've messed up in their life.

932
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,073
They can change the way they do things.
They can even change their luck.

933
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,079
So maybe my nature does draw me
to you. But I don't have to go with it.

934
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,159
I can take hold of myself
and I can say yes to some things

935
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,397
and no to other things
that will ruin everything.

936
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,193
Otherwise, you know, what...

937
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,789
What good is this stupid life
that God gave us? I mean, for what?

938
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,434
Are you listening to me?!

939
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,391
Yeah.

940
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,275
Everything seems like nothing to me now.
I want you in my bed.

941
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,796
I don't care if I burn in hell.

942
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,036
I don't care if you burn in hell.

943
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,116
The past and the future is

944
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,196
a joke to me now.

945
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,198
I see that they're nothing,
I see they ain't here.

946
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,038
The only thing that's here

947
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,277
is you... and me.

948
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,356
- I wanna go home.
- No.

949
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,674
- I'm gonna go home.
- No!

950
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,109
- I'm freezing to death.
- Come upstairs.

951
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,196
I don't care why you come.

952
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,796
No, that's not what I mean.

953
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,876
Loretta,

954
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,956
I love you.

955
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,835
Not... not like they told you love is.

956
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,748
I didn't know this either.
But love don't make things nice.

957
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,509
It ruins everything.
It breaks your heart.

958
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:53,519
It makes things a mess.
We aren't here to make things perfect.

959
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,954
- The snowflakes are perfect...
- Oh!

960
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,630
The stars are perfect.

961
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,035
Not us. Not us!

962
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,632
We are here to ruin ourselves

963
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,558
and... and to break our hearts

964
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,114
and love the wrong people.

965
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,992
And die!

966
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,680
I mean that the storybooks are bullshit!

967
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,397
Now I want you to come upstairs with me

968
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,476
and get in my bed!

969
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,356
Come on.

970
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,793
Come on.

971
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,312
Come on.

972
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,590
19 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn.

973
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,676
Got it.

974
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,920
Hold it!

975
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,512
- How much?
- 25.

976
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,596
- 25 dollars?
- Yeah.

977
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,276
Hold it.

978
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,798
Hey!

979
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,431
Oh, hi. I'm sorry to call so late.

980
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,471
Moving in?

981
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,556
No, I came right from the airport.

982
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,636
Come on in.

983
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,512
Can you wake up Loretta?
I need to talk to her.

984
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,872
She's not home yet. Take off your coat
and come through. I'll make you a drink.

985
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,636
I wanna talk to you!

986
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,236
Thank you. Where is she?

987
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,316
Out. I don't know where.

988
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,396
So. What are you doing here?

989
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,988
You're supposed to be in Palermo.

990
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,635
This is what I came to tell Loretta.
There's been a miracle.

991
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,196
A miracle? Well, that's news.

992
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,076
My mother's recovered.

993
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,511
- You're kidding?
- Oh, no.

994
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,599
The breath had almost totally left
her body. She was as white as snow.

995
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,631
And then,

996
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,638
she completely pulled back from death,

997
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,309
and stood up... and put on her clothes,

998
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,193
and began to cook
for everyone in the house.

999
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,392
The mourners, and me, and herself.

1000
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,829
She ate a meal that could choke a pig.

1001
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,030
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

1002
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,318
Hi, Pop.

1003
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,796
Oh, my God.

1004
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,396
Is he all right?

1005
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,829
My father-in-law's got
this wrong idea in his head.

1006
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,916
Listen, Johnny.

1007
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,156
There's a question I want to ask.

1008
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,078
I want you to tell me the truth...
if you can.

1009
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,276
Why do men chase women?

1010
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,636
Well uh...

1011
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,796
There's the Bible story.

1012
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,836
God.

1013
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,475
God took a rib from Adam...
and made Eve.

1014
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,517
Now, maybe men chase women
to get the rib back.

1015
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,596
When God took the rib,

1016
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,476
he left a big hole there.

1017
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,353
A place where
there used to be something.

1018
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,436
And the women have that.

1019
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,437
Now maybe,

1020
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,838
just maybe,
a man isn't complete as a man,

1021
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,190
without a woman.

1022
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,317
Why would a man need
more than one woman?

1023
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,956
I don't know.

1024
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,876
Maybe because he fears death.

1025
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,834
That's it. That's the reason.

1026
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,712
- I don't know!
- No!

1027
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,718
That's it. No. Thank you.

1028
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,073
Thank you for answering my question.

1029
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,152
Hi.

1030
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,956
Hello, Mr Castorini.

1031
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,156
Oh. Hi.

1032
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,032
Where you been?

1033
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,709
I don't know where I've been
and I don't know where I'm going.

1034
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,956
All right?

1035
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,108
You'll have your eyes opened for you,
my friend.

1036
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,800
- I have my eyes open.
- Oh, yeah?

1037
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,878
Well, stick around.
Don't go on any long trips.

1038
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,710
- I don't know what you mean.
- That's the point. I'll say no more.

1039
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,592
You haven't said anything.

1040
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,716
And that's all I'm saying.

1041
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,558
- Cosmo.
- What?

1042
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,319
I just want you to know,
no matter what you do,

1043
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,034
you're gonna die,
just like everybody else.

1044
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,435
Thank you, Rose.

1045
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,755
You're welcome.

1046
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,836
I'm going to bed now.

1047
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,751
I'm going.

1048
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,836
Good.

1049
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,916
He doesn't like you.
But thank you for answering my question.

1050
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,508
- You don't know where Loretta is?
- No. No idea.

1051
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,599
Mrs Castorini, will you tell Loretta
that I'll come by in the morning?

1052
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,553
- We... We need to talk.
- OK, I'll tell her. OK.

1053
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,671
Thank you.

1054
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,515
Watch it! The house!

1055
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,151
What the hell happened to you?

1056
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,236
I really don't know where to start.

1057
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,148
- Your hair's different.
- Ma, everything is different.

1058
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,078
- Are you drunk?
- No. Are you drunk?

1059
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,156
No. But I have a hangover.

1060
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,236
- Where's Pop?
- Upstairs.

1061
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,393
Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

1062
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,273
What?! He's in Sicily.

1063
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,153
- No more, he's not.
- He's there with his dying mother.

1064
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,157
- She recovered.
- She was dying!

1065
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,077
It was a miracle.

1066
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,670
This is modern times!
There ain't supposed to be miracles.

1067
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,756
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily.

1068
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,759
He came right from the airport.
He wanted to talk to you.

1069
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,998
You got a lovebite on your neck.
He's coming back this morning.

1070
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,634
Your life's going down the toilet.

1071
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,194
Cover up that damn thing!
Put some make-up on it!

1072
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,676
All right! Ma, OK, fine!
But you gotta help me.

1073
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,755
Hurry up...

1074
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,429
You get it.

1075
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,516
Answer the door!

1076
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,232
Mother?

1077
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,276
Hi. Is Loretta home?

1078
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,231
Come on in.

1079
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,396
It's not Johnny.

1080
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,512
Ronny!

1081
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,119
Is Johnny here?

1082
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,151
- No, but he's coming.
- Good.

1083
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,430
We can get this out on the table.

1084
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,915
Hi. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1085
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,031
I'm Rose Castorini.

1086
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,518
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1087
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,234
You got a lovebite on your neck.

1088
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,432
- Your mother's recovered from death.
- Oh, good.

1089
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,990
- We're not close. I'm not...
- Ouch!

1090
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,429
- You gotta leave.
- I want to meet the family.

1091
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,516
No. Really, you gotta get out of here.

1092
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,437
- Anyone want some oatmeal?
- No, Ma.

1093
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,869
Yes, Mrs Castorini. I would love some.

1094
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,911
No, we don't want any oatmeal.

1095
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,553
Ma!

1096
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,636
That was a... This is a... Oh!

1097
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,756
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're welcome.

1098
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,836
- Hi.
- Hi.

1099
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,438
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1100
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,873
It's very good to meet you, Mr Castorini.

1101
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,997
I have a feeling
this is going to be just delicious.

1102
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,718
- You're Johnny's brother?
- Yeah.

1103
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,196
Don't look at me like that, OK?

1104
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,556
Hi, Pop.

1105
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,989
- What's the matter, Pop?
- I'm old.

1106
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,076
The old are not wanted.

1107
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,873
And if they say it, they have no weight.

1108
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,074
But, my son... I must speak.

1109
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:37,311
You must pay for the wedding
of your only daughter.

1110
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,591
You break your house through pride.

1111
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,196
There.

1112
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,115
- I... I've said it.
- It's OK, Pop.

1113
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,915
If she gets married...
I'll pay for the whole thing.

1114
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,031
Now you're talking.

1115
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:01,830
Let's eat.

1116
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,150
Have I been a good wife?

1117
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,758
Yeah.

1118
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,320
I want you to stop seeing her.

1119
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,716
OK.

1120
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,476
And go to confession.

1121
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:01,792
A man understands one day
that his life is built on nothing

1122
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,394
and that's a bad, crazy day.

1123
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,953
Your life is not built on nothing.

1124
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,596
- It's Johnny, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

1125
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,836
- I should tell him.
- I will.

1126
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,678
What am I gonna tell him?

1127
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,554
Tell him the truth, Loretta.
They find out anyway.

1128
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,196
You're right, Papa.

1129
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:04,196
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1130
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,036
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1131
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,515
Why aren't you two at the store?

1132
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,438
Do you have something
you wanna tell us, honey?

1133
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,956
No.

1134
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,831
We just come from the bank.

1135
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,916
Yeah.

1136
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,835
Oh, my God! I forgot to make the deposit!

1137
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,518
Oh, she's got it.

1138
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,359
- I knew she had it!
- We didn't know what to think.

1139
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,710
You were so weird yesterday.

1140
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,230
And then we went to the bank
this morning, and no bag.

1141
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,316
We never suspected you.

1142
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,874
Listen, would anyone like some coffee?

1143
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,956
That's a good idea.

1144
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,274
- What's with this suspected?
- I'll tell you later.

1145
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,152
I forgot to make the deposit.

1146
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,032
Sit down. Have some coffee.

1147
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,029
- So what are we doing?
- Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri.

1148
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,996
My name's Ronny.

1149
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,076
Johnny's brother.

1150
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,272
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

1151
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,517
- Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother.
- Hi.

1152
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,956
Someone tell a joke.

1153
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,872
I'll get it.

1154
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,036
I thought Johnny was in Palermo.

1155
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,836
It's Johnny Cammareri!

1156
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,073
Loretta?

1157
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,156
Ronny!

1158
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:15,478
- Have you come to make peace with me?
- Yes.

1159
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,556
But...

1160
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,076
you may not want to.

1161
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,156
Ronny, of course I want to.

1162
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,919
Johnny, your mother was dying.
How did she recover?

1163
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,476
I told her we were to be married
and she got well right away!

1164
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,591
- I'm sure she did!
- It was a miracle.

1165
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,113
Johnny,
I have something I have to tell you.

1166
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,869
And I have something to tell you.
But I must talk to you alone.

1167
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,434
No, I need my family around me now.

1168
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,951
Loretta,

1169
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,036
I can't marry you.

1170
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,713
What?!

1171
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,310
- If I marry you, my mother will die!
- What do you mean? We're engaged!

1172
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,510
Loretta, what are you talking about?

1173
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,995
I'm talking about a promise?
He proposed!

1174
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,156
My mother was dying and now she's not!

1175
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,874
You're 42 years old.
She's still running your life.

1176
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,877
And you don't love your mother!

1177
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,798
You are a big liar.
Because I have a ring right here.

1178
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,876
Oh, I must ask for that back.

1179
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:12,949
- All right. The engagement is off!
- You will see this is the best thing.

1180
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,992
And you'll drop dead
and I'll mourn you in a red dress!

1181
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,076
- Loretta...
- What?

1182
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,189
- Will you marry me?
- What?!

1183
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,276
Where's the ring?

1184
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,036
Johnny.

1185
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,276
Can I borrow that ring?

1186
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,876
Thanks.

1187
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,676
Loretta Castorini,

1188
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,476
will you marry me?

1189
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:52,277
Yes, Ronny.
In front of all these people, I'll marry you.

1190
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,312
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- Ma, I love him awful.

1191
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,396
Oh, God. That's too bad.

1192
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,596
She loves me.

1193
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,276
What's the matter, Pop?

1194
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,549
I'm confused.

1195
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,116
To Loretta and Ronny!

1196
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,354
There we are! Thank you, thank you.

1197
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,796
Come on, Raymond!

1198
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,873
- Come, come. Your brother is here and...
- No, I don't want any.

1199
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,118
You are a part of the family.
Don't you realise? Come on, <i>bevi!</i>

1200
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,874
Everybody, come on! Glass in hand!

1201
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,316
To... to family!

1202
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,396
To family!

1203
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,913
