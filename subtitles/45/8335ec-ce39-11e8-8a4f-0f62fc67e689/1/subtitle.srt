1
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,103
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:19,275
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- l already told you.

3
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,652
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

4
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:25,115
- What's the password?
- ''I've come to Grandma's funeral.''

5
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,409
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

6
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:31,039
lf you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

7
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:33,250
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?

8
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,462
I'd better blow.
lf Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

9
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,673
Goodbye, Charlie.

10
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:43,137
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

11
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:45,348
You betcha.

12
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,826
Good evening, sir.

13
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,664
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can l do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

14
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,167
l haven't seen you at our services before.

15
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,587
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

16
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,298
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

17
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,427
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

18
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,930
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

19
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:39,664
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

20
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,083
Follow me, please.

21
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:56,476
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

22
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,854
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

23
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,899
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

24
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:04,819
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

25
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:08,657
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

26
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,660
How about that one over there?

27
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:14,831
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

28
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,387
Oops.

29
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,273
Hey, l want another cup of coffee.

30
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:38,068
l want another cup of coffee.

31
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,417
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

32
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:55,798
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

33
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,871
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

34
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,542
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

35
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:29,297
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

36
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,425
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

37
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,389
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

38
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,852
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

39
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:45,358
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

40
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,530
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

41
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:54,828
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

42
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:57,664
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

43
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:01,002
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

44
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:04,840
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1 .

45
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:08,719
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

46
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:12,891
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?

47
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:17,563
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

48
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,609
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

49
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,612
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

50
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,824
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

51
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:29,661
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

52
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:43,762
Four,

53
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:45,222
three,

54
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,766
two,

55
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:48,142
one.

56
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:04,621
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

57
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,749
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

58
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,295
l want another cup of coffee.

59
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,853
All right, Spats.

60
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,648
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

61
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:31,820
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

62
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,949
- l don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

63
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,746
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats - striped.

64
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:43,000
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

65
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:47,256
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

66
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:49,467
Me? I'm just a customer.

67
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,098
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

68
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:59,479
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

69
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,482
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

70
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,403
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

71
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:10,325
Buttermilk.

72
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:13,120
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

73
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,249
Come on. On your feet.

74
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,337
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

75
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,341
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

76
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,521
l wan' another cuppa coffee.

77
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,447
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

78
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,451
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

79
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,287
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

80
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:25,708
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

81
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:29,254
l wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

82
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:34,052
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

83
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,306
- Jerry, l told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

84
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,809
lt is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

85
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:43,647
Look, stupid, he's 10-1 .
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

86
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,745
Greased Lightning.

87
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,708
- l oughta have my head examined.
- l thought you weren't talkin' to me.

88
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,170
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than l am.

89
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,722
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

90
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,475
Thank you.

91
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:17,771
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

92
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,524
Thank you.

93
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:24,029
l can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
l got a fever, l got a hole in my shoe...

94
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:26,949
lf you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

95
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,244
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

96
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:33,916
Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

97
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,628
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

98
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,548
No, your bass.
lf we hock that and my sax...

99
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:43,427
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

100
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,640
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do l care? Freeze.

101
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,477
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.

102
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,562
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

103
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,648
Thank you.

104
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,818
Joe. Come back here.

105
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:03,452
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
l can explain.

106
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,873
What a heel. l spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

107
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,084
l buy me a brand-new negligee,

108
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,253
l bake him a great big pizza pie.

109
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:14,382
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

110
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,758
- With you.
- Me?

111
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,844
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

112
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,222
lt was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

113
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,390
lt was?

114
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,559
Oh, yeah.

115
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:27,231
- l took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

116
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:30,151
- Type O.
- Oh?

117
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:34,323
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

118
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:38,911
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

119
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:42,875
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anyzhing for us? We're desperate.

120
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,713
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

121
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,506
And a sax.

122
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,175
Right?

123
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,719
Right.

124
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,639
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

125
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:58,727
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

126
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:02,065
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

127
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:05,819
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

128
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:08,531
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

129
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,034
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

130
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,246
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

131
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:18,209
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. l got a job for ya.

132
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,003
Gladys. Are ya there?

133
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,381
Gladys!

134
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,635
Meshugeneh.
Played 1 1 2 hours at a marathon dance.

135
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:29,181
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

136
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,849
And Cora Jackson?

137
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:34,479
Last l heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

138
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,690
Drexel 9044.

139
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,776
Those idiot broads.

140
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:42,739
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

141
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:48,162
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

142
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,248
Bienstock, l oughta fire you.

143
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,585
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

144
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,380
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

145
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,092
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

146
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,595
On the level?

147
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,515
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

148
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,395
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

149
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,481
How about Rosemary Schultz?

150
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,775
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

151
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:16,613
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

152
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:21,119
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

153
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:25,165
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

154
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,085
Bye, Sig. l wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

155
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,505
Nellie, get me long-distance.

156
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:35,094
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

157
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,597
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

158
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,100
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

159
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,104
The William Morris Agency in New York.

160
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,983
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

161
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,443
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

162
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:51,155
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

163
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:55,410
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

164
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:56,996
What kind of a band is it?

165
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,499
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

166
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,167
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

167
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,627
And you gotta be girls.

168
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,962
No, we couldn't.

169
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:07,216
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

170
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,846
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
l could wring her neck.

171
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,349
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?

172
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,686
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

173
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,149
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

174
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:23,486
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

175
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,655
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

176
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:29,827
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

177
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:33,290
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

178
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:36,001
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

179
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:38,588
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

180
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:42,050
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

181
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,762
lf you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

182
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:48,933
at the University of lllinois
they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.

183
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,602
We'll take it.

184
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,522
$6 a man. Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

185
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,317
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

186
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:59,571
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

187
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:03,326
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

188
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,246
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

189
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,915
A sax player and a bass?

190
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:12,921
- lf William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

191
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:17,093
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

192
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,053
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

193
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:21,682
Don't crowd me.

194
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:25,311
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

195
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:28,148
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

196
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,360
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

197
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,240
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

198
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:38,786
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

199
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:43,041
l just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

200
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:45,252
Then you'll be in all evening?

201
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:47,129
Yes, Joe.

202
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:49,423
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

203
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,593
My car? Why, you...

204
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,141
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

205
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,865
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

206
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,660
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

207
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:14,871
Knock it off, will ya?

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,212
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

209
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,343
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

210
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,721
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

211
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,433
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

212
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:36,564
Musicians.

213
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,108
Wise guys.

214
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,736
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

215
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,739
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

216
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,242
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

217
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:51,374
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

218
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:54,920
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

219
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,631
And while you're at it, fill it up.

220
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,729
All right, everybody. Hands up.

221
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:13,901
Face the wall.

222
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:18,490
You too, Toothpick.

223
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,576
Come on.

224
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,414
Come on.

225
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:38,723
Hey. Join us.

226
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,281
OK, boss.

227
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,174
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

228
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:11,346
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- l just dropped in to pay my respects.

229
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,974
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- l wouldn't say that.

230
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:16,685
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

231
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:20,231
- l don't know what you mean.
- Now l got all those coffins on my hands.

232
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,986
- l hate to see 'em go to waste.
- l had nothin' to do with it.

233
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:28,158
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

234
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,832
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

235
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,002
No, Spats. Please, no.

236
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,762
l think I'm gonna be sick.

237
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,897
All right, come on outta there.

238
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,691
Come on.

239
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,194
Come on.

240
00:20:58,277 --> 00:21:02,992
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

241
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:06,955
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

242
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:11,335
Say... Don't l know you two
from somewhere?

243
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:14,130
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

244
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,967
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

245
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,136
There's a dance tonight.

246
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,639
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

247
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:26,228
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

248
00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:28,314
You're not goin' nowhere.

249
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,737
- We're not?
- l don't like no witnesses.

250
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:37,200
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

251
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,369
Not even air.

252
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:16,622
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

253
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,475
l think they got me.

254
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,769
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

255
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,399
lf they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

256
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:54,168
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

257
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:58,965
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

258
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:14,693
Quick, gimme a nickel.

259
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,407
You're gonna call the police?

260
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,953
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

261
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:25,664
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

262
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:28,376
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

263
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,214
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

264
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,717
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

265
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:39,306
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

266
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:43,061
l understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

267
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:03,836
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

268
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,257
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

269
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:09,885
All aboard.

270
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:19,355
What now?

271
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,275
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

272
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:26,363
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

273
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,532
lt is so draughty.

274
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,743
They must catch cold all the time.

275
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:33,747
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- l feel naked.

276
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:38,127
- l feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

277
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:50,559
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

278
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:54,522
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

279
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,013
Look at that. Look how she moves.

280
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:23,724
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

281
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:27,145
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

282
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:29,565
l tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

283
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:32,360
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

284
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:35,614
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

285
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:37,574
You will not talk me into...

286
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,538
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

287
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:44,166
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

288
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,963
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

289
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,883
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

290
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,969
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

291
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,472
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

292
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,104
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

293
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:05,024
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

294
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:09,280
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

295
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,783
My name is Josephine.

296
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,202
I'm Daphne.

297
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,457
Saxophone, bass. Am l glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

298
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:20,335
Likewise, I'm sure.

299
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:22,546
Where did you girls play before?

300
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:25,883
Here, there and... around, and...

301
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:30,347
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

302
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,766
All aboard.

303
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,936
You're in berths 7 and 7A.

304
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,104
7 and 7A.

305
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:38,190
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

306
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,359
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

307
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:44,739
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

308
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,785
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

309
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:51,205
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

310
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:02,177
What are you...?

311
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,929
Daphne?

312
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:06,974
l never did like the name Geraldine.

313
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,861
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

314
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,242
My name is Josephine. Sax.

315
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:25,956
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

316
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:29,585
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, l don't wear one myself.

317
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,796
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

318
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,426
l have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

319
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:39,097
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

320
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:42,643
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

321
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,646
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

322
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:49,818
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

323
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:53,781
They went to a conservatory.

324
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,247
How about that talent, huh?

325
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:03,168
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

326
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:07,464
When l was a kid, Joe, l dreamed l was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

327
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:09,759
And there was goodies all around.

328
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:14,556
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

329
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,102
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

330
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:20,272
Yeah, sure, Joe.

331
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:23,108
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

332
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:27,072
Now you've done it.

333
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,118
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

334
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,581
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

335
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:44,593
This way, Daphne.

336
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:47,722
Now you tore the other one.

337
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,572
Terribly sorry.

338
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:03,866
It's OK. l was scared it was Sweet Sue.

339
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,578
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

340
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,040
lf they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

341
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,087
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

342
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,298
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

343
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,384
This is Joe... sephine.

344
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,345
Come in.

345
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,347
I'm Sugar Cane.

346
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,476
- Sugar Cane?
- l changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

347
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,439
- Polish?
- Yes. l come from this musical family.

348
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:32,443
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

349
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:36,322
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

350
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,954
l play the ukulele, and l sing, too.

351
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:45,583
l don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

352
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,669
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

353
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:51,841
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

354
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,678
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

355
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:57,598
I'll take a rain check.

356
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:02,813
l don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
l can stop if l want to, only l don't want to.

357
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:05,608
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

358
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:09,779
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

359
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:13,033
l always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

360
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,000
Are my seams straight?

361
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,295
I'll say.

362
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:26,884
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

363
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,387
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

364
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,307
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

365
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:35,352
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

366
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:38,690
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

367
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,027
Boy, would l love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

368
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,696
Look...

369
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:47,951
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

370
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,454
You tore 'em again.

371
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:32,713
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

372
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:34,883
No. Funerals.

373
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:38,971
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

374
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,057
We'll try.

375
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,186
How did those holes get there?

376
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:46,897
Those?

377
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:48,983
l don't know.

378
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:50,652
Mice?

379
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:55,032
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

380
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:02,489
Bienstock!

381
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,700
Yes, Sue?

382
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:08,872
l thought l made it clear
that l don't want any drinking in this outfit.

383
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:17,090
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

384
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,301
Come on, now. Speak up.

385
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:22,013
- Sugar, l warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

386
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,350
I've had it. ln Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

387
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,853
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

388
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,730
Mr Bienstock, could l have my flask?

389
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:32,734
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

390
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:36,822
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

391
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,157
Give me that.

392
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,202
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

393
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:45,458
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- l thought you said three years.

394
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,378
We got time off for good behaviour.

395
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:54,427
There are two things l will not put up with
during working hours: liquor and men.

396
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:57,764
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

397
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,975
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

398
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:03,396
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

399
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,733
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

400
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:09,779
l beg your pardon, miss.

401
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:12,908
All right, girls. From the top again.

402
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:54,208
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

403
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,711
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

404
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,671
Good night, Gloria.

405
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,383
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

406
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:05,972
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

407
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,561
How about that ''toodle-oo''.

408
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:14,858
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

409
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:17,653
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

410
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:21,199
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

411
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,076
I'm a...

412
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:29,542
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.

413
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:31,753
I'm a girl.

414
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,922
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

415
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,133
I'm a girl.

416
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,679
Good night, Sugar.

417
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,812
Good night, honey.

418
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:49,900
Honey? Hey, she called me ''honey''.

419
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,652
Ooh, honey.

420
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:55,198
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

421
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,618
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

422
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:00,955
Supposin' l gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

423
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,542
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose l lose.

424
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:07,505
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

425
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:13,053
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

426
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,891
- Funny? ln what way?
- l don't know, but l can feel it right here.

427
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,771
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

428
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,691
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

429
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:28,071
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

430
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:30,992
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

431
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:42,464
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

432
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,341
l wish l were dead.

433
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,513
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

434
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:31,899
Daphne.

435
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,205
Sugar.

436
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:48,377
l wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

437
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:52,757
It's nothing.

438
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:55,052
l just thought that
us girls should stick together.

439
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:58,181
lf it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

440
00:37:58,264 --> 00:38:01,393
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

441
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,647
It's freezing outside.

442
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:07,776
l mean, when l think about you
and your poor ukulele...

443
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:10,487
lf there's ever anyzhing l can do for you...

444
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:13,199
l can think of a million things.

445
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:18,288
That's one of 'em.

446
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:21,000
It's Sweet Sue.

447
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:34,892
l don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

448
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:38,646
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

449
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,859
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

450
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:44,570
You stay here as long as you like.

451
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:49,368
I'm not crowding you, am l?

452
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,579
No. It's nice and cosy.

453
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,294
When l was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

454
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:01,049
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

455
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,885
and were trying to find our way out.

456
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,388
Very interesting.

457
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,769
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

458
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:15,149
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

459
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:17,318
That's ridiculous.

460
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:20,155
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

461
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:23,701
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

462
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,870
Here, let me warm them up a little.

463
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:29,959
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

464
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:32,337
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

465
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:35,382
- I'd better go before l catch something.
- Not that sick.

466
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:37,468
I've got very low resistance.

467
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:41,431
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

468
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,560
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

469
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,563
- You've got some?
- l know where to get it.

470
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,232
Don't move.

471
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:52,277
- Hold on.
- OK.

472
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:16,056
Up. Up.

473
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:23,774
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

474
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:26,903
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

475
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:30,449
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

476
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:44,632
Oh, l tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

477
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,428
Put on the lights.
l can't see what I'm doing.

478
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:50,056
No lights. We don't want them to know.

479
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:52,767
- But l might spill some.
- So spill it.

480
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,896
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

481
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,691
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

482
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:01,194
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

483
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:03,822
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

484
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:05,992
That'll put hair on your chest.

485
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,203
No fair guessing.

486
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:11,540
Is this a private clambake?

487
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,626
It's private. Please, go away.

488
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:16,004
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

489
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,798
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

490
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:20,927
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

491
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,221
Manhattans? At this time of night?

492
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:25,933
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

493
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,102
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

494
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:32,399
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

495
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:36,570
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

496
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:38,948
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

497
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:40,951
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

498
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,662
Go get some paper cups.

499
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:46,374
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

500
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:54,592
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

501
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:57,429
l brought some cheese and crackers.

502
00:41:57,513 --> 00:42:01,392
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

503
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:07,024
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

504
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,488
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbours downstairs.

505
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,116
Watch that corkscrew.

506
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:17,328
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

507
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,956
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

508
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,042
Here's the cocktail shaker.

509
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:25,463
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

510
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:29,760
1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck.
1 2 of you will have to get out.

511
00:42:29,843 --> 00:42:33,306
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

512
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,809
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

513
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:41,107
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

514
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:43,318
Never mind.

515
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,328
Maraschino cherries?

516
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:02,091
What's going on here?

517
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:05,929
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

518
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:09,600
It's not my fault. l didn't invite 'em.

519
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:12,186
Come on, girls, break it up.

520
00:43:12,312 --> 00:43:16,150
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

521
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:19,612
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

522
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,781
Get out.

523
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,702
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

524
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,082
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

525
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:32,753
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

526
00:43:32,836 --> 00:43:35,465
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

527
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:38,802
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

528
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,974
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

529
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:52,026
Put it here.

530
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:54,529
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

531
00:43:54,738 --> 00:43:56,407
You'd better keep a lookout.

532
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:58,618
lf Bienstock catches you again...

533
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,912
What's the matter with you, anyway?

534
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:02,998
I'm not very bright, l guess.

535
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,376
l wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

536
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:10,382
No, just dumb. lf l had any brains, l
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

537
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:12,384
Well, why'd you take this job?

538
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:15,305
l used to sing with male bands,
but l can't afford it any more.

539
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,891
Have you ever been with a male band?

540
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:19,476
Who, me?

541
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,145
That's what I'm running away from.

542
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:24,900
l worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

543
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:26,985
- Rough?
- I'll say.

544
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:30,114
- You can't trust those guys.
- l can't trust myself.

545
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:32,826
l have this thing about saxophone players.

546
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:34,912
Especially tenor sax.

547
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:40,418
- Really?
- l don't know why, but they curdle me.

548
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:44,089
All they have to do is play eight bars of
''Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby''

549
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,053
and l get goose-pimply all over,
and l come to 'em.

550
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,431
- That so?
- Every time.

551
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,310
You know, l play tenor sax.

552
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:58,357
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why l joined this band.

553
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:02,737
Safety first. Anyzhing
to get away from those bums.

554
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:06,074
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

555
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,203
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

556
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:11,831
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

557
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:15,169
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

558
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:16,712
You don't say.

559
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:20,175
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

560
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:24,972
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

561
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:29,561
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

562
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,856
It's the same thing all over again.

563
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:35,694
You see what l mean? Not very bright.

564
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,988
Brains aren't everyzhing.

565
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,285
l can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again - ever.

566
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:45,414
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

567
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:49,586
lce. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

568
00:45:49,669 --> 00:45:52,506
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

569
00:45:53,841 --> 00:45:57,095
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

570
00:45:57,178 --> 00:45:59,890
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

571
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:01,684
- About what?
- The future.

572
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:05,230
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

573
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:08,650
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

574
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:11,153
They all go south for the winter, like birds.

575
00:46:11,362 --> 00:46:14,616
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- l don't care how rich he is.

576
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,871
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

577
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:22,125
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

578
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:26,088
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

579
00:46:26,172 --> 00:46:28,883
- l want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

580
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:32,971
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

581
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:36,309
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

582
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:39,104
They get those weak eyes from reading.

583
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:43,818
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

584
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:47,656
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

585
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:50,701
Hot-diggety-dog.

586
00:46:50,785 --> 00:46:53,288
Well, happy days.

587
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:59,045
l hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

588
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:02,883
So the one-legged jockey said...

589
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:05,094
What did he say?

590
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:10,809
So the one-legged jockey said: ''Don't
worry about me, baby. l ride side-saddle.''

591
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:20,321
I'm terribly sorry. l seem to have hiccups.

592
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,824
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

593
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,993
l think... Ow. You dropped it.

594
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,787
Oh, that's cold.

595
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:30,625
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

596
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:36,882
Help. Please. Help. Help.

597
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:38,342
Josephine.

598
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:42,014
Please stop that. Stop that.

599
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:54,737
- What happened?
- Search me.

600
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,823
l mean, I'll see.

601
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:09,756
All right, what's goin' on around here?

602
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:11,841
Bienstock!

603
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,845
Are we in Florida?

604
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,485
Sugar?

605
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:03,988
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

606
00:49:04,197 --> 00:49:06,574
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

607
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,994
Isn't she a sweetheart?

608
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,212
How do you do?

609
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:21,593
Zowie!

610
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:25,264
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

611
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:27,350
l bet there isn't one under 75.

612
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:30,770
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

613
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:33,607
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

614
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:35,276
Yes.

615
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,331
Pardon me, miss.

616
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,085
- May l?
- Help yourself.

617
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:53,006
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

618
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,175
I'm Cinderella the Second.

619
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,889
lf there's one thing l admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

620
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:02,601
Me, too. Bye-bye.

621
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,230
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

622
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:08,858
Aren't you a sweetheart.

623
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:16,868
lt certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

624
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:18,453
Personally, I'm type O.

625
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,248
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

626
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:22,834
ls that so?

627
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:26,254
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

628
00:50:26,379 --> 00:50:29,175
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

629
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:32,220
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

630
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:34,306
Mama is keeping score.

631
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:37,226
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- l wouldn't wonder.

632
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:41,189
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

633
00:50:41,273 --> 00:50:46,070
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

634
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:51,410
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

635
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:55,790
lf l promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

636
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:59,002
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

637
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:01,714
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

638
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,299
Oh, fascinating.

639
00:51:03,383 --> 00:51:05,677
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

640
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,849
Most of the time, l slap it.

641
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:12,477
You must be quite a girl.

642
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,354
Wanna bet?

643
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:18,317
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

644
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:21,863
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

645
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:23,407
Zowie!

646
00:51:23,532 --> 00:51:25,618
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

647
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:27,912
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

648
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:32,293
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

649
00:51:32,376 --> 00:51:35,422
- This is where l get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

650
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,591
You don't get off that easy.

651
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:40,302
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

652
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,931
And keep your eyes on the road.

653
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,237
What kind of a girl
do you think l am, Mr Fielding?

654
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,826
- Oh, please. lt won't happen again.
- I'll say.

655
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,538
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

656
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,707
Please, miss...

657
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:08,795
Zowie!

658
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:11,924
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

659
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,844
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

660
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:18,057
Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.

661
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:21,728
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

662
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:24,022
Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.

663
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:27,151
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

664
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,654
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

665
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:31,406
Rosella and Emily in 41 5...

666
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,660
- l wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do l.

667
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:38,415
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

668
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:44,046
414... That's the same room number
l had in Cincinnati,

669
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:46,341
my last time around with a male band.

670
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,302
What a heel he was.

671
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:52,181
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was l ever crazy about him.

672
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:55,185
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

673
00:52:55,393 --> 00:52:58,105
They were out of potato salad,
so l brought coleslaw.

674
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,985
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

675
00:53:02,068 --> 00:53:04,780
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

676
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:08,326
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

677
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:18,547
Oh. Are these your bags?

678
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:22,927
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

679
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:27,516
- l suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

680
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:32,730
After all, you work here and l work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.

681
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:35,150
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

682
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,154
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

683
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:41,491
I'm workin' the night shift and
l got a bottle of gin stashed away.

684
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,162
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

685
00:53:45,246 --> 00:53:49,125
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?

686
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,966
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way l like 'em - big and sassy.

687
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,095
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

688
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:14,990
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

689
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:18,327
- l got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

690
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:19,996
I'm not even pretty.

691
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,376
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

692
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,297
I'm sick of being the flag.
l wanna be a bull again.

693
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,382
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

694
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:32,928
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

695
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:36,683
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

696
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:42,106
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

697
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,527
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

698
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:48,447
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

699
00:54:48,572 --> 00:54:50,533
But how long can we keep this up?

700
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:53,161
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

701
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,791
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

702
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:59,210
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

703
00:54:59,419 --> 00:55:01,588
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

704
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:04,216
l know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

705
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,220
- Me, after Sugar?
- l saw the both of you in that bus.

706
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:11,308
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

707
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,020
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

708
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,858
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

709
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:20,570
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

710
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:23,907
Are you decent?

711
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,582
Come in.

712
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,461
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

713
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:36,213
lt has all my resort clothes.

714
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,842
- No, we haven't.
- l can't understand it.

715
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:41,637
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

716
00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:43,723
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

717
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:48,437
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

718
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,400
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

719
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:55,320
You haven't got a bathing suit.

720
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:57,281
l don't have one either.

721
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,369
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

722
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:04,998
- How about you, Josephine?
- l think I'll soak in a hot tub.

723
00:56:05,124 --> 00:56:09,295
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

724
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:12,716
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

725
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:18,264
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

726
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:24,178
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:57:24,386 --> 00:57:27,306
Just a little trick
l picked up in the elevator.

728
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,519
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

729
00:58:00,764 --> 00:58:03,809
Daphne. l had no idea
you were such a big girl.

730
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:06,604
You should've seen me
before l went on a diet.

731
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:08,815
l mean your shoulders and your arms.

732
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:11,193
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

733
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:13,821
- There's one thing l envy you for.
- What's that?

734
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,991
You're so flat-chested.

735
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:19,036
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

736
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,122
Watch out, Daphne.

737
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,833
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

738
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,046
Junior, time for your nap.

739
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,465
No. l wanna play.

740
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,843
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

741
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:34,763
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

742
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:37,058
Mommy!

743
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:38,518
Here we go.

744
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:41,647
l like coffee, l like tea.

745
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:45,526
How many boys are stuck on me?

746
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:48,864
One, two, three,

747
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:52,285
four, five, six, seven...

748
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:01,254
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

749
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:03,757
- l don't think so.
- l wish you'd make sure.

750
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:05,968
Because when people find out who l am,

751
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:10,974
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

752
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:14,603
- l won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

753
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:18,984
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

754
00:59:21,403 --> 00:59:22,863
Sugar!

755
00:59:23,364 --> 00:59:25,241
Come on.

756
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,618
Honestly.

757
00:59:27,953 --> 00:59:29,747
Cheerio.

758
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:37,673
- Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

759
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:40,259
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

760
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:42,470
Your face is familiar.

761
00:59:42,554 --> 00:59:45,182
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

762
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:48,102
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

763
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:51,857
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

764
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:53,108
Of what?

765
00:59:53,317 --> 00:59:57,363
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

766
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:59,574
You own a yacht?

767
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:02,495
Which one is it? The big one?

768
01:00:03,204 --> 01:00:04,247
Certainly not.

769
01:00:04,455 --> 01:00:09,169
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2.

770
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:11,255
l quite agree.

771
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:13,550
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

772
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:16,345
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

773
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:19,682
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

774
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:21,893
No, my cocktail steward.

775
01:00:21,977 --> 01:00:24,396
Look, if you're interested in
whether l am married or not...

776
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:27,400
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

777
01:00:28,026 --> 01:00:30,737
That's very interesting.

778
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:36,286
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

779
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,081
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

780
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:41,292
Could be. You play the market?

781
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:44,629
- No, the ukulele. And l sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

782
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:46,798
We are appearing at the hotel.

783
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:49,093
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

784
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:53,390
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

785
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:55,684
We're just doing this for a lark.

786
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,482
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

787
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:03,277
Yeah. Real hot.

788
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:06,948
l guess some like it hot.
l personally prefer classical music.

789
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:08,700
l do, too.

790
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:14,040
As a matter of fact, l spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

791
01:01:14,123 --> 01:01:18,003
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

792
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:21,549
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

793
01:01:21,632 --> 01:01:23,426
But l don't care. lt was such a bore.

794
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,929
- Coming-out parties.
- lnauguration balls.

795
01:01:26,013 --> 01:01:28,015
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

796
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:31,019
And always the same 400.

797
01:01:31,227 --> 01:01:33,939
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

798
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:37,068
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

799
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,947
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

800
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,491
l beg your pardon?

801
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,203
You see, l have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

802
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,665
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when l know you better.

803
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:51,460
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

804
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:54,589
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

805
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:57,634
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

806
01:01:57,718 --> 01:02:01,180
l only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

807
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:04,100
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

808
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:07,229
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

809
01:02:07,438 --> 01:02:09,941
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

810
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:12,527
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

811
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:18,701
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

812
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,996
Sugar!

813
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:22,539
Time to change for dinner.

814
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:26,002
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

815
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:39,143
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

816
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:41,104
Happens to me all the time.

817
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:44,566
l recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

818
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:48,112
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

819
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:50,824
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

820
01:02:50,907 --> 01:02:52,784
His yacht?

821
01:02:52,993 --> 01:02:56,456
lt sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

822
01:02:57,081 --> 01:02:58,208
I'm a what?

823
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:00,419
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

824
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:05,425
l heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

825
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,302
She squealed on her roommate

826
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:10,639
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

827
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:15,854
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

828
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:17,940
Well, l think I'd better be going.

829
01:03:18,149 --> 01:03:20,234
lt was delightful meeting you both.

830
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:23,447
- You will come and hear us play?
- lf it's at all possible.

831
01:03:23,572 --> 01:03:25,866
Do come. lt'll be such fun.

832
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,995
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

833
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:39,299
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. l saw him first.

834
01:03:39,508 --> 01:03:44,305
Sugar, a little advice. lf l were a girl,
and l am, I'd watch my step.

835
01:03:44,514 --> 01:03:47,351
lf I'd been watching my step,
l never would have met him.

836
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:51,314
- l can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

837
01:03:51,397 --> 01:03:54,109
l can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

838
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,820
Neither can l.
Let's go tell her right now.

839
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:59,449
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

840
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:09,961
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

841
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:13,716
- l guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

842
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:15,802
l can't imagine where she'd be.

843
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,013
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

844
01:04:18,096 --> 01:04:20,307
l have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

845
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:24,688
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

846
01:04:24,771 --> 01:04:27,816
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

847
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:32,614
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

848
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,176
- Josephine.
- Oh. l didn't hear you come in.

849
01:04:56,059 --> 01:05:00,773
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

850
01:05:00,982 --> 01:05:02,525
- What?
- Guess.

851
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:06,905
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

852
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:09,951
- l met one of them.
- One of whom?

853
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:13,997
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

854
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:15,583
You don't say.

855
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,543
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

856
01:05:17,752 --> 01:05:19,754
Daphne.

857
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:21,924
Go on. Tell me all about him.

858
01:05:22,049 --> 01:05:25,178
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

859
01:05:25,386 --> 01:05:29,975
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

860
01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:32,478
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

861
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:36,733
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

862
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:39,361
Shells? Whatever for?

863
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:42,699
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

864
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,451
Daphne, you're bothering us.

865
01:05:44,576 --> 01:05:47,288
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- l am?

866
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:49,582
He said he'd come
to hear us play - maybe.

867
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:54,254
What do you mean, maybe? l saw the way
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

868
01:05:54,463 --> 01:05:55,840
l hope so.

869
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:59,594
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

870
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:03,349
Sugar. ls Sugar in here?

871
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:07,604
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

872
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:10,232
See you on the bandstand, girls.

873
01:06:13,987 --> 01:06:17,616
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

874
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,913
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.

875
01:06:21,996 --> 01:06:24,207
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

876
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:28,171
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

877
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,514
I'm not afraid of you.

878
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:40,143
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

879
01:06:40,352 --> 01:06:44,315
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

880
01:06:44,524 --> 01:06:49,238
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
lt was all a joke. l didn't mean any harm.

881
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:52,450
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

882
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:54,953
Answer the tele...phone.

883
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,919
Hello?

884
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,339
Yes, this is 41 3.

885
01:07:04,548 --> 01:07:08,011
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

886
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:10,806
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

887
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:13,225
You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?

888
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:16,020
You slapped my face?

889
01:07:17,272 --> 01:07:19,983
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

890
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:22,403
Daphne can't talk right now. ls it urgent?

891
01:07:22,486 --> 01:07:25,115
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

892
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:29,578
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

893
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:32,916
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

894
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:36,670
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

895
01:07:36,795 --> 01:07:41,384
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

896
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:46,682
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

897
01:07:48,143 --> 01:07:51,814
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

898
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:55,985
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

899
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:58,572
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

900
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,369
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

901
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:07,875
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

902
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,881
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

903
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,467
Pushover for who? What...

904
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,678
Yes, Mr Fielding.

905
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:21,641
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

906
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:23,602
What's that you said?

907
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:28,316
- ''Zowie.'' I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

908
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,571
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

909
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:36,451
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

910
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:38,954
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

911
01:08:39,163 --> 01:08:40,831
Of course you're not.

912
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:42,917
I'm going.

913
01:08:43,626 --> 01:08:46,547
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

914
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:48,841
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

915
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,886
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

916
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,639
- With me?
- That's right.

917
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:56,684
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

918
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,738
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

919
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:17,907
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

920
01:10:18,116 --> 01:10:21,161
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

921
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:27,210
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

922
01:10:37,097 --> 01:10:39,726
Why do l let you talk me
into these things? Why?

923
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:42,646
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

924
01:10:42,729 --> 01:10:46,609
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am l gonna keep him ashore?

925
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:49,613
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

926
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:54,118
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

927
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,210
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

928
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:02,962
Bull fiddle.

929
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:05,382
From satchel mouth at table seven.

930
01:11:10,471 --> 01:11:14,142
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

931
01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:17,897
Never mind leaving your door open.
l got a passkey.

932
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:27,700
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

933
01:11:57,403 --> 01:12:00,657
l guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

934
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,495
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

935
01:12:04,704 --> 01:12:06,497
These came for you.

936
01:12:06,706 --> 01:12:08,458
For me?

937
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:11,504
It's Shell Oil.

938
01:12:11,712 --> 01:12:13,798
- No!
- Yes!

939
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:16,092
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

940
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:17,970
He's picking me up at the pier.

941
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:19,513
- No!
- Yes.

942
01:12:19,722 --> 01:12:21,516
You heard her - yes.

943
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:26,105
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

944
01:12:26,313 --> 01:12:28,065
on a millionaire's yacht.

945
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:30,902
lf my mother could only see me now.

946
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:35,574
l hope my mother never finds out.

947
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:40,372
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

948
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:45,920
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

949
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,715
And l intend to keep it that way.

950
01:12:54,973 --> 01:12:57,059
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

951
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:30,005
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

952
01:14:30,088 --> 01:14:32,508
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

953
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:35,011
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

954
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,311
Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.

955
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,397
Who?

956
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,483
About the roadhouse?

957
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:48,861
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

958
01:14:48,986 --> 01:14:53,033
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

959
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:55,244
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

960
01:14:55,327 --> 01:14:57,330
You're dynamite.

961
01:14:57,538 --> 01:15:00,333
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

962
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:55,108
Ahoy, there.

963
01:15:56,234 --> 01:15:58,445
Ahoy.

964
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,083
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

965
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:13,130
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

966
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:18,052
l wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.

967
01:16:18,261 --> 01:16:20,222
It's the thought that counts.

968
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:29,400
l seem to be out of gas.

969
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:33,488
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
l mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.

970
01:16:33,696 --> 01:16:35,782
Oops. There.

971
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:42,958
lt seems to be stuck in reverse.

972
01:16:44,418 --> 01:16:47,964
l just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model.

973
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,258
lt seems like they're on the wrong track.

974
01:16:50,383 --> 01:16:53,095
Do you mind riding backwards?
lt may take a little longer.

975
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:56,641
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

976
01:17:22,923 --> 01:17:25,009
lt looked so small from the beach.

977
01:17:25,092 --> 01:17:28,346
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

978
01:17:28,555 --> 01:17:33,352
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

979
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:36,689
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

980
01:17:36,773 --> 01:17:40,736
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

981
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:43,156
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

982
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:46,076
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

983
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,248
l mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

984
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:55,045
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

985
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,883
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

986
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,683
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

987
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:11,941
And another nice thing about
this yacht - lots of closet space.

988
01:18:12,024 --> 01:18:16,404
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

989
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:21,202
ln here.

990
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:24,247
Of course. How silly of me.

991
01:18:24,331 --> 01:18:28,002
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

992
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:39,557
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

993
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,768
It's all right for a bachelor.

994
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:46,566
- What a beautiful fish.
- l caught him off Cape Hatteras.

995
01:18:47,484 --> 01:18:49,569
What is it?

996
01:18:49,695 --> 01:18:52,615
It's a member of the herring family.

997
01:18:53,324 --> 01:18:55,326
A herring?

998
01:18:55,535 --> 01:19:00,124
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

999
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,502
They shrink when they're marinated.

1000
01:19:02,627 --> 01:19:04,713
- Champagne?
- l don't mind if l do.

1001
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:07,508
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1002
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,719
Bon voyage.

1003
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:16,477
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1004
01:19:16,686 --> 01:19:20,023
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1005
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:22,234
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1006
01:19:22,443 --> 01:19:24,946
I'll say. l had two ponies
drowned under me.

1007
01:19:25,154 --> 01:19:27,115
Where's your shell collection?

1008
01:19:27,324 --> 01:19:29,743
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1009
01:19:29,952 --> 01:19:32,538
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1010
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:35,667
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1011
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:39,130
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1012
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:42,968
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1013
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:45,804
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1014
01:19:45,888 --> 01:19:48,808
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1015
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,645
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1016
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,731
It's not the icebergs.

1017
01:19:53,814 --> 01:19:57,151
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1018
01:19:57,277 --> 01:20:01,115
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1019
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:05,829
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1020
01:20:05,912 --> 01:20:08,624
- Harmless? How?
- l don't know how to put it,

1021
01:20:08,832 --> 01:20:11,043
but I've got this thing about girls.

1022
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:14,673
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1023
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:16,675
You mean, like, frigid?

1024
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:19,262
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1025
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,933
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1026
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:27,522
- Have you tried?
- Have l. I'm trying all the time.

1027
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:36,991
See? Nothing.

1028
01:20:37,117 --> 01:20:39,703
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1029
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:43,040
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1030
01:20:43,249 --> 01:20:46,169
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1031
01:20:46,294 --> 01:20:48,380
Something goes wrong inside.

1032
01:20:48,464 --> 01:20:51,509
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more.

1033
01:20:51,718 --> 01:20:54,429
l was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1034
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,558
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1035
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:00,979
- l don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1036
01:21:01,187 --> 01:21:03,190
Well...

1037
01:21:03,273 --> 01:21:05,484
lt was my freshman year at Princeton.

1038
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:07,987
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1039
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,782
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1040
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,411
She wore glasses, too.

1041
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,122
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1042
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:19,126
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1043
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:21,754
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1044
01:21:21,837 --> 01:21:25,300
l took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1045
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:27,469
l took a step toward her.

1046
01:21:27,678 --> 01:21:30,598
She took a step toward me.

1047
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:35,104
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1048
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:39,275
l gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

1049
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:42,279
But it was too late.

1050
01:21:42,404 --> 01:21:44,281
Talk about sad.

1051
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:46,451
Ever since then,

1052
01:21:46,576 --> 01:21:50,122
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1053
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,625
You poor, poor boy.

1054
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:55,628
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1055
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:57,631
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1056
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,469
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1057
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:03,680
What else is there for me?

1058
01:22:03,763 --> 01:22:07,434
- ls it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.

1059
01:22:07,518 --> 01:22:10,229
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1060
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:13,567
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1061
01:22:13,692 --> 01:22:15,861
lmported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1062
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:19,324
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1063
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:21,827
What a waste of money.

1064
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:24,330
Have you ever tried American girls?

1065
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:26,207
Why?

1066
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:34,008
Was that anyzhing?

1067
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:37,137
Thanks just the same.

1068
01:22:37,888 --> 01:22:40,182
You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

1069
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:44,980
l have. l spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1070
01:22:46,106 --> 01:22:50,820
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1071
01:22:50,904 --> 01:22:53,407
lf l wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1072
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:56,869
Don't say that.

1073
01:22:57,078 --> 01:22:59,790
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1074
01:22:59,873 --> 01:23:04,170
lf l ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1075
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,008
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it?

1076
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:12,096
l may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1077
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:14,891
but could l take another crack at it?

1078
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:18,229
All right, if you insist.

1079
01:23:31,161 --> 01:23:35,333
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1080
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:38,879
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1081
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:45,136
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1082
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:49,934
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1083
01:23:50,142 --> 01:23:52,353
l think the light switch is over there.

1084
01:23:58,069 --> 01:24:00,154
That's the radio.

1085
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,825
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1086
01:24:39,994 --> 01:24:42,623
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1087
01:24:42,706 --> 01:24:45,543
Don't fight it.

1088
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:48,129
Relax.

1089
01:25:01,479 --> 01:25:03,690
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1090
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,859
So inhale.

1091
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:30,389
Daphne,

1092
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:32,892
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

1093
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:48,744
Well?

1094
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:52,374
I'm not quite sure.

1095
01:25:52,499 --> 01:25:54,877
Would you try it again?

1096
01:26:05,098 --> 01:26:08,351
l got a funny sensation in my toes.

1097
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:12,398
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1098
01:26:13,858 --> 01:26:16,570
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1099
01:26:26,165 --> 01:26:28,793
l think you're on the right track.

1100
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:33,048
l must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1101
01:26:57,786 --> 01:27:00,289
l never knew it could be like this.

1102
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,710
Thank you.

1103
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:07,048
They told me l was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1104
01:27:07,173 --> 01:27:10,927
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1105
01:27:13,514 --> 01:27:15,933
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1106
01:27:16,017 --> 01:27:19,479
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1107
01:27:19,563 --> 01:27:22,900
l used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1108
01:27:32,704 --> 01:27:37,710
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1109
01:28:42,997 --> 01:28:44,457
Whoops.

1110
01:29:12,325 --> 01:29:15,328
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1111
01:29:15,453 --> 01:29:17,539
How much do l owe the Milk Fund so far?

1112
01:29:17,748 --> 01:29:20,251
$850,000.

1113
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:23,046
Let's make it an even million.

1114
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:46,408
l forgot to give you a receipt.

1115
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:30,002
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?

1116
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:32,839
Have l got things to tell you.

1117
01:30:32,922 --> 01:30:36,385
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1118
01:30:36,468 --> 01:30:39,931
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1119
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:41,683
l am.

1120
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,732
What?

1121
01:30:47,857 --> 01:30:51,194
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1122
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:56,701
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1123
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,624
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1124
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:04,419
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

1125
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:08,090
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1126
01:31:08,173 --> 01:31:10,176
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

1127
01:31:10,384 --> 01:31:12,262
Security.

1128
01:31:13,388 --> 01:31:16,850
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

1129
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:20,188
- I'm not stupid. l know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1130
01:31:20,396 --> 01:31:24,985
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because l don't smoke.

1131
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:31,452
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1132
01:31:31,535 --> 01:31:35,498
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1133
01:31:35,707 --> 01:31:39,795
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but l kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1134
01:31:43,424 --> 01:31:46,678
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1135
01:31:46,887 --> 01:31:50,725
l don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

1136
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,562
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1137
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:57,108
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1138
01:31:57,316 --> 01:32:00,445
and l keep gettin' those
alimony cheques every month.

1139
01:32:04,825 --> 01:32:06,911
Jerry, listen to me.

1140
01:32:06,995 --> 01:32:10,332
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1141
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:14,212
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1142
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:18,383
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1143
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:22,347
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1144
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:25,684
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1145
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:29,230
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1146
01:32:29,438 --> 01:32:33,193
l wish l were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am l a boy.

1147
01:32:33,276 --> 01:32:35,696
What about my engagement present?

1148
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:39,242
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1149
01:32:40,994 --> 01:32:42,663
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1150
01:32:42,788 --> 01:32:45,500
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?

1151
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:50,172
- l guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1152
01:32:50,297 --> 01:32:53,843
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1153
01:32:56,847 --> 01:32:59,475
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1154
01:33:06,859 --> 01:33:07,693
Come in.

1155
01:33:08,945 --> 01:33:13,534
l thought l heard voices. l had to talk to
somebody. l don't feel like going to sleep.

1156
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:17,497
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1157
01:33:18,248 --> 01:33:21,794
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1158
01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:25,006
lt was suicidally beautiful.

1159
01:33:25,214 --> 01:33:26,383
Did he get fresh?

1160
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:29,929
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1161
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:32,306
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1162
01:33:32,515 --> 01:33:35,227
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1163
01:33:35,352 --> 01:33:38,898
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1164
01:33:39,398 --> 01:33:41,693
Gee, l wish I'd been there.

1165
01:33:41,818 --> 01:33:44,196
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

1166
01:33:44,404 --> 01:33:46,198
l think he's going to propose.

1167
01:33:46,282 --> 01:33:49,118
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1168
01:33:49,202 --> 01:33:51,413
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1169
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:54,625
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1170
01:33:54,834 --> 01:33:56,628
That's wonderful.

1171
01:33:56,836 --> 01:33:59,005
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1172
01:33:59,131 --> 01:34:00,883
Well, Daphne has a beau, l have a beau...

1173
01:34:01,091 --> 01:34:03,719
lf we could only find somebody for you.

1174
01:34:06,097 --> 01:34:08,100
Here l am, doll.

1175
01:34:34,465 --> 01:34:37,802
''Friends of ltalian Opera'' - that's us.

1176
01:34:37,928 --> 01:34:40,222
Register over there.

1177
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:52,529
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1178
01:34:53,572 --> 01:34:55,657
Thanks.

1179
01:34:55,741 --> 01:34:57,326
Hiya, Spats.

1180
01:34:57,410 --> 01:35:00,538
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't l?

1181
01:35:00,664 --> 01:35:03,792
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1182
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:08,256
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1183
01:35:08,465 --> 01:35:10,759
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

1184
01:35:10,884 --> 01:35:14,639
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1185
01:35:19,228 --> 01:35:22,148
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1186
01:35:22,356 --> 01:35:25,277
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1187
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,571
All right, you're clean.

1188
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,866
You're not.

1189
01:35:39,961 --> 01:35:42,464
lt ain't loaded.

1190
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:53,311
Next. What's in here?

1191
01:35:53,436 --> 01:35:56,857
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1192
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,319
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1193
01:36:05,325 --> 01:36:07,828
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1194
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:12,000
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1195
01:36:12,209 --> 01:36:14,586
Come on, boys.

1196
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:17,632
Well. Spats Colombo, if l ever saw one.

1197
01:36:17,715 --> 01:36:20,010
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1198
01:36:20,218 --> 01:36:22,221
l heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

1199
01:36:22,429 --> 01:36:25,350
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

1200
01:36:25,433 --> 01:36:26,684
Big joke.

1201
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,188
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

1202
01:36:29,313 --> 01:36:32,316
- l was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1203
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:34,527
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1204
01:36:34,611 --> 01:36:37,948
- ln the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1205
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:41,619
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1206
01:36:41,703 --> 01:36:44,957
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1207
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,834
l cut myself while shaving.

1208
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:49,754
- You shave with spats on?
- l sleep with my spats on.

1209
01:36:49,838 --> 01:36:53,300
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1210
01:36:53,384 --> 01:36:54,635
You and who else?

1211
01:36:54,844 --> 01:36:58,723
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1212
01:36:58,932 --> 01:37:01,727
Boys, know anyzhing about
any garage or witnesses?

1213
01:37:01,852 --> 01:37:04,564
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1214
01:37:04,647 --> 01:37:06,942
Honest.

1215
01:37:08,402 --> 01:37:12,699
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1216
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:15,285
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.

1217
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:29,385
l feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery
from a man under false pretences.

1218
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:33,223
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1219
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:35,935
lt'll break his heart when
he finds out l can't marry him.

1220
01:37:36,144 --> 01:37:39,398
lt'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1221
01:37:39,481 --> 01:37:41,984
Can't make an omelette
without breakin' an egg.

1222
01:37:42,109 --> 01:37:44,404
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1223
01:37:44,487 --> 01:37:49,285
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

1224
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:55,334
- Joe!
- What?

1225
01:37:56,794 --> 01:38:00,465
Something tells me the omelette
is about to hit the fan.

1226
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:04,720
Come on, Daphne.

1227
01:38:09,017 --> 01:38:10,978
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1228
01:38:19,029 --> 01:38:20,906
Three, please.

1229
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,839
l don't mean to be forward,

1230
01:38:33,922 --> 01:38:37,051
but ain't l had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1231
01:38:37,176 --> 01:38:39,762
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1232
01:38:39,971 --> 01:38:43,225
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1233
01:38:43,308 --> 01:38:45,728
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1234
01:38:45,937 --> 01:38:47,188
Third floor.

1235
01:38:47,272 --> 01:38:50,400
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1236
01:38:51,568 --> 01:38:53,529
Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.

1237
01:38:53,738 --> 01:38:56,449
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1238
01:39:08,756 --> 01:39:10,758
l tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1239
01:39:10,967 --> 01:39:14,304
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1240
01:39:14,388 --> 01:39:17,642
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1241
01:39:17,725 --> 01:39:19,936
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

1242
01:39:20,145 --> 01:39:23,148
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1243
01:39:23,274 --> 01:39:25,443
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1244
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,737
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1245
01:39:31,492 --> 01:39:34,537
l tell you, l will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1246
01:39:34,746 --> 01:39:39,335
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1247
01:39:39,418 --> 01:39:42,547
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1248
01:39:42,756 --> 01:39:46,635
l figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1249
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,596
lf we get outta the hotel alive.

1250
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:51,641
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1251
01:39:51,725 --> 01:39:54,019
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1252
01:39:54,228 --> 01:39:56,230
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1253
01:39:56,314 --> 01:39:58,733
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1254
01:39:58,817 --> 01:40:01,028
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1255
01:40:01,236 --> 01:40:04,156
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

1256
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:07,702
That's when l was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1257
01:40:07,786 --> 01:40:11,248
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1258
01:40:11,332 --> 01:40:14,043
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1259
01:40:14,252 --> 01:40:15,837
Ship to shore?

1260
01:40:15,921 --> 01:40:18,340
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1261
01:40:23,346 --> 01:40:27,310
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1262
01:40:27,393 --> 01:40:29,813
l may throw up.

1263
01:40:31,356 --> 01:40:35,319
No, l didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, l never closed an eye.

1264
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:39,282
l never slept better.
l had the most wonderful dream.

1265
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:41,785
l was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1266
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:44,622
We drifted for days and days.

1267
01:40:44,831 --> 01:40:46,583
You were the captain and l was the crew.

1268
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:51,589
l kept a lookout for icebergs, l sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1269
01:40:51,714 --> 01:40:54,509
and l wiped the steam off your glasses.

1270
01:40:54,634 --> 01:40:58,597
And when l woke up, l wanted
to swim right back to you.

1271
01:40:59,432 --> 01:41:01,309
Yes...

1272
01:41:01,393 --> 01:41:03,687
Now, about our date for tonight...

1273
01:41:03,896 --> 01:41:06,732
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1274
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:10,904
I'm afraid not. l can't make it tonight.

1275
01:41:12,656 --> 01:41:15,284
Not tomorrow either. l have to leave.

1276
01:41:15,368 --> 01:41:19,122
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1277
01:41:19,331 --> 01:41:21,417
Where to?

1278
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:24,254
South America?

1279
01:41:24,963 --> 01:41:27,049
That is unexpected.

1280
01:41:27,883 --> 01:41:30,720
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1281
01:41:30,803 --> 01:41:34,891
l just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1282
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,020
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1283
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:42,067
Quite a while.

1284
01:41:42,275 --> 01:41:45,196
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1285
01:41:45,321 --> 01:41:47,407
You're not?

1286
01:41:47,824 --> 01:41:51,161
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1287
01:41:51,245 --> 01:41:56,042
lt just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1288
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:59,505
Oh. That kind of merger.

1289
01:41:59,588 --> 01:42:01,591
What is she like?

1290
01:42:01,674 --> 01:42:04,386
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1291
01:42:04,594 --> 01:42:06,388
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1292
01:42:06,471 --> 01:42:10,143
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1293
01:42:10,351 --> 01:42:13,897
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1294
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:17,860
Of course. l understand.
At least, l think l do.

1295
01:42:17,944 --> 01:42:23,909
l knew you would. l only wish there
was something l could do for you.

1296
01:42:23,993 --> 01:42:27,539
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1297
01:42:27,747 --> 01:42:29,625
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1298
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:32,962
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1299
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,173
Smart move.

1300
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:38,302
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1301
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,805
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1302
01:42:41,013 --> 01:42:45,185
The fog finally lifted over Long lsland
and they flew them down this morning.

1303
01:42:45,268 --> 01:42:49,023
That's strange. l sent 'em to your room.

1304
01:42:50,817 --> 01:42:53,111
They should have been delivered by now.

1305
01:42:56,866 --> 01:43:00,412
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1306
01:43:06,336 --> 01:43:09,172
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1307
01:43:09,256 --> 01:43:12,301
l haven't had white orchids
since l was a debutante.

1308
01:43:14,262 --> 01:43:16,264
What's this?

1309
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:18,851
What's what?

1310
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:21,688
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1311
01:43:22,522 --> 01:43:25,442
Real diamonds.

1312
01:43:25,526 --> 01:43:30,031
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1313
01:43:31,491 --> 01:43:32,951
Not always.

1314
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,080
l wanted you to know how grateful
l am for what you did for me.

1315
01:43:36,164 --> 01:43:39,501
l didn't do anyzhing. lt just happened.

1316
01:43:42,213 --> 01:43:45,049
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1317
01:43:45,258 --> 01:43:48,595
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1318
01:43:48,679 --> 01:43:51,098
lf you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1319
01:43:51,307 --> 01:43:53,268
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1320
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:55,896
Goodbye, my darling.

1321
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:59,442
l don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1322
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:02,779
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1323
01:44:05,282 --> 01:44:07,034
What happened to my bracelet?

1324
01:44:07,159 --> 01:44:11,206
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1325
01:44:11,415 --> 01:44:15,711
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

1326
01:44:15,795 --> 01:44:18,215
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1327
01:44:18,298 --> 01:44:20,926
It's on the level this time.

1328
01:44:26,975 --> 01:44:29,061
Where's that bourbon?

1329
01:44:35,193 --> 01:44:39,782
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- l don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1330
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,828
How did you get that bracelet?

1331
01:44:42,911 --> 01:44:44,788
- You like it?
- l always did.

1332
01:44:44,997 --> 01:44:49,794
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

1333
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,048
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what l call a louse.

1334
01:44:53,257 --> 01:44:56,803
lf l were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1335
01:44:56,886 --> 01:45:01,684
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.

1336
01:45:01,809 --> 01:45:04,312
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1337
01:45:05,146 --> 01:45:10,152
How can l? No matter where l go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

1338
01:45:10,236 --> 01:45:13,573
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1339
01:45:15,659 --> 01:45:18,997
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

1340
01:45:19,205 --> 01:45:22,334
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

1341
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:24,628
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1342
01:45:24,754 --> 01:45:28,800
- We'll walk. lf we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that ''we'' again.

1343
01:45:28,925 --> 01:45:32,263
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1344
01:45:41,315 --> 01:45:43,193
Your hands clean?

1345
01:45:43,318 --> 01:45:44,778
Over.

1346
01:45:44,861 --> 01:45:46,864
OK, button my spats.

1347
01:45:49,784 --> 01:45:51,870
You sure dress nice, boss.

1348
01:45:51,953 --> 01:45:55,082
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1349
01:45:55,207 --> 01:45:59,587
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1350
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:03,551
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1351
01:46:03,634 --> 01:46:07,305
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1352
01:46:07,514 --> 01:46:09,474
Like l was tellin' you fellas.

1353
01:46:09,683 --> 01:46:12,937
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.

1354
01:46:13,146 --> 01:46:15,440
Used to be like a rock.

1355
01:46:15,523 --> 01:46:20,321
- It's too bad. l think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1356
01:46:20,446 --> 01:46:22,323
How are we gonna retire him?

1357
01:46:22,407 --> 01:46:24,493
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1358
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:28,789
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1359
01:46:32,002 --> 01:46:35,548
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1360
01:46:38,051 --> 01:46:41,930
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1361
01:46:44,517 --> 01:46:47,145
Hey. Join us.

1362
01:46:47,771 --> 01:46:50,691
What's the matter with those dames?

1363
01:46:50,774 --> 01:46:53,069
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1364
01:46:55,781 --> 01:46:58,492
Same faces, same instruments.

1365
01:47:02,247 --> 01:47:05,793
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1366
01:47:05,918 --> 01:47:10,799
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1367
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:33,868
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1368
01:49:12,738 --> 01:49:13,781
What happened?

1369
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:17,327
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1370
01:49:17,536 --> 01:49:20,748
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1371
01:49:20,873 --> 01:49:24,503
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1372
01:49:24,628 --> 01:49:27,131
They can't be too far away.

1373
01:49:46,195 --> 01:49:48,281
Thank you.

1374
01:49:48,407 --> 01:49:50,701
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1375
01:49:52,036 --> 01:49:56,124
It's been ten years since l elected myself
president of this organisation,

1376
01:49:56,208 --> 01:50:00,296
and, if l say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1377
01:50:02,048 --> 01:50:05,803
Let's look at the record.
ln the last fiscal year,

1378
01:50:05,928 --> 01:50:10,099
we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.

1379
01:50:10,183 --> 01:50:13,228
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1380
01:50:14,355 --> 01:50:18,735
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1381
01:50:20,612 --> 01:50:22,823
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1382
01:50:23,032 --> 01:50:27,412
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1383
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:32,210
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1384
01:50:36,673 --> 01:50:38,759
You too, Spats.

1385
01:50:38,968 --> 01:50:40,970
Up.

1386
01:50:50,565 --> 01:50:52,234
Easy, now.

1387
01:50:52,442 --> 01:50:55,655
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1388
01:50:55,863 --> 01:50:59,952
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

1389
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:02,037
OK.

1390
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:10,172
And don't mess up the cake. l promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1391
01:51:17,681 --> 01:51:19,976
Now, fellow delegates,

1392
01:51:20,059 --> 01:51:23,730
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1393
01:51:23,814 --> 01:51:26,651
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

1394
01:51:26,734 --> 01:51:28,736
No!

1395
01:51:31,114 --> 01:51:34,452
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1396
01:51:34,577 --> 01:51:37,706
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1397
01:51:37,914 --> 01:51:41,126
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1398
01:51:41,335 --> 01:51:43,421
South Side Chapter.

1399
01:51:45,715 --> 01:51:51,264
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1400
01:51:51,347 --> 01:51:55,102
But l say he's a man who'll go far.

1401
01:51:55,227 --> 01:51:59,399
Some people say he's gone too far.

1402
01:51:59,482 --> 01:52:03,153
But l say,
you can't keep a good man down.

1403
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,491
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1404
01:52:06,574 --> 01:52:09,202
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

1405
01:52:09,286 --> 01:52:12,623
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1406
01:52:12,748 --> 01:52:18,589
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1407
01:52:18,672 --> 01:52:21,717
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1408
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:24,012
l almost caught up with them today.

1409
01:52:24,095 --> 01:52:28,184
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

1410
01:52:28,267 --> 01:52:31,521
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

1411
01:52:31,604 --> 01:52:35,776
But l say: to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1412
01:52:35,985 --> 01:52:38,279
And just to show you
what l think of you, Spats,

1413
01:52:38,488 --> 01:52:40,907
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1414
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,077
So we baked you a little cake.

1415
01:52:43,911 --> 01:52:45,788
My birthday?

1416
01:52:45,997 --> 01:52:48,416
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1417
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,380
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1418
01:52:52,463 --> 01:52:54,883
All right, boys. Now all together.

1419
01:52:55,091 --> 01:52:57,386
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1420
01:52:57,678 --> 01:52:59,889
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1421
01:53:00,097 --> 01:53:03,852
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1422
01:53:03,935 --> 01:53:06,438
Which nobody can deny.

1423
01:53:06,647 --> 01:53:08,524
Which nobody can deny.

1424
01:53:08,733 --> 01:53:11,361
Which nobody can deny.

1425
01:53:11,569 --> 01:53:13,947
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1426
01:53:14,073 --> 01:53:16,158
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1427
01:53:16,367 --> 01:53:19,579
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1428
01:53:20,205 --> 01:53:23,334
Which nobody can deny.

1429
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:40,772
Big joke.

1430
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:49,741
Let's get outta here.

1431
01:53:52,661 --> 01:53:55,164
Get those two guys.

1432
01:54:02,047 --> 01:54:03,799
What happened here?

1433
01:54:03,925 --> 01:54:08,180
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1434
01:54:09,431 --> 01:54:13,812
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till l get the recipe.

1435
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:16,523
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1436
01:54:21,029 --> 01:54:22,906
Yeah.

1437
01:54:50,231 --> 01:54:52,108
They slipped through our hands.

1438
01:54:52,191 --> 01:54:56,280
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

1439
01:54:56,488 --> 01:54:59,409
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1440
01:54:59,492 --> 01:55:02,537
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll l tell him?

1441
01:55:02,621 --> 01:55:05,332
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1442
01:55:05,458 --> 01:55:07,961
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1443
01:55:08,044 --> 01:55:11,924
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1444
01:57:14,155 --> 01:57:15,699
Josephine.

1445
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,871
Bienstock!

1446
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,791
Hey. That's no dame.

1447
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:25,502
None of that, Sugar.

1448
01:57:25,628 --> 01:57:27,713
No guy is worth it.

1449
01:57:30,926 --> 01:57:32,928
Grab her.

1450
01:57:36,683 --> 01:57:38,643
Josephine?

1451
01:57:43,983 --> 01:57:47,529
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1452
01:58:38,299 --> 01:58:39,676
Hi.

1453
01:58:39,759 --> 01:58:42,387
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1454
01:58:42,471 --> 01:58:44,557
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1455
01:58:44,682 --> 01:58:46,559
She's so eager.

1456
01:59:00,618 --> 01:59:02,620
Wait for Sugar!

1457
01:59:08,043 --> 01:59:10,338
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1458
01:59:10,546 --> 01:59:13,759
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- l told you, I'm not very bright.

1459
01:59:13,884 --> 01:59:15,970
Let's go.

1460
01:59:18,973 --> 01:59:20,559
You don't want me, Sugar.

1461
01:59:20,767 --> 01:59:23,270
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.

1462
01:59:23,354 --> 01:59:25,773
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1463
01:59:25,857 --> 01:59:27,317
l know. Every time.

1464
01:59:27,525 --> 01:59:30,571
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.

1465
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:32,323
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1466
01:59:32,448 --> 01:59:36,411
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1467
01:59:36,495 --> 01:59:39,623
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

1468
01:59:44,212 --> 01:59:46,632
l called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1469
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:49,844
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1470
01:59:50,053 --> 01:59:53,098
Osgood, l can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1471
01:59:54,349 --> 01:59:57,687
She and l, we are not built the same way.

1472
01:59:57,895 --> 02:00:00,482
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1473
02:00:01,525 --> 02:00:04,987
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1474
02:00:05,196 --> 02:00:06,531
Why not?

1475
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:08,116
Well...

1476
02:00:08,325 --> 02:00:10,828
ln the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

1477
02:00:10,911 --> 02:00:12,580
Doesn't matter.

1478
02:00:12,705 --> 02:00:15,083
l smoke. l smoke all the time.

1479
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:16,877
l don't care.

1480
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:21,257
l have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1481
02:00:21,341 --> 02:00:23,343
l forgive you.

1482
02:00:24,887 --> 02:00:27,723
l can never have children.

1483
02:00:27,807 --> 02:00:31,269
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1484
02:00:33,355 --> 02:00:35,524
- I'm a man.
- Well,

1485
02:00:35,733 --> 02:00:38,153
nobody's perfect.
