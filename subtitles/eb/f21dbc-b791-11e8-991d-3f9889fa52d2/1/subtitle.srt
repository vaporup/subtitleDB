1
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:13,669
Radar Control,
this is Prison Transport 9961

2
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,428
requesting permission to land.
Over. 

3
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:18,707
We've been expecting you,
PT 9961.

4
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:19,667
Please confirm payload.
Over. 

5
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,707
Crite prisoners...
eight of them. Over.

6
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:24,706
There seems to be
a problem, PT 9961.

7
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:27,025
My advance notice cube
states there should be

8
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,584
10 Crite prisoners aboard your ship.
Please explain. Over.

9
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:32,304
We did have 10
at one time,

10
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,543
but the Crites were
eating everything in sight.

11
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:37,503
We had to kill two of them
to make the food last longer. Over.

12
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:39,622
Roger, PT 9961. 

13
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:42,101
You're cleared for landing
in docking bay B.

14
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,781
Send Crite prisoners
through detox and immunization.

15
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,740
Put them in the termination lock
as soon as you land.

16
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,620
Shock control will be
standing by. Over.

17
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,179
Roger, Radar Control.

18
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:04,096
This is Warden Zanti.

19
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,655
Get Shock Control over
to the termination lock.

20
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:08,415
The Crites are
up to something.

21
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,052
Explosion in termination lock.

22
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,812
Damage report.

23
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:20,892
Two dead
and three wounded, sir.

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,011
- Escapes?
- The Crites. All eight of them.

25
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,571
The Crites have stolen a ship!

26
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:34,488
Damn.

27
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,127
Get the bounty hunters.

28
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a job for you.

29
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:17,078
They've stolen
one of our fastest ships,

30
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:20,557
with enough fuel to cross
the galaxy 10 times over.

31
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,556
So fuel is
not their concern.

32
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,915
However, you must stop them
before they can feed.

33
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,714
You will receive
full payment, as usual,

34
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,514
only upon evidence
of their destruction.

35
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:18,662
CRITTERS
sincronizados por astalamina baby!

36
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,690
Brad, April, breakfast!

37
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:14,728
Brad, I need
to get in there!

38
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:18,967
Come on, you little snot,
I'm in a hurry!

39
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,766
Mom, Brad won't let me
in the bathroom!

40
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,845
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.

41
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:29,764
April, telephone!

42
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:33,203
Brad, you're
a real jerk!

43
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,802
Mom, Brad's hogging
the bathroom.

44
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:39,962
Two minutes.

45
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,961
Hello?

46
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,041
Oh, hi.

47
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Jay, breakfast!

48
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,239
Helen, was that
Charlie calling?

49
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,838
No, it was Steve.

50
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,638
Steve?

51
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:07,035
Yeah?

52
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,835
Happy birthday!

53
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,634
Yeah?

54
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:14,713
What'd you get?

55
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,272
- No!
- Hey.

56
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:19,312
Steve who?

57
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:22,071
The new boy at school.

58
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,271
Whatever happened
to what's-his-name?

59
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,030
- Richard?
- I'm a terrible guesser.

60
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,950
Yeah, Richard.

61
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,269
I thought he was
the love of her life.

62
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,029
Try and keep up,
will ya?

63
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,748
You got to keep me informed.
Did you wash my bowling shirt?

64
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,987
Yes, it'll be ready
for the tournament. Go eat.

65
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,067
Brad, get Chewie
off the table.

66
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,746
I can't wait!

67
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,865
Have you seen
Charlie this morning, Brad?

68
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,224
Bye.

69
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:53,663
Thanks.

70
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,663
So who is this Steve?

71
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,222
The dork from New York.

72
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,302
Shut up.
You're such a baby.

73
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,701
What happened
to Richard?

74
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:04,061
All Richard cared about
was hog farms.

75
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,580
So?
My Dad farmed hogs.

76
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,740
Dad!

77
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,779
Brad, what are you
sitting at the table

78
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,779
with a thermometer
in your mouth for?

79
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:14,778
I'm not feeling
very good.

80
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:16,458
I'll bet.

81
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:20,257
- You look okay.
- 106?

82
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,416
Did you tell Mom about your
big geometry test you have today?

83
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:24,376
Shut up.
Just shut up!

84
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:25,895
You have
a test today, Brad?

85
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,255
- You're a real shithead.
- Bradley!

86
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,614
Boy, I'm going
to wash your mouth out.

87
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:34,893
Maybe you'll do as well on this
as you did on your last one.

88
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,972
What last test?

89
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:40,851
Bye.
Mmmmm.

90
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:41,971
Brad!

91
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,290
Come on, April,
we're running late!

92
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,850
Get yourself ready
for school, boy.

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,810
Dad.

94
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,649
You miss that bus
I'm going to skin you

95
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,249
and hang your bones
out to dry.

96
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,487
"Thank you for the lovely breakfast
you prepared, Mother."

97
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,447
Wonder what happened
to Charlie?

98
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,764
Morning, Harv.

99
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:12,603
Morning, Sal.
What's happening?

100
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:16,443
This here says
that John Travolta

101
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,722
used to be a waitress
in Fort Myers, Florida.

102
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:22,321
What's happening
here, Sal?

103
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,280
Big bowling tournament
tonight.

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440
And Charlie, he's sleeping
it off in the back.

105
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,119
Be nice, Harv.
He don't mean no harm.

106
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,116
They're coming!

107
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,232
They're coming, Harv.

108
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,911
Yeah. I'm getting them through
my fillings, just like last time.

109
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:04,710
Cut the crap, Charlie.

110
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,150
Listen.

111
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,870
Jeez.

112
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,868
They're the same ones
that ruined my pitching career.

113
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:17,427
You ever consider slowing down
on the whiskey, Charlie?

114
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,187
It ain't the whiskey.

115
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,946
Sal.
Sal, you remember, right?

116
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:25,185
I was a prospect, huh?
I wasn't drinking then, was I?

117
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:28,105
Sure, Charlie, sure.
You were Major League material.

118
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:30,384
Right.
I had heat.

119
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,543
Then I started
getting these messages...

120
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:39,142
This is Patrol GXP 1198

121
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,661
calling Alpha Tango Delta.
Come in.

122
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:44,460
- Over.
- Do you hear that?

123
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,180
Charlie, it's Jeff.

124
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm on Route 22.
Come on, lover, pick it up.

125
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:55,458
- Cut the horseshit, Jeff.
- Ooh, sorry, Harv.

126
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,537
- I didn't know you were in.
- What do you need?

127
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,417
Just signing off
for the night.

128
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,776
So sign off, already.

129
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:06,535
Uh, Charlie...

130
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:10,214
why don't you just
go on out to Jay and Helen's?

131
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:13,053
You don't want
to get fired now.

132
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,133
Oh no.
No, I like my job.

133
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:19,132
You just forget about
that Martian stuff, okay?

134
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,131
Forget about that.

135
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,331
Yeah, right.

136
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,009
This town's a zoo.

137
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:40,926
Prepare for holographic
transmission.

138
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,606
In my haste
to get you on your way,

139
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,565
there were a couple of things
I neglected to inform you of.

140
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,044
We are tracing the Crites
to a solar system

141
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,964
where only one planet
supports life... Earth.

142
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:55,003
Your ship database will contain
adequate information

143
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,082
on the culture
of the planet.

144
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:57,722
Your transformation
capabilities

145
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,521
should come in
quite handy there.

146
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:04,480
I trust, however, you will be
less destructive this time,

147
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,920
considering you nearly
destroyed half...

148
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,236
Earth is a culture
of many contrasts.

149
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,556
Their technological
advances have been...

150
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,914
Bring him down,
bring him down!

151
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,365
Okay.

152
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:26,605
Okay, I'm ready
for that carburetor, Charlie.

153
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,684
Charlie!

154
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,203
Give me the carburetor!

155
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:34,563
It's 5:16 at KEAT.
K-Eat in Kansas City.

156
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:43,960
Okay, 1948.
A Missouri housewife is kidnapped

157
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,920
by six little men with orange heads
on her way to the laundromat.

158
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,119
All right!
Whoo!

159
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,398
What the hell
was that?

160
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:56,077
Did you see that?
That was the best one we ever did!

161
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,157
Yeah, that was...
that was real good.

162
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:01,316
Homemade.
Best in the state.

163
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,755
Charlie,
you broke my slingshot.

164
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:08,234
It's... I can fix this.
I can fix this.

165
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:10,954
You just go get
a tin can.

166
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,272
Anyway, like I was saying,
this housewife...

167
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:19,271
What housewife?

168
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:22,071
I thought I told you to get rid
of them fireworks?

169
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,270
- You like working here, Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,030
I've been waiting
on that carburetor.

171
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,349
You've got to try and concentrate
on what you're doing, okay?

172
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,149
- I'm gonna.
- I got a lot to do today,

173
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,268
so try to keep up.

174
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,948
- Dad, I asked if he could...
- Give me those.

175
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,667
These are not toys.

176
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:38,187
I want to try to get this thing
fired up before dark.

177
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,743
Now what?

178
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:56,662
Sorry, Charlie.

179
00:14:58,142 --> 00:14:59,701
That don't feel right.

180
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,779
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, girl.

181
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,138
Daddy, this is Steve Elliot.
I asked him to stay for dinner.

182
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,498
I hope it's okay.
Mom said it was okay.

183
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,777
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Brown.
- Expensive little toy.

184
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,857
Steve's dad just gave it
to him for his birthday.

185
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:20,296
It's the greatest,
isn't it?

186
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,776
Don't look like you're going
to haul much hay in it.

187
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:24,415
No...

188
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,255
Let me... let me
just test it out.

189
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,132
Careful, Charlie.

190
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,650
Charlie.

191
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,409
Bradley Brown,
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:54,208
You get back here!

193
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,246
Brad, I'm going
to kill you!

194
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,045
Come here,
you little snot.

195
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:06,045
- April!
- He shot me with a slingshot!

196
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,084
- I did not!
- Liar!

197
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,444
- April!
- Liar!

198
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,683
Hold it, hold it!

199
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:15,042
Boy, did you shoot your sister
with that slingshot?

200
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,522
I think I'll stand
on the fifth amendment.

201
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,121
This is not a democracy.
Did you or didn't you?

202
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,479
Yeah, I guess I did.

203
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,559
You know better
than that, boy.

204
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,758
Go to your room.

205
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,477
- And no supper.
- Oh, Jay.

206
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:37,597
Helen.

207
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,548
At least you like me.

208
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,266
She's all set to go,
Mr. Brown.

209
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,546
Okay, Charlie.
See you in the morning.

210
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,897
This is a great meal,
Mrs. Brown.

211
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:00,376
Really, one of the best
I've ever had.

212
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,936
Thanks.
Thank you, Steve.

213
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:06,734
- Well, we should get going.
- What?

214
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,934
You promised you'd take me
for a ride, remember?

215
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,973
I did?

216
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:13,733
right.

217
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:17,292
Hon, I kinda figured
you'd watch me bowl tonight.

218
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,571
We're defending
the championship, you know.

219
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:21,531
- Oh, we're...
- Maybe we'll come by later.

220
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:25,490
Don't suppose anybody would like
some dessert before they leave?

221
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,249
- No thanks, Mom.
- It was very good.

222
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,969
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

223
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,647
- Helen?

224
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,967
Have you... you know,
talked to her

225
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,966
about the way
things are?

226
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,366
Years ago.

227
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:44,285
Years?

228
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,760
I thought you were
going to let me drive?

229
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,600
Okay. Be careful.

230
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,794
What do I want
to see an old barn for?

231
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,234
Come on.
It's romantic.

232
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:31,193
April...

233
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,833
You want your car keys back,
don't you?

234
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,910
Come on, Steve.
Want your keys?

235
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,828
Come on!

236
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,258
I'm allergic.

237
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:32,978
Just a minute!

238
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,535
Come in.

239
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:52,853
You can thank your mama
for fixing you a plate.

240
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,651
Where's that slingshot?

241
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,849
Brad, why are you always
fighting with your sister?

242
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:11,328
How come you and Mom
always take her side?

243
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,927
I mean, I didn't even
do nothing!

244
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,567
Boy, you shot her
with a slingshot.

245
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,526
Right.

246
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,724
Anyway, I'm confiscating
this until further notice.

247
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,684
- But Dad...
- And no movies...

248
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:28,924
for two weeks.

249
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,802
No, uh... April...

250
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:39,761
if your Dad catches me
up here I'm history.

251
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,160
He didn't even like me
eating his food.

252
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,399
My parents never
come out here at night.

253
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,919
You sure?

254
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:51,638
Sorry.

255
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:53,278
Chewie!

256
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,856
And now for the number one
song of the week...

257
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,775
Johnny Steele's,
"Power of the Night."

258
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,844
Jay?

259
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:10,043
There's something wrong
with the TV!

260
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,758
Jay?

261
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:39,796
The earth moved.

262
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:41,595
- Already?
- Yeah.

263
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,634
Jay, will you forget about
the shaking? Let's go.

264
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,913
I'm just going
to have a look.

265
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:51,913
We're going to be late
for the tournament.

266
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:22,825
Brad, what the hell
are you doing up there?

267
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:26,144
Dad... you see... uh...

268
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:28,584
the earthquake threw me
clear out of my room.

269
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:29,543
I could not believe it.

270
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,543
Cut the bull and get
your butt down here.

271
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,061
You look like you've
done that a couple of times.

272
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,740
- A couple times.
- Come on.

273
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,220
I want to keep
an eye on you.

274
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,619
- Where are we going?
- Out to the field.

275
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,978
- Did you see that meteor?
- I saw something.

276
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:52,618
Maybe it's a Russian spy probe
on some sort of secret mission.

277
00:25:52,657 --> 00:25:55,497
I think you watch
too much TV.

278
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,562
Smells like oil burning.

279
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:55,002
Smells like cow crap
to me, Dad.

280
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:14,317
Holy shit!

281
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:16,277
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

282
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:18,356
What is it?

283
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:22,155
Looks like
one of the herd.

284
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:24,794
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

285
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:29,673
Without my gun,
I don't want to find out.

286
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,073
Let's go.

287
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,832
Mom's going to be
really grossed out

288
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:35,872
when she hears about this.

289
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,591
Maybe we shouldn't even
tell her about it

290
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:40,870
till we find out more
about what happened out here.

291
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:01,705
This is GXP 11 niner eight,

292
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:04,264
come in
Alpha Tango Delta. Over.

293
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:06,264
What is it, Jeff?
Over.

294
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:07,904
Hey, Sal.

295
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:12,342
How about we get some donuts
and coffee after work? Over.

296
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:14,862
Not tonight, Jeff.
Not ever. Over.

297
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:19,101
I copy, Alpha Tango Delta.
Over and out.

298
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,899
Shit!

299
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,737
Damn dog.

300
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:55,492
Come here, poochy.

301
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,251
Here, pooch.

302
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,410
Come on.

303
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,770
Come on, doggie.

304
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,649
Come on.

305
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,089
Bark, bark, bark.

306
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:08,528
Come on.

307
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,048
What the...?!

308
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,751
Damn cat.

309
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,903
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me!

310
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:50,583
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Forgive me.

311
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:53,502
- Something was staring at me.
- What do you mean something?

312
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:56,221
- Where?
- Over there by the window.

313
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:13,857
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe it was Chewie.

314
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,736
Yeah, maybe.

315
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,736
Did you find anything?

316
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,375
Yeah, we found something
a little strange.

317
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,894
Jay?

318
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,530
Transform.

319
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,930
Nothing likes me.

320
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,529
Find something.

321
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,282
Eating start.

322
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,874
Who are you calling?

323
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:47,273
Harv. I want to tell him
what's going on out here.

324
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:49,673
Maybe he's gotten
other calls.

325
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:05,949
This phone is dead.

326
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,748
What?

327
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,146
Mom?

328
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,025
Okay.

329
00:33:24,704 --> 00:33:27,903
There's no reason for you to
come down here. Just wait a minute.

330
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:31,102
Probably just a circuit
breaker's been tripped.

331
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:46,539
What the...?

332
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:06,654
Jay, any luck?

333
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:08,893
Just a minute.

334
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
What's wrong?

335
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:05,679
Dad!

336
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,118
- Stay upstairs!
- Mom, we got to help him!

337
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:30,592
- Bradley!
- No, no, don't come down here!

338
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:52,667
Jay, come on!

339
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:54,227
What's down there?

340
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:57,026
I don't know.
Something meaner than hell.

341
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,259
Jeff, come in, Jeff.
Over.

342
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,818
This is Alpha Tango Delta

343
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:31,817
calling GXP
11 niner eight.

344
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,177
Come in.
Over.

345
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:38,935
Come on, will you quit fooling
around and answer me? Over.

346
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:51,572
All right, I'm sorry
about the donuts and coffee.

347
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:55,051
Maybe another time, but tonight
I have to wash my hair.

348
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,771
Over.

349
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,009
Come on, Jeff.

350
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:07,208
I've been getting all sorts of calls
about UFOs in the area.

351
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:11,367
Carla Emmons swears
one nearly ran into her house

352
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,167
and then went flying off.

353
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:14,886
I think she's been dipping
in the cooking sherry again.

354
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:19,245
Anyway, she wants you to get
over there right away. Over.

355
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:25,284
I am starting to lose
my patience, Jeff.

356
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:27,883
If you are sleeping on
the job again, I am not going...

357
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:52,917
I can't feel that.

358
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:05,834
Hey, careful, boy.

359
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,313
That's some kind
of poison.

360
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,472
That's better, babe.

361
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,552
I'm beginning to get
the feeling back.

362
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,148
I'll get it.

363
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:42,864
Steve!

364
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,023
Steve!

365
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,578
Who's that?

366
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,658
April!

367
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,138
April?

368
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,974
Brad!

369
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,573
April?

370
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,693
Brad! Brad, help!

371
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:30,812
Hurry up!

372
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:34,411
Do something, Brad!

373
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:39,530
Brad!

374
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,288
Brad!

375
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,641
- Brad!
- Mom!

376
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:19,320
- What? What are you...
- Steve's dead!

377
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,078
Charlie?

378
00:40:27,118 --> 00:40:28,958
- Call Harv.
- What for?

379
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,797
Call Harv.
Call.

380
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:34,276
Call the army.
They're here.

381
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:37,236
- Who?
- Who?!

382
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:39,715
Them!
My teeth.

383
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:42,754
Sally, call Harv, please?

384
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:45,074
Charlie...

385
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,393
I want to go home.

386
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:50,992
Okay.
Just... where is he?

387
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,632
Might be
at the bowling alley.

388
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:55,711
Okay, good, good.
I'll get Harv.

389
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,870
- You call the army.
- Okay.

390
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,628
Thank you, Ms. Grubner.

391
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,947
Tonight...

392
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:13,946
I would like to read to you
from the book of Genesis.

393
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:17,146
Chapter 19...
which, as most of you know,

394
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:20,225
is the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

395
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,862
Obviously, some
of our citizens are...

396
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:55,016
We're here for the Crites.

397
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:06,653
The county is going
to pay for this, Jeff.

398
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:12,412
Jeff?

399
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,931
Jeff?

400
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,208
Jeff Barnes?

401
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,473
Jay.

402
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:30,792
Jay, what are you doing?

403
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:37,390
Maybe we ought to just
stay put.

404
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,350
They haven't gotten
into the house yet.

405
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,029
They will.

406
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:44,429
We could board up the place.
We could make it stronger.

407
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:46,988
Helen, these things
are vicious.

408
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:50,147
They've cut out our phone,
they've cut out our power.

409
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:51,267
You understand
what that means?

410
00:43:51,307 --> 00:43:54,066
It's just a matter of time
until they get in here.

411
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:55,946
Yeah, but we should
just stay here.

412
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:57,905
No, we can't wait.

413
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,782
Wait up, Brad.

414
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:14,821
All right, Jay,
I've got her.

415
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,060
Okay, let's go.

416
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,500
Stay together.

417
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,297
I'm going to drive, Jay.

418
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:32,057
Okay, baby.

419
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:39,375
Come on.

420
00:44:40,335 --> 00:44:42,054
Oh my God, Jay.

421
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:44,374
- Oh, Mom.
- What the hell are those things?

422
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:47,133
They're from outer space,
like Charlie says.

423
00:44:47,493 --> 00:44:48,293
Bradley.

424
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:50,252
Maybe they're some government
experiment gone haywire.

425
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:53,451
They used to be gophers,
but got zapped by some radioactive...

426
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,651
- Bradley!
- What are we going to do now?

427
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:58,170
Steve's keys.

428
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,250
Oh God.
Wait!

429
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,568
Stay together.

430
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,168
Come on, come on.

431
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:28,922
Go on!

432
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,721
They're getting bigger!

433
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,119
Come on, faster!
Faster!

434
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:52,876
It's locked!

435
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,196
Come on!

436
00:45:58,115 --> 00:45:59,315
Go! Get in!

437
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,473
Jay!

438
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:21,909
Brad!

439
00:46:41,184 --> 00:46:43,384
Get him up to the door.

440
00:46:43,424 --> 00:46:45,423
Get your feet up, Jay!

441
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:49,982
Mom, shoot!

442
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:52,421
I can't!
It must be empty!

443
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:54,941
My pocket.
My shirt pocket!

444
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,500
Get them. Hurry.

445
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:50,607
- Well?
- The line's busy.

446
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:52,646
I don't get it.
Jay's never this late.

447
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:55,326
- Except when he pays for the beer.
- Yeah.

448
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:58,245
Jake, they are coming.

449
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:01,004
They are not only coming,
they are here.

450
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:03,124
See, I was out
on Route 22...

451
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:07,043
- and I looked up...
- Have another drink, Charlie.

452
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,962
I don't want
another drink, Jake.

453
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,081
I want Harv.
We're under attack.

454
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,320
I'm going to leave it
right here.

455
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,479
Just don't bother me
any more.

456
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,479
I saw the sign was shaking
and everything.

457
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:37,355
- Isn't that Johnny Steele?
- I don't know.

458
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:46,193
Whoa!

459
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,350
Joe, let's go.

460
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:44,698
Holy shit!

461
00:49:46,098 --> 00:49:47,937
Wonder what team
he's on?

462
00:49:59,654 --> 00:50:02,414
Hey, Jake, are we gonna get
a couple beers over here or what?

463
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:04,693
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

464
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,973
I got a problem here.

465
00:50:09,252 --> 00:50:11,092
You believe these guys?

466
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:14,491
It ain't Halloween, is it?

467
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,929
If anything does happen to me,
you crooks won't live long.

468
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:25,088
What does he mean
we won't live long?

469
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:28,687
What can I get
for you fellas?

470
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:31,166
Reverend, what are
you doing here?

471
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,046
That's some outfit
you got on.

472
00:50:33,046 --> 00:50:35,485
- We want the Crites.
- Oh really?

473
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:38,165
Who are they,
some new team?

474
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:42,484
The Crites.

475
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,443
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

476
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:51,161
I think you all
better be leaving

477
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,721
before somebody
gets hurt.

478
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:04,198
You all have
a serious attitude problem.

479
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:07,397
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

480
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:02,823
This had better
be important.

481
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:05,343
Harv, you better get
down to the church,

482
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:06,743
- all hell is breaking loose.
- What?

483
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:09,262
The reverend says
a couple of guys started shooting...

484
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:11,261
Whoa, slow down.

485
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,941
...destroyed the organ,
you know how beautiful...

486
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,980
- Where's Jeff?
- I don't know.

487
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,980
I've been trying
to get him for hours.

488
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,259
Give me 10 minutes.

489
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:42,054
He looks pretty sick, Mom.

490
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,493
I'm okay, sport.

491
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:45,813
He's fine.

492
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:48,772
He doesn't look
fine to me.

493
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:51,451
Why don't you go
check the windows?

494
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:53,331
- I already did.
- Check them again!

495
00:53:04,408 --> 00:53:06,008
It's okay, Mom.

496
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:08,367
I'm so sorry.

497
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,042
April?

498
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:30,122
Yeah?

499
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:32,961
You okay?

500
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,639
The flue's open!

501
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:53,636
Mom!

502
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:11,511
The shotgun!

503
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,221
Brad!
Brad, look out!

504
00:55:17,935 --> 00:55:19,454
Hey, hey!

505
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:21,014
Hey, hey!

506
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:24,213
I've been looking
for you guys!

507
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:25,973
I just want to talk
to you.

508
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:29,612
- At first he was Jeff.
- Was it Jeff or wasn't it?

509
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:31,731
- He changed.
- Changed?

510
00:55:31,971 --> 00:55:33,731
They were wearing
really funny clothes.

511
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,330
Like they was
from Los Angeles.

512
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,529
- Everybody calm down.
- Harv, all hell is breaking loose.

513
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,649
- Yeah, Sal. Over.
- There's been a disturbance

514
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:44,568
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

515
00:55:43,928 --> 00:55:46,647
What kind
of a disturbance? Over.

516
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:49,127
Well...

517
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,166
evidently some guys
shot up the bar.

518
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:55,725
You get a description?
Over.

519
00:55:55,765 --> 00:55:58,324
Well...

520
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:01,684
it's kind of strange, Harv,
but Jake says

521
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:05,403
it was Reverend Miller
and Charlie

522
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:07,162
and some stranger.

523
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:09,322
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.

524
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,441
I'm not reading you
clear, Sal.

525
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:13,001
Repeat that. Over.

526
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,280
Reverend Miller,
Charlie McFadden

527
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,479
and some stranger
just shot up the bar

528
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:21,599
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

529
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,758
Have you heard
from Jeff? Over.

530
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:26,637
I can't raise him, Harv.

531
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:30,756
I also got a report here

532
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:32,356
about shots fired
out Route 22...

533
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,555
near the Brown place. Over.

534
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:37,794
Harv, do you read? Over.

535
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:40,674
Sal, I want you to keep
trying to raise Jeff.

536
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:42,753
I'm headed over
to the bowling alley.

537
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:45,113
Then I'm going to head out
towards the Brown's place.

538
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,392
Over and out.

539
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:47,832
Over and out.

540
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:00,349
Get 'em, Harv!

541
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:07,467
Babe, I got to get to a phone,
get some help out here.

542
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,466
I can do it.

543
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:14,305
- Absolutely not.
- Dad, you can't even walk.

544
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,184
I'm so tired.

545
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,263
Damn.

546
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:31,621
Son...

547
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:34,421
assuming I said okay,
how would you do it?

548
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:37,140
Hit the yard, grab my bike
and head for the highway.

549
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,819
Dad, somebody's got
to go for help.

550
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:42,859
All right.

551
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,578
But boy, you ride like
you never rode before.

552
00:57:46,018 --> 00:57:48,337
You get over to the Emmons' house
and get on the phone.

553
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:50,857
- Get Harv over here.
- Dad, I'll be fine.

554
00:57:51,297 --> 00:57:52,096
Don't worry.

555
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,896
You want to take this?

556
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:57,975
Nah, you keep it.

557
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,174
It'd just slow me down.

558
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:01,414
Anyway, you might need it.

559
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:21,849
Brad?

560
00:58:23,488 --> 00:58:25,328
See ya.

561
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,149
Oh my gosh.

562
00:59:41,149 --> 00:59:43,308
They're growing!

563
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
How ya feeling, hon?

564
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:22,219
Like a brick hit me.

565
01:00:24,578 --> 01:00:25,818
Oh, baby.

566
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,336
How long have I been...?

567
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:34,975
Where's Brad?

568
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:38,355
Brad has gone
to get help.

569
01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:42,194
Oh, Jay, you shouldn't
have let him go.

570
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,780
Stop, stop!
Wait!

571
01:01:43,218 --> 01:01:45,978
Go, just go.
These things... these critters.

572
01:01:45,978 --> 01:01:47,897
Come on, go!

573
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,456
Dad's all torn up and Mom's got
a harpoon thing in her neck.

574
01:01:50,496 --> 01:01:51,536
They're getting
bigger.

575
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,695
Let's go!

576
01:01:54,775 --> 01:01:56,775
Charlie?

577
01:01:58,095 --> 01:02:00,214
Where's Jeff?

578
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,493
Hey, you're Johnny Steele.

579
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,733
- Where?
- Huh?

580
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:07,852
Where are they?

581
01:02:08,212 --> 01:02:09,492
At my house.
Come on, hit it.

582
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:16,010
Where?

583
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,129
Charlie, you know
where my house is.

584
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:22,048
Who are you guys?

585
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,167
We want the Crites.

586
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,207
The Crites?

587
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,687
Critters,
Crites.

588
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:33,246
You're not from
around here, are you?

589
01:02:33,326 --> 01:02:36,965
Okay, okay.
You help me, I help you.

590
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:00,919
Stop it!

591
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:08,237
Goddamn it, stop it!

592
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:18,834
I got one.

593
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:42,628
Get out of my house!

594
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:48,187
Damn it!
Give me some more rounds.

595
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:49,347
That's it.

596
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:50,946
Oh, Jay.

597
01:04:24,258 --> 01:04:26,457
Holy...

598
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,696
Mom? Dad?

599
01:04:32,896 --> 01:04:34,615
Are you all right?

600
01:04:34,695 --> 01:04:37,455
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

601
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:38,534
Brad, who did you bring?

602
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,374
Charlie
and Johnny Steele.

603
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:41,933
- Who?
- Go on!

604
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,332
Help us!

605
01:04:46,372 --> 01:04:47,892
Oh God, Chewie!

606
01:04:49,212 --> 01:04:51,571
Help us!
Help us!

607
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:54,050
Oh, it's Harv.

608
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,850
Holy shit!
What is that, a cannon?

609
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,689
What's going on here?

610
01:04:57,849 --> 01:04:59,489
Brad.
Where's Brad?

611
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,648
He's still in the house.

612
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:03,888
Helen, Helen!
Helen, Helen, Helen!

613
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:05,647
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

614
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:07,127
Get in there.
Get in.

615
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:08,887
Jay, get in the car.

616
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:33,600
Watch it!

617
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:06,112
Jeez, these folks could use
a good exterminator.

618
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:10,951
Charlie, what do you think
you're doing?

619
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,110
You drunk?

620
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:24,628
I hope not you'll
take over our operation.

621
01:06:24,668 --> 01:06:26,587
Charlie, put me down.

622
01:06:37,904 --> 01:06:40,664
Harv...
are you okay?

623
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,263
I swallowed
my chewing tobacco.

624
01:06:57,099 --> 01:06:58,939
Chewie.

625
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:03,738
Here, Chewie.

626
01:07:17,254 --> 01:07:19,294
Chewie.

627
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:20,694
Come here.

628
01:07:29,131 --> 01:07:30,771
Chewie.

629
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,490
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

630
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,649
Come on.
We're going for a ride.

631
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:41,088
Brad, get down here!

632
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:48,047
Brad!

633
01:07:56,645 --> 01:07:58,004
Help!

634
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,520
Thanks.

635
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,118
Oh, no.

636
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,358
April!

637
01:08:28,077 --> 01:08:29,716
No, Helen, no!

638
01:08:29,756 --> 01:08:30,796
No!

639
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:33,235
Where's April?

640
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,674
It just grabbed her.
I couldn't...

641
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:38,714
It was huge.

642
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,554
- Come on, Harv.
- They took her that way.

643
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:44,353
What was that thing?

644
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:52,431
Charlie?

645
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:04,468
Brad!

646
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:09,066
Brad!

647
01:09:09,106 --> 01:09:10,666
No! You get him!

648
01:09:10,706 --> 01:09:12,865
Get him!

649
01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:21,368
- Charlie?
- Brad.

650
01:10:21,408 --> 01:10:22,888
I was right.
I was right!

651
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:25,607
What are you doing here?

652
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:27,127
I'm just following
my teeth.

653
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,806
- I'm getting signals like crazy.
- Come on.

654
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:31,686
Where are we going?

655
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:44,842
- What the heck...
- Shhh!

656
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:48,201
Brad, is that April?

657
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,198
- Stay down, Brad.
- Stay here.

658
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:03,358
If I need you,
I'll holler.

659
01:11:03,398 --> 01:11:04,837
Brad...

660
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:06,597
What's that thing
going to do with April?

661
01:11:06,677 --> 01:11:08,796
- It's going to kill her.
- Oh, it's going to kill her.

662
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,236
Kill her?!

663
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:13,755
Bradley!

664
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:52,705
Let's go.

665
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:39,813
Brad!

666
01:12:40,813 --> 01:12:41,933
April?

667
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:51,730
Give me your hand!

668
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:58,329
- I dropped my firecracker!
- Forget it!

669
01:12:58,369 --> 01:12:59,888
But they'll get away!

670
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:04,887
- Charlie, let's go!
- Come on!

671
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:07,806
Brad, I got an idea.
Come here!

672
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,326
- Give me your fire.
- Brad!

673
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:11,965
Brad, come on!

674
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:14,925
Come on!

675
01:13:19,643 --> 01:13:21,643
Throw it!

676
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:44,477
Dad!

677
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:48,516
- Mom, Dad!
- Are you okay?

678
01:13:48,516 --> 01:13:50,116
Yeah, we're okay.

679
01:14:47,701 --> 01:14:49,861
Hey!

680
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,739
I, uh...
just wanted, you know...

681
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:57,899
to say thanks.

682
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:09,016
Call me.

683
01:15:17,414 --> 01:15:19,333
listen, you wouldn't
happen to have

684
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:21,573
another one of them
electronic gizmos

685
01:15:21,613 --> 01:15:23,452
like you gave
to Brad there?

686
01:15:23,492 --> 01:15:25,412
Listen, maybe you need
a good mechanic

687
01:15:25,452 --> 01:15:26,892
to work
on them guns there.

688
01:15:26,892 --> 01:15:28,371
I'm real good
with my hands...

689
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:52,910
Chewie!

690
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:29,261
Chewie?

691
01:17:36,339 --> 01:17:38,618
Chew.
