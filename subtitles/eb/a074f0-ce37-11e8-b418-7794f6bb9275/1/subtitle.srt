1
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,255
Here! You take this!

2
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,790
You can have this ticket
and keep it!

3
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,689
I'm not paying that ticket!

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,230
Jesus! Watch where you're going!

5
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:04,097
Go down to the cellar and check
the water line to the boiler.

6
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:08,142
- Do that today, all right?
- Frank, would you give me a hand?

7
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,007
I ain't the doorman, Miss Barrett.

8
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,707
- I'm the building superintendent.
- You're also a human being.

9
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,908
What the hell,
I'll do you a favor.

10
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:20,614
I asked you last week to fix
the radiator in the baby's room.

11
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,214
Didn't I do that?

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,591
It's getting cold in there,
and l--

13
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,960
Okay, it's no problem.

14
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,872
- Stop that carriage!
- Whoa! Get it!

15
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,787
That's my baby!
Watch out!

16
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:59,360
- Jesus!
- Oscar, watch out!

17
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:02,830
My God!

18
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,441
Stop that carriage!

19
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,994
- How many are there?
- Fourteen. In here.

20
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,967
I hope you can handle it.
It's been like a nightmare.

21
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,867
How big are they?

22
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,404
Four feet.

23
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:24,309
Kids, listen up!

24
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,778
Look who's here!

25
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:33,517
- I thought it was gonna be He-Man.
- Yeah!

26
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:37,285
I know. Let's all sit down,
and we'll have fun!

27
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,791
Yeah!

28
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,360
My dad says you guys
are full of crap.

29
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,456
Some don't believe
in the paranormal.

30
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:49,435
He says you went out of business
because you're full of crap.

31
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,006
Song.

32
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,743
Come on, everybody!

33
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:08,988
He-Man!

34
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,595
- Let's go get a beer, all right?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:22,093
- Thank you. Call anytime.
- Bye.

36
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,106
- That's it, Ray. No more parties.
- Here's your share.

37
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:29,268
I won't take abuse
from overprivileged nine-year-olds.

38
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,278
I know, Z,
but we can't quit now.

39
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,042
The holidays are coming up.
That's our best season.

40
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:38,246
Man, face it.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,222
In a year, those kids
won't remember who we are.

42
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,258
Ungrateful Yuppie larvae.

43
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,487
- After all we did for this city.
- Yeah.

44
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:49,621
We conjured up
a 100-foot marshmallow man...

45
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,531
blew the top three floors off
an uptown high-rise...

46
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:57,004
and got sued by every state, county
and city agency in New York.

47
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:59,336
Yeah, but what a ride.

48
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,285
If went out into traffic.

49
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,759
I started really running after it.

50
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:23,264
Then it just suddenly stopped
in the middle of the street.

51
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,993
Did anyone else see this happen?

52
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,160
Sure. Hundreds of people.

53
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,330
- Egon, I didn't imagine this.
- I'm not saying you did.

54
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:34,500
In science, we look
for the simplest explanation.

55
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:38,410
- We're ready, Dr. Spengler.
- Start with the negative calibration.

56
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,049
What are you working on?

57
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:46,451
Trying to determine if human emotions
affect the physical environment.

58
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:51,390
- It's a theory Ray and I had.
- Can they see us?

59
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,863
No. They think they're here
for marriage counseling.

60
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,628
They've been waiting over two hours, and
we've increased the room temperature.

61
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,534
It's up to 95 degrees now.

62
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,435
My assistant is asking them
to wait another half-hour.

63
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,376
Good. Very good.

64
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,382
Very, very nice.

65
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,342
What do you think?

66
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:22,048
Excellent.
Do the happiness index next.

67
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:27,288
- I mean about the carriage.
- I'd like to bring Ray in on this.

68
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,757
Sure. Whatever you think.
But not Venkman.

69
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,697
- Do you ever see him?
- Occasionally.

70
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,937
- How is he these days?
- Peter was borderline for a while.

71
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,605
Then he crossed the border.

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
Does he ever mention me?

73
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,747
We didn't part
on very good terms.

74
00:06:56,825 --> 00:07:00,761
Then we lost track of each other
after I got married.

75
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,389
- We're ready for the affection test.
- Good. Send in the puppy.

76
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:06,934
I thought of contacting him
after my marriage ended, but--

77
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,273
Isn't that sweet?

78
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,445
I appreciate your doing this.

79
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:22,949
Try not to worry.

80
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,777
Here's my phone number.
You'll call me?

81
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,288
Yes.

82
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,291
Don't mention any of this to Peter,
if you don't mind.

83
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,792
No, I won't.

84
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:36,796
Thanks.

85
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:44,261
Let's see what happens
when we take away the puppy.

86
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:56,650
Hi. Welcome back to "World
of the Psychic." I'm Peter Venkman.

87
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:01,417
I'm chatting with my guest
author, lecturer and psychic...

88
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,480
Milton Angland.

89
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:07,926
Your new book is called
"The End of the World."

90
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:12,160
Can you tell us when it will be
or do we have to buy the book?

91
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:16,761
I predict the world will end
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

92
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:19,005
- This year?
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:23,306
That's cutting it a little close,
isn't it?

94
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,471
Just from a sales point of view,
your book just came out.

95
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,015
You won't see any paperback sales
for a year.

96
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:34,989
It will be another year before
you have the mini-series possibility.

97
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,253
Just devil's advocate,
shouldn't you have said...

98
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,329
- "The world will end in 1992."
- Wait a minute.

99
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,988
Better yet, 1994.

100
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:45,896
This is not just
some moneymaking scheme.

101
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:50,904
I have a strong
psychic belief...

102
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,877
that the world will end
on New Year's Eve.

103
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,776
- For your sake, I hope you're right.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,880
But I think my other guest
may disagree with you.

105
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:15,019
Elaine, now you had
another date in mind.

106
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,927
According to my source...

107
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:19,933
the end of the world
will be on February 14...

108
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,526
in the year 2016.

109
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,531
Valentine's Day.

110
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,734
Bummer.

111
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,538
Where did you get your date?

112
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:33,379
I received this information
from an alien.

113
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,212
As I told my husband...

114
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,878
it was in the Paramus Holiday Inn.

115
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:42,320
I was having a drink at the bar,
alone...

116
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,756
and this alien approached me.

117
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,885
He started talking to me.

118
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:48,758
He bought me a drink.

119
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,062
And then I think he used
some kind of a ray...

120
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,658
or a mind control device.

121
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:58,227
He forced me
to follow him to his room.

122
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,206
That's where...

123
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:03,972
he told me
about the end of the world.

124
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,648
Your alien had a room
at the Holiday Inn in Paramus?

125
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,079
It might have been a room
on the spacecraft...

126
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,318
made up to look like
a room at the Holiday Inn.

127
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:20,555
I can't be sure about that.

128
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:24,086
Of course not.
That is the whole problem with aliens.

129
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,928
You just can't trust them.

130
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,800
Occasionally, you meet a nice one--
Starman, ET--

131
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:33,272
but usually they turn out
to be some big lizard!

132
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,935
That's all the time
we've got this week.

133
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:38,774
Next week, though--
Give me Ira.

134
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,281
Hairless pets.
Weird.

135
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,615
Until then,
this is Peter Venkman saying--

136
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,624
See you then.

137
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,789
Norman, we were supposed to have
the telekinetic guy who bends spoons.

138
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:58,957
He cancelled.
This is the best we could do.

139
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,968
The respected psychics
all think you're a fraud.

140
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,867
I am a fraud.

141
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:07,305
Mr. Mayor. Lenny.
Pete Venkman.

142
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,606
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, get your hand off me.

143
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,272
Thank you.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.

144
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,816
I'm Jack Hardemeyer,
the mayor's assistant.

145
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,320
I know who you are. I just don't see
any ghosts anywhere.

146
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,523
That's why I wanted
to talk to His Highness.

147
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,524
We did a job for the city
a while back...

148
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:28,585
and got stiffed on the bill by some
bureaucratic bookworm like yourself.

149
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:32,326
You stay away from the mayor.
He's running for governor next fall.

150
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,198
We don't need him associating
with two-bit frauds...

151
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,329
like you and your friends.

152
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:44,106
I'm a voter. Aren't you supposed
to lie to me and kiss my butt?

153
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:52,816
Yes, I want you to put the Vigo
in the arch.

154
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,287
Under the arch there.

155
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:58,757
Everything you are doing is bad.
I want you to know this.

156
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,528
You be careful there, all right?

157
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,265
No one listens to me.

158
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,530
Dana, how are you doing?
How's this Bonington coming?

159
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,064
Fine. This mixture you gave me
works really well.

160
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:19,409
I make pretty good cocktails,
don't I?

161
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,007
- You're doing quite good work.
- Thank you.

162
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:26,144
It won't be long
before you can assist me...

163
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:30,749
in the more important
restorations.

164
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:33,157
Just a white thing.

165
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:36,391
- Thank you, Dr. Poha.
- Janosz.

166
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,731
I've enjoyed working here,
but my baby's older now...

167
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,169
so I'm going to try to go back
to the orchestra.

168
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:47,538
I'm sorry to hear
that you will not be not here.

169
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:52,569
Could I say good-bye,
maybe bring you to a brunch today?

170
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,174
I have an appointment today.
In fact, I must go.

171
00:12:56,251 --> 00:13:00,051
I don't understand. Every day I say,
"Can you do something?"

172
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,385
You say,
"No, I can't do something."

173
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:04,584
Do I have bad breath?

174
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,389
- Of course not.
- All right.

175
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,192
I'll give you a rain check.

176
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,604
I think she likes me.

177
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,900
I do. I truly do.

178
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,516
This one's interesting.
Berlin, 1939.

179
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:33,520
A flower cart took off by itself,
rolled half a kilometer.

180
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,522
Three hundred eyewitnesses.

181
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,251
My best to the coven.

182
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:38,758
Berlin?

183
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:43,160
Check Duke University studies
on controlled psychokinesis.

184
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:45,290
- I pulled it.
- Could you help me?

185
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,960
I need a love potion aerosol...

186
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:52,029
that I could spray
on a certain Penthouse Pet...

187
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,301
to obtain her total submission.

188
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,206
- Hello, Venkman.
- How's it going, Pete?

189
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:59,610
Very well. Hi, Egon.
How's school?

190
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,775
I bet those science chicks
dig your large cranium.

191
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,318
They're more interested
in my epididymis.

192
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,788
Let's close up
so you can buy me a calzone.

193
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,556
I can't.
I'm working on something.

194
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,598
But your book came in.

195
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,997
"Magical Paths
to Fortune and Power."

196
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,535
Thank you.

197
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,729
Good luck with that, Venkman.

198
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,703
- Put this on my account, please.
- Sure.

199
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,331
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

200
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,740
What are you working on?

201
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,177
We're just kind of...

202
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,339
checking on something
for a friend.

203
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,007
Neat. Who?

204
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,913
Ray's Occult.
7:00 on weekdays, midnight on Saturday.

205
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,458
Thank you.

206
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,690
- Who?
- Just someone we know.

207
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,870
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

208
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,405
- Who?
- Nobody!

209
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,465
Can you tell me now?

210
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,271
- Now?
- Dana Barrett!

211
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,315
My Dana Barrett?

212
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,386
I'll get it.

213
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:25,388
Hi, Ray. How good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

214
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,661
Always glad to help and hug.

215
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,795
- Hello.
- Nice place.

216
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:35,070
I know I'm asking for the big hurt,
but I'll give us one more chance.

217
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,236
He tortured me, pulled my ears.

218
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,250
- What would you like to do first?
- Examine the baby.

219
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,052
Yeah, and anything associated
with the baby, especially toys.

220
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,958
- Then the buggy.
- Can I put him over here?

221
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:55,962
- Wherever he sleeps.
- Yes.

222
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,964
- This would be fine.
- This okay?

223
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,600
Lay him down flat.

224
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,569
Sweetheart,
they're going to look at you.

225
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:06,106
We'll do a cursory medical exam.

226
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,573
Gammel and Pross
Infant Acuity Test?

227
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,110
We'll finish
with an APGAR score.

228
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,270
It won't hurt him, right?

229
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,009
No, I don't think so.
He'll be fine.

230
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,160
- Done this before?
- On a chimp.

231
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,927
I heard Mr. Right ditched you
and ran off to Europe.

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,401
He didn't ditch me.
We had some problems...

233
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:40,601
and he took a good job offer
from a London orchestra.

234
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,142
He ditched you.

235
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:48,307
Subject is a male Caucasian
of approximately...

236
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,544
24 inches in length.

237
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,919
Subject weighs approximately 18 pounds
and is eight months old.

238
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,550
Okay. Ocular?

239
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,560
Pupillary response normal.

240
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:04,824
- Auditory.
- Normal.

241
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,833
Axillary reflex.

242
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,599
- Appears to be ticklish.
- Yup, baby ticklish.

243
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,969
You should have married me.

244
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,136
You never asked me.

245
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,511
Whenever I brought it up,
you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

246
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,214
You never got it, Dana.

247
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,256
I'm a man. I'm sensitive.

248
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:33,657
I need to feel loved.
I need to be desired.

249
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:38,665
When you introduced me as "the old ball
and chain," that's when I left.

250
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:45,439
I may have a lot of personal problems,
but I'm a total professional at my job.

251
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,707
- Egon.
- What?

252
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,641
What are we doing?

253
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,235
He's fine, Dana.

254
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,904
- He's very healthy.
- He's okay.

255
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:55,846
Where does he sleep?

256
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,545
Here, I'll show you.

257
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,247
Get a stool specimen, please.

258
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,290
Business or personal?

259
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,052
It's a little messy.

260
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,065
We don't want to play,
just sweep for valances.

261
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,933
Very cheerful.
My parents didn't believe in toys.

262
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,545
You want to play
with a big kid?

263
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:32,484
I should have been your father.

264
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,986
I could have been.

265
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:39,859
I understand.

266
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,732
Help!
He's gone completely berserk!

267
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:01,471
You never even had a Slinky?

268
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,007
We had part of one,
but I straightened it.

269
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:14,752
He had some sort of clear liquid
coming out of his mouth.

270
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,763
Yeah, that happens.

271
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:21,594
- What do you think?
- He's ugly.

272
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,603
He's not "Elephant Man" ugly,
but...

273
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,229
he's not attractive.

274
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:27,399
- Was his father ugly?
- Don't listen.

275
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:31,377
And he stinks.
You are ripe, senor.

276
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,413
Did his father stink?

277
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:36,575
Yeah? Your daddy was smelly?

278
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:39,211
- What's your name?
- His name is Oscar.

279
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:43,781
Named after a hot dog.
You poor, poor man!

280
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:47,191
But seriously,
is there anything...

281
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,252
unusual about him?

282
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,232
I don't have a lot of experience
with babies.

283
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:59,637
But you're excited now because
Mama's here to get your stool sample.

284
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:02,039
- Right?
- Stool sample?

285
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,479
Nothing.

286
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,105
So, what, Brainiac?

287
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:10,309
I'd like to run some gynecological
tests on the mother.

288
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,817
Who wouldn't?

289
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,319
Let's check the street.

290
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,714
It stopped right there,
in the middle of the crosswalk.

291
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:21,660
I can get us out there.
Hold on.

292
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:24,698
We're scientists.
Get out of the way!

293
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,666
Thanks a lot.
We have to do an inquiry.

294
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:30,329
Thanks. Appreciate it.

295
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,100
- Get out of there!
- Relax, you're on the meter.

296
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:39,745
I think we hit the honey pot.

297
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:43,716
Something is brewing under the street.
I've got 1118 on the PKE.

298
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,877
2.5 GEV's on the giga-meter.

299
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,420
What does that mean?

300
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:05,705
How you doing?

301
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,733
- Me?
- Yeah.

302
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:14,212
- Fine. It's cutting fine now.
- Great.

303
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,978
- Why are you cutting?
- Why am I cutting?

304
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:20,077
- Yeah.
- Boss!

305
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:25,559
Who told you to stop cutting?
Somebody tell you to stop?

306
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,184
- What are you guys doing here?
- Did you tell him to stop?

307
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:30,422
- Yes. What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

308
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,398
Why don't you let us work?
We let you work.

309
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:34,093
Relax. He's been working overtime.

310
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:39,264
Some diaper bag downtown is making us
work on a Friday night. Right?

311
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,034
Of course you're right, Raymond.
Right, Ziggy?

312
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,113
- You guys take it easy.
- Come on.

313
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,012
What have you been doing?

314
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,678
While you were getting coffee
for an hour, I've been digging a hole.

315
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,189
You uncovered an old air shaft.

316
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,418
It just goes on and on.

317
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:02,792
This is very intense.
We should get a deeper reading.

318
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,161
Yeah, we'll need a deeper reading.

319
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:09,429
Somebody has to go down there.

320
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,211
I'm stinging!

321
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,756
Listen to me.

322
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,227
What? Who?

323
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:37,594
l, Vigo, the scourge....

324
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:39,633
of Carpathia...

325
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,168
the sorrow of Moldavia...

326
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,669
command you.

327
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,365
Command me, lord.

328
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:50,501
On a mountain of skulls,
in the castle of pain...

329
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,480
I sat on a throne of blood.

330
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,743
What was, will be.

331
00:22:56,817 --> 00:23:00,412
What is, will be no more.

332
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:03,957
Now is the season of evil.

333
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:06,759
Evil?

334
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:09,057
Find me a child...

335
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,757
that I might live again.

336
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,369
Yes. A child.

337
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,304
A child?

338
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:36,379
A child.

339
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,558
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

340
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,599
The speed is good, boys.

341
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,634
Keep it coming.

342
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:04,048
We're breaking through.
I see some light.

343
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,053
I'm in some kind of chamber.

344
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:09,351
There's tile work.

345
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,015
Slime!

346
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,218
It's a river of slime!

347
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,327
There must be 25, 000 gallons!

348
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,923
It's flowing like a river!

349
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:23,402
Van Horne. Pneumatic transit.

350
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,961
It's the old Pneumatic
Transit System.

351
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,669
Whoa! That's good.
Hold me up.

352
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,972
What do you see?

353
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:36,906
I'll get a sample.

354
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:38,975
What's going on here?

355
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,578
- What's the story?
- Hang on.

356
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:46,624
You boneheads are going
to roust me out again?

357
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,288
I got 3,000 phones out
in Greenwich Village.

358
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:54,460
I got to check eight million miles
of cable, and you're hassling me?

359
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,561
What do you mean?
The phone lines are over there.

360
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,640
I told you.
The phone lines are over there!

361
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,371
What did I say?
How many times--

362
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:08,006
You're not with Con Ed
or the phone company. We checked.

363
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:09,515
So tell me another one.

364
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:13,252
I've got a major gas leak!

365
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,948
Where do you think this is coming from,
the sky?

366
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,593
Okay, boys. Boys?

367
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:26,690
Pull me up now.

368
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:32,400
There's some kind of activity
going on with this stuff.

369
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,806
- Hey, take me up!
- Start it!

370
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:40,638
What's going on up there?
Come on!

371
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,148
Get me out of this hole!

372
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:05,194
Sweetheart, hello.

373
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,331
Go back to sleep.

374
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:13,142
- Who is it?
- It's Janosz.

375
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,082
Hello, Janosz.

376
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,242
This is a surprise.

377
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,153
Hello. Yes?

378
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:26,954
I happened to be here
in this neighborhood...

379
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:31,157
and I thought I'd stop by
and see how it is with you...

380
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:34,462
because of all this blackness.

381
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,968
We're fine. Thank you.

382
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,833
Then you're okay?

383
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,395
How's the baby?

384
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,771
He's okay.

385
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:44,367
He's sleeping.

386
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,811
- But I wooed.
- That's okay.

387
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,906
You don't need anything?

388
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,384
You want me to come in?

389
00:26:55,756 --> 00:26:59,089
- No, thank you.
- All right.

390
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,788
I just thought that
I would check. You know.

391
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:07,698
Well, don't let the bedbugs bite.

392
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,602
Good night, Janosz.

393
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,526
Before we begin this trial,
I want to make one thing clear.

394
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:38,997
The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts, nor do I.

395
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:43,025
I won't listen to malarkey
about goblins, spooks and demons.

396
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,264
Stick to the facts
in this case.

397
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,739
Leave the ghost stories to the kiddies.
Understood?

398
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:50,470
Sounds like an open-minded guy.

399
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,034
He's called "The Hammer."

400
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:54,637
It's in the hands
of our lawyer now.

401
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,978
You guys are making a big mistake.

402
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,349
I do mostly tax law
and some occasional probate stuff.

403
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,354
I got my law degree
at night school.

404
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:05,823
That's fine, Louis.
We got arrested at night.

405
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,261
Put these guys away fast...

406
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,025
and make sure
it's for a long, long time.

407
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,535
I don't think it will be hard
with this list of charges.

408
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:17,729
Good. Very good.

409
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,798
Violating a restraining order...

410
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,572
willful destruction of public property,
fraud, malicious mischief.

411
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,671
See you in a couple years
at your parole hearing.

412
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,216
You won't take us alive.

413
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:34,254
All right, let's get on with it.

414
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:39,287
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen
of the audience.

415
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:43,929
It's not fair
to call my clients frauds.

416
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:47,125
The blackout was a big problem
for everybody.

417
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:50,762
I was stuck in an elevator for two hours
and had to make the whole time.

418
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,361
But I don't blame them.

419
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,431
'Cause one time I turned into a dog
and they helped me. Thank you.

420
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,118
Very good, Louis.
Short but pointless.

421
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:10,623
Mr. Fianella,
please look at Exhibits A through F...

422
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:13,387
on the table over here.

423
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:15,927
Do you recognize this equipment?

424
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:17,930
The cops took that
from their truck.

425
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:20,330
Do you know what this equipment
is used for?

426
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,063
I don't know.
Catching ghosts?

427
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:28,335
I remind the court that the defendants
are under a restraining order...

428
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,411
that strictly forbids them
from performing services...

429
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:34,605
as paranormal investigators
or eliminators.

430
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,205
So noted.

431
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,113
Now, Mr. Fianella...

432
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:42,019
can you identify the substance
in this jar marked Exhibit F?

433
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,025
Yeah, that's the stuff.

434
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:53,123
I've worked underground for 27 years.
I never saw anything like this.

435
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:56,293
Whatever's there,
they must have put there.

436
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,668
- No, we didn't!
- Shut up!

437
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,369
So you were just trying
to help out a friend.

438
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:06,378
Who was scared of what was happening
to her, and when you're scared--

439
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,846
- What?
- There was no evil intended.

440
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:11,008
- I live here.
- You live here.

441
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:16,112
When you live in a place, you don't
want nothing bad to happen. What?

442
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:19,920
It will never happen again.
It's a one-shot deal.

443
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:21,790
- Objection, Your Honor.
- What?

444
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,625
- He's leading the witness.
- Sustained.

445
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,928
- Give me a break. We're both lawyers.
- Mr. Tully...

446
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,468
do you have any questions
for this witness...

447
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,061
that might have some bearing
on this case?

448
00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:35,300
- Do I?
- No, we've helped them enough.

449
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:38,435
No, Your Honor.
Your witness.

450
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:46,175
Please tell the court why you
and your co-defendants...

451
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:50,154
dug a very big hole
in the middle of First Avenue.

452
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,994
With so many holes there,
we thought no one would notice.

453
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:59,933
Keep that up,
and I'll find you in contempt.

454
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,591
I'm truly sorry.

455
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,364
I'll ask you again.

456
00:31:04,438 --> 00:31:07,771
Why were you digging the hole?
Please remember you're under oath.

457
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,674
There are some things
in this world...

458
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,941
that go way beyond
human understanding.

459
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:18,279
Things that cannot be explained and
most people don't want to know about.

460
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:20,946
That is where we come in.

461
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:25,991
Are you saying the world of the
supernatural is your exclusive province?

462
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,062
Kitten, what I'm saying is...

463
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:33,065
when shit happens,
someone has to deal with it.

464
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,067
And who are you gonna call?

465
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,536
Shut up!

466
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,203
Stand up! Get up!

467
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:47,202
You too, Mr. Tully.

468
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:52,147
You're guilty on all charges.

469
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:55,188
I order you to pay fines
of $25,000 each.

470
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,823
I sentence you to 18 months
at Ryker's Island.

471
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:04,330
- Egie, she's twitching.
- I'm not finished!

472
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,298
On a more personal note...

473
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:10,735
let me go on record as saying
there's no place for fakes--

474
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,237
- Your Honor?
- Shut up!

475
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,500
Or tricksters like you
in decent society.

476
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:15,905
This is important.

477
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,171
You play on innocent people's
gullibility.

478
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,678
- Yes, sir.
- Be quiet!

479
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:21,907
- But--
- If my hands weren't tied...

480
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,973
by the fetters of the law...

481
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:27,815
I would invoke the tradition
of our illustrious forefathers...

482
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:32,086
reach back to a purer,
sterner justice...

483
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,754
and have you burned
at the stake!

484
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,871
My God! The Scoleri Brothers!

485
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,808
- The Scoleri Brothers!
- Friends of yours?

486
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:59,181
I tried them for murder!
Gave them the chair!

487
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,789
Do something!

488
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,825
Tell them you don't believe
in ghosts.

489
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,899
Do something! Help me!

490
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:22,999
Don't talk to me,
talk to my attorney.

491
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:26,204
That's me! My guys are still under
a judicial "mis-strangement" order.

492
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,042
That blue thing I got from her!

493
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,707
They could be exposing themselves.

494
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:32,377
You don't want us
exposing ourselves.

495
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,065
You're next.

496
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:50,103
All right! I rescind the order!
Case dismissed!

497
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,661
- We won the case!
- Now do something!

498
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,679
I always hated this part.

499
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:11,616
We haven't used this stuff
in a couple years.

500
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,181
- I hope it still works.
- It should.

501
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,751
The power cells are good
for 5,000 years.

502
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:19,196
There's no time for a bench test.
Heat them up.

503
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,525
Do.

504
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:26,194
Re.

505
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:30,065
Egon.

506
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:41,046
Come on, fat boy!

507
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:44,049
I'm taking you home
to my private zoo!

508
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,418
You got him!

509
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,422
- Bring the trap.
- Okay.

510
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,026
Behind you!

511
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:03,399
Hold it, Ray!
Venkman, start bringing him back!

512
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,166
Come on, meanie.
Let's go, chubby.

513
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,434
Keep pulling to the right!

514
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,975
Okay, the trap's going in!

515
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,710
No, Spengie!

516
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,117
- Hold it, Ray!
- Hit it!

517
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,659
- Two in the box!
- Ready to go!

518
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,027
We be fast,
and they be slow!

519
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:37,793
We're the best!
We're the beautiful!

520
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,738
- We're the only Ghostbusters!
- We're back!

521
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,047
Ghostbusters.

522
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,612
Yes, we're back.

523
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,886
Something strange going on

524
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,424
Something's wrong

525
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:00,891
Ghoul in the room

526
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,723
Outside is the storm

527
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,296
All alone and afraid

528
00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:06,695
- Certified check, cash or money order!
- What can you do

529
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,427
Oh, is that what I think

530
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:10,435
Did I see something move

531
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:13,904
Chills down your spine
Your heart fills with frighf

532
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:18,069
Not thrilled by the things
that go bump in the night

533
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,941
Walk through the wall

534
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,947
With no time to stall

535
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:25,075
You call the Ghostbusters
Well, that's who you call

536
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:37,956
- Stop, Hit it
- Bye-bye.

537
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:44,501
- What is it, honey?
- It's that darn ghost again!

538
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:48,098
He won't leave us alone.
We'll have to move.

539
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:50,335
No, wait !
Don't worry.

540
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:53,844
We're not moving. He is.

541
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,574
Who are you going to call?

542
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,274
Ghostbusters!

543
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:09,651
I remember the time
I visited the grave

544
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:12,391
My life on the line
Only my life to save

545
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,936
All by myself
with no one around

546
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,131
Did not understand
a hand comin' out the ground

547
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:21,673
I knew it wasn't mine

548
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:24,073
- It was somebody else
- Now.

549
00:38:24,144 --> 00:38:27,307
Before it could get me
I just screamed for help

550
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:29,348
- Then
- Ghostbusters

551
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:32,145
Packs strapped to their back
screaming

552
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:35,084
Ghostbusters attack

553
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:37,180
Janine, lunch!

554
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:40,488
- It smells like somebody took a big--
- We are the busters of any

555
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:43,255
G-h-o-s-t

556
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,501
...with our special
half-price service plan.

557
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:57,633
What? Hold on! Half-price?
Have we all gone mad?

558
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,268
I guess so.

559
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:01,575
That's not all.
Tell them, Egon.

560
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:04,947
You mean the Ghostbusters'
hot beverage thermal mug...

561
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,714
and free balloons for the kids?

562
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:12,515
I've been experimenting with the plasm
we found in the subway tunnel.

563
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,026
Careful.

564
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:19,393
- Should I get spoons?
- Don't bother. Watch this.

565
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,530
Go ahead, Ray.

566
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:25,730
You worthless piece of slime!

567
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,535
You ignorant disgusting blob!

568
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:32,237
You're just a short-chain molecule!

569
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:35,042
You foul, obnoxious muck!

570
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,344
You have a weak
electrochemical bond!

571
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,251
I have seen some disgusting crud
in my time...

572
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,948
but you take the cake!

573
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:51,226
This is what you do
with your spare time?

574
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,322
This is
an incredible breakthrough.

575
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,867
What a discovery:
a psycho-reactive substance.

576
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,463
Whatever this stuff is,
it responds to human emotional states.

577
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,973
Mood slime.

578
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,771
Oh, baby.

579
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,009
You mean this actually feeds
on bad vibes?

580
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:11,016
Like a cop in a donut factory.

581
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:14,611
We ran tests to look
for a strong positive reaction.

582
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:20,353
- What kind of tests?
- We sing to it and talk to it...

583
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:23,657
and say supportive,
nurturing things to it.

584
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,655
Are you sleeping with it?

585
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,105
Oh, you.

586
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:37,135
- It's always the quiet ones.
- You hound.

587
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:40,369
How about the kinetic tests?

588
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,014
Ordinary household toaster.

589
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:48,019
We'll take your word for that.

590
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:58,162
It responds to music, so we've been
playing middle-of-the-road stuff.

591
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:00,961
- Paul Young works okay.
- Works for me.

592
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:03,798
- Dig this.
- Loves Jackie Wilson.

593
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:09,306
You guys do this at night
when I'm not here?

594
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:13,541
I get it. It sings.
It sounds exactly like Jackie.

595
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,103
- That's fantastic.
- Just watch.

596
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,308
Does it do Emmy Lou Harris?

597
00:41:17,383 --> 00:41:20,841
- Your love is lifting me higher
- It dances too.

598
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:26,590
Than I've ever been lifted before

599
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:30,857
- Whoa! Shake it up!
- Yeah! Happy thoughts.

600
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:34,300
And I'll be at your side

601
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,767
Oh, baby!

602
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:39,930
You're my number-one
Christmas boutique gift item.

603
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:42,634
The first time somebody gets mad,
the toaster eats their hand.

604
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,974
We put a warning label on it,
we have no liability.

605
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,515
Did you ever go for it!
The old man-eating toaster bit.

606
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:54,246
Get him!

607
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,880
Hello.
I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

608
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,950
- Room 304, Restoration.
- Thank you.

609
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:05,520
Hey, Dr. Venkman!
"World of the Psychic."

610
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:07,259
That's right. How you doing?

611
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,427
- I'm a big fan of yours.
- Thank you very much.

612
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:15,405
- It's one of my two favorite shows.
- You're kidding. What's the other one?

613
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:17,773
"Bass Masters."
It's a fishing show.

614
00:42:17,844 --> 00:42:19,641
Yeah, I know "Bass Masters."

615
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:01,387
You're good, pretty eyes.

616
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:05,223
I didn't paint it.
I'm just cleaning it.

617
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:08,020
- It's a Gauguin.
- I've heard of him.

618
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:12,731
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

619
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,733
Sure. Peter Venkman...

620
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:19,397
this is Dr. Janosz Poha,
the head of our department.

621
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,067
I have seen you on the television.
I quite enjoy.

622
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:25,110
You're not here on business,
I hope.

623
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:26,770
It's top-secret.

624
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:29,041
Say, Johnny,
you have a Gauguin too.

625
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:34,451
Actually, I'm preparing this portrait
for the new romantic exhibition.

626
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,083
This is Prince Vigo,
the ruler of Carpathia and Moldavia.

627
00:43:40,193 --> 00:43:45,893
- He's a bit of a sissy.
- He was a very powerful magician.

628
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:48,866
And a genius in many ways.

629
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:52,234
He was also a lunatic
and a genocidal madman.

630
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,771
I hate this painting.

631
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,809
I've felt uncomfortable
ever since it came up from storage.

632
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:59,470
You're probably feeling
what Vigo is feeling.

633
00:43:59,545 --> 00:44:02,378
Carpathian kitten lost.
He's missed his kitten.

634
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:06,145
- We'll just put one in here.
- No altering valuable artwork!

635
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:10,814
- Go! The joyfulness is over!
- He's kidding.

636
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,950
You won't get a green card
with that attitude, pal.

637
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:18,962
I don't know what to do.
Oh, of course.

638
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,659
You're sweet
on this hunky stud.

639
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:25,898
Every now and then, I get the feeling
that painting is watching me...

640
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:27,973
even smiling at me.

641
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:46,749
I think we got more food
on your shirt...

642
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,793
than in your mouth.

643
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:53,827
You're gonna take a bath.

644
00:44:57,103 --> 00:45:00,095
Yeah, do your favorite thing.

645
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:05,239
You know what you get to do?

646
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,176
You know what's more fun
than anything?

647
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:13,341
Splash Mommy.
I get to splash Mommy. Yes.

648
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:41,475
I'll be ready for you this time.

649
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:43,572
Mommy's taking her shirt off too.

650
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:06,830
Peter, it's me!
Please, let us in!

651
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,941
What the hell is this?

652
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:16,948
Let us in, please!

653
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,914
I didn't know where else to go.

654
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,581
The most awful thing happened.

655
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,591
The bathtub was trying
to eat Oscar!

656
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,593
I was giving him a bath.

657
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:32,563
There was all this pink ooze
reaching for him!

658
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:35,499
- You're all right.
- I won't let them get you.

659
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:37,502
You're all safe now, okay?

660
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,595
I was so terrified.

661
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,072
- You guys just sit down, relax.
- I'm sorry.

662
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:45,774
I'll get you guys a shirt
or something.

663
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:56,952
Ray, Dana's just come over
to my place.

664
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,950
Her tub tried to eat her.

665
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,522
What? Are you serious?

666
00:47:03,596 --> 00:47:05,029
That's great!

667
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:07,725
I mean, that's terrible.

668
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,234
But it's great for what we--

669
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:13,466
Yeah, I will.
Sure, we'll get right on it.

670
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:17,472
A major slime-related
psychokinetic event.

671
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,807
- What happened?
- Something came out of Dana's bathtub.

672
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,313
- It tried to grab her and the baby.
- Are they all right?

673
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,281
Yeah, she went to Venkman's.

674
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,808
This is interesting.
Remember the painting Venkman mentioned?

675
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,980
I ran Vigo the Carpathian
through the occult reference net.

676
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,922
Look what came up.

677
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,494
Nice ugly history.

678
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,760
You think there's a connection
between Vigo and the...

679
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:47,000
slime?

680
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:49,837
Is the atomic weight
of cobalt 58.9?

681
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:54,371
Let's go to Dana's.
I'd like to check out that bathtub.

682
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:57,382
It would be a good idea to go
to the museum in the morning...

683
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,384
get a look at that painting.

684
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,857
- Ray's checking out your place.
- He is?

685
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:09,223
I have held onto this
for a long time, Oscar.

686
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:11,763
I got this from a girl...

687
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:15,995
who got this
from Joe "Willie" Namath.

688
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:17,501
We don't want to know how.

689
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,563
So please don't hose this down...

690
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,631
or give it your personal rinse.

691
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:25,643
It's time for you
to start practicing...

692
00:48:25,711 --> 00:48:28,441
what we big guys call self-control.

693
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,474
Get out of here.
Look at him.

694
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:33,984
Look at his gut.

695
00:48:34,053 --> 00:48:35,782
He's a coconut.

696
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,890
You'll stay at Uncle Pete's
till this blows over.

697
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,485
This is your place now.

698
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,968
Hi. Come on in.
This is my place.

699
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,878
How are we going to handle
the sleeping arrangements?

700
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:10,081
It's best for me if I lie on my side
and you spoon up beside me...

701
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,885
your arm draped over me.

702
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:17,429
The other way, I get your hair
caught in my throat...

703
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,259
and I choke in the night.

704
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:23,597
How about you on the sofa
and me and the baby in the bed?

705
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,261
It's a way to go.

706
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:30,104
It's so late.
I really should put him down.

707
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,734
May I?

708
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,937
Yeah, if you want to.

709
00:49:34,046 --> 00:49:35,911
You're short...

710
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:37,972
your belly button
sticks out too far...

711
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,746
and you're a terrible burden
on your poor mother.

712
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:55,933
- Did you find anything at Dana's?
- Just some mood slime residue.

713
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:58,469
But I got something
on that Vigo character.

714
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,131
I found it in Leon Zundinger's
"Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen."

715
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,266
- Dig that.
- Vigo the Carpathian...

716
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:05,810
born 1505, died 1610.

717
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,812
105 years old.
He hung in there.

718
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,438
He didn't die of old age.

719
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,348
He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung,
disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

720
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,046
- Ouch.
- He wasn't too popular.

721
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:17,622
Not exactly a man of the people.

722
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,953
Also known as Vigo the Cruel,
Vigo the Torturer...

723
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,925
Vigo the Despised
and Vigo the Unholy.

724
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:25,623
- Wasn't he also Vigo the Butch?
- Dig this. There was also a prophecy.

725
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,289
Just before his head died...

726
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:30,301
his last words were,
"Death is but a door.

727
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:33,395
Time is but a window.
I'll be back."

728
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,380
Let's suck in the guts.
We're the Ghostbusters.

729
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,975
- Please go!
- Who's this wiggler?

730
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:47,575
He's yours. Sic him.

731
00:50:48,888 --> 00:50:51,652
How are you?
Ray Stantz from the Ghostbusters.

732
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:54,318
Beautiful lab here. We're just
doing a routine spook check.

733
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,827
- Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.
- Yeah, we know that.

734
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:01,094
- So why are you came?
- We heard there's a major creep here.

735
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,100
We checked our list,
and you were there.

736
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:06,535
Johnny, where in the hell
are you from?

737
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,005
The Upper West Side.

738
00:51:09,074 --> 00:51:10,939
The whole room's extremely hot.

739
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,207
- That's one ugly dude.
- Hot?

740
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,339
That's Mr. Vigo.

741
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,382
- Vigs, look this way, please.
- Don't.

742
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,010
- No.
- Show me something.

743
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:22,951
No photographs, please!

744
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:26,048
Slides are available
in the gift shop.

745
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,355
Thank you, Winston.

746
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,452
You know what?
Give me angry, will you?

747
00:51:31,564 --> 00:51:32,963
You've had a bad day.
You're cranky.

748
00:51:33,032 --> 00:51:35,865
Yeah. Thank you. Good.
Angrier.

749
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:38,699
You're scaring me.
Stop it. Yeah.

750
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:41,968
Good!
Walk for me, talk for me. Yeah!

751
00:51:43,108 --> 00:51:44,700
Give me hot and sexy.

752
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:46,540
Can you do it?
You can.

753
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:48,671
Oh, boy.
Show me some teeth.

754
00:51:48,747 --> 00:51:52,376
I bet the girls like you.
Do the girls? Do the guys?

755
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,009
I bet they both do.
Do the animals like you?

756
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:57,351
That's it! More!
Yeah, you're big!

757
00:51:57,456 --> 00:52:00,789
All right, destroy me!
Yeah!

758
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:05,028
Give it! Yeah!

759
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:07,031
We need to talk.

760
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:13,598
I've worked with better,
but not many. Thank you.

761
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,105
John, thanks.

762
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:20,741
You finished?

763
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:22,303
Yeah, I'm finished here.

764
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:24,905
- Are you all right?
- What?

765
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:27,953
- Are you coming down with something?
- Me?

766
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:39,430
Your prince.

767
00:52:53,178 --> 00:52:54,611
She cleaned.

768
00:52:58,183 --> 00:53:01,016
He's asleep.
Come here.

769
00:53:03,188 --> 00:53:05,622
What happened
with my apartment?

770
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,625
The guys spent
the whole night there.

771
00:53:07,693 --> 00:53:10,287
They went through
all your personal stuff.

772
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:12,330
They tried on some
of your clothes...

773
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:15,128
made some long-distance phone calls,
cleaned out the fridge--

774
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,100
Did they find anything?

775
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:19,694
They found a little
of that pink slime.

776
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:24,839
What should I do now?

777
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,472
You are supposed to get dressed
and get crazy with me.

778
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,483
- Peter, I don't think--
- This is exactly what you need.

779
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,987
I have got you a baby-sitter.
The whole thing's wired.

780
00:53:36,055 --> 00:53:38,489
I don't think we should
go out on a date.

781
00:53:38,557 --> 00:53:41,788
I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place...

782
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,658
with a strange person.

783
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,530
"Strange person"?
Janine Melnitz from my staff.

784
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:55,897
- Janine has experience baby-sitting?
- Here.

785
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:03,040
- Thank you.
- Here's some things from your apartment.

786
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,844
Some wardrobe choices.

787
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:07,852
A couple provocative ensembles.
I'll leave it up to you.

788
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,187
But after dinner, don't put any
of those cheap moves on me.

789
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:17,092
- It's different.
- I have all new cheap moves.

790
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:21,023
Hey, you!

791
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:26,697
It looks like you're awake.
You're awake.

792
00:54:26,772 --> 00:54:30,799
Yes, you'll have the whole place
to yourself tonight, pal.

793
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:32,707
It will be pretty neat.

794
00:54:32,778 --> 00:54:36,544
I got some Laura Antonelli tapes
you can watch.

795
00:54:36,615 --> 00:54:40,881
Did you see some shirts here
in the floor /bed area?

796
00:54:40,953 --> 00:54:44,047
- I put them in the hamper.
- I have a hamper?

797
00:54:44,123 --> 00:54:47,559
- Yes, in the bathroom.
- Neat.

798
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:52,928
- Tell me next time you do that.
- I thought they were dirty.

799
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:56,227
I have more than
two grades of laundry.

800
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:59,566
There's not just clean and dirty.
There are many subtle levels.

801
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:07,904
You hang this outside the window
for 20 minutes, it's perfectly fine.

802
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,744
Interesting role model for you.

803
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:18,749
They couldn't get to you
until after the New Year.

804
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:22,426
Just don't go in there.

805
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:27,465
I'm closing up.

806
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:33,438
Should I take the subway
or the surf ace roads? It's busy out.

807
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:35,598
I'm walking.
Good night.

808
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:39,807
Well, now hang on now.

809
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,780
Do you maybe want to--
No.

810
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:47,114
Do you want to have
something to eat with me?

811
00:55:47,186 --> 00:55:48,949
Yeah, I'd love that...

812
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:52,787
but I told Dr. Venkman
I'd baby-sit for him.

813
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,796
- Do you want to baby-sit with me?
- Okay, I would.

814
00:55:58,864 --> 00:56:02,129
- Great. His place at 8:00. Bye.
- All right.

815
00:56:02,201 --> 00:56:04,499
- I can get his address from the W2--
- Buddy, move!

816
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:13,538
We were right.

817
00:56:13,612 --> 00:56:15,637
Multi-planar Kirlian emanations.

818
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:17,978
Here's your next month's
cover of "GQ."

819
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,984
Check out the aura on this sucker.

820
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,778
There's definitely
a living presence there.

821
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:25,781
We should get a deeper look.

822
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:28,486
I'll run this shot
through the spectral analyzer.

823
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,824
Good. I'll try turning up
the Roentgens.

824
00:56:33,065 --> 00:56:35,499
What do you think?
Chinese?

825
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:38,502
- How about Thai?
- No, too spicy.

826
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,004
- Greek?
- Mexican?

827
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:43,007
- Pizza?
- Thin or thick?

828
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:44,508
Chicago.

829
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,514
What the hell is that?

830
00:56:52,851 --> 00:56:54,284
I know what it is.

831
00:56:56,922 --> 00:56:59,857
- I've seen it before.
- Where?

832
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:03,691
When you had me dangling like a worm
on a hook 100 feet below First Avenue.

833
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,657
That's the river of slime.

834
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:10,759
What in--

835
00:57:14,106 --> 00:57:17,564
- We need a blanket or a hose.
- Let's get out.

836
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,077
Why is this closed?

837
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,751
Fire! What are we gonna do,
put our heads in the toilet?

838
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,369
Taxi!

839
00:57:51,977 --> 00:57:55,037
It's great that you're here.
We've got incredible news.

840
00:57:55,147 --> 00:57:57,581
Can I have one try?

841
00:57:57,649 --> 00:58:00,083
All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night
at the Sizzler.

842
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:02,382
We analyzed the photos of Vigo.

843
00:58:02,454 --> 00:58:04,945
The spectrogram shows a river of slime
flowing behind him.

844
00:58:05,057 --> 00:58:09,391
We're going into the subway and sewer
system to trace the source of the flow.

845
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:11,053
Change your clothes.
We'll wait.

846
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:14,530
Egon thinks it might be a breeding
surge in the cockroach population.

847
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:17,966
Hi, boys.
What's up?

848
00:58:21,306 --> 00:58:25,072
The guys are going into the sewer
to check for slime.

849
00:58:25,143 --> 00:58:29,375
Egon thinks there may be a huge surge
in cockroach breeding.

850
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:32,417
Want to blow off dinner
and go with them?

851
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,382
Taxi!

852
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:42,927
Women. Huh?

853
00:58:52,337 --> 00:58:54,669
Will you watch your step?

854
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,638
I hate this.

855
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,646
According to this old transit map,
there should be an entrance near here.

856
00:59:02,714 --> 00:59:04,773
I'm not getting anything yet.

857
00:59:04,883 --> 00:59:08,944
At least it's too dark
to see the cockroaches.

858
00:59:09,021 --> 00:59:12,457
It's the subway rats
you have to worry about.

859
00:59:12,524 --> 00:59:14,048
Big as beavers.

860
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:16,390
Some of them
are four or five kilos.

861
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,053
Enough, all right?

862
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,463
Listen. You can hear them
behind the walls scratching.

863
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:23,865
There must be thousands.

864
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,802
- Just shut up about the rats.
- Okay.

865
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:31,672
Hello!

866
00:59:52,564 --> 00:59:53,997
I'm out of here.

867
01:00:09,414 --> 01:00:11,006
They're gone.

868
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:12,516
What the--

869
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:15,348
Before we go further,
we should get our proton packs.

870
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,853
Good idea.

871
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,826
- What's that?
- What's what?

872
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:32,131
Sounds like a train.

873
01:00:32,204 --> 01:00:35,935
Uh-uh. These lines have been
abandoned for 50 years.

874
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:52,548
Probably in a tunnel above us.

875
01:00:52,624 --> 01:00:54,717
I don't know.

876
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:57,387
It sounds awfully close to me.

877
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,082
That was the old New York Central
"City of Albany."

878
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,591
Derailed in 1920,
killed hundreds of people.

879
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:29,593
Did you catch the number
on the locomotive?

880
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:32,255
Sorry, I missed it.

881
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:38,097
Something's trying to stop us.
We must be close.

882
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,838
Where's Ray?

883
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:52,115
Guys!

884
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:55,278
- Sorry. I found it.
- What?

885
01:01:55,353 --> 01:01:57,287
- Right here there's a hole.
- Let's go.

886
01:01:57,355 --> 01:02:00,756
What about the packs?

887
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,408
Unbelievable.

888
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:23,439
Did I tell you?
I wasn't lying, was I?

889
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:28,979
It takes a lot of negative energy
to generate a flow this size.

890
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:31,614
New York. What a town.

891
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:35,689
Let's see how deep it is.
Get a sounding.

892
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:42,923
All right, six feet.

893
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,504
Twelve feet.
Maybe something's pulling it.

894
01:02:47,572 --> 01:02:51,235
- Hold on.
- I'm trying. Give me a hand!

895
01:02:53,078 --> 01:02:56,013
Something's got him!
Get his belt off !

896
01:02:56,081 --> 01:02:58,811
- We can't hold it!
- Wait! Hold on!

897
01:03:12,731 --> 01:03:14,824
A toast to...

898
01:03:14,933 --> 01:03:18,061
the most charming, kindest--

899
01:03:18,136 --> 01:03:21,401
- It's me.
- It's you.

900
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:24,340
And most unusual man...

901
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:26,206
I've ever broken up with.

902
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:39,521
Speaking of breaking up with neat guys,
why did you dump me?

903
01:03:39,591 --> 01:03:41,388
I didn't dump you.

904
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:44,690
I was protecting myself.

905
01:03:44,763 --> 01:03:49,132
You weren't very good for me.
You know that, don't you?

906
01:03:50,468 --> 01:03:52,060
I'm not even good for me.

907
01:03:52,137 --> 01:03:54,401
You're much better
than you realize.

908
01:03:54,472 --> 01:03:56,235
You don't give yourself
enough credit.

909
01:03:56,308 --> 01:03:57,866
I need to hear that.

910
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:02,072
If I had this kind of support
24 hours a day...

911
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:04,945
I could have myself whipped into shape
by the end of this century.

912
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:09,612
Why don't you give me a jingle
in the year 2000?

913
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:15,692
Why don't I give you a jingle
right now?

914
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:25,267
So the seven dwarves had a limited
partnership in a mining operation.

915
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:28,101
One day a beautiful princess
came to live with them.

916
01:04:28,173 --> 01:04:30,573
They bartered housekeeping services
for room and board...

917
01:04:30,642 --> 01:04:32,109
which was a good deal.

918
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:35,112
They didn't have to withhold
Social Security or taxes.

919
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,911
You're not supposed to do that, but for
the purposes of this story it's okay.

920
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:43,078
It really is a great place.
It needs a woman's touch.

921
01:04:43,154 --> 01:04:45,588
But it looks really good.

922
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:47,716
- You know--
- Bedtime.

923
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:54,931
- You're very good with children.
- Thanks. I practiced on my hamster.

924
01:04:57,569 --> 01:04:59,161
You live alone?

925
01:05:01,373 --> 01:05:05,332
I used to have a roommate,
but my mom moved to Florida.

926
01:05:08,046 --> 01:05:11,106
- Come over here and sit with me.
- Okay.

927
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:17,448
You want to play Boggle
or Super Mario Brothers?

928
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:23,456
I think motherhood
is a very natural instinct.

929
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:26,691
I'd like a child myself.

930
01:05:26,765 --> 01:05:28,289
Would you?

931
01:05:29,401 --> 01:05:30,800
Tonight?

932
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:53,653
Nice going, Ray.
Were you trying to drown me?

933
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:56,193
Like it was my fault...

934
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:58,729
that you were too stupid
not to drop that plumb line!

935
01:05:58,797 --> 01:06:01,322
Watch your mouth
or I'll punch your lights out!

936
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:04,300
- Yeah? Well, anytime! Come on!
- Right now!

937
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:06,701
It's go time! I want you bad!

938
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:11,970
- Grab me! Come on!
- Wait! Stop!

939
01:06:12,077 --> 01:06:14,341
Get your clothes off quick.

940
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:26,189
Ray, what were we doing?
I was ready to kill you.

941
01:06:26,257 --> 01:06:29,818
It's the stuff.
It's like pure, concentrated evil.

942
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:32,624
And it's all flowing
right to this spot.

943
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,533
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, he said Armand's.

944
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:47,169
- Excuse me--
- It's all right. We'll look in back.

945
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,877
Please get out of my restaurant.

946
01:06:55,954 --> 01:06:57,717
- Absolutely incredible!
- You cannot come in here!

947
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:01,555
The greatest tangible evidence
of psychic energy in years!

948
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:05,027
- You're disturbing my guests!
- Just a second.

949
01:07:05,096 --> 01:07:07,564
Boys, you're scaring the straights.

950
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,725
Can we do this tomorrow?

951
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:12,895
This won't wait.
It's hot, and it's ready to pop.

952
01:07:12,971 --> 01:07:15,098
- It's all over the city.
- Under it, actually.

953
01:07:15,173 --> 01:07:18,142
- Rivers of the stuff.
- It's all flowing to the museum.

954
01:07:20,545 --> 01:07:22,410
Look what he got all over me.

955
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,243
- What is this stuff?
- Sorry.

956
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:27,751
Oh, God.
You mean my museum?

957
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:31,721
I was going to tell you between
the dessert and the cheese course.

958
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:34,587
- There they are.
- You can never go back there.

959
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:38,254
- You'll have to find a new job.
- It's psychomagnotheric plasm.

960
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:41,264
It affects behavior.
We were fighting!

961
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:43,766
- We were in a fight!
- Had him by the throat.

962
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:47,161
We have to see the mayor.

963
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,623
- Ghostbusters.
- How you doing?

964
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,454
Come right this way.

965
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:13,297
You got another proton pack?
My kid brother wants one.

966
01:08:13,364 --> 01:08:16,856
- The proton pack is not a toy.
- He's right.

967
01:08:29,747 --> 01:08:33,308
Dana, we were just baby-sitting.
We watched TV and ate something.

968
01:08:33,384 --> 01:08:36,649
- Then one thing led to another.
- I know what you were doing.

969
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,484
I didn't know anything would happen.

970
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:40,820
Hi. How was your date?

971
01:08:40,892 --> 01:08:42,985
It wasn't a date.
It was just dinner.

972
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:45,188
- Where's Peter?
- He was arrested.

973
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,930
Typical.

974
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:51,725
- Did he call?
- Nobody called.

975
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:55,468
Is Oscar all right?

976
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,508
He's fine.

977
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:59,566
Such a good baby.

978
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:04,843
He was fussy at first,
then we gave him French bread pizza.

979
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,406
Passed right out.

980
01:09:08,586 --> 01:09:13,148
Good.
I'll just give him a look-see.

981
01:09:25,103 --> 01:09:27,037
You think we should go?

982
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:31,371
I don't know. I don't think
we should leave her alone.

983
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:33,376
You're right.
Let's stay.

984
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:40,447
Lenny! Big man!

985
01:09:40,518 --> 01:09:43,180
- Ghostbusters.
- Mr. Mayor.

986
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:47,520
What is this?
A slumber party?

987
01:09:47,592 --> 01:09:51,358
- That's what we're here to talk about.
- I don't want to hear about it.

988
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:55,932
You've got two minutes.
Make it good.

989
01:09:58,303 --> 01:10:02,205
First of all, Mr. Mayor,
it's a pleasure to see you again.

990
01:10:02,307 --> 01:10:05,606
Almost 50 percent of us voted for you
in the last election.

991
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:07,872
I appreciate that.

992
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:11,005
Sorry we have to meet
under these circumstances.

993
01:10:11,115 --> 01:10:14,573
We're here tonight because
a psychomagnotheric slime flow...

994
01:10:14,652 --> 01:10:16,984
is building up beneath the city.

995
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:18,920
Psycho what?

996
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:20,423
- Psychomagnotheric.
- Big word.

997
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:22,584
Negative human emotions
are materializing in the form...

998
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,460
of a viscous plasm
with explosive supernormal potential.

999
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:30,265
- Does anybody speak English here?
- Yeah.

1000
01:10:30,368 --> 01:10:33,428
We're trying to tell you
all the bad feelings...

1001
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:37,133
all the hate and anger of this city
is turning into this sludge.

1002
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,971
I didn't believe it either...

1003
01:10:39,077 --> 01:10:42,911
but we went for a swim in it
and almost killed each other.

1004
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,244
This is insane.
Do we have to listen to this?

1005
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,514
Can't you stop your lips from flapping
for two little minutes?

1006
01:10:49,587 --> 01:10:52,784
Lenny, have you been out
on the street lately?

1007
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:55,917
Do you know how weird it is out there?
We've taken a head count.

1008
01:10:56,027 --> 01:10:58,621
There seem to be three million...

1009
01:10:58,696 --> 01:11:02,427
completely miserable assholes
living in the tristate area.

1010
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,094
Please.

1011
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:07,763
I beg your pardon.
Three million and one.

1012
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:11,364
Budgy-brain here doesn't realize
if we don't do something fast...

1013
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:14,172
this whole place will blow
like a frog on a hot plate.

1014
01:11:14,245 --> 01:11:17,476
- Yeah, right.
- What am I supposed to do?

1015
01:11:17,548 --> 01:11:19,607
Go on television
and tell ten million people...

1016
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:22,277
they have to be nice
to each other?

1017
01:11:24,188 --> 01:11:26,952
Being miserable
and treating other people like dirt...

1018
01:11:27,024 --> 01:11:29,618
is every New Yorker's
God-given right.

1019
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:33,455
Your two minutes are up.
Good night, gentlemen.

1020
01:11:33,531 --> 01:11:35,795
- Wait!
- You're making a big mistake!

1021
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,663
You're making
a very newsworthy mistake.

1022
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:40,704
The "Times" will be interested,
and you know the "Post"--

1023
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:42,171
Whoa!

1024
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,300
- "Mayor Hides Slime."
- "Time Square Slime."

1025
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,207
"Slime Square."

1026
01:11:47,278 --> 01:11:49,143
Fine.

1027
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:51,807
Before you go running off
to the newspapers with this...

1028
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:56,080
would you consider telling this slime
business to our people downtown?

1029
01:11:57,922 --> 01:11:59,981
It must be done right away.

1030
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:02,992
You know the expression, "It all
comes back"? It's gonna come back!

1031
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,824
This city's in danger!
The whole state! The whole world!

1032
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:10,333
- All we want to do is help!
- I'm warning you. Come on, let's go.

1033
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:13,996
The mayor wants them kept under strict
observation for the next few days.

1034
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:17,666
We think they're seriously disturbed
and potentially dangerous.

1035
01:12:17,775 --> 01:12:20,539
- We'll do whatever is necessary.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1036
01:12:24,749 --> 01:12:28,344
I await the words of Vigo.

1037
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:32,514
l, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia...

1038
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:34,352
You've told me this.

1039
01:12:34,459 --> 01:12:36,359
the sorrow of Moldavia...

1040
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:38,019
Sorrow.
I've heard all of this.

1041
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:39,585
command you.

1042
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:41,858
Command me, lord.

1043
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:47,064
The season of evil begins
with the birth of the new year.

1044
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:48,696
Good.

1045
01:12:48,773 --> 01:12:52,368
Bring me the child,
that I might live again.

1046
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:53,876
Yes.

1047
01:12:56,948 --> 01:12:58,540
Lord Vigo...

1048
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:01,880
I was wondering.

1049
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:06,889
This woman, Dana,
is fine and strong.

1050
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:10,860
Now, if I...

1051
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:15,228
was to bring that baby...

1052
01:13:15,299 --> 01:13:17,563
could I have that woman?

1053
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,239
So be it.

1054
01:13:22,306 --> 01:13:27,403
On this day of darkness,
she will be ours:

1055
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:29,241
wife to you...

1056
01:13:29,313 --> 01:13:32,476
and mother to me.

1057
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,073
Yes!

1058
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:36,381
Thank you, lord!

1059
01:13:39,724 --> 01:13:44,252
- Is she the killer or what?
- No, that's Rita Hayworth.

1060
01:13:44,328 --> 01:13:47,593
She was married to Citizen Kane
while they were doing this thing.

1061
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:51,761
Right after they finished,
she dumped him for some polo player.

1062
01:13:51,836 --> 01:13:56,603
I don't know why beautiful women
love horses so much. Do you love horses?

1063
01:13:56,674 --> 01:14:00,110
You don't have to stay.
Peter will be back soon.

1064
01:14:00,177 --> 01:14:02,111
We don't mind.

1065
01:14:02,179 --> 01:14:05,273
- Can you see okay?
- Yep.

1066
01:14:58,169 --> 01:14:59,602
Oh, God!

1067
01:15:04,742 --> 01:15:07,609
- What?
- It's Oscar!

1068
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,581
Call 911 right now!

1069
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:02,225
- God, it was a ghost!
- No, that was Janosz.

1070
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:05,234
- He took him.
- What's happening?

1071
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,065
- What should we do?
- Where's the baby?

1072
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:08,571
The museum!

1073
01:16:09,807 --> 01:16:13,334
- Where are you going?
- To get my baby!

1074
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:15,777
We have to find the guys.

1075
01:16:16,881 --> 01:16:18,746
As I explained before...

1076
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:21,751
we think the spirit
of a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant...

1077
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:25,915
is alive and well in a painting
in the Manhattan Museum of Art.

1078
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:29,756
Are there any other paintings
in the museum with bad spirits in them?

1079
01:16:29,827 --> 01:16:31,385
You're wasting valuable time.

1080
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:36,762
He's drawing strength from a slime flow
collecting under the city.

1081
01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:39,928
- Yes, tell me about the slime.
- It's very potent.

1082
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:42,939
We made a toaster dance with it.

1083
01:16:43,007 --> 01:16:45,441
And a bathtub tried
to eat his friend's baby.

1084
01:16:45,509 --> 01:16:46,942
A bathtub?

1085
01:16:48,045 --> 01:16:51,037
Don't look at me.
I think they're nuts.

1086
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:15,364
Sweetheart.

1087
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:22,231
I thought I'd lost you,
that I'd never see you again.

1088
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,869
- Oh, baby.
- Hello, Dana.

1089
01:18:26,944 --> 01:18:29,174
I thought you might come.

1090
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,113
You stay away from us.
I mean it.

1091
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:34,515
Don't worry.
He will not be harmed.

1092
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,519
He has been chosen...

1093
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:41,024
to be the vessel
of the spirit of Vigo.

1094
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:45,892
You will be the mother
of the ruler of the world.

1095
01:18:45,963 --> 01:18:50,525
- Doesn't that sound nice?
- No, it sounds ludicrous.

1096
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,365
You stay away from him.
I mean it.

1097
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:57,032
I don't think we have a choice here.
Take a look.

1098
01:18:57,141 --> 01:19:01,077
It's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy.
He is Vigo.

1099
01:19:01,145 --> 01:19:05,275
I don't care who he is.
You can't take my baby.

1100
01:19:15,593 --> 01:19:17,060
You bastard!

1101
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,113
Is this a big dinosaur
or a little dinosaur?

1102
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,281
It's just a skeleton.
Which way was it heading?

1103
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:25,124
What was chasing you in the park?
The park bench? I see.

1104
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,789
What? Wait a second.

1105
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,129
Lieutenant, I think
you better talk to this guy.

1106
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,633
I'm busy here.

1107
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,466
It's some dock supervisor
at Pier 34.

1108
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:35,971
What's the problem?

1109
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,668
He says the "Titanic"
just arrived.

1110
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:50,145
Well, better late than never.

1111
01:20:54,358 --> 01:20:57,657
We're swamped. We've had more than
3,000 calls since midnight last night.

1112
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:01,664
We've got every officer on the streets,
and I'm still shorthanded.

1113
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,825
Meter maids are chasing ghosts
all over midtown.

1114
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,665
There's this shell thing
over the Manhattan Museum of Art.

1115
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,329
We can't make a dent.

1116
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,839
- Have you tried dynamite?
- We've tried everything.

1117
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:14,002
What's going on?
It's pandemonium out there.

1118
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,171
Yes, I know.
We're working on it.

1119
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,339
While you're "working on it,"
I'm going down in history...

1120
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:22,681
as the mayor who let New York
get sucked into the tenth level of hell!

1121
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:25,017
We've got no choice.
Call the Ghostbusters.

1122
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,023
Wait!

1123
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,685
I'm sure there's another way.

1124
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,629
Jack, I spent an hour last night
talking to Fiorello La Guardia...

1125
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:37,531
and he's been dead for 40 years.

1126
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,796
Where are the Ghostbusters?

1127
01:21:42,373 --> 01:21:45,774
- They're not available.
- What do you mean?

1128
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:52,177
I had them committed to the psychiatric
ward at Parkview Hospital.

1129
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:54,012
You what?

1130
01:21:54,084 --> 01:21:57,053
They threatened to go to the press.
I was protecting your interests.

1131
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,215
Yeah?
Stop protecting my interests.

1132
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,726
You have exactly three minutes
to clear out. You're fired!

1133
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,388
- But the election--
- Harry, remove this man.

1134
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,398
- You're making a mistake.
- Get me the Ghostbusters!

1135
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,401
Mr. Mayor, look at this.

1136
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:18,931
What is it?
Have you ever seen anything like that?

1137
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,752
Somebody get me the Ghostbusters.

1138
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:41,093
He put the baby in a carriage,
then they levitated away.

1139
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,931
- Where did Dana go?
- She went to the museum to get the baby.

1140
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:48,768
Then there was an eclipse. The whole
town went dark, and everybody's nuts.

1141
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,774
It all fits.
Vigo wants in on the 21st century.

1142
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,276
He needs a human body to inhabit.
Oscar must be it.

1143
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,507
- And we're the only ones who can help.
- You bet we are.

1144
01:23:33,517 --> 01:23:36,452
It looks like a giant Jell-O mold.

1145
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,987
I hate Jell-O.

1146
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,285
There's always room for Jell-O.

1147
01:23:44,194 --> 01:23:46,560
Soon it will be midnight.

1148
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,963
The city will be mine and Vigo's.

1149
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:52,831
Mainly Vigo's.

1150
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:59,198
We have a terrific opportunity
to make the best of this relationship.

1151
01:23:59,276 --> 01:24:01,642
We don't have a relationship.

1152
01:24:01,712 --> 01:24:06,547
I know. Marry me. Together,
we will raise Vigo as our son.

1153
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,979
Let me tell you something here.

1154
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:16,515
There are many perks in being
the mother of a living god.

1155
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:19,323
I'm sure we could get
a magnificent apartment...

1156
01:24:19,396 --> 01:24:22,365
a car, free parking.

1157
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:27,999
Many marriages begin
with a certain amount of distance.

1158
01:24:28,071 --> 01:24:29,663
Yet I think that...

1159
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:33,971
you and I could learn
to love each other.

1160
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:37,944
Yes.

1161
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,080
I could learn.

1162
01:24:51,695 --> 01:24:53,629
Pull them.

1163
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:56,832
Full neutronas.

1164
01:24:59,069 --> 01:25:01,537
Let's cook!

1165
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,112
Save them.

1166
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,063
That slime wall
is pulsing with evil.

1167
01:25:29,132 --> 01:25:31,896
It would take a tremendous amount
of positive energy to crack that shell.

1168
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:34,563
I doubt there's enough goodwill
in this town...

1169
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,901
to do it.

1170
01:25:36,974 --> 01:25:40,239
Are things so bad in this city
that there's no way back?

1171
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,404
Sure, it's dirty, crowded,
polluted, noisy...

1172
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,745
and there's people who would rather
step on your face as look at you...

1173
01:25:47,818 --> 01:25:49,752
but come on!

1174
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,983
There must be a few sparks
of humanity left in this burg.

1175
01:25:53,056 --> 01:25:56,548
- We just have to mobilize it.
- He's right.

1176
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:59,629
We need something that everybody
can get behind. We need...

1177
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,565
a symbol.

1178
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,570
Something that appeals
to the best in each of us.

1179
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,276
- Something good.
- Something decent.

1180
01:26:14,344 --> 01:26:16,312
Something pure.

1181
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,188
- Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- Wonder what?

1182
01:26:33,297 --> 01:26:36,630
Whether she's naked
under that toga.

1183
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,669
She's French.
You know that.

1184
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:43,802
Got it.
Ready with the speakers.

1185
01:26:43,874 --> 01:26:45,341
Slime blowers ready?

1186
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:48,469
Internal audio set.
Internal electric set.

1187
01:26:48,545 --> 01:26:50,809
Slime blower primed and set.

1188
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:54,339
Good slime.
Is our slime in a good mood tonight?

1189
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,818
I hope so.
She's a lot bigger than a toaster.

1190
01:26:56,887 --> 01:26:58,821
- All yours. Let's go.
- Thank you.

1191
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:02,347
Testing, one, two. How many of you
are a national monument?

1192
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,986
Raise your hand, please.
Hello, miss.

1193
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:07,656
- Let's frost it.
- It's slime time.

1194
01:27:16,506 --> 01:27:17,939
Beautiful.

1195
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,723
Pilot controls are ready.

1196
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:38,192
It's getting late.
It's almost midnight. Let's go.

1197
01:27:38,261 --> 01:27:42,857
Here's something off the request line
from Liberty Island!

1198
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:46,460
We're gonna squeeze some
New Year's juice from you, Big Apple.

1199
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:49,204
You know your love

1200
01:27:49,272 --> 01:27:50,864
Your love keeps liftin' me

1201
01:27:50,941 --> 01:27:53,876
- Keeps on liftin' me
- Love keeps liftin' me

1202
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:55,571
- Higher
- Liftin' me

1203
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,636
Higher and higher

1204
01:28:35,485 --> 01:28:38,579
Imagine people's faces
when we come on shore.

1205
01:28:38,655 --> 01:28:42,091
This should get the city's
positive energy flowing.

1206
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,922
Keep kicking, Libby.

1207
01:28:43,994 --> 01:28:47,987
Make this work, we'll pop for a weekend
in Vegas with the Jolly Green Giant.

1208
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:02,171
You look fantastic in this.

1209
01:29:04,281 --> 01:29:06,613
I was born to wear this stuff.

1210
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,494
This equipment is heavy.

1211
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,674
I'm so glad

1212
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:35,643
I finally found you

1213
01:29:35,712 --> 01:29:40,979
You're that one in a million girl

1214
01:29:41,051 --> 01:29:45,613
And now with
my lovin' arms around you

1215
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:47,816
It's a lovefest, New York!

1216
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:50,121
- Sing it out!
- Come on!

1217
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:09,244
Your love

1218
01:30:09,312 --> 01:30:12,338
- Is lifting me higher
- You sing!

1219
01:30:19,723 --> 01:30:22,851
- We're running out of time.
- Can't you go faster?

1220
01:30:22,926 --> 01:30:25,156
The vibrations
will shake her to pieces.

1221
01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:28,686
- We should have padded her feet.
- They don't make Nikes in her size.

1222
01:30:28,765 --> 01:30:32,201
Don't worry. She's tough.
She's a harbor chick!

1223
01:30:37,107 --> 01:30:39,598
Sorry! My fault!

1224
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:42,377
Happy New Year.

1225
01:30:43,446 --> 01:30:45,209
Stay fit. Keep sharp.

1226
01:30:45,282 --> 01:30:47,216
Make good decisions.

1227
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,953
Oh, good.

1228
01:30:58,328 --> 01:30:59,989
It's you.

1229
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:04,491
Okay, but I didn't know
you had your license.

1230
01:31:05,602 --> 01:31:07,194
Four minutes to go...

1231
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:09,602
and then party time.

1232
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:21,482
It's happening.

1233
01:31:22,819 --> 01:31:24,582
It's really happening.

1234
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:34,687
Go away from here!

1235
01:31:39,502 --> 01:31:42,767
- I love you when you roughhouse!
- Hit it, Mama!

1236
01:31:42,839 --> 01:31:45,603
- Drop the hammer on her!
- Go! Do it now!

1237
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,852
- Oscar, look.
- Go away!

1238
01:32:05,862 --> 01:32:08,695
- Don't you know who this is?
- Happy New Year.

1239
01:32:08,765 --> 01:32:13,702
He's Vigo! You are like
the buzzing of flies to him!

1240
01:32:16,539 --> 01:32:20,134
Johnny, you backed the wrong horse.
Hose him, please.

1241
01:32:33,223 --> 01:32:35,350
- One down.
- On the ground.

1242
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:41,292
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1243
01:32:44,734 --> 01:32:49,364
- Is he dead?
- No, this slime is positively charged.

1244
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,464
He'll wake up feeling
like a million bucks.

1245
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:54,009
This gentleman is a little ripe.

1246
01:32:54,077 --> 01:32:56,705
That's all right, my friend.
I think I had an accident too.

1247
01:33:15,932 --> 01:33:17,331
Get him away!

1248
01:33:18,601 --> 01:33:21,661
Get a knife
to cut her out of this!

1249
01:33:24,074 --> 01:33:27,737
Listen. You need to stay right here.
Don't move.

1250
01:33:27,844 --> 01:33:31,974
Uncle Pete has to help your mom.
Stay here and don't say anything.

1251
01:33:46,563 --> 01:33:48,861
Hold it, deadhead!

1252
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:54,795
You want a baby?
Go knock up some willing hellhound!

1253
01:33:54,904 --> 01:33:56,895
Otherwise,
get back in that painting...

1254
01:33:56,973 --> 01:33:58,440
where you belong!

1255
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:02,842
- One!
- Two.

1256
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:07,582
Three!

1257
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:10,781
You got him!

1258
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:19,186
Oh, that was really stupid.

1259
01:34:21,831 --> 01:34:27,463
- Ray, can you move?
- No. Are you okay?

1260
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:34,201
- Venkman, how are you?
- I'm fine.

1261
01:34:53,163 --> 01:34:55,791
Please, do something!

1262
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,865
Not so fast, Vigo!

1263
01:35:01,504 --> 01:35:03,028
You, the bimbo with the baby.

1264
01:35:05,008 --> 01:35:07,101
The big shoulder look is out.

1265
01:35:07,177 --> 01:35:11,113
You know, I have met
some dumb blondes in my life...

1266
01:35:11,181 --> 01:35:13,615
but you take the taco, pal.

1267
01:35:15,852 --> 01:35:20,289
Only a Carpathian
would come back to life now...

1268
01:35:20,356 --> 01:35:22,324
and choose New York.

1269
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,156
Tasty pick, bonehead!

1270
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:28,288
If you had brain one...

1271
01:35:28,364 --> 01:35:32,232
in that huge melon
on top of your neck...

1272
01:35:32,302 --> 01:35:35,294
you would be living
the sweet life...

1273
01:35:35,371 --> 01:35:37,635
out in Southern California's...

1274
01:35:37,707 --> 01:35:40,733
beautiful San Fernando Valley.

1275
01:35:46,549 --> 01:35:49,450
Oh, darn it.

1276
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:53,246
Now we become one.

1277
01:36:01,764 --> 01:36:04,858
- Where's that singing coming from?
- The people outside.

1278
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:16,337
Excuse me. Ghostbusters.

1279
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:24,010
I'm here with you, guys.

1280
01:36:30,393 --> 01:36:33,556
He's weakening! The singing
is neutralizing the slime!

1281
01:36:34,898 --> 01:36:35,956
I can move!

1282
01:36:45,909 --> 01:36:47,774
Sweetie!

1283
01:36:52,949 --> 01:36:54,678
He's back in the painting!

1284
01:36:57,654 --> 01:36:59,918
Go find a shady spot.

1285
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:11,964
Vigie, you have been
a bad monkey.

1286
01:37:17,807 --> 01:37:19,968
We'd like to shoot the monster.
Move, please.

1287
01:37:23,646 --> 01:37:26,945
l, Ray, am Vigo,
and rule the Earth!

1288
01:37:27,016 --> 01:37:30,577
- Be gone, you pitiful half-men!
- Now!

1289
01:38:04,821 --> 01:38:07,790
- I did it!
- That was great!

1290
01:38:07,857 --> 01:38:10,189
- I'm a Ghostbuster!
- I loved it!

1291
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:14,286
- You all right?
- Come on, get up. Let's get this off.

1292
01:38:14,364 --> 01:38:16,764
Here. Here we go.

1293
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:21,901
- How do you feel?
- Groovy.

1294
01:38:23,006 --> 01:38:25,770
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

1295
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,143
Spread out, shorty.

1296
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:38,145
I love you guys.

1297
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:40,781
- I love all you guys.
- Great.

1298
01:38:40,857 --> 01:38:43,155
- And I love Venkman.
- Let's go.

1299
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:44,784
- Wow.
- We have to live with this?

1300
01:38:44,861 --> 01:38:46,488
- Real friendship.
- Yeah.

1301
01:38:51,401 --> 01:38:53,335
Are you all right?

1302
01:38:54,871 --> 01:38:56,964
Why am I dripping with goo?

1303
01:38:57,073 --> 01:39:00,634
You had a violent, prolonged,
transformative psychic episode.

1304
01:39:00,743 --> 01:39:03,610
Sorry we had to hose you,
but you were out of control.

1305
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,639
Hey, man...

1306
01:39:06,716 --> 01:39:08,479
let me tell you something.

1307
01:39:08,584 --> 01:39:10,347
I love you.

1308
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,978
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1309
01:39:12,088 --> 01:39:13,988
I love you too.

1310
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,959
Fellas.

1311
01:39:19,062 --> 01:39:20,962
Take a look at this.

1312
01:39:27,904 --> 01:39:29,838
Early Renaissance, I think.

1313
01:39:29,906 --> 01:39:33,501
Raphael or Piero della Francesca.

1314
01:39:33,576 --> 01:39:36,443
No, I believe it's one
of the Fettucine's.

1315
01:39:39,282 --> 01:39:40,840
Ghostbusters
