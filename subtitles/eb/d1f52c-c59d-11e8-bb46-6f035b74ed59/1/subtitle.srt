4
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:12,698
There once lived a mean
cuckoo guy named Young-Dal.

5
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:21,941
His wife died giving birth to
their daughter Il-mae.

6
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:27,282
Since then, it was my mother who
breast fed her and raised her.

7
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:44,361
From our birth on,
she was my destined partner
who stole half of my milk.

8
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,711
That's how
my first love began.

9
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,248
Crazy First Love

10
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,192
Teacher, can we stay closer?

11
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,759
You punks! Keep your distance!

12
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:57,866
You all are a bunch of animals
with too much testosterone.

13
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,435
Tes... what? What's that?

14
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:07,817
Joo, Young-dal must keep
his words with Sohn Tae-il!

15
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:15,617
My dear ladies!

16
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,892
You all know me, right?

17
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:24,103
Sophomore at Kang High School
Class 7, number 58

18
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,104
SOHN Tae-il!!

19
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:32,177
Promises are supposed to be kept.

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:39,383
Especially, words from a teacher
who is a role model!

21
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:45,848
How can he break his promise?

22
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,326
At this moment,

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:58,728
In the presence of Buddha, Jesus
and all other Gods in the world,

24
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:06,371
I accuse Mr. JOO Young-dal,

25
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:14,684
a teacher at Kang High,
of breaking his solemn promise!

26
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,382
10 years ago,

27
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,026
our teacher Mr. JOO promised me,

28
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:28,730
"Just wait till you have some
hairs on your balls!

29
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:35,399
When that happens, you can marry
my daughter Il-mae!"

30
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:45,642
Il-mae! My pubic hair started
growing when I was thirteen!

31
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:52,825
So, I ran to your dad
right away.

32
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,555
"Look! I have the pubic hair

33
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,066
Now, hand over Il-mae
like you promised!"

34
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,592
But, what did you say? Teacher?

35
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,970
"That's not it!

36
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:17,408
It's just hair attached to your body.
You wanna see my real ones?"

37
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:27,689
Fine. Let's just say it was just hair.

38
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:36,133
But now, tell me what
covers me down there.

39
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:42,402
You wanna call them a bunch
of black threads?

40
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:50,139
Teacher, do you wanna
check it out?

41
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,411
Show us! Show us!

42
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:16,536
Il-mae! Look!

43
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,577
Do they look like threads to you?

44
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,303
Testosterone is a type of
male hormone...

45
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,782
that can turn a normal kid like Tae-il

46
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,786
into a wild animal in a snap!

47
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,651
- Ready?
- Ready.

48
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,821
Let's go!

49
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,359
What the...?

50
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,754
- Boss!
- Kneel down!

51
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:51,536
Was it you that broke into
my territory and beat up

52
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,333
my boys in open daylight?
and beat up my boys?

53
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,637
What do you want?

54
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,838
I'm a righteous warrior!

55
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,773
You little shit.

56
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,387
You're from Kang High?

57
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,529
So am I. Is that why you're here?

58
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,265
Cut the bullshit.
Are you gonna take me in or not?

59
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,152
Are you gonna take me in or not?

60
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,519
How's Mr. JOO?

61
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,928
Why the hell did you bring up
his name?

62
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,338
Stay still!

63
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:20,757
Teacher, what's happening to
our school?

64
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:27,698
I'm a gangster now, but
I graduated high school though.

65
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:33,171
Teach them a lesson!
Especially that curly hair!

66
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,672
48th year class
Byun, Kang-chul!

67
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,975
Yes, sir.

68
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,569
Get down!

69
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,646
What?

70
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:49,052
Because of little shits like you
these kids wanna be gangsters.

71
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,653
Listen! Urgent news!

72
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,822
- Tae-il from Kang High...
- What about him?

73
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,232
He went to the boss of the market
area and asked him to take him in.

74
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:08,262
- For real?
- But the boss told Il-mae's
dad on him

75
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,300
and now he's getting
his ass whipped.

76
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,345
Pants down!

77
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,554
On your stomach!

78
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:43,573
Do you guys hear my heart?

79
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,704
It's crying out in pain.

80
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,574
Ouch! Ouch!

81
00:10:53,586 --> 00:11:00,253
If my heart hurts this much, then
how would your parents feel?

82
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,387
Right, Tae-il?

83
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:10,258
You haven't changed a bit, sir.
I'm so happy to see you again.

84
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:16,302
Your mother works so hard
selling fish at the marketplace to...

85
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,368
Feed me and to send me to school.
So what?

86
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,614
You little brat!

87
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,148
Are you giving me dirty look
during my admonition?

88
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,283
You wanna lose your eyes?

89
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,363
Sir, I apologize.

90
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,877
Even an animal like a crow
appreciates the love of its parents.

91
00:11:53,946 --> 00:12:01,443
Then what bird are you, teacher?
You didn't keep your words.

92
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,685
What did you say?

93
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:22,366
You think I sold fish at the market
to make you a gang?

94
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,371
Il-mae! What did you eat to grow?

95
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,207
Milk.

96
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,275
What kind of milk? Cow milk?

97
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,019
No. Your breast milk.

98
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:44,854
After all I've done for you,
how could you seduce my son?

99
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,527
Ma'am, you got it wrong.
Il-mae didn't do anything.

100
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,540
She ruined my boy's life...

101
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,848
Go inside.

102
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:10,615
Teacher, why don't you just expel him
from school?

103
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:19,320
He's only causing more trouble
staying in school...

104
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:43,549
Look at me.
You can't even look at me.

105
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,852
Pretty embarrassing, huh?

106
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,430
Face is busted by a gang and
ass is whipped by my dad,

107
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,056
and your back is beaten
by your mother.

108
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,928
Let me see your back!

109
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,959
Why do you live like this?

110
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:29,865
I'm gonna show him...

111
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,369
how his unkept promise
brings me down.

112
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,432
You're crazy!

113
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,303
What am I supposed to do?

114
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,040
You rank in top 3,000 nationwide
but I'm not even in top 300,000.

115
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,244
And everyday, you get prettier
and I get uglier.

116
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,543
You're slipping away from me
and... Shit!

117
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,916
There's nothing I can do

118
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,225
What am I supposed to do with you?

119
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,160
Shut up! Stop whining!

120
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,140
...even when you're angry,
you look beautiful.

121
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,777
What?

122
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,144
When I think of your pretty face,
I can't control myself!

123
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,812
I can't sleep nor eat!

124
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:32,395
When I open a book,
the words turn into your face!

125
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:39,630
You're so goddamn pretty and my
body is boiling with hot blood.

126
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,501
What am I supposed to do?

127
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,017
I've never seen a student
as unruly as Sohn Tae-il.

128
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:05,464
And what's worse is that
our naive students worship him,

129
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:14,270
and it'll keep creating someone
just like him.

130
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:23,111
it's time to pull out our swords
and eliminate the bad wolf!

131
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,241
We agree with you, Mr. Principal.

132
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,653
Let's hear from his homeroom teacher.

133
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:41,388
Every teenager has a bit of wolf
within himself.

134
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,568
To achieve peace in our school,
we should take this chance

135
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:58,482
to emasculate them all!
Even the sheepish kids!

136
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,383
Testosterone!!

137
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,252
Teacher, you'll pick a husband
for Il-mae through open contest?

138
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,420
For real? Awesome!

139
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,485
Shit!

140
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,162
Teacher! Isn't she Tae-il's girl?

141
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,436
Since he entered high school,
suspended from school 3 times!

142
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,439
Disciplinary confinement 7 times!
Lewdness in public

143
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:39,886
Intoxication, unlawful entry
and attempted kidnapping

144
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,051
Plus, he's in the bottom
with an IQ of 148 and

145
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,057
preoccupied with joining a gangster.

146
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,400
If you were in my shoes, would
you give your daughter to him?

147
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,030
No way!

148
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,407
Teacher!
What are the requirements?

149
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,016
Requirements? It can be anyone

150
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,551
Just improve your scores
up to my daughter's.

151
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,919
The day you bring me
your report card,

152
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,590
you will marry my daughter.
Understood?

153
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,598
Yes, sir!

154
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,106
Yes? You got a question?

155
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:42,978
As a man to man! One on one!

156
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,757
Are you challenging me?

157
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,888
Why? You scared?

158
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,977
Where are you going?
You challenged me!

159
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,407
Here I come!

160
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,833
You little punk!

161
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,144
You're nothing!

162
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,417
You can't even swing one punch.

163
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,352
How dare you want my daughter?

164
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,560
- Teacher!
- I'm here.

165
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,272
- Teacher!
- That's water.

166
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:23,619
I'd rather die with you
than lose her to someone.

167
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,080
You are unbelievable

168
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,587
You said you're gonna be a fisherman,
but can't even swim!

169
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,159
You're hopeless!

170
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,891
Teacher, what do I have to do?

171
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,567
Please tell me what I have to do.

172
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,402
to beat 300,000 kids in 2 years.

173
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,246
Please tell me!

174
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,083
Give it up!

175
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:37,622
I'll die if you ask me to die
Please tell me!

176
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,392
It won't happen to someone like you

177
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,964
Teacher, please tell me!

178
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,569
I said, it won't.

179
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,976
It's impossible! Impossible!

180
00:21:56,048 --> 00:22:02,544
Ouch! What are you hitting me?
It stings!

181
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,488
Sleep only 3 hours a day.

182
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:16,933
Then, in 3 days, you will nosebleed.

183
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,336
If you nosebleed everyday
till you graduate,

184
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,537
Then my girl will be yours.
I guarantee!

185
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:33,177
Teacher, I'll nosebleed everyday.

186
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,649
Il-mae is mine.

187
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:44,123
You can't give her
to anybody else. Ok? Dad?

188
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,826
I got it.

189
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,099
Gees... You're so heavy.

190
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,094
You see the spot I'm on

191
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,490
Marked with white paint?

192
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,296
Yes, teacher!

193
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,269
This is the spot,

194
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,004
where you freshmen's proud 6 year
senior SOHN Tae-il fell down

195
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:42,215
bleeding from both nostrils with
college exam scores in his hand.

196
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:59,999
That's when I found out
a man can survive

197
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,768
way too much nosebleeding.

198
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:13,617
You all know the proud tradition
of our Kang High, right?

199
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,947
Yes, sir!

200
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,412
Say it!

201
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,926
One! We don't have
guidance department!

202
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:22,957
And?

203
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,158
One! We're the worst enemy
of the Red Cross!

204
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,166
That's how it happened!

205
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,840
When Tae-il made top 3,000,

206
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,401
and got early accepted to Seoul
National University,

207
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:47,578
our principal said to the
Department of Education,

208
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,955
"Our students study so hard and
nosebleed everyday,

209
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,453
they don't have any blood to
donate!

210
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:10,101
From now on, Kang High is the
worst enemy of the Red Cross!"

211
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,646
Goddamn persistent kid!
Worse than a leech!

212
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,086
Father in-law!

213
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:36,834
Let's set the wedding date...
dad?

214
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:49,338
First, go to college.

215
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,213
Welcome! Welcome!
This is Seoul National University!

216
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,985
My school!

217
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,227
I got into the law school,
like you told me to.

218
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,771
So, let me marry her now!

219
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,875
Il-mae's college expels students
who get married before graduating.

220
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,513
You're joking, right?

221
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,050
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

222
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:37,186
Now I'm in a law school, he's gonna
ask me to pass the bar exam,

223
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,889
Then finish the judicial trainings
And after that,

224
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,864
who knows what excuse
he's gonna come up with.

225
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,463
SOHN Tae-il!! Stop right there!

226
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,970
Where are we going?

227
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,780
Let's do it! Let's make a baby!

228
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,784
Are you crazy?

229
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,215
What?

230
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:11,290
I can't betray my dad like that!

231
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,389
What about me, then?

232
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,941
Math workbook pg.216, #14-8!

233
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,414
What are all critical points,
if there are any, of a function

234
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:37,320
where k (t) equals to one divide by
the square root of "t" minus

235
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,550
squared positive one?

236
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,852
Answer!

237
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,486
its critical point is
(0, 1).

238
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:52,263
Buddha, the God of Mercy...

239
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,518
Name, SOHN Tae-il!

240
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,429
Il-mae!

241
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,101
Il-mae!

242
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,745
Is he ok?

243
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,917
Exactly then, you know
what your father said to me?

244
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,448
"C'mon, Tae-il!
Just a bit more!"

245
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:53,020
What am I? His slave?

246
00:28:53,965 --> 00:29:00,165
If I keep listening to your dad,
then I'm gonna die as a virgin!

247
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,604
Let's go in! What the...!

248
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,579
You kidnap my daughter
in open daylight?

249
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,276
You crazy punk!

250
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,377
We're gonna have a baby first.

251
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,945
Have what?

252
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,925
Dad! Tae-il!

253
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:43,178
Stop right there! You little shit.

254
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,643
You think you can run away?

255
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,463
Kneel down!

256
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,335
Release him.

257
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:28,783
We have laws in this country!
You think you can get away with

258
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,827
abduction and physical assault?

259
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,859
I've lived well without any laws.

260
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,131
You piece of shit didn't pass
the bar exam yet, so what the hell
do you know about the law?

261
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,876
This is your mother in law.
Give her a bow.

262
00:30:53,751 --> 00:31:07,597
Mom! Look how bad he's treating
one and only son in law.

263
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,833
If she were alive,
she'd be in her early 40's

264
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:23,038
But I only remember her as
a high school girl who likes fast food.

265
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,414
You mean...

266
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,712
That's right.

267
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:37,754
We both were in high school
when she got pregnant.

268
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,933
I don't like you! No, I fear you!

269
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,809
You're just like how I used to be.

270
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:59,448
You don't know anything about her.
About her pain and suffering...

271
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,611
What you see is all you know.
Is that real love?

272
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,023
Bull shit!

273
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:12,929
You're just pleasing yourself.

274
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,762
Look at me!

275
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:22,972
I loved Il-mae's mom to death...

276
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,305
but she was gone at 18!

277
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:38,753
If you really love her, then you
have to know how to protect her!

278
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,661
Tae-il!

279
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,993
Yes, sir!

280
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,033
Il-mae isn't going anywhere.

281
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:01,067
I swear I'll keep her safe.

282
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:08,381
So, can she stay with me just
a little longer?

283
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:15,686
Can you please leave her with me
just a little longer?

284
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,363
Teacher...

285
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,862
I'll protect her!

286
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,068
Up until I graduate and
pass the bar exam,

287
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,904
I won't even touch her hair!

288
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,747
Thanks.

289
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:48,391
Kiss... I'll allow kissing.

290
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,021
Nonsense! If I kiss her, then
I'd wanna touch her boobs.

291
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:59,301
And if I touch her boobs, then I'll cross
the line that I must not cross.

292
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:10,872
Until the day you give Il-mae's hand
to me, I'll keep her intact, and virgin!

293
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,472
Tae-il!

294
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,895
What a lie!

295
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,199
She is a slut.

296
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:44,213
She slept with me a lot
when she's in high school.

297
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,877
She wasn't even a virgin
when we first had sex.

298
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,944
She already had abortions,
even five times!

299
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:56,786
And her tube got so damaged
that she can't even have a baby.

300
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,125
How do you know her so well?

301
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:04,100
How? She's my first love
and so am I to her.

302
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,370
Out my window, I can see
Il-mae's room well.

303
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,535
That's my room.

304
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,080
Well done, Tae-il.

305
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,444
I protect my girl, sir!

306
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,624
Il-mae, I had a really good time tonight.

307
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,898
I'm sorry about...

308
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,909
That's ok. Your friend Tae-il
always adds thrill to our date.

309
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,218
I don't see him.

310
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:27,114
Tae-il! You!!

311
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,314
Shit!

312
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:46,527
I'm gonna get wrinkled and die
as a virgin without kissing a man

313
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,006
Why don't you go for Tae-il?

314
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,908
Tae-il?

315
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,702
Do you really love me?

316
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,471
If you really love me,
if you can hear my heart,

317
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,915
then please look at me.

318
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,121
Stop that gibberish.

319
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,498
You really gonna be like this?

320
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:07,342
You're an animal with
too much testosterone!

321
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,985
Patience!

322
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:21,458
Other boys? I hooked up
Yonsei University boys

323
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,160
with girls from Sookmyung University.

324
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:28,638
Only Ewha girls here!

325
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:37,309
I'm the only one who stands up to pee.

326
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,212
So no need to worry, sir!

327
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,252
How do you manage to
prepare for the bar exam?

328
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,845
I brought everything with me.

329
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:53,256
I'm confident in memorizing
with my IQ, I gotta go, bye!

330
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,496
How do you say "Eat it while
it's warm" in local dialect?

331
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:07,405
Slurp it while it's hot.
Slurp it while it's hot.

332
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:16,753
Let's see, where is Il-mae's
cold medicine?

333
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,428
It's her shampoo, snacks.

334
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:29,432
Where is it? Oh, here it is.

335
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,166
Hello! It's time for my girl
to take her medicine!

336
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,274
Il-mae!

337
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,778
She went swimming with a boy
she met in the lobby.

338
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,113
I can't even leave her alone
for 2 seconds!

339
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,991
Don't you think it's way
too much sexy?

340
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,697
Not at all. I have to knock him.

341
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,033
out with one punch!

342
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,684
Il-mae! JOO Il-mae!

343
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:38,426
SOHN Tae-il! Let's see
who's gonna win this time!

344
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,171
Where is that bastard?

345
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,295
What... what are you doing?

346
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,458
Thanks, Tae-il.

347
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,198
For... for what?

348
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:19,675
For looking after me till now.
You don't have to do it anymore.

349
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,989
This is our last trip of
our college years.

350
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,227
I want to make a memorable moment

351
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,600
with you! Right now!

352
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,638
Here?

353
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,381
Tae-il.

354
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:09,091
Teacher, please forgive me!

355
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,870
Wake up!

356
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,142
Too much testosterone!

357
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,648
Cover up yourself well
before you come out.

358
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,312
Stop right there!

359
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,317
I can't move anyway.

360
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,295
Tae-il, if you walk out on me now
then it's over.

361
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,429
You might never see me again!

362
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,763
Do you hear me?

363
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,208
Calm down and come out!
After giving you your medication,

364
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,443
I've got a lot to study tonight!

365
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:13,446
You fool! What's so important
about that stupid promise?

366
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:25,994
I need you... right now...

367
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:33,975
There might not be next time...
Stupid...

368
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,062
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, sir!

369
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:07,140
You finally did it!

370
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:16,147
Everyone! Tae-il passed
the level 1 bar exam.

371
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,255
Sir, Il-mae is really mine, right?

372
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:29,425
Of course! She's all yours!

373
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,965
Where are you?
Are you with her?

374
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:39,272
My whereabouts is a top secret.

375
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:45,107
I'm preparing a present for her.

376
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,084
Ouch... Be careful, will you?

377
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:58,390
Alright. We're giving you a cool
finishing stitches.

378
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,097
We can't stitch it up like this.
Relax, will you?

379
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,828
Relax!

380
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:09,032
What's that sound?
Did you get into a fight?
Are you hurt?

381
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,739
No, I'm fine. Teacher,
Il-mae is mine, right?

382
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,178
Everyone, bow to our teacher!

383
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,883
We welcome you, sir.

384
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,516
Teacher!

385
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,522
Tae-il!

386
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,261
Tae-il!

387
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,403
Why are you crying
on this happy day?

388
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:59,144
- Then why are you crying?
- Because I'm so proud of you!

389
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,628
How much did you nosebleed
this time?

390
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:17,171
Not too much. Only about a bucket
this big... 2 of it...

391
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,334
You did well.

392
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,340
C'mon. Get up.

393
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,581
So, where is your bride?

394
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,426
My bride?

395
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:44,524
Yes, your bride!

396
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:52,098
Of course!
My bride just got off work.

397
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,304
So my bride should be here soon.

398
00:46:55,379 --> 00:47:02,945
Oh, I see...

399
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:08,890
you're already getting excited
just thinking about her, huh?

400
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,993
Teacher! Please, don't touch it.

401
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,465
Don't be shy.

402
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,259
She's here!

403
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,576
Hello?

404
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,485
Tae-il... What are you doing?

405
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,096
Tae-il!

406
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,834
Congratulations!
Tae-il passed
level 1 bar exam

407
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,605
Did you really?

408
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:15,056
JOO Il-mae! How lonely you've been,
spending so many nights,

409
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:21,722
all by yourself! Open it.

410
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:46,121
This is my heart. From now on,
I'll breathe if you tell me to breathe,

411
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,886
And I'll stop if you tell me to stop.

412
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:59,425
Stupid! You're so stupid!

413
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,069
Stupid! Stupid!

414
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,253
Teacher!

415
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:29,959
Teacher!

416
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,060
Dad!

417
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,501
- For Tae-il!
- For Tae-il!

418
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:43,039
Always wait for your return...
your apartment!

419
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:59,758
I call you because I miss you!
And I hear your lovely voice...

420
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,764
Stop!

421
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,130
This is the happiest day in my life

422
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,864
since the birth of
my daughter Il-mae!

423
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,474
Since we're in full swing of
celebration,

424
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,942
let's have the engagement
ceremony for SOHN Tae-il

425
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,750
and JOO Il-mae right now!

426
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,221
Dad!

427
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,448
Yes?

428
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,896
I wanna get married!

429
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:39,502
Sure! I'm so proud of Tae-il,
my SOHN in law!

430
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,234
It's not Tae-il!

431
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,309
It's not him

432
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:57,385
He's not the one I want to marry!

433
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:09,093
Teacher, you're just joking
with me, right?

434
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:13,603
You're worried that
I'm gonna mess up the 2nd exam,

435
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,195
And that's why you're doing this.

436
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,264
Shut up!

437
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:32,978
Please tell me this isn't real.
Tell me Il-mae wasn't serious.

438
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:41,260
What did you tell me before?
"Sir, I protect my woman!"

439
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,030
Well... you did really well.

440
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,832
I trusted you with my daughter...

441
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,374
Teacher.

442
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,713
You're worthless!

443
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:17,501
Even if this is the end of the world,
you can't do this to him.

444
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,299
You know he lived his whole life
just for you.

445
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:24,633
You're killing him.

446
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:31,278
But, dad, I slept with that man.
Many many times!

447
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,942
What?

448
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:45,017
I'm not a virgin anymore.
That's why I can't go back to Tae-il.

449
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:37,041
You worthless shit.

450
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,618
We did our best.

451
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:53,120
Okay, let's make a contract.

452
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,563
Thank you. I'll convey your message
to our president.

453
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,032
They want to contract
the agreement.

454
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:13,013
Il-mae! Il-mae! Get off me!

455
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:15,840
Let's go!

456
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,652
What are you doing?

457
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,687
It all started when we came to Seoul.

458
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,727
So let's go back to Pusan!

459
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,362
- Tae-il!
- Come on!

460
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,660
Let's go back to Pusan!

461
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,726
What am I? A joke?

462
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,895
You think you can just show up
like this and

463
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:44,873
cause all this ruckus and I'd
go with you?

464
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:50,113
Il-mae, I love you! I really do!

465
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,016
You don't know what love is!

466
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,133
- Il-mae!
- Excuse me, sir!

467
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,038
- Get off me!
- Sir!

468
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,479
Il-mae, don't do this. Think about it
one more time.

469
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,745
Do you know how I raised you?

470
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,648
Why are you acting like this?

471
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,485
- Let's go, ok?
- Get off me!!

472
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,023
Tae-il! Tae-il!

473
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:34,894
If you don't go with me, then
I'm gonna kill myself right here!

474
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,094
I already gave you my heart.

475
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:43,602
I can't live without you!

476
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,234
Don't be stupid. I'm not going.

477
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:54,384
Il-mae! Il-mae!

478
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,816
Tae-il!

479
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,285
Teacher, the sky looks
awfully blue today!

480
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,323
Tae-il!

481
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:52,333
I can't believe she's doing this!
Now what's gonna happen to him?

482
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,409
What am I supposed to do now?

483
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:04,152
You awake? You know how long
you've been passed out?

484
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:09,349
3 days!
You really scared me this time.

485
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:16,427
I prepared some seafood porridge.

486
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,135
Kang-chul left his gang and
opened up a sushi restaurant.

487
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:26,039
He made this for you using
only the freshest ingredients!

488
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:43,425
Too hot, huh?
Should I cool it down for you?

489
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,894
Give me a cigarette!

490
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,130
What? You got a problem?

491
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:08,808
No. I heard in Japan a father and
daughter in law smoke together.

492
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,284
I say, where are the morals
and ethics in that?

493
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:23,994
I mean, it's about liberation.

494
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,030
Cultural liberation!

495
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:34,838
We need to adopt that thinking
too, right?

496
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,148
- So what are you gonna do?
- About what?

497
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,877
About Il-mae!

498
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,457
We'll get her back. We will.

499
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:58,194
How the hell are you gonna get her back
when her heart has changed?

500
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:26,454
First, we gotta find out
who that guy is

501
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:32,725
Il-mae!

502
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:39,842
English, French, Japanese and now,
Chinese, too?

503
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:43,369
Wow, I'd better study harder
to be your husband

504
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,131
Who beat you?

505
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:12,038
I don't know. A woman came
into the bathroom and...

506
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:26,451
Il-mae!
How about a hot cup of coffee?

507
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,551
I'll get it.

508
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:33,653
Nonsense. I'll get it. Wait here.

509
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,221
Relax!

510
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:44,430
Come on, spill it out!

511
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,205
I'm sorry! Please stop.
I have hemorrhoid.

512
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,648
You should listen to your buddy
if he tells you to stop.

513
01:00:55,718 --> 01:01:00,519
No, you're worse. If you're
his friend, you should've stopped him.

514
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,720
- Look! Look over there!
- Hold on. I should punish...

515
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,386
We got the wrong guy.

516
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,070
Shit!

517
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:26,178
- Why didn't you tell me earlier!!
- You didn't listen!

518
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,718
Would you like to order?

519
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,222
In a minute. Calm down!

520
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,129
Really?

521
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,509
Bastard! What?

522
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,376
You must know your enemy to win!

523
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:10,015
What's there to know? He's a rich boy
with tons of money! Fuck.

524
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:14,393
Fuck? Watch your language!
What am I? Your friend?

525
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,981
LEE Seung-no! Age, 30!

526
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:55,432
According to my investigation,
he emigrated to US at the age of 12,

527
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,735
received masters in psychology, then
graduated Harvard Law School,

528
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,605
received MBA at Wharton and

529
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,611
returned to Korea in 1999.

530
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,709
Impressive! Level 1 bar exam is
nothing compared to him.

531
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,949
Are you on my side or his?

532
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,513
Of course I'm on your side.

533
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:22,422
In 1999, he established
Phoenix Software, which

534
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:26,195
exports various games to
international markets.

535
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:34,504
In 2001, he was awarded for his
excellence in his industry.

536
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:38,946
Any weaknesses?

537
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:55,226
Neuschwanstein, or sometimes
it's known as New Swan Castle.

538
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:04,704
King Ludwig ll, a fan of Wagner,
built this castle for his lover.

539
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:14,216
But sadly, they never lived
together, right?

540
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,979
I'm different.

541
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:25,751
I won't spend my life only building
a castle for someone I love

542
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,436
Il-mae, I love you!

543
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:45,044
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Hey, look at that
cuckoo flying over there!

544
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,550
You only know one side of a coin.

545
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,678
2002 Sisa English pg. 482.

546
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,758
King Ludwig ll and Wagner were
gay lovers.

547
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:04,299
Eventually, Ludwig destroyed
the castle, missing him

548
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,599
Why don't you go look for
a young boy?

549
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,267
Tae-il! You!!!

550
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,473
Take a good look at these!

551
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:26,684
A dog collar... At the office...
In the car... this one is outdoor...

552
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:29,923
Do you see now?

553
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,251
He has so many women,
besides you!

554
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:37,959
He's about quantity. Not quality!

555
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:43,564
He's not a man. He's a dog!

556
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,437
A dog!

557
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,668
Let's go.

558
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:56,146
Maybe you're too shocked to
fully understand the situation here.

559
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,015
No. It's you who's not
getting the situation.

560
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:02,752
I knew he had other women,

561
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,261
but I didn't care. Because I liked him
and that's all it mattered.

562
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,792
I'm sorry about this.
Let's go somewhere else.

563
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:19,632
Are you crazy?

564
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,774
What are you doing with
this playboy?

565
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,075
I'd rather be with a playboy who
knows how to love me,

566
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,506
than a kid like you who doesn't
even know what love is.

567
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,146
Nice photoshop work.

568
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:35,854
Pervert.

569
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,231
Fine! You can call me pervert or

570
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:48,426
whatever you want!
But what about me?

571
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:54,034
I lived my whole life just for you!

572
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:57,909
What about me then?

573
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,091
Who are you?

574
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,700
Me? An international referee.

575
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,205
Ready?

576
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,276
Hello?

577
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:43,518
Teacher, I forgot to tell you
one thing about LEE Seung-no.

578
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:48,723
He's a master in judo,
aikido and fencing!

579
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,480
Tae-il! Are you ok?

580
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:23,863
Teacher... he's pretty damn strong!

581
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,029
Tae-il! Tae-il!

582
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:48,820
Il-mae, I shouldn't say this
as your dad, but...

583
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:58,758
I think purity of heart is
more important than that of body.

584
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:06,039
I believe Tae-il loves you for
who you are in your heart.

585
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:15,481
Can't you just give him
one more chance?

586
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,912
Dad, give me a kiss!

587
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:36,535
You crazy?

588
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:45,642
You can't do it, right?
Neither can I. Tae-il is like that.

589
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:56,381
He's my childhood buddy.
Like a brother.

590
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,354
I can't even kiss him.

591
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,795
Really?

592
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,427
It's too late, dad.

593
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:18,440
I just want to be his friend.

594
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:30,848
I'm worried.
He'd never give you up.

595
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:35,493
There's only one solution.

596
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,963
I should marry Seung-no quickly

597
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,545
Tae-il! Are you out of your mind?

598
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,105
Why are you burning your books?

599
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:59,220
The reason for my existence was
to marry Il-mae.

600
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,553
Not becoming a judge
or a district attorney.

601
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,650
Tae-il! Tae-il!

602
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,587
Oh my god!

603
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,429
Fire! Fire!

604
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,561
JOO Il-mae, come back to me!
I love you forever.

605
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,106
Come back to me, JOO Il-mae!
Come back to me, JOO Il-mae!

606
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,665
JOO Il-mae, come back to me!
JOO... Il-mae!!

607
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,318
"Prepare yourself for death, and
you'll live and prepare yourself

608
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,155
for life and you'll die!"
said General LEE.

609
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:20,565
Chinese textbook pg.118, line 4!

610
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:37,647
Love is like a marathon!
I must eat to win!

611
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,530
Merciless bastard!
You can't take her away from me!

612
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,932
Maybe today is the D-day.

613
01:12:55,037 --> 01:13:01,499
They dined at a fancy restaurant
and danced at a jazz bar, right?

614
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,347
Then, he probably gave her
Neuschwanstein and said,

615
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:11,648
he won't be a fool who
only builds a castle...

616
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,649
then a kiss.

617
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,452
They didn't kiss.

618
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,392
That's not the point!

619
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,973
With a little bit of alcohol and
sweet words, he melts her heart

620
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,579
Then with a seal of love,
the game is over

621
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:41,582
She becomes his woman.

622
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,789
You really like polar bears that much?

623
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,025
JOO Il-mae!

624
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,970
Tae-il! You're impossible.

625
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:24,492
Please let her go. Please.

626
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:33,101
You could have anything in the world.

627
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,298
But she's all I have.

628
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:43,434
Please let her go. I beg of you.

629
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:54,689
Il-mae! I never even got a chance
to show you how much I love you.

630
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,056
Just give me one chance!

631
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,560
He looks just like a weasel

632
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,400
Tonight is not the first night
we're sleeping together.

633
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:19,246
We've done it countless times.

634
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,478
So, don't bother me anymore.

635
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,350
You bitch! Bother you?

636
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:32,053
I've been bothering you?
How about me?

637
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:36,924
You think I enjoyed packing
your lunch for 4 years?

638
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,032
And reserving your seat at the library?

639
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:47,241
Do you think doing your
laundry was fun?

640
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,308
Really?

641
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:07,128
It's nice to know
how you really felt.

642
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,325
Can I go now?

643
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:20,771
Get out of my sight!
You make me want to puke!

644
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:24,307
No, I'll go.

645
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:31,842
I'm so shamed I wasted my life
chasing after a slut like you!

646
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:37,641
What? I ask you to go to Seoul

647
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,187
to look after Tae-il and
investigate Il-mae's affairs.

648
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,850
And, now you
return and cry like a girl.

649
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:50,123
Il-mae went to the hospital.

650
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,496
So, I thought she's gonna see
a gynecologist.

651
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,801
Hospital?

652
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,686
She has the myelodysplastic
syndromes,

653
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:21,260
the same illness that
took away your wife.

654
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,024
Oh, lord.

655
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:07,738
Teacher, you're so light.
You got no meat on your legs.

656
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,009
You've gotten so thin.

657
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:18,213
You need to eat more.

658
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:26,418
I'm not light.
You've become stronger.

659
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,595
Tae-il.

660
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,460
Yes, teacher.

661
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,103
Are you really ok?

662
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:41,875
Of course. I'm fine.

663
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,409
It's not a big deal to me

664
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:54,816
The funny thing is, the date for the
2nd exam is the same date

665
01:19:56,258 --> 01:20:00,695
as Il-mae's wedding date.

666
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:07,833
Good. There is no reason why
you should attend her wedding.

667
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:17,507
Go on and do well on your exam
and pass it with flying colors.

668
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,776
Don't worry about me.

669
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:32,057
I'll pass the exam... get married...
have kids...

670
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:37,888
then I will come back to see you.

671
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:52,035
I'll never forget...
all you've done for me.

672
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,077
Alright.

673
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,184
Who is it? Dad?

674
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:45,565
Dad, Dad!

675
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,728
Tae-il... Tae-il...

676
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:09,821
Tae-il! SOHN Tae-il!

677
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,701
JOO Il-mae!

678
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,231
Yes?

679
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,571
Eat well and live well!

680
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,574
Eat well and...

681
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,780
don't get sick, ok?

682
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:47,453
If you do get sick,
don't get too sick. Ok?

683
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:58,568
You too! Don't get into
any more troubles!

684
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,873
And don't be so stubborn, ok?

685
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:12,480
Stop worrying about me.

686
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:15,717
I'll be fine.

687
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:23,128
Goodbye.

688
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:47,544
Tae-il! Do you know why
I'm marrying him?

689
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:53,150
Because he has other women.

690
01:23:54,429 --> 01:24:00,425
He'll easily fall in love again.

691
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,239
Even without me,

692
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:12,041
he'll continue to live
a happy life!

693
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:20,878
But, you can't do that.

694
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,522
You'll only think of me
and love me!

695
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:33,432
Just like my dad!

696
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:41,307
I can't let you become
like my dad.

697
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:54,179
Dad, I'm not a bad person,
am I?

698
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:59,925
Of course not.

699
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:13,640
Like a flower... like a star...
you're the loveliest girl in the world...

700
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:28,881
Dad, let's practice the wedding march.

701
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:38,493
We have to be careful
not to step on my dress.

702
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:45,404
Alright, alright.

703
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:07,343
Il-mae!!!

704
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:16,590
- Tilt your head a bit to the left.
- Turn it just a little.

705
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:28,864
My love, do you know
what I did today?

706
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:37,900
I went to the photo studio with
Il-mae and took pictures.

707
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:45,344
She braided her hair and
wore this really pretty dress.

708
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:52,988
And we took a picture together.

709
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:01,533
She was trying to do what
you and I couldn't do.

710
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:14,113
Do you know what she said to me
as she took her portrait?

711
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:28,996
She smiled and said,

712
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:38,902
"Dad, I've a very happy life.

713
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:46,743
So please don't cry
when you look at this picture."

714
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:54,883
And she smiled.

715
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,921
My lovely child... my sweet child...

716
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:17,542
Teacher, you're killing yourself.
Please don't do this.

717
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,358
The 45th Level 2
bar exam center

718
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,164
Begin.

719
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:19,172
It would be much appreciated
if you'd participated in blood drive.

720
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,033
What the hell are you saying?

721
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:26,910
Of course it's our duty as his students
to do as much as we can.

722
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,588
- What's going on?
- Get off me!! You bastards!

723
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:39,057
SOHN Tae-il! You bastard!

724
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,651
How can you take a test right now?

725
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:45,028
Tae-il, come out here! You know
what Il-mae did for you?

726
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,126
Get off me! She... Tae-il, she's...

727
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:54,368
Tae-il doesn't understand why.

728
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:58,345
He's just trying to forget her
because she told him to.

729
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:05,574
Come on! Step on the accelerator!

730
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:13,958
He has no clue that she's doing
this for his own sake

731
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:18,096
For the only person she ever loved...

732
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:23,665
she wants him to be happy
even when she's not here anymore.

733
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:29,800
My love, what am I supposed to do?

734
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:34,643
What can I do?

735
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:42,283
I now pronounce you to be
husband and wife.

736
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,289
Nonsense!

737
01:32:55,603 --> 01:33:00,267
- Nullify this marriage!
- Nullify! Nullify!

738
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,174
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

739
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:10,616
Ladies and gentlemen, this girl
right here, is a horrible person!

740
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,781
This stupid girl...

741
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:19,590
She's suffering from the same illness
which took her mom away...

742
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:25,397
So I can live happily by myself...

743
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:33,772
So I can pass the exam and
live happily by myself!

744
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:39,741
Il-mae, did you really think
I'd be fine?

745
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:45,685
I already gave you my heart.

746
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:51,752
How am I supposed to
live without you?

747
01:33:56,764 --> 01:34:00,825
And our teacher...
he's a horrible person, too.

748
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,032
As her father...

749
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:18,280
this is how he shows his love.

750
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:37,365
Tae-il, why are you doing this to her?

751
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:43,433
What can she do now?

752
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,072
That's exactly why
I cannot allow this marriage.

753
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:53,717
If you'd known your wife's gonna die,
would you've not loved her?

754
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:57,252
Answer me!

755
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:15,469
Il-mae!

756
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,613
I never regret loving your mother.

757
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:32,217
Your mother was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

758
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:48,435
Even now, everyday of my life is
filled of joy because your mom!

759
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:07,691
Please, forgive her.

760
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:10,588
And please release her.

761
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:19,030
Allow me to be at her side
till her last day.

762
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,274
- Please release her.
- Please! Release her!

763
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:39,727
This marriage is... nullified!

764
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:18,591
Tae-il! I'm sick.
And I'll get sicker.

765
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:31,440
I'm afraid I won't be able to
be with you much longer

766
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:40,083
You can't die. I won't let you.

767
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:48,017
Forget the law school! I'll study
and go to a medical school

768
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:52,293
I'm gonna find out a cure
for your illness

769
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,647
I pretended I was asleep

770
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:19,682
and he's already snoring. Little fool...

771
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:27,762
Our first kiss was a long awaited one...

772
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:36,366
Thinking about our first kiss
still makes my heart flutter...

773
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:47,311
I love you, Tae-il!

774
01:38:50,591 --> 01:39:01,195
Teacher, I can't say that!

775
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,106
Tae-il.

776
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:26,253
I can't... I can't do that here.

777
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:52,110
Let go of her, will you?
Let go of her.

778
01:39:55,189 --> 01:40:00,126
Never! I'll never let her go!

779
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:09,364
I'm gonna cure her illness and
we're gonna live happily together

780
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:15,072
till our deaths do us apart
teeth fall out.
