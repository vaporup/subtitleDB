1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
And another quick
knock out for Mason Dixon,

2
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,400
although de facto, the fans let
him know how they feel about it.

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Hide the women and
children, this could get ugly.

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,100
This crowd does
nothing to hide its anger,

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
over this latest debacle.

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Fans are mad as hell, they
don't want to take it anymore.

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,100
They seem to be blaming
Dixon, a good fighter,

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
for decline of not only the
heavy-weight division guys,

9
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
but of the entire sport.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,400
They're actually pelting the undefeated

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,300
heavy-weight champion
of the world with ice!

12
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,400
Maybe this angry visceral reaction

13
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,400
will pressure Dixon to fight someone
who could fight back for a change.

14
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
If there's somebody out there.

15
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,100
World of the boxing is hoping for a
warrior who threw us with his passion.

16
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Andrian Balboa

17
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Time goes by too fast.

18
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah, not fast enough.

19
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
Your kid should've been there.

20
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,700
Nah, it's alright, Paulie.

21
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
No, it ain't alright!

22
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Oh you know, the kid gets
a little busy sometimes.

23
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
He don't get that busy.

24
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
Well, let's not talk
about it here, okay?

25
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,900
You're coming tonight, right?

26
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm working!

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,700
I took the tour the last three years!

28
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,700
I know, but it's the anniversary.

29
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
Fine, you got my word.

30
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
I appreciate it, thank you.

31
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,300
I owe you, Paulie.

32
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,900
Yo, Robert. What's going on?

33
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Where have you been? You're late!

34
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
No, I don't want to hear any excuse!

35
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,300
Look, your job perfomarnce is no
way near good enough. It's pointless!

36
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,300
I don't give a damn who your
father is, you understand me?

37
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
- Yeah.
- Alright.

38
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,100
Alright. Now get outta here.

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Thank you, Sir.

40
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yo, Robert!

41
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,500
- Yo!
- Hey, Rocky.

42
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Hey, how're you doin'?

43
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,000
- Hey!
- What's up, champ'?

44
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You caught me off guard!

45
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,200
I know I caught you off guard.

46
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I wanted to catch you
before you got to busy!

47
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Yeah, it gets busy up there.

48
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
- So how ya doin'?
- Real good.

49
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Yo, Rock!

51
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah, how're you doing?

52
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,100
Yeah, real good.

53
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
Hey listen, you want to go
out and get some coffee?

54
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm kinda behind...maybe later?

55
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
Yeah...that'd be great!

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,700
You know, you ought to come
by to the restaurant tonight,

57
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,800
I can have something
made special for you.

58
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,000
Tonight I can't...I've got plans.

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
Few other guys, stick
together, you know...

60
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
Did I say something wrong?

61
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
What...what do you mean?

62
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
Well...

63
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,600
I don't know exactly what I mean,

64
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,800
but I just think like when I come
here you don't feel so comfortable,

65
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
and I certainly don't want to do that.

66
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,600
You throw a big shadow.

67
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,900
A big shadow?

68
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,600
You're not getting anything
done down here, Robert.

69
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,900
You're not gonna
introduce me, then I will.

70
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
- Hi, I am William Tomisson.
- How ya doin'?

71
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,800
Your son has the
misfortune of working for me!

72
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
It's a good job.

73
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
You know, I gotta tell ya,

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,700
I told Robert about twenty
times that I wanted to meet you!

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,900
But I guess you're pretty busy!

76
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,500
- Which is a bad thing, isn't it?
- Well, I get a little tired...

77
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,300
Hey look, grab a shot, will you, please?

78
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
I may not get this chance again,

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
us old war horses gotta
stick together, don't we?

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,600
- The old horses, yeah.
- I tell you!

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,100
It's not your left.

82
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,400
This makes very popular with people.

83
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,100
- One, two, three.
- Finally, we get to meet!

84
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh look, I kind of get going, it
was nice to meet you face to face.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,500
- How ya doin'?
- Alright, you take care of yourself.

86
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,100
Robert, I'll see ya later.

87
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,000
I've got to get going.

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,900
I'll change my plans for tonight.

89
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Oh, that'd be great.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
- I'm looking forward to!
- Okay.

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,800
- How ya doin'?
- Okay.

92
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,100
- Okay!
- Alright.

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,000
And do not let those
numbers drive you crazy.

94
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Too late!

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Use an eraser, and
get rid of all of them!

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,300
- Hey Rock'.
- Hey guys.

97
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,500
- Hey Rock'!
- Hey, how you doin'?

98
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Here you go.

99
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
You know, I'll buy 10 of them, OK?

100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,200
You guys take care, OK?

101
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,300
You got it.

102
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Tell you what, I'll try
a few of these later on.

103
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,000
This good for making.

104
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,000
How much?

105
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,600
Yo, Paul, what's the cost?

106
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
$58.40, Sir.

107
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,700
Alright, take out of that. I trust you.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Yeah.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,900
- Here you go, Rock'.
- You're generous.

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,900
No problem!

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hi, you guys!

112
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
How are you doing, Isabel?

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,100
Okay, except for the freebee
reading the Bible over there.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Nah, he's ok.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,700
You know, just because
you've fought him,

116
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
but you don't got to feed him forever.

117
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,300
He doesn't even look like a fighter!

118
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,700
Spider Rico can hit!

119
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
Listen, how's your stomach?

120
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,400
You know, if you keeping rubbing
that oliver oil on your stomach,

121
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,100
and your kid's gonna
be born very strong!

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,100
- OK, I don't know what to say.
- No, really.

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,700
- Yo, how're you doin', Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

124
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Thanks.

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
- How you guys doing?
- Alright.

126
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,500
Jose, can you make
something special for my kid,

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
he's coming tonight.

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,200
- No problemo.
- Good, I appreciate it.

129
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,300
Back and forth. Give and take. And then,
I went down there like an animal,

130
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,700
and I threw him into the corner.
And I unloaded everything I had!

131
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,300
Hook, hook, hook. Left, left, left.

132
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,200
But Creed, he kept
busting me back pretty good.

133
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,000
In the end, it did begin to pile up.

134
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Then I heard the best sound
I've ever heard in my life...

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,100
- The bell!
- That's right, the bell.

136
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,300
And I ain't never been so tired
and I'm sitting in my corner,

137
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,000
and I'm trying to figure out
how to survive the last round

138
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,000
when Mickey leans near my ear and says:

139
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,000
"C'mon, get out there and
fight this guy hard, you bum!"

140
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
"You gotta be first,
you gotta be first!"

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,700
I said: "Yo Mick', if I could...

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
- I would!
- I would.

143
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,400
- The end.
- Salute.

144
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Salute.

145
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,000
And another quick knock out for
Mason Dixon, although de facto

146
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
the fans let him know
how they feel about it.

147
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,600
They are actually pelting the undefeated

148
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,400
heavy-weight champion
of the world with ice!

149
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Hello, Adrian's.

150
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Tell him you can't make it?

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,900
Yeah, I'll leave the message.

153
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,600
I just kept hear it,

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,100
Voice in my head all over again,

155
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,200
I just dug down before I knew all
of this. Just try toe to toe, he was...

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Excuse me.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Your son said he can't make it,
he said he'll take a rain check, ok?

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
These birds...

159
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't these birds look like candy?

160
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Flying candy! Hey bird,
you want to fly me home?

161
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
You need somebody to walk you home?

162
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,400
It's a cold night.

163
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,200
We need a few laughs around
like, what do you think? Maybe?

164
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Maybe?

165
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,800
Maybe? Okay, let's get outta here!

166
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,000
That place didn't change
much from last year.

167
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
We're done?

168
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Hey, how you doin', Mick?

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,100
The sign's falling apart, Paulie.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
The whole world is falling apart.

171
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,400
- Look at us!
- You talk crazy, Paulie.

172
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,100
You know, I think if you live
in some place long enough...

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
...you are that place.

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
I ain't no talking building.

175
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,000
Go on, it's getting late, Rocko.

176
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
I get a headache from this train.

177
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,900
I remember when she
was standing there...

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,700
All nervous and shy
with that little smile.

179
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,600
And all I wanted her
to do was to trust me.

180
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,800
She did.

181
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,600
She did.

182
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,300
You're done?

183
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,600
- How long we stay at it?
- Not long.

184
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, I'm glad they
tore this ice rink down!

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,500
- Come on!
- You heard me?

186
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm happy they tore it apart.

187
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,700
First time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

188
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
She was nervous, but I
wasn't so great at blades either.

189
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,900
Ice is stupid, people
standing on ice are more stupid!

190
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
And over there...

191
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,900
...where she was fallen,

192
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
and my hand grabbed her...

193
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,900
And I got her arm through
that coat I could feel...

194
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,000
...electric.

195
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,700
You said the same
thing last year, Rock'...

196
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
Did I?

197
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,000
You weren't born much of the body,
you'd better develop your brain.

198
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
You never got a chance
because you're left handed, huh?

199
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Absolutely, but...

200
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,700
Come on, Rock! Let's go.

201
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
We're done.

202
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,400
There's no place to
sit down around here.

203
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh, it's alright!

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,600
It ain't alright, it's
depressing and freakin' cold!

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
What's the matter with you, Paulie?

206
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
You're livin' backwards, Rocko!

207
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
Jesus, change the
channel from yesterday!

208
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,600
- Yesterday wasn't so great.
- It was to me.

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,700
Not to me!

210
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,300
You treated her good!

211
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
You had your good times.

212
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,100
I treated her bad, I don't
have to think about this.

213
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,100
She always loved you, Paulie.

214
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Sorry, Rocko. I can't do this no more.

215
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Can I help you?

216
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,700
Nah, I used to come down this place
a long time ago, I just look around.

217
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,800
No big deal.

218
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
Can I get you a drink?

219
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,700
Alright, maybe just a short beer.

220
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,700
Okay.

221
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
Listen...

222
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't mean to cross
the line or anything, but...

223
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,500
...I read about your wife's
passing a few years back.

224
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,100
Yeah, it was a women cancer.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,800
Yeah.

226
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I always heard she was a nice person.

227
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Yeah, the best.

228
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,100
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

229
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,100
We did?

230
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,000
When I was a kid, you walked me home.

231
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,700
I did?

232
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,900
Told me to stop smoking and things...

233
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,800
Stop smoking...

234
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
Are you the lil Marie that used to
hang around that atomic hoagie shop?

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah, that's right.

236
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Now I remember...I walked you home,

237
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,100
and when you got there,
you turned around and said:

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
"Screw you, creepo!"

239
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

240
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
You sure?

241
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
Great insults last a long time!

242
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,500
Yo!

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Yo, was that you, is that really you?

244
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,800
- How're you doing?
- I think he wants to drink alone.

245
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,000
Well then give him his drink
then. I ain't stopping you.

246
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,500
What's that your man or
something? No, I don't think so!

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Anyway...

248
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,100
...me and my friends,
we are right down there.

249
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
You think, you think
you can buy us a round?

250
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,700
Come on, you've got the
money, just one round!

251
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Hey, hey...

252
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,500
- Take care.
- What are you...?

253
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
What're you doing,
pushing my hand away like that?

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,300
What's your name?

255
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,100
Angie, what do you wanna know for?

256
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
Angie, don't be playing the
fool for that guy, alright?

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,700
- A fool?
- Yeah.

258
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
A fool? I'm the fool?

259
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,200
You're the fool, not me!

260
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,900
You've got it twisted. You're the fool.

261
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm a person just like you.

262
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,300
You ain't no better than me. You think
you're a big shot there? You ain't!

263
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,100
You ain't no better than me!

264
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
No better!

265
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Wow...

266
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,800
Glad you dropped in?

267
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,200
Think the neighborhood's
changed a little.

268
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,900
- What was that all about?
- I don't know, forget about it, it's ok.

269
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,100
Well, I'm gonna lock off,
so if you want to take off,

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,100
I'll tally everything up.

271
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Yeah, thanks.

272
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,100
- How're you doing, Rock?
- I'm good, thanks.

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

274
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,100
Eight blocks...

275
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
Would you need a lift?

276
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Alright.

277
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,000
- You ever get married?
- Yeah, sort of.

278
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
- Sort of?
- Yeah, he took off.

279
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,900
- Pouf, just like that.
- Yeah, just like that.

280
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,700
- Are you sort of have any kids?
- Yeah, yeah I've got one kid.

281
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Yeah, me too...me too.

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
- A wonderful boy.
- Hey...tough guy!

283
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
What's the matter,
you can't buy a round?

284
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,300
Huh? Girl has been nice, you dumb ass!

285
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Yeah, what're you doing with that pig?

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,500
...go around here, and disrespect us?

287
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
Come on back, come on back!

288
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Hey, don't listen to 'em.

289
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,800
You ain't no better than me.

290
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Come over here.

291
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,200
Everybody ain't perfect.

292
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
You punch-drunk!

293
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,800
- Goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot. Look at you!

294
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,000
You haven't even got a
car to take that pig home!

295
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
You alright?

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah.

297
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,500
What are you doing?

298
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Don't get out, it's alright!

299
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,500
No, little Marie...it ain't alright!

300
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Yo!

301
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,400
What? I'll tell you
what! You get inside.

302
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,200
You get inside.

303
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,900
Hey, leave him alone!

304
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,500
- Alright.
- You see that?

305
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
- You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

306
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry.

307
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,800
- C'mon, I'm sorry!
- Get a job!

308
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,600
That guy sends his apologies.

309
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Okay.

310
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,600
Martin?

311
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Martin?

312
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Yo, Mart'!

313
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
I see you still got your key...

314
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah, I've got a key.
You've got time to talk?

315
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,500
I've got a lot of time
since you people let me go.

316
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,600
You know I had nothing to do with that.

317
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah.

318
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.

319
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,800
Yeah?

320
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
- Yeah, but it's only temporary.
- Yeah, I can see that.

321
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,000
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
- Your apartment is nice.

322
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,600
- Yeah, it is what it is, you know.
- Yeah, it is what it is.

323
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
But you know, this place
used to be pretty nice.

324
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,300
You know, there's a lot
of history around here.

325
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like...

326
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,700
...down the street
there there's a fight club.

327
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
They used to call that place
like the bucket of blood,

328
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,200
I took some massive beating down there!

329
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,600
But it was nice, good memories.

330
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,800
And I've heard these buildings
are like, I don't know...like

331
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
...150 years old.

332
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,500
So, I mean if I was 150 years
old, I'd be falling apart too, so...

333
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,700
...it's okay, building!

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Does that light work?

335
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
- Nah, it's burnout or something.
- Oh yeah?

336
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,800
Yeah.

337
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,200
Hey listen, thanks for the ride and...

338
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
...I'm sorry about those
guys and everything.

339
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh, it's ok. Y'know some of those
guys just let the brains on them,

340
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,000
backwoods or stuff.

341
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,400
What's he doing out so late?

342
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,100
- Is it your kid?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,200
Wish he wouldn't stay out so late.

344
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Amazing!

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
- Yeah? What's that?
- Oh...

346
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,000
Last time I've seen
you, you was the kid...

347
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,100
And now you officially
got one on your own.

348
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,300
It's amazing.

349
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,800
You know, he sorta resembles
you, he got that...y'know...

350
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,000
...big Irish hair!

351
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,700
Yeah, it's the other one.

352
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah?

353
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,500
- His father was from Jamaica.
- Jamaica, European...

354
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
- No, not really.
- What's his name?

356
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,900
Steps.

357
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,400
- Short for Stevenson.
- Makes sense.

358
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,200
Is he look on like he's mad at me,

359
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,800
or is it maybe the
angle I'm standing at?

360
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,700
No, no. He's a good kid.

361
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,500
You wanna meet him?

362
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,100
No...It's getting kinda late,
I've got so much things to do.

363
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah, I understand.

364
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,700
Thanks again for the
ride and everything else.

365
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,800
See you.

366
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You too.

367
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Hey Steps, come on, let's go!

368
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Say good night to your friend.

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,600
What are you doing in the
cold with no hat on? You cold?

370
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,900
- You get something to eat?
- Yeah. I already ate.

371
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
- Yeah? Alright.
- Yeah.

372
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,400
- You're late, you know?
- That's not a problem.

373
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Yo, little Marie!

374
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to your kid?

375
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,100
- How're you doing, Steps?
- What's up?

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Listen, I've got this place.

377
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
restaurant, nice little eatery.

378
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,600
Not too far from here.
So much junk tissue!

379
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Sometimes, I feel like a kangaroo with
all that stuff in my pocket, you know?

380
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,900
Here you go. I've got
a card, there it is.

381
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,400
And if you ever get a chance, it'll
be great both of you come down there,

382
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,300
to eat everything with great free!

383
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,600
I'll leave it over there...

384
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,500
Here.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
Leave it on the steps...

386
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,900
...Steps!

387
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
See ya later.

388
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,500
Come on, let's go.

389
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,900
You know what's best
for you since you were ten,

390
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,900
since you walked in here alone.

391
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
You got everything money can buy...

392
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,800
except what it can't.

393
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,400
It's pride.

394
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,300
Pride is what got your ass outta here.

395
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,500
And losing is what brought you back.

396
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
The people like you...

397
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
...they need to be tested!

398
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,600
They need a challenge!

399
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
But you know that ain't never
gonna happen, it'll not Mart!

400
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,800
There's always somebody out there.

401
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
Always.

402
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,200
And when that time comes, and you
find something standing in front of you,

403
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,100
something that ain't running, and that
ain't backing up, it's hitting on you,

404
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,000
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,500
You find a situation on you that's good.

406
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Cuz that's baptism under fire!

407
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,100
When you get through that,

408
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,900
you find the only kinda respect
that matters in this damn world.

409
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,400
Self-respect.

410
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Thanks, Mart. I appreciate it.

411
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,300
What can a champ do for you?

412
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,600
You can give me some
of the money you got.

413
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
- You know I like you, Mart!
- But not that much!

414
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,400
How about a picture with
the kid, Rock? Is that alright?

415
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Sure.

416
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,100
Hey son, hold up your fist, make
sure it looks more hazardous.

417
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,300
- There you go.
- Nice ones.

418
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Enjoy your meal.

419
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
- He's a nice guy, isn't he?
- Rocky?

420
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,700
- Yeah?
- Listen up...

421
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
Spider's went downstairs, I don't
know if that's alright or not, so...

422
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,100
- What's he doing down there?
- I don't know, it's your friend!

423
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,300
Yo, Spider!

424
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,800
Let me do some dishes. I'll feel better.

425
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,400
- Oh, come on! You're my guest.
- Let me do something.

426
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,700
Well, keep the Indians do that.

427
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't make me fight again!

428
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,600
Last time, you got lucky!

429
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,700
Lucky? Okay.

430
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Jesus wants me to work.

431
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,300
Yo, Rocky!

432
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,400
Yeah?

433
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,900
You've got guests.

434
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,000
Don't get too wet, okay?

435
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,300
Glad Jesus didn't ask him to cook...

436
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,500
- You kept the card.
- Yeah, I kept the card.

437
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
Yeah, why don't you sit down?

438
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,100
Yeah, sure.

439
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,000
Excuse me.

440
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,700
Because you know what? I walk
in there, I say good morning...

441
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,900
...I do this, I do this.

442
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,500
Tonight, boxing once again!

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Two contrasting styles
in almost every way.

444
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
- Hi, everybody welcome to ESPN.
- Hey, can you turn this up?

445
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Turn this up, please!

446
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Who was the best of all time?

447
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,000
If two athletes from different eras could
actually compete against one another,

448
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,400
who would come out on top?

449
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,400
Giving the same rules,
using the same equipment,

450
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,700
who was the greatest?

451
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,200
This week, we feed our
facts into computer.

452
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,400
They will weigh up who
they think will win supreme.

453
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,700
While fill the good comments of
our lustrous panel of sportswriters.

454
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Champ!

455
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,800
- Yo, champ.
- Yo!

456
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,600
Man come check out this trash,
they're talkin' about you, man!

457
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,600
What are you talkin' about?

458
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Come on man, come
check this out, hurry up!

459
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,500
Tonight, the former two-time
heavyweight champion from Philadelphia,

460
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Rocky Balboa.

461
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,000
All right, Chuck Johnson, USA Today.

462
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
There's no question
that Rocky Balboa fought

463
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,800
the much tougher fights during
the much tougher era of boxing.

464
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,700
We look in Mason Dixon and his career,

465
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,100
he's basically been
spoon-fed to his opponents.

466
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,400
No question in my mind, no
matter what he does Rocky win,

467
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,900
but he wins knock-out!

468
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,600
Offspring!

469
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
Juan Fernandez, what do you think?

470
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,800
Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.

471
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,400
He's never been in real
knocked on drag on brows.

472
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,100
He's never had to
dig down to rally back.

473
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
What if he tries to dig
down against Balboa,

474
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,800
he's gonna find that he does
not have a big enough travel.

475
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,300
What happened to you?

476
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,500
What happened to you?

477
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Come on, take it back!

478
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,900
Let's take it to Bert "rand up" Sugar.

479
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Dixon has fought cream pot.

480
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
So we really don't know what he's
made of, but both in their primes,

481
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
you got a factor in here.

482
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,700
Dixon's unbelievable
speed and slashing offence,

483
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,000
he cuts Balboa, no doubt!

484
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
Dixon wins all the way.

485
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,100
Alright, here's where
our subjectivity ends.

486
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
Let's see what the computer
has to say. What's happening?

487
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Dixon unloads on Balboa!
Rocky has no answer.

488
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,000
What time is it? Mason time!
What time is it? Mason time!

489
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,700
Now Dixon is standing...

490
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,900
He's almost out on his feet!

491
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,400
Balboa turning up the heat!

492
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,300
He's been on corner
this time. Believe it!

493
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,200
Oh, a murderous raider!

494
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,700
And Dixon is out on his feet...

495
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,500
...as he crumbles to the cannon.

496
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
And it's Balboa who...

497
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Ladies and gentlemen:
"Baby Rocky, Baby Rocky"!

498
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,800
Yo, I'm glad you liked
the food, but heat that up

499
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,500
it's pretty good in the morning.

500
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
Yeah, thanks man.

501
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,600
Nice kid. I hope this music
ain't giving you a headache,

502
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,800
but I like this whole stuff.

503
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,800
No, I like it...it's nice.

504
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Good.

505
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,800
Good.

506
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,200
Yo. You think...

507
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
...Steps wants a job, y'know
to make a few bucks on weekends.

508
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
It's good makin' your own jean.

509
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,900
I keep stash a few bucks during nine.

510
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,000
Why are you being so nice?

511
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,500
You know, I don't want you to
think nothing's off, you know.

512
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
My wife, she's gone...

513
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,100
...but she ain't, you know what I mean?

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
Yeah, I was't thinking that, believe me.

515
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,700
- No?
- No.

516
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,900
What were you thinking?

517
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,200
I think about you
don't know us nothing...

518
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
- What are you doing?
- Oh, be patient!

519
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Now.

520
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't know you nothing.

521
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,100
But why you gotta owe something...

522
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
...to get...

523
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Bingo!

524
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,500
But why you gotta owe something
to get something. You know?

525
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,600
Really.

526
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,500
You know...I think hanging
out with your kid would be nice.

527
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,700
- What do you think?
- I think that'd be nice.

528
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,200
Good.

529
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,100
That's very nice.

530
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,100
I'm glad you come by.

531
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Nice...

532
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
Nice watch you eat.

533
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Good company.

534
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Yo, lil Marie!

535
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,700
Let there be light!

536
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,000
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Dogs. This is like a dog pawn,

538
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,900
so they keep...

539
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,900
...a large rally of dogs.

540
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,800
I used to come here all the
time for sight seeing, but...

541
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,900
You know, you learn
a lot talkin' to dogs.

542
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,400
- Really, you do.
- Yeah?

543
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,300
Hey, man. How about this one?

544
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Hey, he don't look
too friendly, my friend.

545
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh, man this is the one.

546
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,000
Hey, how're you doing?

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,200
Hey, hey what about this one here?

548
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
- Come here, boy.
- Oh, him?

549
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,900
- Yeah, why not?
- Oh, hell no!

550
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
That's one ugly dog, man!

551
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,300
I know, but it's kind
of a cute dog, you know?

552
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
If you look at him closely,

553
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,900
the color, a kind of looks like
old furnish, like some kinda...

554
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,500
...pirate chest thing, goin' on here.

555
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,500
Yeah, sure man.

556
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,400
Hey, so how about the young one?

557
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,500
Yo, Steps. Get him.

558
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Come over here. I want
you to see something.

559
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,000
Now you know what
this animal is doing here?

560
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,500
Lying in that position?

561
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
He ain't doing nothing.

562
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,900
No, he's doing lie, he
ain't wasting no energy.

563
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
Cause he's dead!

564
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,300
No, no he ain't dead!
There's a lot of good mileage

565
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
who was left into that animal.

566
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,800
You know, some good food, a
dish and a couple of new friends...

567
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Bingo, he's back!

568
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
But what do you think
is like a good name?

569
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,500
I mean, it's your dog...you name it!

570
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,300
Hey, no, it's like a
cumulated animal, 50-50.

571
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,700
Look, I don't know much about no dogs.

572
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
Oh, you know Steps, it
ain't that complicated!

573
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Y'know, you pet'em, you feed'em...

574
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,000
The nature takes its
course. You know so, but...

575
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,500
Don't you want to name an animal?

576
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,200
I think every guy
should one time try to...

577
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,900
...name an animal or something.

578
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,300
I don't know...Fleabag!

579
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,900
It's catchy, I don't know...

580
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
It ain't original, but
it's pretty good, and...

581
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,100
I think though you can come
up with your young brain,

582
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,300
something better to throw out...

583
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
...than like fleabag.

584
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,500
Punchy! How's that?

585
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy!

586
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
- I like it. You know?
- For real?

587
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,100
Yeah, for real! Y'know punchy it is.
I think Punchy is easy to remember,

588
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,800
it's not that hard to spell...

589
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,200
Once it's in your brain,
you'll never forget it.

590
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,500
- Punchy, very good!
- Alright, man!

591
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,500
Good call.

592
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Alright, Punchy!

593
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,500
You ready to be belled up, my friend?

594
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Okay!

595
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,100
Hey, you know it was a joke, right?

596
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,900
Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy!

597
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,400
Uh, Rocky?

598
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

599
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,500
- Rock...
- Yo, Paulie...

600
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,900
Hey, they're gonna be talkin'
about that fake Looney Tunes fight!

601
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,600
Hey, come on! We're about
to serve today's special.

602
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,300
Italian food cooked up by a bunch
of Mexican ain't so special, Rocko!

603
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Hey, yo.

604
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,000
Hey, I skipped work for this!

605
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,200
What an ugly dog!

606
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,700
It's a cute dog.

607
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,900
- Hey, Rock.
- Yep.

608
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm gonna take off, alright?

609
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Hey, that stuff back
there is pretty cool!

610
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,500
- Oh, you liked that?
- Yeah, man!

611
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
Thanks, I appreciate it.

612
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
- I'll catch you later.
- Good night.

613
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,400
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

614
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
He dresses like a bum!

615
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,400
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment!

616
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,500
- Hide the silverware!
- It's nice.

617
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Hey, Spider.

618
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,000
Haven't you knocked up that bum once?

619
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Will you give a rest?

620
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,900
I'm gonna be late for work
for this, gimme a break, huh?

621
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,700
Alright, just for a few seconds.

622
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,200
In the late 60's, a simulated fight
took place between two legends.

623
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.

624
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,000
Marciano, long retired,

625
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,900
and Ali, unable to fight
legitimately for 3 years

626
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,500
for having refused induction
into the Armed Forces,

627
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,300
was in need of money and agreed
to the so-called dream match,

628
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,900
whose outcome would
be decided by a computer.

629
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,300
It's almost 35 years
since Rocky Marciano

630
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
won the much disputed computer decision.

631
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
And guess what? Not much has changed!

632
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Last week, Rocky Balboa...

633
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,200
See? That's the cartoon
fight I told you about!

634
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,600
Yeah.

635
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,500
A stunning knock-out,

636
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,800
and keep in mind this has
taken the human factor out of it.

637
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,600
- Wow, that was beautiful.
- It says Rocky Balboa...

638
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
- ...would be triumphant.
- K.O. thirteen.

639
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
And here's some of the fallout.

640
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,600
You know, what has started as
a simple form of entertainment,

641
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,700
has now become this
rallying cry for people

642
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,700
who think an old-school
athlete like Balboa

643
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
could actually be better.

644
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,400
So the computer technology
has to create what is it.

645
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,500
That's just not responsible.

646
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,900
Get up, will you?

647
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,900
How do you think Balboa
would have done against Dixon?

648
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,500
Badly! Personally, I think
Balboa was completely overrated!

649
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
You know he owns a little
restaurant, in south Phila.

650
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,400
What's his specialty, pounded chicken?

651
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,200
Anyway, I would have
paid to see the fight!

652
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,500
Next topic, NASCAR and the
controversy that won't go away.

653
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,300
Let's go back to sunday's race...

654
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,900
Hey, hey, hey! Cheer up.

655
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,900
Free advertisement.
Come on, meat house's closed.

656
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yo, Robert.

657
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,900
What is this? What are
you doing out so late?

658
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Uh, you know, I tried calling
but no one was picking up.

659
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,700
- Something wrong?
- No,no.

660
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,800
I just wanted to come by
and see you personnaly.

661
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,700
You wanna come inside?

662
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,100
No, uh you know, I just want to
get your opinion on something.

663
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,600
Sure. Opinion on what?

664
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,200
Well, y'know what they say,
you only go around once, right?

665
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,800
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

666
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
I think I wanna like...do something.

667
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,800
Like what?

668
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,500
Fight!

669
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,500
Y'know, nothing big!
Small stuffs like locally.

670
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Don't you think you're too...

671
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,000
...y'know, old?

672
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah, but you think I
ought to stop trying things

673
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,700
cause you've had a
few too many birthdays.

674
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I do not.

675
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,100
People gonna think you're goin' crazy!

676
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,600
What's crazy about standing
toe to toe, sayin': "I am"?

677
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,100
It's just the ego you talking.

678
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,300
What are you trying to
prove to other people, pop?

679
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Prove? Listen, I...

680
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I stopped thinking the way the
other people think a long time ago!

681
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Ya know, you gotta think like you think.

682
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,400
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

683
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Face reality!

684
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,100
Okay? It's a different world now.

685
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Only the clothes is different.

686
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,700
I really don't know
what you want from me.

687
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,000
I just want us to get
involved you know, like...

688
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,600
...home team.

689
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,200
Whatever it is...

690
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
whatever you're going through...

691
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,000
It'll pass.

692
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

693
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,500
Time's gonna catch up for all of us.

694
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,900
Especially for standing still, you know?

695
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,500
Hey, come on.

696
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
C'mon, I'll call you in the morning.

697
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
Did you tell this to
your kid by the way?

698
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
Yeah, I did.

699
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
What did he think, you're nuts, right?

700
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Yeah.

701
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Well, you don't believe in you?

702
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,000
Welcome to my world, buddy!

703
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,900
Rocko, nobody's
giving you no title shot.

704
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,000
I know that, I don't want one.

705
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,800
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

706
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
No.

707
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
You're mad maybe because
they took down your statue?

708
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
No.

709
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,700
- No, really no.
- If it's about money...

710
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,900
...just hang a sign around your
neck, saying: "Punch Me!".

711
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Five dollars. You'll make big money!

712
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,600
What? You haven't peaked yet?

713
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked!

714
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,800
I don't know, there's still
some stuff in the basement.

715
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,100
- What basement?
- In here.

716
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Tell me about the stuff.

717
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,600
- What about it?
- Tell me about the stuff inside.

718
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,600
- Is it angry?
- Angry?

719
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,200
Are you mad because Adrian left you?

720
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

721
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

722
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,500
You know...sometimes
it's hard to breathe.

723
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,800
Y'know I fell this...

724
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
...beast inside me.

725
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,100
It's ok, Rocko. Please, it's ok.

726
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,100
Is it...

727
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,700
...ok.

728
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,100
I didn't know...I just never knew
it was supposed to be that hard.

729
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,000
It wasn't supposed to be
like this, Paulie. You know it.

730
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
I say, you wanna come
by and help me train?

731
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,700
- I've got a job here.
- I understand.

732
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,100
Remember you said if you
stay in one place long enough...

733
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
...you become that place?

734
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,400
Rocko, this is all like that.

735
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,000
I understand, Paulie. I do.

736
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,300
Well, if you get time, you may
come down and see me train.

737
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,400
I'd appreciate it.

738
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
Of course, Rocko.

739
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,400
Bye, Paulie.

740
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,400
Goodbye, Rocko.

741
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,100
Take care, Rocko.

742
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,500
This plenary session of the
Pennsylvania Athletic Commission

743
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,700
is convened in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa

744
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,000
for the issuance of the discretionary
professional boxing license.

745
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,500
Due to his ineligibility

746
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,900
to be licensed as a matter of right.

747
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,700
Mister Balboa, you're welcome here.

748
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,800
Since you're representing yourself,

749
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,900
we invite you to make an
opening statement if you'd like to.

750
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
No, I'm just curious
how I did, that's all.

751
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,800
Alright, well.

752
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,100
The medical advisory
report has informed us

753
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,400
that the battery of tests to
which you've been subjected,

754
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,600
you've passed these
tests with flying colors.

755
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
And we congratulate you for that.

756
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
- Thanks.
- However, this commission

757
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,300
in good conscious,

758
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,000
cannot recommend you for a license.

759
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,700
And we therefore deny your application.

760
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,100
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

761
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So I should get license, right?

762
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,400
Not exactly.

763
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,500
So, why did you give me all them
tests if you was never gonna passing me.

764
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,100
We've got to stand by our decision here.

765
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,400
And we have to deny your
request for a license at this time.

766
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,600
Yo, don't I got some rights?

767
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,700
What rights do you
think you're referring to?

768
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,900
Rights, like in that
official piece of paper

769
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,400
that they wrote down
on the streets there.

770
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,600
- That's the Bill of Rights.
- Yeah, yeah, the Bill of Rights.

771
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,900
Don't it say something about
going after what makes you happy?

772
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,700
No, that's the pursuit of
happiness. But, what's your point?

773
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,800
My point is I'm pursuing something
and nobody looks too happy about it.

774
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,100
But we're just looking
out for your interest.

775
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,100
I appreciate that, but
maybe you're looking out

776
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
for your interests
just a little bit more.

777
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,500
I mean, you shouldn't been
asking people to come down here

778
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,200
and pay the freight
on something they paid,

779
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,400
it still ain't good enough,
I mean, you think that's right?

780
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,900
I mean, maybe you're doing your job,

781
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,100
but why you gotta
stop me from doing mine?

782
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,300
Cause if you're willing to
go through all the battling

783
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
you got to go through to
get where you want to get,

784
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,700
who's got the right to stop you?

785
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,600
I mean, maybe some of you guys
got something you never fill in,

786
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,800
something you really wanna do,

787
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,400
something you never said
to somebody, something!

788
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,100
And you're told "No", even
after you have paid your dues.

789
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,700
Who's got the right to
tell you that? Who? Nobody!

790
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,600
It's your right to listen to your
gut, it ain't nobody's right to say no

791
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,100
after you earn the right to be what you
wanna be, and do what you wanna do!

792
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
You know, the older I get,

793
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,600
the more things I gotta
leave behind, that's life.

794
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,000
The only thing I'm asking you
guys is to leave on the table...

795
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,200
...is what's right.

796
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Yo! Have you seen the paper today?

797
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,300
One row, one row.

798
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,100
That is so great!

799
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,400
Alright. You know what? Let's
go get some food. Food food!

800
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,400
Come on, come on!

801
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,300
Come on! Hey!

802
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,500
The last two papers went in the toilet!

803
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,400
Nobody cares, you're not making
heavy-weight championship money.

804
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,300
There's a bunch of nobody out
there Mason, this is the bottom line

805
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,800
but I want to talk to you
about something I think

806
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,300
is an interesting opportunity.
We should run with it.

807
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Alright? Look at me.

808
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,900
You heard Rocky Balboa applied
for a license and got one, yeah?

809
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,400
Yeah, I heard he got a
licence, forget about it!

810
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,800
- Hear me out, hear me out!
- Hear what out?

811
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
You want me to fight a guy

812
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,700
that I can beat with both
hands tied behind my back?

813
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,700
Everybody knows you
can beat the guy sit down.

814
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,300
But that's not what it's
about, it's about making money!

815
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
We gotta capitalize
on that computer fight.

816
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,000
This thing could do a million buck,
that's 15.20 million to you, Mas'!

817
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,100
- Forget about it!
- Then what you wanna do?

818
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,200
Cause no one's beaten the door
down to watch you fight anymore.

819
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,700
Look man, we've got guarantee fight.

820
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
We don't have guarantee fight!

821
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,500
You wanna do this now? In front
of all your friends, well do it now.

822
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,000
- Whatever.
- We've got nothing, Mas'.

823
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,900
All the fights you command
with the pay-per-view fights,

824
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
all are rejected, you
know why? Am I rude?

825
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,900
There're all bummers out
there. Nobody's care about that.

826
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,300
There's no market value.

827
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,700
But, this Balboa thing is interesting.

828
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,300
- I won't do it.
- Because...listen to me!

829
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,200
It's a has-been name
remembered by the world.

830
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,400
And you wanna call this nostalgia
or whatever the hell you want,

831
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,100
but people can relate to that stuff.

832
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,300
This is a no-lose for
everybody, it's all good.

833
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,500
- Good for who?
- For you, not for me, for you!

834
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,000
Excuse me, maybe you don't understand.

835
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
People don't like you no more.

836
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
They don't follow you or they
don't support you anymore.

837
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,800
Don't you understand that?

838
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,300
And don't look at me like I'm
messing with your legacy.

839
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,400
Every jerk now thinks they got a legacy.

840
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,100
A legacy is what you get instead
of getting paid. That's a legacy.

841
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Hey, man! Don't talk to
me like I'm stupid, alright?

842
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,900
I'm not, I'm not no more.

843
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,400
Mas', Mas'! Everybody knows
you can kick this old man's ass.

844
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,700
But you don't. You leave him
with a little bit of dignity.

845
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,400
So they say: "Mason
Dixon's got compassion."

846
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,000
"He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."

847
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,200
You'll get a whole new audience,

848
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,700
with double of your
money on the next fight.

849
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,700
You wanna a new image
Mas'? That's how you get it!

850
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,400
What you mean, to replace the one at...?

851
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,500
Whoa, whoa wait, we made your
world green, you made the rest.

852
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,100
All this is you. You made
all this junk happened!

853
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,000
I've had enough to
you with this mess, man!

854
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,800
It's time for me to make some
changes, I'm goin' back to Mart's gym.

855
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,400
Alright, we'll talk about that.

856
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,300
I want Martin back,
there's nothing to talk about.

857
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,000
- Hey, how're you doing?
- Hey, what a surprise!

858
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,600
I was just driving around
the neighborhood, I thought:

859
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,800
"Well, why not drive
by, and say hello?".

860
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,500
Do you want to come inside?

861
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,200
No, I gotta let the
dog do some exercise.

862
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,700
- Do you want to take a little walk?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, alright.

863
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
It's nice outside.

864
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,700
Alright.

865
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Nice and brisk.

866
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
When did you get a dog?

867
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,800
Uh, we picked up Punchy
a couple of days back.

868
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,000
- Punchy?
- Yeah.

869
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,400
You named a dog "Punchy"?

870
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,100
Well, actually, your
kid come up with the name!

871
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,200
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

872
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,800
I think that's disrespectful.

873
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh, no no, it's fine really, no.

874
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,600
It's easy to remember,
you told that, you know.

875
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,800
Listen, what do you think about
coming over to the restaurant?

876
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,700
- What for?
- Well, you know, for like...

877
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,200
...for work! The hostess
is gonna be having a kid.

878
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,300
- You'll do good!
- Uh, I don't know.

879
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,100
I tell you you'll do
good, you'll do so good.

880
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,500
I appreciate what you're
doing for my kid. But I can't.

881
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,200
But you know...Hey listen,
I think you'll like it a lot.

882
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,800
It's a nice environment,
it's very pleasant.

883
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,000
Can we drop it?

884
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,500
What's bothering you?

885
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,000
Nothing, it's alright.
Listen, I got to get back.

886
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
- No, it ain't alright.
- Oh, come on.

887
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,200
Why?

888
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,500
Well, am I supposed to be the first
person people see when they walk in?

889
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah, you just give them menus,

890
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,900
you say "Hello how are
you?", you sit people down...

891
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,600
But look little Marie! If I
can do it, anybody can do it.

892
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,200
But you can find ten byte of people,
a hundred byte of people for this job.

893
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Give it a trial, like two weeks.

894
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,600
I don't wanna try.

895
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,700
Yo, who put that stuff in your head?

896
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Nobody.

897
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,500
Well, it just don't
get in there by itself.

898
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,900
Thanks for coming by.

899
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,000
Yo!

900
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,100
When was the last time you
went dancing? Has it been a while?

901
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Why are you asking me that?

902
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,300
Well, I'm askin' cuz you dance
around all these promises,

903
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,500
you might want to
come and dance with me.

904
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,100
I ain't that good, but you know,

905
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,100
I'm probably better
than the average bear!

906
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Where that came from, I don't know!

907
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,200
Crazy!

908
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, a little bit. But the way you're
thinking, the way you're talking...

909
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,400
...that's a little crazy, too!

910
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,100
Come on, you deserve better, really.

911
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Come on...

912
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,400
I need you to class my place up.

913
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,900
Feel I need ya!

914
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,800
And if you say:

915
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,700
"Screw you, creepo"
again, I totally understand.

916
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,100
But I warn you right now.
I'm gonna put myself like

917
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,100
geographically in the
middle of the street here,

918
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,600
and staying here, me and Punchy

919
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,100
and wave to the first bus:

920
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,800
"Come on over here, mash me!"

921
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,700
Cause little Marie turned
down the job at the restaurant!

922
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,000
She thinks she's better than us.

923
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, yeah?

924
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,600
Well, there hasn't been a bus
down here in twenty years.

925
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,300
- Yeah?
- No.

926
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,400
That was a close call!

927
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,100
Listen, seriously.

928
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,400
Come on, be nice.

929
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
Alright.

930
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,500
Paulie.

931
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,700
Sorry, Paulie.

932
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,900
Sorry, came from upstairs.

933
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,400
How are you, get my unusual over there.

934
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,000
Excuse me...

935
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
Deliveries here are in the back.

936
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,700
I'm not a delivery guy.

937
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,400
Well, do you have a reservation?

938
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,600
Do I look like a freakin' Indian?

939
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,700
Hey, Rock. Rocky!

940
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,600
I think we got a little bit
of a problem with this guy.

941
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,000
A problem? No, no, he's just a relative.

942
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh...

943
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,700
Oh, okay.

944
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yo, Paulie.

945
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,600
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

946
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,700
- Why?
- Needed to.

947
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,000
- What happened?
- I'm celebrating, Rock.

948
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,400
- Why?
- I'm retired.

949
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,000
Retired?

950
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,700
So when they start giving retired
people meat instead of watches, Paulie?

951
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,200
I don't need a watch.

952
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,300
I've got a watch.

953
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,600
You gave me a watch.

954
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,600
Paulie...

955
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,500
I don't need a goddamn watch!

956
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,500
- Yo, Paulie.
- I've got a watch!

957
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,100
I've got two watches.

958
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,000
Yo, Paulie!

959
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,800
Yo, Paulie.

960
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,200
Rock.

961
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,500
It takes guts climbing
back in that ring,

962
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
knowing you're gonna take a beating!

963
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,200
- You're gonna do alright, Rocko.
- How do you know that?

964
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
The stuff in the basement.

965
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,000
Thanks, Paulie.

966
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,900
- Hey.
- Hey, Rocky.

967
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,000
You're OK?

968
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,500
Yeah, yeah, good, good. How're you?

969
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,100
- Oh, yeah, fine.
- Good.

970
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,000
Listen, there's some guys
who'd want to talk to you.

971
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,200
- Okay.
- Okay?

972
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Yeah.

973
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,300
Thanks for coming by, I appreciate it.

974
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,400
No problem, our pleasure.

975
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,700
So, you wanna hear some stories?

976
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,900
What kind of stories?

977
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,600
Well, a lot of people like to hear
these old fight stories, you know?

978
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,100
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

979
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,300
I'm Lou DiBella.

980
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,100
This is Elso Luca. He's
Mason Dixon's manager.

981
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,500
Would you sit down with us?

982
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,000
Sure.

983
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,800
Please.

984
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,400
You know, we have
the commercial contract

985
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
for Mason Dixon, who's
a big fan by the way.

986
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,800
Really?

987
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,000
And when he heard you're
interested in fight again,

988
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,300
he thought: "Why not to
try to work something out?".

989
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,500
Like a special event.

990
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,500
Like a first class exhibition fight.

991
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,900
- Why me?
- He respects the helluva you.

992
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,700
Alright, and let's be honest, that
computer fight got people curious.

993
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,200
This could be very interesting.

994
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,500
Yeah, but I ain't interested in
getting like mangled and embarrassed.

995
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,600
No, that's not gonna
happen, never happen.

996
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,900
Truthfully, I was thinking
more, you know like

997
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,200
minuscule, small level.
You know, small fights.

998
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Not big fights, small fights...

999
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,800
Things that local...you
know what I mean?

1000
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,100
Not a bad idea, but
don't think of this as big.

1001
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,500
Think of it like a
set, like a exhibition.

1002
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,400
Think of this like a
glorified sparring session.

1003
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,900
And here's something
I think you'll like.

1004
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,100
We're gonna donate a
portion of the gain to charity.

1005
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,800
- That's always nice.
- Well, it's good to give.

1006
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,600
Yeah.

1007
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,400
- Where is it taking place?
- Las Vegas.

1008
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,400
Nice and warm. This
cold's gonna be killing you.

1009
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:42,800
It's stiff.

1010
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
You'll do better when you're
warmer, you know that.

1011
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,600
- Yeah...
- And not nothing else...

1012
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,300
...you'll have new stories to tell.

1013
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,800
I really got to think about this.

1014
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
Absolutely.

1015
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,200
- Is that okay?
- Understand. No problem.

1016
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,700
I'm gonna go over there,
you guys can order something.

1017
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,300
- What do you recommend?
- It's all eatable.

1018
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,200
OK...thanks.

1019
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,800
We got him.

1020
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Imagine Dixon met this
bastard in his prime...

1021
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,100
- He'll kill him!
- No kidding.

1022
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,100
Man, I'm confused...

1023
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
I didn't think this
is gonna come along...

1024
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,000
But this is what you wanted, right?

1025
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,100
I don't know...

1026
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,400
You know, I talk and I talk,

1027
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,500
and sometimes I think what
I'm saying is true, and then...

1028
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,100
You know, I look at myself, I'm not
even sure what is true anymore.

1029
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,100
Cuz it's like I pushed this
crazy idea about fighting.

1030
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,700
I mean, what's it all about?

1031
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,000
Do I really care about standing
toe to toe, and all that stuff?

1032
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Or like my kid says, it's just like...

1033
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,300
...ego?

1034
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,800
What am I like, this old pub?

1035
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,100
Who's just trying to replace
old paint with new paint?

1036
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,700
I don't know...I don't know.

1037
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,700
Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.

1038
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,400
Almost...

1039
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,600
...listening and looking.

1040
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
But you know who you are,

1041
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,500
you know the part of
you that's so full of life.

1042
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,400
I mean...we all have
that feeling, that fire,

1043
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,200
but we usually never
get a chance to use it.

1044
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,900
And then it just goes away.

1045
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,300
But you can, you've got this
opportunity. So you do it. Why not?

1046
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,400
I mean this is who you are. You
know, this is who you'll always be.

1047
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,300
And you don't move the side for
nobody until you're ready to move.

1048
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,200
And it doesn't matter how
this looks to other people.

1049
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,600
All that matters is how it looks to you.

1050
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,300
Rocky...

1051
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,500
Rocky, look at me.

1052
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,900
How it looks to you.

1053
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,500
And if this is something
that you wanna do,

1054
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,100
and if this is something that
you gotta do, then you do it.

1055
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,200
Fighters fight!

1056
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,500
You're not gonna punch me, right?

1057
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
Alright, listen. I gotta go
before I wear up my welcome.

1058
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,500
I'll see you tomorrow.

1059
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,300
Thanks.

1060
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Fighters fight, right.

1061
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,900
It's rare when you got to promote
an event that's bigger than boxing.

1062
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,800
This is skill versus will.

1063
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,800
With part of the
proceeds going to charity.

1064
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The brave child of Mason Dixon...

1065
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,300
...to honor passed
heavy-weight champions.

1066
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,800
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.

1067
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,500
Let's open up for questions.

1068
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,300
Hey, champ!

1069
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,900
Rocky, a few great fighters
have fought in their fifties,

1070
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,900
often with disastrous results.

1071
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,400
Why risk the danger of embarrassment?

1072
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,000
The smart money says you
have virtually no chance.

1073
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,300
Puncher always has a chance.

1074
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,600
This fight will be competitive.

1075
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,700
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

1076
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,400
I'd rather do something...

1077
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,500
...I love badly, but...

1078
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,600
Rocky, the press has
labeled you "Balboasourus"!

1079
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,400
How do you feel about that?

1080
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,800
Mason, let's say before it happens.

1081
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,900
You win, we'll say
you've beaten an old guy.

1082
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,000
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade!

1083
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,100
Y'all know that will never happen.

1084
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,100
This is only exhibition!
Don't go try to make more out

1085
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,200
of this than that computer tried.

1086
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,700
Is this sport had enough trouble
without these circus events?

1087
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,100
Next question.

1088
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,500
This looks like a cheap bit of ring
theater between, no offense,

1089
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,700
a has-been and a man whose own
credible legacy and popularity is in doubt.

1090
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,200
- What's the up-side?
- Doubt?

1091
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,200
Up-side? I mean...

1092
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,400
What do you mean upside?

1093
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
I mean what do I have to do?

1094
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,000
You know, I'm 33 over 30 knock-outs.

1095
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,100
I'm doing you people a favor, I'm
gonna do this exhibition for you all!

1096
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,200
And you got to get up here
to make a mockery outta me?

1097
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,500
I'm the champ!

1098
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,100
I mean, I get pissed this guy get hurt!

1099
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,800
See you at the fight!

1100
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
This guy's a joke,
he's gonna get crushed!

1101
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,300
Hello, look who's here!

1102
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,400
Hi, uncle Paulie.

1103
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,500
- Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

1104
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Thanks.

1105
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,200
You're doing good.

1106
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,600
Go eat something, alright?

1107
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,400
Excuse me.

1108
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,800
How ya doin'?

1109
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,900
Glad you'd come by!

1110
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,800
- Can I talk with you?
- Sure.

1111
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,300
Can we do it outside?

1112
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,400
So, you're going through with this?

1113
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, I start training tomorrow.

1114
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,900
Hey, Rock!

1115
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,300
I've made some connections.

1116
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,300
I can make some money
on these endorsements.

1117
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,300
Absolutely, do that.

1118
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
- Thank you, Rock.
- Sure.

1119
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,000
So, you're nervous about the fight?

1120
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,700
I'm scared to death!

1121
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,200
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

1122
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,400
Then you don't have to do it.

1123
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,500
Yeah, well, I think I do.

1124
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,100
You know, living with
you, it hasn't been easy.

1125
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,000
People see me, but they think of you!

1126
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,800
Now with all this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever!

1127
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,900
- It don't have to be.
- No, sure it does!

1128
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,500
Why, you've got a lot going on, kid.

1129
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,700
About my last name?

1130
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,600
That's the reason I got a decent job.

1131
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,800
That's the reason why people
deal with me in the first place.

1132
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,800
Now I start to get a little ahead.

1133
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,200
I start to get a little
something for myself.

1134
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,400
And this happens!

1135
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,300
Now I'm asking you as a favor
not to go through this, OK?

1136
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,900
This is only gonna end up bad for
you, and it's gonna end up bad for me.

1137
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,200
- You think I'm hurting you?
- Yeah, in the way you are.

1138
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,000
It's the last thing
I ever wanted to do...

1139
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,700
I know that's not what you wanna do.

1140
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,300
But that's just the way that it is!

1141
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,800
Don't you care what people think?

1142
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,000
Doesn't it bother you that
people making you out to be a joke,

1143
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,500
and I'm gonna be included in now?

1144
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,900
Do you think that's right?

1145
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
Do you?

1146
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,200
You ain't gonna believe this.

1147
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,500
But you used to fit right here.

1148
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,700
I hold you up and said to your mother:

1149
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,100
"This kid's gonna be the
best kid in the world."

1150
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,300
"This kid's gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew."

1151
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,900
And you grew up good and wonderful.

1152
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,400
It was great just watching,
every day was like a privilege.

1153
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,700
Then the time come for
you to be your own man,

1154
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,700
and take on the world. And you did.

1155
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,500
But somewhere along the line,

1156
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,600
you changed.

1157
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,600
You stopped being you.

1158
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
You let people stick
a finger in your face,

1159
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,000
and tell you you're no good.

1160
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,700
And when things got hard, you
started to look for something to blame.

1161
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,100
Like a big shadow...

1162
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Let me tell you
something you already know.

1163
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,700
The world ain't all
sunshines and rainbows.

1164
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,000
It's a very mean and nasty place,

1165
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,400
and I don't care how tough you
are, it'll beat you to your knees

1166
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,600
and keep it there
permanently if you let it.

1167
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,300
You, me or nobody...

1168
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,500
...is gonna hit as hard as life.

1169
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,900
But it ain't about how hard you hit.

1170
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,800
It's about how hard you can get hit,

1171
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,500
and keep moving forward.
How much you can take,

1172
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,100
and keep moving forward.

1173
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,500
That's how winning is done!

1174
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,300
Now, if you know what you're worth,
then go out and get what you're worth.

1175
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
But you gotta be
willing to take the hits.

1176
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,100
And not pointing fingers saying
you ain't what you wanna be

1177
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,300
because of him, or her, or anybody.

1178
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,700
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!

1179
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,400
You're better than that!

1180
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,400
I'm always gonna love
you, no matter what.

1181
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,600
No matter what happens.

1182
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,800
You're my son, you're my blood.

1183
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,500
You're the best thing in my life.

1184
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,400
But until you start
believing in yourself...

1185
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,200
You ain't gonna have a life.

1186
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,800
Don't forget to visit your mother.

1187
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,900
- Yeah, that is beautiful.
- Yeah.

1188
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,600
- You got off early from work?
- No...I left.

1189
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,700
I quit.

1190
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,400
Quit, why?

1191
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,100
I wasn't very...

1192
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,700
I don't know, I just...

1193
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,700
...I didn't fit in there.

1194
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,300
I understand.

1195
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,000
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

1196
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,100
Right now, I'd rather be with you.

1197
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,600
You're not alright?

1198
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,600
Yeah.

1199
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,100
It's been a long time
since I've seen a fight.

1200
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,600
You know all there is
to know about fighting.

1201
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,700
So there's no senses of going
down that same old road again.

1202
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,500
To beat this guy,

1203
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,900
you need speed.

1204
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,300
You don't have it.

1205
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,600
And your knees can't take the pound.

1206
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,200
So hard running is out.

1207
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,600
And you got arthritis in your neck.

1208
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,000
And you've got calcium
deposits on most of your joints.

1209
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,400
So sparring is out.

1210
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,800
I had that problem!

1211
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,400
So what we'll be calling on,

1212
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,700
is good old-fashioned
blunt force trauma.

1213
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,800
Horsepower.

1214
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,300
Heavy duty, cast iron,
pile driving punches,

1215
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,800
that will have to hurt so
much that'll rattle his ancestors.

1216
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,500
Every time you hit him with a shot,

1217
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,600
it's got to feel like he tried
kissing the express train!

1218
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,600
Yeah!

1219
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,500
Let's start building some hurtin' bombs!

1220
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,500
Come on, you can do it.

1221
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,400
You'll get it, you'll get it.

1222
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,200
You can do it, Rocko.

1223
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,200
Getting stronger.

1224
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,600
Up, up, up!

1225
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,700
Come on!

1226
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,700
Rocko.

1227
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,600
You can do this.

1228
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,700
Yeah!

1229
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,200
Come on, Rocko.

1230
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,300
Come on, come on.

1231
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,700
Take him, take him.

1232
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,200
You can do it, Rocko.

1233
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,300
Getting stronger!

1234
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,000
Up, up, up!

1235
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,500
Push!

1236
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,600
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

1237
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,700
Rocky Balboa...

1238
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,100
...217!

1239
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,300
The undisputed heavy-weight
champion Mason Dixon...

1240
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,800
...221!

1241
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,300
Thank you very much, I
appreciate it, champ! Thanks a lot.

1242
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,100
- How much money is in this?
- A lot of it!

1243
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,100
Imagine trying to clean this place!

1244
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,400
- Seriously...
- Balboa!

1245
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,600
Alright you guys, I'll catch
up with y'all later, okay?

1246
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,300
Robert, I want you to hang with me.

1247
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,800
- How ya doin', champ?
- I'm good.

1248
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,700
Yo man, there's no reason for
neither one of us get hurt in this fight.

1249
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,400
I'll do my best to care you.

1250
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,500
Make sure you save face.
There'll be no embarrassment.

1251
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,900
But I promise you...

1252
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,900
...you try to press me, you hit
me, you hurt me, you hit me low,

1253
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,800
cheap shot me, I'll get you outta there!

1254
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,700
You know...a lotta people
come to Vegas to lose, I didn't.

1255
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,300
- It's already over.
- It ain't over till it's over!

1256
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,900
- Where's that from, the 80's?
- That's probably the 70's.

1257
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,100
Just remember what I said.

1258
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,100
Hey, yo champ!

1259
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,800
Yo, aren't you a little scared?

1260
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,000
I don't get scared.

1261
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,100
You know, I think you try a
little harder when you're scared...

1262
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,100
This is...

1263
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,300
...what has worked for me.

1264
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,300
- You scared, aren't you?
- Oh, yeah, you're even scarier than me!

1265
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,800
Come on, let's see what you've got.

1266
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Come on...

1267
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,500
Hey, don't hurt me, I'm brittle!

1268
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,400
- Hey.
- Hi.

1269
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,800
How're you doing?

1270
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,800
No, I was just thinking to
tomorrow. Do you want to come in?

1271
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,300
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

1272
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,400
Uh, I just wanted to...

1273
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,400
...I don't know, come by and
wish you good luck for tomorrow.

1274
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,600
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1275
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,700
I've brought you something.

1276
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,300
I hope you don't mind I
took it from the restaurant.

1277
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Adrian...

1278
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Yeah...thought you keep it safe here.

1279
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
Yeah, she's always brought me luck!

1280
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,300
Yeah!

1281
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,900
Yeah...listen, I wanted
to say thanks for everything

1282
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,600
you've done for me and my kid, you know.

1283
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,900
You've been great and...

1284
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,800
It's, you know, tomorrow...

1285
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,800
You're gonna prove that the last thing
to age on somebody is their heart.

1286
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,900
- I'll try.
- You go showing.

1287
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Thank you.

1288
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,700
The heavy-weight championship has
been one of sports most coveted titles,

1289
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,900
for a hundred and twenty years.

1290
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,800
Two-time heavy-weight
champion Rocky Balboa,

1291
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,400
the Philadelphia slugger,

1292
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
renowned for his cast iron jaw,

1293
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,400
coriaceous body
attack and will of steel.

1294
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,100
All of it to carry the
much smaller fighter

1295
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,000
to numerous victories over the years,

1296
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,500
against physically superior opponents.

1297
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,200
And Mason Dixon, the current
heavy-weight title holder,

1298
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,700
with all the speed, determination
and confidence any fighter could want.

1299
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,000
But many still question,

1300
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500
whether he has the
heart of a true champion.

1301
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,700
Never having been
pushed to go the distance.

1302
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,600
Tonight, we find out.

1303
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,300
We're at the Mandalay Bay
Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada,

1304
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,100
for the much anticipated showdown,

1305
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,300
between Mason "The Line" Dixon,

1306
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,200
and Rocky "The Italian Stallion"Balboa.

1307
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Hello again! I'm Jim Lampley with
Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman,

1308
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,700
live from the Mandelay
Bay Hotel in Las Vegas,

1309
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,100
where we anticipate one of the most
outrageous and compelling events,

1310
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,900
in boxing history!

1311
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,800
The current, unappreciated heavy-weight
champion Mason "The Line" Dixon,

1312
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
putting his reputation on the line,

1313
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,400
against legendary
ex-ex-ex-champion Rocky Balboa.

1314
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,900
Even though most see this as
more of a glorified sparring session,

1315
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,700
the energy in the room is electric!

1316
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,100
Larry, why is this
built as an exhibition?

1317
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,300
Well, I guess, so they wouldn't
have to call it an execution!

1318
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,400
Zechariah 4.6 says:

1319
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,300
It is not by strength...

1320
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,000
...not by might...

1321
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,400
...but by his spirit...

1322
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:51,500
...we have already claimed the
victory in our Lord Jesus Christ.

1323
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,600
- Good luck, Rocky.
- Thanks, Spider.

1324
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,800
I appreciate it.

1325
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,700
Nobody's expecting much I think,

1326
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,100
from the way past his prime
former champion, Rocky Balboa.

1327
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,200
Rock...

1328
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,800
I gotta talk to ya.

1329
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,100
Look...

1330
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,200
Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you want to get outta your system.

1331
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,900
Tonight, you do it!

1332
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:24,900
Right?

1333
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,100
Get rid of the damn beast.

1334
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,400
Let it be done once and for all!

1335
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,700
Please, I love you.

1336
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:44,600
Here go the lights! The applause is
bulding toward the glory present off.

1337
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,800
Where that come from?

1338
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,500
I chose it...

1339
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,700
...I love Sinatra!

1340
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,900
He's very good, Sinatra.

1341
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,000
Let's go!

1342
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,200
Very good.

1343
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,700
Here comes Rocky Balboa.

1344
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,400
A fairy of the warriors,

1345
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,600
here for one more last round.

1346
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,500
Or the last supper, perhaps
with him as the main course!

1347
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:26,000
What's that music, you can't be serious!

1348
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,900
High hopes. Talk about wishful thinking.

1349
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,400
Well, maybe no hopes
is more realistic, anyway

1350
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,500
the crowd likes it!

1351
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,100
Look at the Italian
Stallion, cool and relaxed.

1352
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,900
Rocky's off the board
underdog, and they don't care at all.

1353
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,500
This is about his pride and dignity,

1354
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,500
and this punch guy's
the last thing to go,

1355
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,500
is the guy's punch. Rocky
always has that puncher's chance.

1356
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,100
Rocky Balboa is still, as you can
hear, the people's champion!

1357
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,400
Prediction guys, for
at least two rounds,

1358
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,100
Dixon's gonna have his head fold.

1359
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,500
Two whole rounds? We have a
cockeyed optimist in the house!

1360
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,700
How ya doin'?

1361
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,200
Crowd wants to see something,

1362
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,800
real or at least.

1363
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,600
Rocky Balboa just asked
me how I'm doing now,

1364
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,200
I grew up watching this guy!

1365
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,900
I never thought I'll be
covering one of his fights!

1366
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,500
This is unbelievable,
I'm a fan, I can't help it!

1367
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,500
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

1368
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,800
Mason Dixon is establishing
his presence on the ring, and...

1369
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,600
...somewhere near, a conversation
breaking out at the ring side.

1370
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,600
Mike Tyson, calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

1371
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,700
You can't win...

1372
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,200
I'm the champ!

1373
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,300
You should've fought against me!

1374
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:22,300
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Mandalay Bay resort,

1375
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,600
and casino in Las Vegas.

1376
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,400
And a special main event of the evening,

1377
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,500
ten rounds of heavy-weight excitement!

1378
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,200
Session by the Nevada
State Athletic Comission.

1379
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,700
And when the bell rings, the
referee in charge of the action,

1380
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,700
Joe Cortez.

1381
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,100
And now, for the
thousands in attendance,

1382
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and the millions
watching around the world.

1383
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,300
Ladies and gentlemen...

1384
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:54,200
...let's get ready to rrruuuummmmble!

1385
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,900
Into the scene first,

1386
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,900
fighting over the blue
corner, wearing black with gold,

1387
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,500
official weight 217 pounds.

1388
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:08,900
His professional record, 57
victories including 54 knock-outs,

1389
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,500
with 23 defeats and 1 draw.

1390
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,100
He's the fighting pride of Philadelphia,

1391
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,300
the two-time heavy-weight
champion of the world...

1392
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,700
..."The Italian Stallion", Rocky Balboa!

1393
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,400
I'll beat him till his head busts.

1394
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
Shut up!

1395
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,100
Across the ring, fighting
up at the red corner,

1396
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
wearing white with blue.

1397
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,100
Official weight 221 pounds.

1398
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,500
He has a perfect professional record.

1399
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,000
Consisting of 33 bouts,

1400
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,400
33 victories, including 30 knock-outs.

1401
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,900
Originally from Tampa, Florida, but
now fighting at Las Vegas, Nevada,

1402
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:03,900
The reigning, undisputed, undefeated

1403
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:09,000
heavy-weight champion of
the world, Mason "The Line" Dixon.

1404
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,200
Alright, gentlemen.

1405
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,900
Alright, Mason.

1406
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,600
Rocky, we went the
rules at the dresser room.

1407
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
I expect a good clean fight,

1408
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,300
watch for kidney punches,
rabbit punches, those low blows,

1409
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,300
be careful with those, alright?

1410
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,600
Gimme good sportsmen-like combat.

1411
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,400
Remember, gentlemen a fair, but a firm!

1412
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,300
Touch your gloves.

1413
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,300
Enjoy the ride.

1414
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,100
Champion's not in the best
shape we've seen him in.

1415
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,800
Maybe just plans to pound this winning,

1416
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,500
and go home early.
That wouldn't be a surprise.

1417
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,600
Love you, kid. Glad you could make it.

1418
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,100
One thing about Rocky we know for sure:

1419
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,400
this guy's showing up in shape!

1420
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,900
The old man's crazy!

1421
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,700
You know what, he's
gotta be crazy, he's in here.

1422
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,000
Okay.

1423
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,800
You just take it easy,
this is an exhibition, alright?

1424
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,200
- Alright, alright.
- You'll tune it.

1425
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,700
You got three rounds to set a pace now,

1426
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,300
every time you hit him,
you gonna make a damp.

1427
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,200
Got it.

1428
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,700
The moments before Rocky Balboa
fight. I can't believe it's here!

1429
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,900
Round one begins. If old George Foreman,

1430
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,300
shocked the world with one
punch, why can't be Rocky Balboa?

1431
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,500
And as much the excitement
as the race in the arena,

1432
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,700
there's a sense of foreboding as well.

1433
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,000
And now, Mason "The Line"
Dixon goes to work with his jab,

1434
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,200
as though he's fighting against
the number one challenger,

1435
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,600
in the heavy-weight division.

1436
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,700
See, this is to be expected early on.

1437
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,000
You knew the champ is
gonna control the distance

1438
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,700
with his jab, his height, his range.

1439
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,000
Balboa, looking to get
a shot, misses wildly!

1440
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,700
You like that?

1441
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,400
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

1442
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,400
Now Rocky is understandably frustrated,

1443
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,500
he came out of retirement
to get into a fight.

1444
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,000
The guy's named Rocky,
don't like to be toyed with.

1445
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,900
One punch can still turn it around.

1446
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,200
Apparently, he forgot his
arthritis meds this morning!

1447
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,200
Rocky misses.

1448
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,300
There's a meat-seeking missile
from the jab by the champ.

1449
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
Pour pinpoint dance by Dixon.

1450
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,600
There's a hard right hand
and a left and a right by Balboa!

1451
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,700
He prised Dixon into the
rope with a series of shots.

1452
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,500
And the crowd goes insane!

1453
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,200
C'mon!

1454
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,000
C'mon!

1455
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,300
Dixon punishing Balboa

1456
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,000
for the temerity of landing those shots.

1457
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,100
It's toe to toe in the corner,
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

1458
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,400
Balboa landing hook combination
to the head of the champion.

1459
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,600
A wake-up call for Dixon.

1460
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,100
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright, yeah!

1461
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,600
Sit down.

1462
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,100
Man's got bricks in his gloves!

1463
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,700
What happened to your
angry stuff in the basement?

1464
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:46,500
It's still there, it's still there!

1465
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,100
Well, he came to battle you, okay?

1466
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,200
Listen to me!

1467
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,500
Things that he bomb in your body
he can break, he's gonna do it!

1468
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,300
His bomb breaks too.

1469
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,000
- Alright? Give the man a little respect!
- What about my respect?

1470
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,600
Rocky box numbers
tell a ghostly story here.

1471
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,200
Balboa landed 9 to 13
punches in that round.

1472
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,400
Dixon landed an incredible...

1473
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,900
...59 out of 69!

1474
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,300
Are you listening to me?

1475
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,600
Rocky's been here a
million times before.

1476
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
Coming out to start another round,

1477
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,800
after he took a beating.

1478
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,200
- Remember what I said, okay?
- I won't...I won't.

1479
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,700
Rocky's tired. His legs are
going fast or already gone.

1480
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,900
And what's truly extraordinary,

1481
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,600
is that Rocky can still take it!

1482
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:30,200
The Boxing Comission, which remember
was criticized for licensing again,

1483
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,900
will be massacred if
something happen to Rocky.

1484
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,300
And a monstrous straight left hand!

1485
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,800
Down goes Rocky, and that could
conceivably be the end of the fight.

1486
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,900
That could be the
exhibition right there, but no.

1487
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,800
Balboa up.

1488
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:51,000
As referee Joe Cortez asks if he
wants to continue, and Rocky says yes!

1489
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,900
Even Rocky Balboa could be
too brave for his own good.

1490
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,900
Dixon comes right
back to try to finish it!

1491
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,300
Balboa almost went down.

1492
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,600
Rocky actually shuts Dixon back.

1493
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,800
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

1494
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,800
Cover up! Cover up!

1495
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,800
Open shots at close
range right and left hands,

1496
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,100
and down goes Balboa,
perhaps for the last time,

1497
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,300
in his fighting career.

1498
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,800
That should do it.

1499
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,700
4, 5, 6, 7...

1500
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,400
- Get up, get up!
- Eight.

1501
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,400
Nine.

1502
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,700
- How do you feel, man? You OK?
- Alright, alright.

1503
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,400
Rocko! C'mon!

1504
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,100
He convinces Cortez he
wants to keep fighting.

1505
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,100
Dixon's pointing the ref to end it.

1506
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,500
Rocky waving his arm to say he's fine!

1507
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,700
Let it go, let it go!

1508
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,400
And Balboa comes back
with a left and a right,

1509
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,600
and bows Dixon into the ropes,

1510
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,700
for the second round in a row!

1511
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,100
And back comes Dixon
with brutal left hand shot.

1512
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,100
Dixon hurt his hand there!

1513
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,200
Go after him!

1514
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,300
This is Rocky's best chance
right here, the champ

1515
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,400
obviously just turning
his hand on Rocky's rib.

1516
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,000
And Balboa immediately
going to work to the body!

1517
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,200
Huge right hook.

1518
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,800
Balboa ripping the way Dixon's body.

1519
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,200
These are big punches.

1520
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,600
Yes!

1521
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:10,100
Rocky Balboa has knocked the
reigning heavy-weight champion down!

1522
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,100
- Two, three...
- You hurt him, Rocky!

1523
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,800
Mason the Line Dixon
has never taken this kind

1524
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,500
of punishment in his
entire professional career!

1525
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,900
Maybe he's fearing that guy, but the
body shots nearly caved in his ribs.

1526
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,400
Balboa is thinking knock-out himself!

1527
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,100
Another counter hook by
Balboa followed by two more!

1528
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,700
Dixon fires back his own hooks.

1529
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,500
- Now Rocky's stunned.
- All along the ropes...

1530
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,400
...as round two comes to a close.

1531
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,800
I mean a giant turmoil into the ring!

1532
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,600
Incredible!

1533
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,600
You're alright!

1534
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,600
Welcome to Rockyland!

1535
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

1536
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,300
We lose, it's your ass. Your ass!

1537
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,000
It will numb up on you, alright?
It will numb up in a few rounds.

1538
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,300
Once the hand numbs up,

1539
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,500
Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.

1540
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,500
Until then, here's Rocky's chance.

1541
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,600
You can do it!

1542
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,600
Take the pain, champ.

1543
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,500
Hey, stay on! Everybody thought
this was a joke, including me!

1544
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,500
Now nobody's laughing!

1545
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,600
Stay on, you go get him!

1546
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,800
Go out strong!

1547
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,100
Keep him up there.

1548
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,300
That's it, that's it!

1549
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,700
You won that round, break him down!

1550
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,000
Bomb him, bomb him!

1551
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,200
Yeah!

1552
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,300
Just keep throwing the bomb!

1553
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,400
Come on!

1554
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,800
You can do it!

1555
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,000
Yeah, go on.

1556
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,500
Go to him, run over him.

1557
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,300
Unload on him.

1558
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,500
Dig down, Mason!

1559
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,600
There's nearly nothing
left on the table, guys.

1560
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,300
The fans are still standing.

1561
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,200
They'll not be able to
sit down for a week.

1562
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,200
You're doing great.

1563
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,000
I can do better. I feel good.

1564
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,100
He's okay?

1565
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,700
I've gotten worse.

1566
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,500
Toe to toe, one round to go.

1567
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,400
Who would have
believed this was possible?

1568
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,500
Can you see out of your eye?

1569
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,300
Wait, let me talk, let me
talk! Look at me, look at me!

1570
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,400
Don't take any more chances
out there than you have to.

1571
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,800
There's nothing more to prove, pop.

1572
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,200
There's nothing more to prove!

1573
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,400
I gotta go out, the way I gotta go out.

1574
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,800
You can do it, Rocko!

1575
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,500
- You can do it, Rocko!
- One more round, we go home.

1576
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,400
Okay, then do it.

1577
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,100
There's an old saying
that every great champion

1578
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,200
has one great fight left in their own.

1579
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,500
And Rocky is proving it, so far.

1580
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,700
Come on, let's go
guys. Touch your gloves.

1581
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,600
Rocko! The last round of your life!

1582
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,400
- Come on, guys.
- The last round!

1583
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,800
Come on, touch your gloves. Let's go.

1584
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,600
- You're one crazy old man!
- You'll get there.

1585
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,400
Let's go.

1586
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,700
Tenth round of a scheduled ten.

1587
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,400
Who would ever have
dreamed that Rocky Balboa

1588
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,800
would still be in this quoit

1589
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,500
exhibition against the
heavy-weight champion of the world?

1590
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,500
You can do it, come on!

1591
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,500
This fight is what goes Dixon got
on the job training and courage.

1592
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,000
Cover up, cover up.

1593
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,900
They're both in a pain freeze-up,

1594
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,600
these guys to fight in
another dimension by that.

1595
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,000
Unbelief, Balboa's just walking
straight into the Dixon's punches!

1596
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,000
Target practice for Dixon.

1597
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,400
They're exchanging right hooks.
Balboa's thrilled, here comes Dixon.

1598
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,100
He's exhausted punching the man.

1599
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,800
Rocky's sprawling out, Mas'!

1600
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,500
What is it you said to the kid?

1601
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,800
It ain't about how hard you hit.

1602
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,000
It's about how hard you can get hit,

1603
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,600
and keep movin' forward.

1604
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,800
How much you can take,
and keep movin' forward.

1605
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,400
Get up.

1606
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,700
Let's go, get up!

1607
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,500
Get up.

1608
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,400
Another monster body shot.

1609
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,700
Come on, Rocky! Shovel with his head.

1610
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,800
Just two minutes to go!

1611
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,100
The crowd is astonished
that Balboa got up!

1612
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,200
- Come on, Come on!
- Kill him, all the way through.

1613
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,500
...and retaliate with fury!

1614
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,300
Chop him down!

1615
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,700
Come on, Rocky, come on!

1616
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,000
Take him out now.

1617
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
They're trading shots again!

1618
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,900
Balboa's trying anything, in anywhere!

1619
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,700
Win it, win it!

1620
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,200
Yes!

1621
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,100
You're a great champion, you got heart!

1622
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,100
Thanks, man.

1623
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,900
Thanks for the opportunity, good man.

1624
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,500
That's unbelievable. That's the
greatest thing I've ever seen!

1625
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,400
You did it, baby. That's the
kind of pride I told you about.

1626
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:47,800
Hey, Paulie...

1627
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,300
The beast has gone now.

1628
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,500
The beast is out.

1629
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,500
One of the most overused words
in sports guys, is "incredible".

1630
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,900
I hate to say it.

1631
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,000
This is incredible!

1632
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,000
Let's go!

1633
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the score cards,

1634
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:14,000
a round of applause for these
two heavy-weight warrior!

1635
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,400
We have a split decision.

1636
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:30,200
Dominique Bird scores it, 95-94...

1637
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,500
...Dixon.

1638
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,400
Tom Chuck has it: 95-94...

1639
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,900
...Balboa.

1640
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,300
And Bill Grant, scores it 95-94...

1641
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,900
to the winner by split decision...

1642
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:59,500
and still undefeated, the
heavy-weight champion of the world...

1643
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,700
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1644
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,500
You know I couldn't have
done nothing without you.

1645
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:06,900
Yo, Adrian we did it.

1646
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,400
We did it!
