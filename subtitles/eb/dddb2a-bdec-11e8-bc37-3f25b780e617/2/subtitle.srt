1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,900
This time it's a martial arts film.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,700
The heroine is a bounty hunter.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,000
The villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,300
The worst of his kind.

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,700
What happened? His name's Gyeon-woo?

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,600
Gyeon-woo?

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,900
The story's setting is a mess.

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Japan invades during King Sejong's reign,

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,900
and the king's father is the tyrant Yeonsan.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,400
In the end,
the heroine fights the villain in a field.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Heavy rain pours down on a sunny day.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Yup~!

13
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,100
The heroine becomes a king. King Jung-jo.

14
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,600
She's from the future, of course.

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
It's fun, huh?

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Why is the heroine always from the future?

17
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,200
Science is advanced then,

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,000
so they invent a time machine.

19
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
And people go to the past to travel.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
People from the future could be here now.

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,000
I think UFOs are time machines.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Someday, I'll meet someone from the future.

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I have to.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,400
If you do, ask him to take you.

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,800
What?

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
If it's possible...

27
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,400
Give this to Shin Cine.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,000
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Excuse me, we talked on the phone, right?

31
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,400
Well... this is "The Warrior's Sad Love Story"...

32
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,400
It's going to be a hit.

33
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,700
Shin Cine didn't

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,400
call back.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,900
Hey!

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Hey, kid.

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Is the subway your sketch book?

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't scribble on it. Wanna die?

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,500
My lipstick!

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
I always take her home, even to Bupyung station.

41
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,900
It's something a man must do.

42
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,300
On the way, we play fun games, too.

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,700
Left foot over the line, I win.

44
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,500
With the right foot, you win.

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
What's the prize?

46
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,500
Let's see...

47
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
How about a kiss?

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
A kiss?

49
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Wanna die?

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,700
You choose.

51
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,800
Hitting each other.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,000
Again?

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
You can hit me, too.

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay.

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,100
Someone's coming.

56
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I think this is unfair.

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm a girl, so I'll slap the cheek.

58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
No. Then I'll change it, too.

59
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,400
- But I'm a girl.
- Men and women are equal.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Okay, then. You slap, and I slap, too.

61
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Go easy on me, and I'll kill you.

62
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,400
Better slap me on the cheek.

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
If you don't, I'll kill you!

64
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
All right.

65
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,800
You slap, and I'll use my finger.

66
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,100
Right, that's fair.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Saw that?

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,800
See that guy step over with his left foot?

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,600
I had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.

70
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,100
I thought it was this way.

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,000
Shut up. Here they come.

72
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,400
Left foot. Left foot.

73
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,000
It'll be the right foot.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,100
Left! Left! Switch to the right.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,300
You have to hit me?

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
You know why the sky is blue?

77
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,500
'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,100
Nope. It's for me!

79
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,200
I want it to be blue. So, it's blue.

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,900
You know why the fire is hot? It's all for me.

81
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,400
I want it to be hot. So it is.

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,500
You know why we have four seasons here in Korea.

83
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,600
- Because of you.
- That's correct!

84
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,000
And why you were born here?

85
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
- It's for me as well.
- What?

86
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,700
That's nonsense. I was born before you.

87
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
You know the word of "worship"?

88
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,200
"Peter came first in order
to prepare for the birth of Jesus." huh?

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
Well... Yeah, I know.

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
So, get ready!

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,700
Come here. Stay still.

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,900
When I'm with her,

93
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,800
I never know how the day will turn out.

94
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
What?

95
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,900
What are you looking at?

96
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,700
I quit!

97
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Is your face a racket?

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Why does the ball always hit my face?

99
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
It's strange.

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,100
I never want to lose a game.

101
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,000
So I play until I win.

102
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
Wait long?

103
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,900
Just a teeny bit.

104
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
My mom bought me these heels,

105
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,400
but they're killing my feet.

106
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Want a massage?

107
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
No, it's okay.

108
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,100
Instead, let's exchange shoes.

109
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
Don't wanna?

110
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,100
How can a guy wear heels?

111
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,900
It'll fit.

112
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
But, I can't...

113
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,900
Yeah? I see.

114
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,400
Come on. I'll buy you some sneakers.

115
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,900
Forget it.

116
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Then wear mine, and I'll carry yours.

117
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
You don't understand women.

118
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,600
Okay! Let's exchange.

119
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Really?

120
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Wanna know a secret?

121
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
What is it?

122
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,600
I don't wear panties on exam day.

123
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
But I had one today.

124
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,300
Catch me, honey!

125
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Hey. If you don't, I'll kill you.

126
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Catch me, honey!

127
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Stop right there!

128
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,100
Stop!

129
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Out!

130
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,600
It was just a second,
but I felt something in her eyes.

131
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
That's my house.

132
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Wait. I'll bring you an umbrella.

133
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm okay. I'm already wet so I'll just leave.

134
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,000
Eh?

135
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?

136
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,400
Yes, sir.

137
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
How much do you know about my daughter?

138
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Not much...

139
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,300
Next time, don't hang out till late.

140
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,200
You don't understand me.

141
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Why'd you stand him up?

142
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,900
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?

143
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,700
And what happened to your heels?

144
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
What's wrong with you?

145
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,600
I told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.

146
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,900
He's dumb and has no future.

147
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,600
It's none of your business.

148
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Why is he stupid?

149
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,500
You're stupid so you don't know.

150
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
What has gotten in to you?

151
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,400
Let me live my own life!

152
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,800
Afterwards,

153
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,100
I didn't hear from her for a long time.

154
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,000
- Hello?
- Gyeon-woo, it's me.

155
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,100
Long time no see.

156
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,800
Her voice sounds cheerful
as if nothing happened to her.

157
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,100
Our 100th day celebration is soon.

158
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
It's 100 days already?

159
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,800
When do you think a girl's the prettiest?

160
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,800
When a sexy woman is naked.

161
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,700
Where are you now? Stay right there.

162
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,500
No, I'm just kidding.

163
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,300
The prettiest is when she's playing the piano.

164
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
What's your favorite song?

165
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,500
That George Winston song.

166
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,100
Pachelbel Canon?

167
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, that song.

168
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
You're not gonna ask me?

169
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When is the guy the prettiest?

170
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,400
Just give me a rose.

171
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,600
Still have your high school uniform?

172
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah. Why?

173
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,900
Bring it on our 100th day,

174
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,600
and give me a rose during my class.

175
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,300
Do it yourself, okay?

176
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,200
What? What did you say?
How can I during class?

177
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,500
Hey! Just hung up on me! Damn it!

178
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't wanna get beaten by her,

179
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,300
or get humiliated at a women's college.

180
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
Oh my God!
A burglar!

181
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,100
Help, a burglar!

182
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,000
Eh? Are you crazy?
You're gonna break into where?

183
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,700
What on earth are you doing in broad daylight?

184
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,300
And you...

185
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,300
Why you didn't drop by an aunt's
coming and going Bupyung for the girl.

186
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,500
You never know how much hard time
I went through for you.

187
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,900
She even intends to introduce a girl to you.

188
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,900
Gyeon-woo!
Where are you going?

189
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
I'm cleverer than I look.

190
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,700
These girls sure love Chinese food.

191
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,500
Hey, you! Where you headed? Come here!

192
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm delivering Chinese food.

193
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
I ordered it. Bring it here.

194
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
Really?

195
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,800
Bring a lot of radish?

196
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
Oh, I forgot something!

197
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,900
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!

198
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
There's another customer.

199
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,700
Hey!

200
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,700
But that wasn't enough for her.

201
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,400
We relived our old high school days.

202
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,000
Drink!
Drink till die!

203
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,100
I've never had anything like this. Gee!

204
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Sorry, I'm gonna drink it in my way.

205
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
Feeling so good!

206
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Have a smoke, too!

207
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Wow, I've never had a smoke, either!

208
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Gonna be a big deal. I don't smoke well...

209
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,100
What are we supposed to do if caught by teacher.

210
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,500
It's a suspension!

211
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
You've already had your ups and downs in life.

212
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Not to worry.

213
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
Go ahead and smoke!

214
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey, you are such a tough cookie!

215
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,700
You go to a very good school!

216
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
These clothes are so tight!

217
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,300
After we visited that club,
a school uniform party was held every month.

218
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,100
But she got wasted again.

219
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,200
Oh, wild teens! Here's a condom.

220
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's prevent AIDS.

221
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,200
Taxi!

222
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
She's having a happy dream.

223
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,100
Compared to when I looked at her
in the motel the first time,

224
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
She looks so different.

225
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,800
Could her pain be cured now?

226
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Maybe it means that she doesn't need me anymore.

227
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Excuse me. Can you drive slowly?

228
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,700
Here.

229
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,100
Have any plans after graduation?

230
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,300
Actually, I've never thought about it yet.

231
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Can I see what's in your pocket?

232
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Sir? Right.

233
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,800
It's a condom.

234
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,600
What is this for?

235
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, right. I learned that it prevents AIDS.

236
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,900
But I haven't used it yet.

237
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,200
- Actually, on the way here.
- Forget it.

238
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,100
"Chicks Hen"? What does this mean?

239
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,800
Oh, right. It's a chicken soup restaurant.

240
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,300
"We'll satisfy all your wishes"?

241
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,300
I think it's to satisfy our tastes.

242
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
"Hurry and tell him."

243
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,700
How do feel about our daughter?

244
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,300
Oh, right. We're just friends now.

245
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Please don't worry.

246
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,900
If we get closer, I'll let you know, sir.

247
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,600
Don't see her any more.

248
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,400
After that day, she never calls me.

249
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,100
It was sudden, but that's how we broke up.

250
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,500
We've broken up. Now, I'm free.

251
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,000
It's me. Come to the cafe by seven o'clock.

252
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,800
Why?

253
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,100
What? I have a blind date today.

254
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Come in 45 minutes.

255
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,400
I have a blind date, too.

256
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,100
Are you on your way?

257
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm on a date with a girl.

258
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,400
Hurry up.

259
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,800
I have to go to the bathroom.

260
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,400
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'

261
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Eh?

262
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,900
Nice to meet you.

263
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm Cha Seok-won. Nice to meet you.

264
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,800
- Same here.
- Have a seat.

265
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,000
Were you really with a girl?

266
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,600
No, I was with a guy.

267
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,700
Can I take your order?

268
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,900
Coffee, please.

269
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
You can drink coke.

270
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,700
I'll drink coffee.

271
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,400
Gyeon-woo. You're very lucky.

272
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,300
I heard a lot about you. That you're a close friend.

273
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Friend...

274
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I need to go to the bathroom.

275
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,900
How is he?

276
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,900
No idea... but he looks nice.

277
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,000
He is not the man you broke up with, is he?

278
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
How do you know?

279
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,800
When you see a new man...

280
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,100
Forget about the past, all right?

281
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
How the hell do you know?

282
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,600
This necklace is given
from your ex-boyfriend, isn't it?

283
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,800
You wouldn't wear it
if you just broke up for nothing.

284
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,900
Considering your temper... and you...

285
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,800
used to say that you couldn't get over him.

286
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,800
Does that means he isn't here anymore in this world.

287
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,900
That man is the one my mom introduced to me.

288
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,700
She kept pushing me to meet him...

289
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,800
...Doesn't look bad, does he?

290
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,500
Yes.

291
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,100
Hey, listen!

292
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm totally ok, but you should be obedient to man.

293
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,500
Man likes something more feminine.

294
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,000
And... don't drink a lot.

295
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Some of the guys target intoxicated girls.

296
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:59,200
And it's all right with me, but to the other guys

297
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
try to surrender for just once.

298
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:09,300
...not try to win. Good luck to you.

299
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,000
Where's Gyeon-woo?

300
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,200
He left already.

301
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,900
He told me ten rules to follow.

302
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,600
I have a good memory. I'll recite them.

303
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,200
First, don't ask her to be feminine. And don't...

304
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Second, don't let her drink over three glasses.

305
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
She'll beat someone.

306
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,900
At a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.

307
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,900
If she hits you, act like it hurts.

308
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,700
If it hurts, act like it doesn't.

309
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,600
On your 100th day together,

310
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,300
give her a rose during her class.

311
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
She'll like it a lot.

312
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
Make sure you learn fencing and squash.

313
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,900
Also, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.

314
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
If she says she'll kill you,

315
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,700
don't take it lightly. You'll feel better.

316
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,600
If her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.

317
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,600
Finally, she likes to write.

318
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Encourage her.

319
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention...

320
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Gyeon-woo.

321
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Step back behind the yellow line...

322
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Gyeon-woo!

323
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,700
after passengers getting off, take in order...

324
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,200
Gyeon-woo!

325
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,200
please use the next train.

326
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,000
What's his name?

327
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,300
Gyeon-woo. I'll do it myself.

328
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Gyeon-woo. Where are you?
I looked all over for you.

329
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,400
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator. Okay?

330
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,500
You're dead if you don't. Hurry up.

331
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Who told you to hug me?

332
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,300
Dummy. You're supposed to dodge.

333
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,000
Sometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don't.

334
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,500
We're definitely standing at the crossroad now.

335
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,400
What's going on between us?

336
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,100
Can this relationship last forever?

337
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,500
Who is it?

338
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,800
It's me, Dad.

339
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,700
She told me to write a letter and bring it.

340
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,200
To write it on paper.

341
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,300
To express my feelings,

342
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,700
I tried hard to find the right words.

343
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,600
When I first met her,

344
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,700
I wanted to cure her grief,

345
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,900
but now I can't give her up.

346
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,400
I wish we can get serious.

347
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,300
I'm writing about these feelings.

348
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,300
She's probably writing about me now.

349
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,600
This is how we're preparing to split up.

350
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Gyeon-woo.

351
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,500
See that mountain top?

352
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,700
Yeah.

353
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,000
Could someone hear me from there?

354
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Yes, probably so. Or probably not.

355
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Then go over there. I'll shout here.

356
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,400
If you hear, answer me.

357
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,400
You want me to go over there?

358
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah.

359
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,900
Gyeon-woo?

360
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,500
Can you hear me?

361
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:08,100
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry. I really can't help it.

362
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:21,700
Gyeon-woo.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I can't help it.

363
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,300
I thought I was different, but I'm just a helpless girl.

364
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:46,200
Gyeon-woo!
I'm sorry.

365
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Did you bring your letter?

366
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,700
Yeah.

367
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,800
What's that?

368
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,200
A time capsule.

369
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,700
We put our letters in it and bury it here.

370
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,500
And two years later, let's meet here again.

371
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,400
We'll read the letters that day,

372
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,900
and maybe we can find an answer then.

373
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,900
This was her way of saying good-bye,

374
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,800
and I kept repeating in my mind
that two years isn't long.

375
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,800
Let's open this exactly two years later,
at two, Okay?

376
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,400
We can meet two years later.

377
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,400
When we meet then,
we'll be different from what we are now.

378
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,400
We may become closer,

379
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,000
or stay forever apart.

380
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,400
We can only choose one.

381
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,500
Gyeon-woo.
You go first.

382
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,800
Let's separate here.

383
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,600
Should we go together?

384
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,900
No, I'll take the next train.
I think that's better.

385
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,200
See you two years later!

386
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,700
Okay, in two years!

387
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,600
Two years!

388
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,400
Bye!

389
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,200
Gyeon-woo!

390
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,700
That's how we broke up.

391
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,300
Over time

392
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,100
I couldn't endure the loneliness after we broke up.

393
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,700
Thinking of those memories,

394
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,300
I started to write about our stories on the Internet.

395
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,700
Then I made up my mind.

396
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,700
If I meet her again, I'll show her a different me.

397
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,300
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.

398
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,700
Why does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?

399
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,500
I wrote our stories on the Internet everyday,

400
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,300
and I kept myself busy for two years.

401
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:39,000
Yu~p!

402
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:51,400
Excuse me. I wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.

403
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,400
Shin Cine saw my writing,

404
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,000
and offered to make a movie out of it.

405
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,000
I made her dream come true instead.

406
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,200
I wanted to tell her right away,

407
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,100
but I can only wait till that day.

408
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,700
She didn't come.

409
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,300
It's our only day to meet.

410
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,000
No one knows when she will come.

411
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,500
Wow!

412
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,000
How did he get in here?

413
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,900
It's a mystery.

414
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,600
Gyeon-woo!
How are you?

415
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,600
I was so happy while being with you.

416
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,700
I'm not sure if you knew,
but the person I loved passed away.

417
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,100
The day when I first met you

418
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,300
was the day he died a year ago.

419
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Actually, I tried to look for him in you.

420
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,400
I know it was wrong. I'm sorry.

421
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,300
I also met him on the subway like you.

422
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,100
I was really sick at that time.

423
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:47,700
He did everything I wanted.
Like you did to me.

424
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,500
Under this tree, we planned our future together.

425
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,200
But he suddenly passed away.

426
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,700
While I was dating you, I met his mother often.

427
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,800
She wanted to introduce a nice man to me,

428
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,100
but I couldn't.

429
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,500
The day I first met you, I came under this tree,

430
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,500
and I prayed to him.

431
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,100
To let me free.

432
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,700
When I met you, this occurred to me.

433
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,100
That maybe... he introduced you to me.

434
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,100
But the more I met you,

435
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,200
he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.

436
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:58,000
The more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.

437
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,500
While the two of us are apart,

438
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,500
I want to forget him alone.

439
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,800
After that day, I went often to this place.

440
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,500
If I'm not with you after two years,

441
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,700
it means I still lack of courage.

442
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,500
How much will we change after two years?

443
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,900
I feel like you live in the future,

444
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,600
and I stay in the past.

445
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,400
I want to meet you soon,

446
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,100
so I can read your letter.

447
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,800
Why are you staring at me, sir?

448
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:38,800
Because you're so pretty.
I thought an angel came down.

449
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,100
Do you come here often?

450
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,700
Sometimes. This tree has a secret.

451
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,900
I have a secret here, too.

452
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,700
Really?

453
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:05,000
Three years ago,
I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.

454
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,400
What's your secret?

455
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,800
So what happened?

456
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,100
We promised to read the letters a year ago.

457
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,600
But I couldn't come.

458
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,800
I guess you're a year late.

459
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,600
But two years didn't seem that long.

460
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,700
I haven't made any decision yet.

461
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,300
I just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.

462
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,600
Like what?

463
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,800
If we were destined to meet,

464
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,100
I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.

465
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,100
Know what fate is?

466
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,000
Building a bridge
of chance for someone you love.

467
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,800
To be honest, I read you guys letters.

468
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
I said this tree had a secret, right?

469
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,400
Yes.

470
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,200
Look closely. Does this tree look the same as before?

471
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,100
Well, it looks like it changed a bit. But I'm not sure.

472
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,200
People are dead or alive.

473
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,100
There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.

474
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,200
This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.

475
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,200
It was split into two.

476
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,600
But this young man felt sorry for it.

477
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
During this spring,

478
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:25,600
he planted another tree that looked the same.

479
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,700
When he planted the tree,

480
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,000
he asked me if it look the same.

481
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,700
He said that someone would be sad if it died,

482
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,800
so no one should know.

483
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,400
Gyeon-woo...

484
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,400
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.

485
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,700
Please, call again.

486
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,400
Hi.

487
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,900
It's been a while. You've gotten prettier.

488
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,500
You still look young. How have you been?

489
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,400
You were in England?

490
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,700
Yes. For one and a half years.

491
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,600
So I can forget him.

492
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,800
I see. Feel better?

493
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,200
Yes. A lot better.

494
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,200
Is it true now?

495
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,200
My son might be sad.

496
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,300
He won't. He'll like it this way.

497
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,800
Good, that's what I really hoped.

498
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,600
Auntie! I was getting my photo taken.

499
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,600
You naughty boy.

500
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,500
Know how long it's been?

501
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,200
Sorry I didn't tell you before.

502
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,800
This is Gyeon-woo. Doesn't he resemble him?

503
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,100
When you had a hard time,

504
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I tried to introduce you to him for several years,

505
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,100
but he kept getting out of it.

506
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,100
Heard you came to Bupyung often,

507
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,400
but you never visited me?

508
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,400
Go out with him.

509
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,600
I thought he'd make things easy for you.

510
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,200
Oh, yeah. Gyeon-woo,
you're going to England, right?

511
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,900
She's already been there,
so she can give you some tips.

512
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,900
I don't have to go now.

513
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,000
Why? You two know each other?

514
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,800
You may not believe it,
but I think I met a man from the future.

515
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,000
From your future.

516
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,500
This is how I met her again.

517
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,800
Think it's too coincidental?

518
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,500
It's building a bridge of chance for your love.
