MY SASSY GIRL

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Exactly two years ago today,

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,200
she and I buried a time capsule here.

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,800
We promised to meet here two years later,

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,500
but she hasn't come yet.

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm going to wait.

11
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,900
Here we go.

12
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Please don't move.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
One, two...

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Wait a minute.

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello? Oh, auntie.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Sorry, I'm on my way.

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm really sorry. Yes, I'm coming.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm having my photo taken. Bye.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,700
Are you ready?

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,900
Here we go.

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
One, two...

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
My parents wanted a daughter,

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,900
so they raised me like one.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,600
So I thought I was a girl until I was seven.

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,000
I had to go to the women's public bath, too.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
The older I got,

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,000
I thought my penis would get smaller and disappear.

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,800
But it was the opposite.

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,200
First Half

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
He hasn't changed at all.

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,100
No, I'm a real man now.

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,500
Hey, asshole.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,800
Think clerical work in the army makes you a man?

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,700
You irritate me!

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Give me a break, asshole.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,300
My job was tougher than you could imagine.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,900
Hey!
I worked near the DMZ.

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,400
Who are you kidding?

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Hold it. Anyway, welcome back home.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,200
She's just my type.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,000
When l see my type, I can't help it.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,700
I need to hit on her.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Who's interrupting me?

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,100
Hello? Who is this?

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
- Your mother, you bastard.
- Oh, mom...

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,400
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm leaving soon.

48
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,300
Keep quiet! It's my mom!

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,600
Talk over there!

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,900
Make sure you pay a visit.

51
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,800
It's been over a year since you saw her.

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,300
That long?

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,200
You know she feels lonely
after losing her son last year.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,600
She says you resemble him.

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,100
She'll be so glad to see you.

56
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Still there?

57
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,900
We don't look alike.

58
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,400
Plus,
I hate when she rubs my face and kisses me.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Uncle does, too.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,800
She'll introduce you to a girl. Hey!

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,600
I know the type she likes.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,900
Tell her no thanks.

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,700
I want to meet a girl
like the ones in romantic comic books.

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,400
But on that day...

65
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,100
She's my type, but I don't Iike her.

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,500
Why?

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,400
Drunk girls disgust me.

68
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Hey, get up!

69
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,400
Offer your seat to the elderly!

70
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,900
Ugh!

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,300
Go!

72
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,200
Hey.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
Don't wear pink.

74
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,400
Honey!

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She call him honey!

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm not...

77
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,700
What are you doing!

78
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,700
I'm not...

79
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,700
You handle this!

80
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm not...

81
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,500
Think I'm stupid?

82
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Come here!

83
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,800
Are you laughing?

84
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Why didn't you look after her?

85
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
Hurry and do something!

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,100
What are you doing?

87
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm sorry. Let me help with cleaning expenses.

88
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,200
Forget it. Just take care of her.

89
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,300
Nothing's there when you need it.

90
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where did all those motels go?

91
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,800
I hate being with a drunk girl.

92
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Carrying her on my back is worse.

93
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Wow, your honey's wasted.

94
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,300
No, it's not my fault.

95
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,600
Of course, it is. I know everything.

96
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,900
You see, we're engaged.

97
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,000
Western or Korean style?

98
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,900
Give me any room.

99
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
Room 405.

100
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,700
None on the first floor?

101
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Fourth floor!

102
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,100
You forgot to check in.

103
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
It's 40,000 won, kid.

104
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
What? 40,000 won?

105
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,100
Why? Find another place then.

106
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Count it.

107
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,200
624... 770

108
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,700
Shindang-dong, Joong-gu... Seoul...

109
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,500
Hey, why do you keep reading this?

110
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
016... 228... 53...

111
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,100
Oh, please...

112
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,600
A thousand won Ieft!

113
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,300
Hello?

114
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,500
This phone's owner?

115
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,700
She's sleeping beside me.

116
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,500
What? Here?

117
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.

118
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Better wash and leave fast.

119
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,100
Aha!

120
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Hands in the air!

121
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
What are you doing?

122
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,100
Hands in the air!

123
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Aaggh!

124
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
No, I'm not, sir!

125
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,900
I toId you. I'm an innocent victim.

126
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Talk about it later and get in there.

127
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,300
Oh, damn! l'm gonna die mad!

128
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
Come over here. Come on!

129
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Please forgive me just this once.

130
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
Please forgive me. I can't get in there...

131
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
How are you?

132
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
PIease, please save my life!

133
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
Hi? How are you?

134
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,200
Please just for once! Please...

135
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,700
See you!

136
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,500
What's your name?

137
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Answer now! Boss told you!

138
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Gyeon-woo, I'm Gyeon-woo.

139
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,400
What brought you here?

140
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm innocent.

141
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm telling the truth, sir!

142
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,600
So you're an innocent and we're fucking guilty, huh?

143
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,100
No, l don't mean that!

144
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,800
That's exactly what you said, Motherfucker!

145
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm gonna put it right. I'm sorry.

146
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,200
You raped a girl, huh?

147
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Nope! No!

148
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,600
Come on! Shoot now, you little creep!

149
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,100
You wanna cut your finger or talk now? Huh?

150
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,200
Be quick, He told you, you little bastard!

151
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,800
You turn against him, or what?

152
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,100
All of you.

153
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,500
Eat one a piece, okay?

154
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, boss.

155
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,900
What are you looking at? Look away.

156
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
Gyeon-woo! You're out!

157
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,300
Take care you guys!

158
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
Bye!

159
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
And remember to keep in touch!

160
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,600
Uh... Oh, yeah.

161
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
Don't just pass by us next time, all right?

162
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,500
Of course. See you.

163
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,500
Hey! You come over here.

164
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,800
Didn't I say eat one a piece!

165
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,100
I'm home.

166
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,300
Did you go to Bupyung?

167
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,100
Yes, I did.

168
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,200
Come here!

169
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
Where did you sleep?

170
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,300
Your aunt said you didn't come!

171
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,800
And you're telling me a lie!

172
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,900
What happened to your sweater?

173
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,500
l'm such a poor guy.

174
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,000
All this because of a drunk girl.

175
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,000
I wanna die.

176
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,300
You asked if I went to Bupyung!

177
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,500
I did, but not to see auntie!

178
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,300
What?

179
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Bastard! Wait till he comes back.

180
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Know me now, right? I'm a typical student.

181
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
An engineering major. Study?

182
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm smart, but I never study.

183
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,800
My parents can prove that.

184
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,700
You're smart like me, but studying is your problem.

185
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,000
Since you inherited your brain from me,

186
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,600
you'll get good grades if you study harder, idiot.

187
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,900
Up four points in three years.

188
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,300
Call this a report card?

189
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Since you inherited your brain from your mom,

190
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
you'll get good grades if you study harder.

191
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,700
If you raise kids, never tell them they're smart.

192
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,600
They'll never study.

193
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,500
My goals?

194
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,000
Haven't thought about it yet.

195
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,600
You know now?

196
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,200
You got it.

197
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm a hopeless student.

198
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Hello?

199
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Who are you, asshole?

200
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
What? Who's calling?

201
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,200
Why were you naked in a motel with me?

202
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,900
What?

203
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,800
Come out!

204
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,500
To Bupyung station now!

205
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,800
Uh...

206
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,100
How could she do this?

207
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,700
I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.

208
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Excuse me.

209
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Is it you?

210
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,200
Yes?

211
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,900
Follow me.

212
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,300
Get over here.

213
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,000
What do you wanna eat?

214
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Cherry jubilee...

215
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,700
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...

216
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Jamonka Almonds good, too.

217
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
I'll just have a Love Me.

218
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,500
Hey, wanna die?

219
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,100
Drink coffee.

220
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
Two coffees.

221
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,100
You pay for it.

222
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,300
Tell me.

223
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,800
What happened last night?

224
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,700
Well, it's...

225
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,300
You were drunk, so...

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,900
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!

227
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,900
You see.

228
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,500
You were drunk and staggering at the subway station.

229
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,900
I saved you from the train.

230
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I thought maybe this girl was a snake.

231
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Pretending to be drunk and vomiting

232
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,400
to use the guy in a state of confusion.

233
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,600
So I called you honey?

234
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
That's right.

235
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,000
I kind of remember that.

236
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,200
You showered to wash off vomit and sweat,

237
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,900
and the police came?

238
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
That's right.

239
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,800
Would you believe that, too?

240
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,000
To a girl like this,
you need to show her who's the boss.

241
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
So I did that, right?

242
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,400
Yes, you did.

243
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,400
- Sorry, it's late.
- Yeah...

244
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,900
When she's not drunk, she's just my type.

245
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,800
You look prettier and livelier than yesterday.

246
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
Are you mocking me?

247
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,500
No, I'm not.

248
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
Then are you hitting on me?

249
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,700
I don't wanna date you.

250
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
We're not destined for each other.

251
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Throw the trash away.

252
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Damn it.

253
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
I think she's a heavy drinker.

254
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,600
You order.

255
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.

256
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,200
Eat Golbangee.

257
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Then you should order.

258
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,700
Stop pouting!

259
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Golbangee, please.

260
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,900
Let's go somewhere fun later.

261
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,600
I know what that means.

262
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,500
- A motel? Are you rich?
- Of course.

263
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,800
How much will you give us?

264
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,700
We'll see, so don't worry.

265
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,400
You kids are prostituting, huh?

266
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Why'd you order Golbangee? Eat something else!

267
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,900
What's it to you? Mind your own business.

268
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,900
We're just having a drink with some friends.
What's wrong?

269
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,800
You take friends to a motel?

270
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,800
How old are you kids?

271
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Old enough to drink. Mind your own business.

272
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Think I'm doing this 'cause you're drinking?

273
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,900
Show me your ID. You, too.

274
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,300
What's with you?

275
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,100
Show it, now.

276
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,700
This sucks.

277
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,400
She's a vicious chick. No matter how pretty she is,

278
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm too embarrassed to be with her.

279
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,900
Who are you to butt in other people's business?

280
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,300
- Don't you have a daughter?
- I don't. Bear me one.

281
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Who the hell do you think you are?

282
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,000
- How dare you?
- Come on, let's fight!

283
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,900
Come on! I'll show you.

284
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
Don't live like that!

285
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,900
Catch up with the girls.

286
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,900
Have a drink and calm down.

287
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Shit!

288
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,000
Ah!

289
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Seeing a girl cry makes me sad for some reason.

290
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,000
She's more attractive the closer I look at her.

291
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,300
Did you blow your nose on this?

292
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,400
No.

293
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,600
Please stop crying.

294
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Also...

295
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,900
The handkerchief is mine.

296
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,700
To be honest,

297
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,500
I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday.

298
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,400
Excuse me.

299
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,800
Wake up.

300
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,700
Come on, wake up.

301
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,100
Your fiances wasted again?

302
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,600
What now?

303
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,900
Sign you in like before, right?

304
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes.

305
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,400
But mister, have any medicine for alcohol?

306
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,300
No, you buy it.

307
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,300
Where did you go, honey?

308
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,900
- What! What is it?
- Uh!

309
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,500
I saw her lips.

310
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
Her white neck.

311
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,300
And...

312
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I saw her breast, too.

313
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
While watching her sleep like a baby,

314
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,200
it may be forward, but this occurred to me.

315
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,900
I want to heal her sorrow.

316
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Give me some water.

317
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,700
Hey.

318
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,700
Why am I here?

319
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
You see.

320
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,600
I'm sorry,

321
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,700
but I saw your ID, and you're twenty-four.

322
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,900
If you talk down on me again...

323
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,400
So what are you gonna do? Just that...

324
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,700
Nothing.

325
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,800
Give me the towel.

326
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,900
Yes. You see, I'm a year older.

327
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,200
- Then talk like friends.
- Yeah?

328
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,100
Toothbrush.

329
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Toothpaste?

330
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,500
In the bathroom.

331
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,800
Our relationship is so peculiar.

332
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,700
We met only three days ago,
and slept twice in a motel.

333
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,800
That's how our relationship began.

334
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,800
Lee Hyung-chuI.

335
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,700
Here.

336
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Jeun Mi-young.

337
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Here.

338
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
Kang Man-gyu.

339
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,300
Yep.

340
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,700
Gyeon-woo.

341
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,800
Is he absent?

342
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,700
No, no!

343
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm here!

344
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Then answer right away.

345
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,100
Phew! Gonna be sucks!

346
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,900
Lee Jeung-min.

347
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
Here.

348
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,300
Gu SeoI-soo.

349
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
(In a dialect) Yes, I'm here.

350
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,400
Professor. How about a break?

351
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,600
You're right. Let's take a break.

352
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,100
Let's go.

353
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,700
Go where? Class isn't over yet.

354
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Don't be a coward. He called roll, right?

355
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,600
Let's go.

356
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,200
I can't. I can't miss this class.

357
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,300
Kill me instead.

358
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
All right.

359
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,400
Who is she? She's pretty.

360
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,100
Pretty? Doesn't matter.

361
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,300
A girl needs to act pretty.

362
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
- But she's still pretty.
- Nice body, too.

363
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,700
Who's Gyeon-woo?

364
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,400
It's me, sir.

365
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I won't mark you absent so you can leave.

366
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,500
Pardon me?

367
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,900
I said leave.

368
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,200
Why?

369
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,300
Wasn't that girl your girlfriend?

370
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,300
So go see her.

371
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,200
Thank you, sir.

372
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,100
Oh, Gyeon-woo.

373
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,600
If you can, raise it with her.

374
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,200
It worked.

375
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,600
What did you tell him?

376
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
That I'm getting an abortion, and you're the father.

377
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,400
What?

378
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
No, no! Professor, it's not true!

379
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,600
She wanted to be a scriptwriter,

380
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
so she kept writing stories.

381
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
She called them synopsis.

382
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,500
To get me into the mood,
she took me to the park to read them.

383
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,000
Reading her synopsis was stressful.

384
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,800
If I miss anything, I'm dead.

385
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,600
Wanna die? Finish reading it.

386
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,200
I will.

387
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,400
Mister! How could you throw the butt here?

388
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,600
Pick it up!

389
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
And why did you wear that color?

390
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,700
Then what about you?

391
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,500
Don't wear the same color as mine!

392
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,500
The heroine is tough, like the 'Terminator'.

393
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,700
The year is 2137.

394
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Villains kidnap her lover and travels to the present.

395
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
I don't know why.

396
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,700
To save her lover,

397
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,200
she travels in a time machine to the present.

398
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
They have to kiss in the end.

399
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,500
This isn't a melodrama. It's an action movie.

400
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
You don't know movies.

401
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,900
Koreans like melodramas.

402
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,100
Why?

403
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,600
Know what novel touched us when we were teenagers?

404
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,100
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.

405
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,100
It shaped our people's sensibility in their teens.

406
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Koreans like sad movies all because of 'Shower'.

407
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,800
Shower? What's sad about it?

408
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
It's sad when she asked

409
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,700
to be buried in the clothes reminiscent of her love.

410
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,200
I couldn't sleep for one week.

411
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,300
The ending sucks.

412
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Gotta change it.

413
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,900
How?

414
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,300
It's sad.
Her family couldn't afford to pay for her medicine.

415
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,800
Their family line is broken up now.

416
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,500
But you know,
she must have been an extraordinary girl.

417
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,900
Why?

418
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,400
This was her last request:

419
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,600
"When I die, please bury me with my loving friend."

420
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,900
What?

421
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,500
To bury him alive, even.

422
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,500
Oh, my gosh.

423
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,700
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?

424
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,500
No way!

425
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,300
This is wrong! This is wrong!

426
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,400
This is wrong!

427
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,400
Please. Don't!

428
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,100
Bury him!

429
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,200
They bury him alive. Isn't it sad?

430
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,300
I must be hurt still.

431
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I think I'll never get over him.

432
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,400
How deep could it be?

433
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,900
I don't know.

434
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,100
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.

435
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,400
I wanna know how deep it is.

436
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,100
Come on.

437
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,200
Help me! Help me!

438
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,300
Wow, it's deep.

439
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,200
I can't swim!

440
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,200
Yes, it's deep...

441
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,800
My mind was getting blurry.

442
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,000
At that moment...

443
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,500
Heard you got a girlfriend.

444
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,600
Introduce me.

445
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
- Really?
- I'm serious.

446
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,600
Is she pretty?

447
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,700
Have you kissed her?

448
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Girlfriend?

449
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,900
Gonna introduce me or not?

450
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,500
She really pretty?

451
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,700
What are you looking at?

452
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,700
See that girl over there?

453
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,200
She's my girlfriend from today. Got it?

454
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,500
Hey...

455
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,900
Excuse me...

456
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,500
Hey, baby.

457
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,200
- Are you free?
- Hey?

458
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,700
What?

459
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,400
Baby?

460
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,800
Hey! Come here.

461
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,800
Hmm!

462
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,400
How could a coincidence like this happen?

463
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,100
"Reportedly say
there is an accident of runaway soldier..."

464
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,500
Hello?

465
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,700
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.

466
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,300
Please, call again.

467
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,400
You call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.

468
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,000
Please, call again.

469
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Let's drink. Drink till we die.

470
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,100
- 1 HOUR AGO -
It's me. Where are you?

471
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,400
What are you doing? Meeting your friends?

472
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,500
Can't I join us, can I?

473
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,300
Why not? I wanna see your friends!

474
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,500
Hey! Hey! Now, you're dead.

475
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,000
Excuse me...

476
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,300
You've just forgotten your things.

477
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,200
Oh my gosh! It's kind of you, thanks.

478
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,500
Do you want me to hold it for you?

479
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,300
- Oh no. That's all right.
- All right then.

480
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,600
I'll help you, ma'am.

481
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,800
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

482
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,700
Watch your step!

483
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,500
Hey, money!

484
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,800
Ooh! Damn it!

485
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,900
Since I'm drunk,

486
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:13,600
I decided to take revenge on her.

487
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,900
If I'm out cold at Bupyung station,

488
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,800
then she'll have to carry me on her back.

489
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,300
This stop is Bupyung station...

490
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Hey, kid. Wake up. Wake up.

491
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,900
Where am I?

492
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,100
I'm at Inchon station. Be here in 30 minutes.

493
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,000
Wake up. Get up, idiot.

494
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,300
Go away, buttbrain.

495
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,000
Talking back?

496
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,900
- Get up, bastard!
- What the...

497
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,500
How're you?

498
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,800
Hi!

499
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,600
How are you?

500
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,000
Oh, how is it going?

501
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,400
What?
"Go away, buttbrain"?

502
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
You got a bad mouth.

503
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,900
I'll set you straight the gangster's way.

504
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,300
On your head.

505
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
Get up.

506
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,900
Sit down. Get up. Sit down. Roll right. Roll left.

507
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,700
Do it right. Keep going!

508
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,500
What's going on there? Stop fooling around.

509
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,800
Hey! You low-life thieves.

510
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,600
- What officer?
- Keep quiet.

511
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,300
Low-life thieves?

512
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,600
Damn it.

513
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,000
- Hey. Want some of this?
- No thanks.

514
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,700
Try it. It's delicious.

515
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,900
- No.
- Hey, boy.

516
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Pay attention to your elders.

517
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,700
Eat it, buttbrain.

518
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,800
I told you no. How many times did I tell you?

519
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,000
Am I your toy? Leave me alone you petty thieves!

520
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,100
Stop toying with me, you jerks! It's humiliating!

521
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,300
Oh, shit!

522
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,100
Good morning.

523
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,200
- Keep quiet!
- Thank you. Thank you.

524
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,300
You bastard!

525
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,600
Do that again, and you're dead.

526
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,900
What?
"Are you free, baby?"

527
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,000
Your English is good, too.

528
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,500
Better behave!

529
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,600
Wanna die?

530
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,600
Taste good?

531
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,700
It's so delicious.

532
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,800
You're very happy to see me, aren't you?

533
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,100
Be good to me...

534
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,500
and you'll always be with good luck.

535
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,300
If I sleep out,
mom beats me with whatever's in her hand.

536
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,800
If she's sweeping, it's a broom stick

537
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
If she's cleaning, it's a vacuum.

538
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,000
When I'm lucky, it's a cucumber or eggplant.

539
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,500
So I have to come at the right time.

540
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,900
You studying now?

541
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,700
Yes, I'm.
I'm looking over something on the internet.

542
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,500
- Go to bed now.
- You too, dad.

543
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,300
- All right, good night!
- Good night.

544
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,700
Ok then, I'm gonna have a sleep too.

545
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,800
You're not looking at dirty pictures, right?

546
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,100
Of course not, dad. You don't trust me?

547
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,600
No, I do. Time for bed.

548
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,500
- Go to sleep.
- Good night, dad.

549
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,300
Uh?

550
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,000
Hi, Gyeon-woo. My birthday's in two days.

551
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,700
You're dead if you forget. Got it?

552
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,400
Since I like you so much, better make me smile like this.
* *
¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬¦¬

553
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,700
Got it?

554
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
I got it.

555
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,000
Phew!

556
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,500
Her birthday.

557
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,000
If I prepare nothing, she may murder me.

558
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,400
I have a good idea.

559
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,100
Before going to the service, I worked in a theme park.

560
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,200
So this is my plan.

561
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,900
At midnight, I'll be alone with her in the park.

562
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,200
It'll be completely dark all around us.

563
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,500
One by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.

564
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,900
I raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.

565
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,300
Then all the lights turn on and it moves.

566
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,000
There's fireworks, too. Isn't it fantastic?

567
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,300
She'll be thrilled.

568
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
I gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.

569
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,500
- Jump over here?
- Yeah. We have to.

570
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,100
I always wanted to come here at night.

571
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,800
It's my birthday, not yours.

572
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,800
Please, let's just try.

573
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,600
I'll go up first and help you.

574
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,100
Eh? There's a step here.

575
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,700
Take my hand.

576
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,000
Oh, shit!

577
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,600
Shit!

578
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Gyeon-woo.

579
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,000
Hey!

580
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,000
Answer me. I'm Ieaving. I'm leaving.

581
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Answer me! Gyeon-woo! You're dead.

582
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,100
Wait till I catch you.

583
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:33,200
Why didn't you answer?

584
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,400
Wanna die?

585
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,400
Come with me!

586
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,700
Hurry and get in.

587
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,400
Shut up!

588
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,100
Go in fast. Move it. Sit here.

589
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,300
If you're loud, I'll kill you. Got it?

590
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,200
Yes.

591
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,200
- Answer quietly!
- Yes.

592
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,400
Is that a real gun?

593
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,800
- Wanna see?
- Forget it.

594
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,300
How are you two related?

595
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,400
We're just friends.

596
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Really?
You mean she could be my pussy?

597
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,700
What?
Your pussy?

598
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm not a cat or anything! Go ahead and apolize!

599
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,500
Alright. I'll do it. I'm sorry.

600
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,900
Anyway, friends come here late at night?

601
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,800
Why are you here?

602
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,600
We just wanted to come here at night.

603
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,600
- Tell me the truth, idiot.
- Nothing special.

604
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,700
Bullshit.

605
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,800
What makes you trust a guy like him?

606
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,000
I trusted myself.

607
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,100
I had a girlfriend, too.

608
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,300
She visited me every week for one year.

609
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,700
I was so happy.

610
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:28,700
But that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.

611
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,400
I found out the fact after he was discharged.

612
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,700
Damn it.

613
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:45,300
While I'm in the service,

614
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,400
even my dog ran away with some mutt, too.

615
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,600
My Yorkshire terrier.Bitch.

616
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:04,200
Fuck. I came out to kill both bitches. Fuck.

617
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,200
I have the worst luck in this world.

618
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,900
Damn it.

619
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,300
Know what special day is it today?

620
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,900
Huh, damn it? This sucks!

621
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,400
Hey, what are the odds
to meet a runaway soldier in a park?

622
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,500
Don't know.

623
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,100
Heard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.

624
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah, the hole in your head is this big.

625
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,200
That's serious. A teeny bullet does that?

626
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,400
Yeah, the bullet tears the...

627
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,300
Hey! What are you two doing?

628
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,200
Stop joking around.

629
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,500
Damn it. Damn it!

630
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,100
Even you bastards ignore me.

631
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:19,300
- That's why don't be foolish.
- Why am I foolish?

632
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,600
Even if you do this, she won't come back.

633
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,700
I know. l know, too.

634
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,500
But if I die, she'll be heartbroken.

635
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,000
She'll never be the same.

636
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,600
You're wrong.

637
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,600
The pain goes away sooner than you think.

638
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,800
You went through something like this?

639
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:55,300
Yeah. It happens that way.

640
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,200
Damn it. If I'm caught, I'll go to the can.

641
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,500
I'll always think of her there.

642
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,200
What does 'can' mean?

643
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,200
It means prison.

644
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,800
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

645
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,000
Anyway,
you're responsible for your actions now.

646
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,100
Excuse me, sir.

647
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,100
How about letting her go?

648
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,100
If I say no?

649
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,600
Then...

650
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,500
...let me go, instead.

651
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,700
Come to think of it,

652
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,300
your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.

653
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,500
You act like him, too.

654
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,100
You can go.

655
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,600
And you...

656
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,300
We die together. Got it?

657
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,900
Pardon?

658
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:01,300
Hey, lady. Forget about this bastard,
and look for a nice guy. Got it?

659
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,300
- Go!
- Let's go together.

660
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,200
All three of us.

661
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,100
Will you leave if I kill him?

662
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,300
Gyeon-woo. Don't worry too much.

663
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,200
This soldier isn't a bad guy.

664
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,200
You'll come out safely.

665
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,300
You're leaving me alone?

666
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,600
There's no other way.

667
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,900
I was afraid to die alone,
but I'm glad we're in it together.

668
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,200
Oh, right.

669
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,900
Over there,

670
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:07,400
there's an exit near the merry-go-round.

671
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,900
Nobody knows about it.

672
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,300
I used to work here.

673
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,400
Really?

674
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,100
You're not tricking me, right?

675
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,300
I'm a man, too. Why would I?

676
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,200
Walk in front of me.

677
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,300
See?
I told you so.

678
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,900
This way!

679
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,200
Shit!

680
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,300
What's going on? It's Gyeon-woo.

681
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,300
Screw you! Don't come closer!

682
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,900
I'll kill him! I'll really kill him!

683
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,300
Tell that bitch to come! So she can see me die!

684
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,500
I'll give you an hour!

685
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,200
If not, I'll kill him, and myself, too!

686
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,600
- Got it?
- Hurry up!

687
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,500
Sniper 2!

688
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,800
The hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.

689
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,000
Don't! Wait! Don't shoot!

690
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,000
Hey, soldier! I mean sir!

691
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,000
Your girlfriend changed her mind, right?

692
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,800
Did you really love her?

693
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,600
Ask yourself.

694
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,300
I think you didn't.

695
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,800
If you really love her,

696
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
you should let her go.

697
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,100
If not, then it's not love.

698
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,700
What's wrong with someone
you don't love getting married?

699
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,700
Stop this,

700
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,400
and go back to base as a real man.

701
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,600
A person like you should learn more about love.

702
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,500
If we want to learn,

703
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,000
then we should keep living.

704
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,000
Damn it.

705
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,000
She's the nicest girl I've met.

706
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,900
Hey! Don't Iet her go. Got it?

707
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,600
If you do, I'll take her.

708
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,000
- Can I go?
- Go. Screw it.

709
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Shit! Don't know.

710
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,100
Thank you. Today's my birthday.

711
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,200
I'll live on until I learn what love is.

712
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,200
What?
"We're just friends"?

713
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:03,300
No, I said that to save you.

714
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,100
"Let me go, instead"?

715
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,900
Wanted to save yourself, huh?

716
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,000
He wouldn't have let you go.

717
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Stop lying! Stop lying! Stop lying!

718
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,800
Have a nice life alone.

719
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,500
I screwed up her birthday,
but I feel good anyway.

720
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,400
'Cause I'm proud to be with her,

721
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,800
and things turned out as planned.

722
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,300
I hope you beIieve in me.

723
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,800
You can't?

724
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,400
Wait...

725
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,200
Second Half

726
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,100
I remember.

727
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,700
She always came with him until last year.

728
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:24,500
Was it last spring or winter?

729
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,500
One day,
she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.

730
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:37,600
To not let anyone sit in his seat that day.

731
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,100
What's up?

732
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,300
Oh, hi.

733
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,300
You're early.

734
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,700
I was in the neighborhood.

735
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,500
Miss me?

736
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,000
Of course!

737
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,100
She always tried hard to look cheery.

738
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,100
I like her that way.
- What would you like?

739
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,300
Coke, please.

740
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,500
Wanna die? Drink coffee.

741
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,300
Two coffees, please.

742
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,500
He he he

743
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,400
I know her.

744
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
She pretends to be happy,

745
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,700
but she's full of sorrow inside.

746
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,400
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?

747
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
No. It's nothing.

748
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,000
Looks fun, huh?

749
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,600
- Another one?
- Why? Don't wanna read it?

750
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
She may get disappointed,

751
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,400
but I should be honest for her sake.

752
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,100
Looks fun. I'll read it.
