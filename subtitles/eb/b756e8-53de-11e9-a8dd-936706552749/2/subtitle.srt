1
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:04,810
Keep guard here!

2
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,277
That way

3
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,165
Run up to the back of the hill
and don't turn back.

4
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,736
Don't stop or I will shoot!
Run for it!

5
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:43,679
Who told you to come in?

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,220
We are helping the General
to catch the prisoner.

7
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,888
Damn it!

8
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:49,957
The prisoner has run away
to the back of the hill.

9
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:54,128
Mount the horses and chase!

10
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:01,801
Run!

11
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:24,276
I've heard King Li Shih-Min
went to visit

12
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,785
enemy's place by himself.
Is that you?

13
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,157
Thank you, Madam.

14
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,587
You've not taken food for two days.
Eat the food!

15
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,565
As you are a monk,
can you take meat?

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,536
With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing.

17
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:52,236
Monks always have Buddha
in their hearts.

18
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:53,540
Take it!

19
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,981
Your life as a monk is too simple
and poor.

20
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,649
Right.

21
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,922
Wang Jen-Tse's soldiers
have searched everywhere.

22
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,758
You better stay here for a few
more days.

23
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,264
- I will send you food.
- Okay.

24
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:14,335
Thank you, Madam. I've a job to do

25
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,770
must cross the river at once.
Do you know if there is a shortcut?

26
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,303
Well, we can escort you
to cross the river.

27
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,471
There are many check points.
How can you pass them?

28
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,128
Put down your hand at once!

29
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,846
You're born to be a couple.
It's a pity you're monk.

30
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,177
Dont' be shy.

31
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,616
- What now?
- Let's go!

32
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:40,854
You've got a lot of romance, Kid!

33
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,326
It's a pity you are a monk.

34
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,165
Sir, it's late now.

35
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:55,667
The bridegroom and
bride must return to their room.

36
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,103
Will you please let them go.

37
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,104
Damn it! Stop pretending.

38
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,544
How can we fool you?

39
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,081
Don't play that!

40
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,119
I'll buy you a drink.
Will you give me a favor?

41
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,687
Alright, you may go!

42
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,555
Thank you, Sir.

43
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,930
Don't be too cautious, brother!

44
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,163
Let's go and have a drink!

45
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,849
Is it hurt?

46
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,358
No.

47
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,125
Tear it off quickly.

48
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,204
Oh! It's bleeding!

49
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,245
What are you laughing for?

50
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:21,252
You really look like a sweet little wife.

51
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:36,795
Thanks for saving my life.
I'll repay your kindness.

52
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:48,815
- Li Shih-Min, you can't get away.
- Shoot.

53
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,057
Stop it! The general wants him alive.

54
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,220
We'll get promotion
and fortune this time.

55
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,592
Capture him alive!

56
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,265
Will you take him cross the river?

57
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,765
- How about yourself?
- Hurry.

58
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,968
They are running!

59
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,485
Shoot!

60
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,272
Master!

61
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,879
Master!

62
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,485
Bald-heads,
don't you want to betray us?

63
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,123
I guess they don't have guts
to do that.

64
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,554
Buddhists do not kill. Let's move!

65
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,025
Master, what shall we do now?

66
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:12,428
We need to defend ourselves.
Buddha will not give mercy to devils.

67
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:13,660
I understand.

68
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,619
Chueh Yuan, kill him!

69
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,422
Don't you dare to kill?

70
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,496
Buddhist and thief
won't live together. I'll kill you!

71
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:12,846
Chueh Yuan, kill.

72
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,752
Chueh Yuan, kill him!

73
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,083
Amida Buddha! My holy Buddha,
please forgive us.

74
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,781
Chueh Yuan is only taking them

75
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,821
to the heaven.

76
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,356
Buddha will forgive us.

77
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:57,891
Yes!

78
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:02,019
Chueh Yuan is doing it
you goodness sake.

79
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:06,957
Master.
I know I have committed sin again.

80
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:12,099
But, they would have killed me
if I didn't do it.

81
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,501
Yes, he is right.

82
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,011
Your mind can never he purified
and stay with Buddha.

83
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,105
You are leaving Buddha from now on.

84
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,510
Master!

85
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,112
Go far away from us!

86
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,993
Master! Wang Jen-Tse is still
waiting in Temple for him.

87
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:37,791
You can't be responsible
for letting him go.

88
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,365
Let's go back.

89
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,010
Why don't you mount the horses?

90
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,883
Master,
the buddhists are always merciful.

91
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:00,044
I know I'm wrong.
Please give me another chance.

92
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:05,416
Go away!
Don't come back to Shao Lin Temple!

93
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,100
Master!

94
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,873
Master...

95
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,314
Master!

96
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,615
Master!

97
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,993
Stop him!
Don't let him come into the Temple!

98
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,192
Master!

99
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:55,870
Hurry and go.

100
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,603
Master!

101
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:03,943
Wang Jen-Tse is waiting to catch you,
run quickly!

102
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,019
I don't want master and brothers
to be blamed.

103
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,348
Please let me in!

104
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,047
Master!

105
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,325
- Master!
- Tie him up and take him down hill!

106
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:48,357
Master, you have saved my life.

107
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,020
And abbot has helped me
in reincarnation.

108
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,665
I can't cause disaster
to Shao Lin because of me.

109
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:57,602
Let me have the suffering. Master!

110
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,476
Sorry for not seeing you off.

111
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,377
The monk has gone
but the temple still remains.

112
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,211
If you don't hand over the monk
and Li in three days,

113
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,012
I'll destroy Shao Lin Temple.

114
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,801
It's really a big trouble.

115
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,628
I've said he would get Shao Lin
into trouble.

116
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,305
We should have not let him stay.

117
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,171
Amida Buddha.

118
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:40,872
Buddhists are all merciful,

119
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:46,180
As Chueh Yuan is my disciple,
we must help him.

120
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:51,952
Being a Buddhist for years,
how can you say this?

121
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,721
You are wrong!

122
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:58,293
I'm sorry.

123
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,001
General!

124
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,266
General!

125
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,246
Have you found Li Shih-Min
and the monk?

126
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:14,509
I've found them.

127
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:16,482
Where are they?

128
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,779
The Shao Lin monks have helped Li
to escape.

129
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:24,119
Chueh Yuan has killed
all our soldiers.

130
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:29,222
Traitors!
Let's march into Shao Lin Temple!

131
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,310
There'll be a disaster
in Shao Lin Temple.

132
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,649
- Master, let's fight with them!
- Yeah, fight with them...

133
00:16:57,526 --> 00:17:00,825
We are trained in kung-fu.
We must protect Shao Lin.

134
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,530
Master, please let me go out.

135
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,931
I'll be responsible for everything.

136
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,768
To take the responsibility alone
be yourself?

137
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,998
How can you fight against
Wang's army by yourself?

138
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,296
I...

139
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,769
You are too eager to take revenge.

140
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,875
You better unfrock
and join Li Shih-Min.

141
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:23,481
Master,
I have not repaid your kindness.

142
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,118
I'm a buddhist monk
and have nothing to worry.

143
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:32,858
Only my daughter worries me.

144
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,455
Father!

145
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,730
If you can
take care of her in future.

146
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:43,369
- I'll have no more to worry.
- Father!

147
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:45,603
Master!

148
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:49,769
You go with him.

149
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:53,310
No matter what happens to us,
protect him and don't come back.

150
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,238
You may go!

151
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,849
- Father!
- Master...

152
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:42,222
Abbot! It's no good!

153
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,625
Wang Jen-Tse's army has passed
the Shao Shih Shan.

154
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,630
They'll reach our main entrance
very soon.

155
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:53,029
If we don't worry anything,
nothing will worry us.

156
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,907
Then we'll have a sound mind.
Why are you still so afraid?

157
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,337
Buddha bless us!

158
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:03,812
Tell the monks not to start any move.

159
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,282
Yes!

160
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:11,223
Let's lay siege to Shao Lin.
Bowmen to a ambush in hide-out!

161
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,121
Don't let any monk to escape.

162
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,601
Kill...

163
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:25,705
Kill...

164
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,508
Amida Buddha!

165
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:39,083
Abbot...

166
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,888
Why do you want to

167
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,493
attack our temple, General?

168
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:52,589
Because Shao Lin monks conspire
with Li Shih-Min.

169
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,792
There is evidence
to prove the treason.

170
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:57,632
I'm ordered to punish the monks

171
00:19:57,806 --> 00:19:59,706
and burn the temple.

172
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:01,104
Burn it down!

173
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:07,748
Hold it, General! I have a request.

174
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,043
Say it!

175
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,912
This is a historical land.

176
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,521
If there's a crime,
it should not involve the temple.

177
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:19,021
And the punishment shouldn't extend
to the monks.

178
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,822
As a temple abbot,
I'll take all responsibilities.

179
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,426
Alright, I'll kill you first.

180
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,400
Light up the fire!

181
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:46,213
Abbot!

182
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,285
If anyone tells me the whereabouts
of the traitors,

183
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:54,485
I'll keep your temple in peace
and abbot alive.

184
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:07,268
Abbot!

185
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,809
Abbot! Amida Buddha.

186
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,178
Kill him!

187
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:23,516
Oh, you!

188
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,717
If none of you speaks,
I'll kill you all.

189
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,260
Abbot!

190
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,494
No killing!

191
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,932
Abbot,
kindness results nothing to evil.

192
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:37,401
Kill the devils and enter Buddha.

193
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:42,170
Let's release their souls
and bring them to death.

194
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,511
Abbot!

195
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:16,476
Brother
Pan K'ung!

196
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,346
Master, you start killing now!

197
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:00,346
Let's kill them. They deserve it.

198
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:48,920
Shoot the arrows!

199
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,980
General...
Shoot the arrows!

200
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,612
Master!

201
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:29,560
- Master!
- Father!

202
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,168
Shoot the arrows!

203
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,304
Let's charge into the temple
and burn it down!

204
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:50,047
- Master!
- Father!

205
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:59,551
Li Shih-Min has crossed the river
with his army.

206
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,193
They are heading for Tung Tu.

207
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:08,730
You must defend Shao Lin

208
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:12,999
and uphold the justice.

209
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:21,181
- Master!
- Father!

210
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,650
Let's kill them!

211
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,251
General!

212
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:39,456
It's a bad news. Li Shih-Min
and his army have crossed

213
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
- the river heading for Tung Tu.
- What?

214
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,372
Kill them!

215
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:30,813
Kill them!

216
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:57,796
Kill!

217
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,558
Chueh Yuan, watch out for the sword!

218
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:04,763
Thou shall not kill. Can you do that?

219
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:10,702
I'll stop killing but not stop
to uphold justice.

220
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:25,456
Secondly, thou shall not steal.
Can you do that?

221
00:36:25,592 --> 00:36:26,991
I've determined to enter Buddha,

222
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:36,598
Thirdly, thou shall not covet,
can you do that?

223
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:55,817
Master, I've determined to enter Buddha,

224
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,557
to defend Shao Lin
and uphold the justice.

225
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:37,260
Thou shall not covet,
Can you do that?

226
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,456
Yes.

227
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:50,674
Fifthly, thou shall not drink.
Can you do that?

228
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:58,675
I suggest this vow should be exempted.

229
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:01,448
Your majesty!

230
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:07,685
Since your majesty has given an order,

231
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:13,628
this vow of drink
shall be exempted forever.

232
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,117
To show appreciation,

233
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:15,122
King Li of T'ang Dynasty awarded

234
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:18,594
the Shao Lin monks

235
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,460
many fortunes.

236
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:23,595
The monks only accepted

237
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,795
a gown for each,

238
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,439
a tea set, and forty acres of land.

239
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:31,971
The King permitted Shao Lin

240
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:35,876
to form a defence force.

241
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:38,449
Such legend was recorded
on a temple stone

242
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,316
with the royal signature
of King Li Shih-Min.

243
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:52,856
The martial art of Shao Lin began
to prevail.

244
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:58,930
The fame of Shao Lin kung-fu was
everlasting.
