1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,913
Shao Lin, Shao Lin.

2
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:30,457
How many heroes adore you.

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,394
Shao Lin, Shao Lin.

4
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,931
How many wonderful stories
mentioned you.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,541
Your martial art is the only one
in the world.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,703
The Shao Lin Temple is famous
everywhere.

7
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,339
Its history last forever.

8
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,453
The Shao Lin Temple is splendid.

9
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,247
The thousand years' old temple,

10
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,259
the mystic place,

11
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,058
the valley of Song Shan,

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,725
every people dreams of,

13
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,906
the original place of martial art,

14
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,805
the charming place,

15
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,640
is well-known in everywhere,

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,613
and will be praised forever.

17
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:36,286
Shao Lin, Shao Lin, Shao Lin...

18
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,241
You good boys.

19
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,511
Ya Chu Lai has suffered for you,

20
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:03,588
and you have been purified.

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,184
Now I tell you the facts of ten laws,

22
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:13,129
to advise you respecting yourself,

23
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,200
and others.

24
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,430
Chueh-Yuan.

25
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,236
Firstly, thou shall not kill.

26
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,941
Can't you do that?

27
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:37,648
Thou shall not kill,
can't you do that?

28
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:45,096
Thou shall not kill,
can't you do that?

29
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,941
Who is lazy, who shall be killed.

30
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,337
Wars happened during the end
of Sui Dynasty.

31
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,212
Heroes fought for empire
and divided the land.

32
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,352
The traitor Wang Shi Chuang

33
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,685
settled at Tung Tu.

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,555
Named himself King Cheng,
and ruled cruelly.

35
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,063
Li Shi Min and his army

36
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,061
are already near Hwangho.

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,564
How can be defend
with these weak men?

38
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,796
General,
we really can't get strong men.

39
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,372
We even have to use
the dying prisoners.

40
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,938
Take all prisoners
and Mighty Leg Chang to me.

41
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,100
Yes.

42
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,185
Hurry! Hurry!

43
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,695
Get out.

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,571
You are called Mighty Leg Chang.

45
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,400
I'll make your legs broken.

46
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,060
Father.

47
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,306
Father.

48
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,037
Be careful.

49
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:25,175
- Hsiao Hu, run away.
- Dad...

50
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,502
Ready,

51
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,174
Who is it?

52
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,481
Amida Buddha.

53
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,387
Abbot, more and more people
are starving, soon,

54
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,190
our property,

55
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,231
Can't afford to feed the people.

56
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:27,467
To help them
is our Buddhist's business.

57
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,765
Amida Buddha!

58
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,912
From now on,
tell those people to leave.

59
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,175
No one can stay here.

60
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,874
Abbot. This boy is seriously hurt
and fainted.

61
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,214
Will you keep him stay?

62
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,480
No.

63
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,156
That will bring us great trouble.

64
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,193
Jen Jih,
save one's life is important,

65
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,727
Talk no more.

66
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,331
Abbot.
His identity is unknown,

67
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,969
I'm afraid he may bring us trouble...

68
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:04,471
Since Wang Jen-Tse settled,
he killed innocent,

69
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,047
that made people angered.

70
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,777
Abbot, Buddhist should be kind,

71
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,080
you let him stay.
Abbot...

72
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,952
Saved him first.

73
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,524
Buddha bless him.

74
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,799
You are bringing yourself

75
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,099
into trouble.

76
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,732
Master,
we can't put water into him mouth.

77
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,102
He is too weak.

78
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:44,206
We don't have rich food,
may be we can't save him.

79
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,578
How can we be like this,

80
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,319
what shall we do?

81
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:28,056
"Go as wind, stand ad pine,
sit as bell, rest as bow"

82
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,660
Then what are you doing?

83
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,189
We... we are practicing Toad Kung-fu.

84
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,832
Right.

85
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,028
Don't do that.

86
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,566
You offend the law,

87
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,799
face the wall for three days.

88
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,379
What?

89
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,619
Why do you follow me?

90
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,137
What are you laughing for?
What so funny?

91
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,147
As a monk,
you should neither cheer nor anger.

92
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,554
You beast.

93
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,491
Master, kill it.

94
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:43,694
It's a sin, Set it free.

95
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,229
Yeah.

96
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,901
Amida Buddha.

97
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,672
Amida Buddha.

98
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,279
Master.
Amida Buddha.

99
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,676
Master, I'm guilty.

100
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,142
What is it?

101
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,609
I committed murder.

102
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,022
"Save one's life
and you can go to heaven."

103
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,883
The frog will be grateful
if it knows.

104
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,026
Sure?

105
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,988
Monks won't cheat.

106
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,662
I do understand.

107
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,714
Painful?

108
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,390
No.

109
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,872
Thank you...

110
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,639
Let's talk again
when you have recovered.

111
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,877
Master, congee with frog.

112
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,419
Wu Sha sent him two eggs.

113
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,990
She cares him so much.

114
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,738
Master, how is the taste?

115
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,769
You should know,

116
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,244
He think he is smart.

117
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:19,288
The sun rises from Song Shan.

118
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:25,258
Morning bell wakes the birds.

119
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:32,267
Streams runs along the wood.

120
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:37,103
Grasses are green on the hillside.

121
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:45,479
Fruit smell sweet,
flower look pretty.

122
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:51,188
The dogs hop, the rams run.

123
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:59,590
Hold up the whip and flicks softly.

124
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:08,331
Song drifts along the mountain.

125
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,169
Watch out!

126
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,180
Ya Wong, chase him.

127
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,919
Wo, Wo. Come on.

128
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,660
It's really coming.

129
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,731
Ya Wong, chase him.

130
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,185
I go to take again.

131
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,296
Get away.

132
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:48,644
It's useless
if one only knows to eat and sleep.

133
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:10,465
It's useless
if one only knows to eat and sleep.

134
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:15,132
Hey, wake up.

135
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,136
Oh, it's dead.

136
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,023
Who is it?

137
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,102
It's me...

138
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,602
What are you doing?

139
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,544
I want to take the short cut
to get water.

140
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,547
T'a Lin is the land
for burying monks of Shao Lin.

141
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,708
Nobody is allowed
without the abbot's permission. Get!

142
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,944
Yes!

143
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,962
I didn't mean to kill you.

144
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,363
I think it's good of me, to bury you

145
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,402
in this scenic place.

146
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,286
It's buried, that's pitiful.

147
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,946
Fairy would come
if he smells the taste of dog's meat.

148
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,653
It's a pity that you are monk.

149
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,722
Hsiao Hu.

150
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,295
Big Monk.

151
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,831
You are weak,
this food is good to your health.

152
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:24,998
I...

153
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,668
You are not buddhist,

154
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,799
and you are outside the temple.
You need not obey our law,

155
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,202
you may eat.

156
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,173
You have eaten before, aren't you?

157
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,747
This is usually cook with ginger,

158
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,445
wolfberry's fruit...

159
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,483
But it is my first time

160
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,194
see this way of cooking.

161
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,163
You are tired enough for caring me,

162
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,028
and you should take some rich food.

163
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,599
Amida Buddha.

164
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,304
As a buddhist,
it's guilty even to think of it.

165
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,802
It's hard to enjoy such good food.

166
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,878
No one will come here, you may eat.

167
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,317
Master...

168
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,217
Master...

169
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,158
Master, during these years
in Shao Lin Temple,

170
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,994
we work more than we eat.

171
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:34,228
It's tired.
It's hard to have this rich food.

172
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:43,012
You have one.

173
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,583
Master, let's eat together.

174
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,580
These buddhists came here
when they were in danger,

175
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,816
in such case,
so they aren't so devoted.

176
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,688
Let's eat, it taste good...

177
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,100
Master, then,
aren't we breaking the law?

178
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,037
"With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing."

179
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,975
We must have Buddha in heart,
and help people.

180
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,703
No need to worry about too much.

181
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,575
I understand.

182
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,306
"With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing."

183
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,816
Brother Shih K'ung realized this
already.

184
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,095
Big Monk, he?

185
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,858
Love can't be forgotten.

186
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,737
Shih K'ung,

187
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,643
wine increase sadness,
don't get drunk.

188
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,180
We've eaten Hsiao Hu's dog.

189
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,255
And we haven't requite.

190
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,593
Master, monks have nothing,

191
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,662
nothing to requite.

192
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,274
Shih K'ung, aren't you hurt?

193
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,999
He's drunken.

194
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,539
The fool.

195
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,382
Shih K'ung.

196
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,765
Big Monk, he?

197
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,029
He looks drunk but he isn't drunk.

198
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,801
Looks drunk but not drunk?

199
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,406
Drunken stick?

200
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,869
Yes, years ago,
when his wife was giving birth,

201
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,811
he was so happy
that he bought a large pot of wine.

202
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:06,154
But, his wife had been killed

203
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:12,755
by the robber Wang Jen-Tse.

204
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,193
So he became very fond of wine.

205
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,802
Every day he is sad and drunk.

206
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,938
And that made him
to create the "Drunken Stick".

207
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,806
He has such smart kung-fu,
why don't he revenge?

208
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,682
Can't defeat so many enemies alone.
Somebody.

209
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,388
Hide.

210
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,817
Get away.

211
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,409
Amida Buddha. It's a sin.

212
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,349
Ya Wong. Ya Wong.

213
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,880
Madam.

214
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,691
Did you see my dog?

215
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,295
Oh, you killed my dog.

216
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,090
No. Madam, please listen to me...

217
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,999
No, give me back my dog,
give me back.

218
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,300
Is that enough? Otherwise,
I'll hurt you.

219
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,146
You dare hit me?

220
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,847
As you are a girl,
I let you hit few times,

221
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,532
If you continue on,
I'll hurt you.

222
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,502
Father.

223
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,070
Father?

224
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,385
What's so serious? You are so cruel
to make him hurt like this.

225
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,351
It's him who's so cruel.

226
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,722
Madam, I didn't mean to...

227
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,225
However you explain,

228
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,488
I won't forgive the one ate my dog.

229
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,531
That means,
you won't even forgive me?

230
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,533
You?

231
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,670
I also ate the dog.

232
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,531
Father, why do you shelter him?

233
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,901
So are you. He recovered so fast,

234
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,277
all because of your eggs
and goats' milk.

235
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,644
I...

236
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,714
Thank you.

237
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,657
I hate you, revenge instead of thank.

238
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,356
Look at this girl!

239
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,498
Is she really your daughter?

240
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,930
This girl had no mother
since she was a baby.

241
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,036
At that time,
I was being attacked by Wang Jen-Tse,

242
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,107
and was force to hide myself
in Shao Lin Temple.

243
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,912
So I made her stay at a farmer's home.

244
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:22,212
The old man spoiled her
because he had no kids.

245
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,548
I must kill Wang Jen-Tse for revenge.

246
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,384
Please teach me Shao Lin Kung-fu.

247
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,586
The temple has rule,

248
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,390
kung-fu is use for protection,
it cannot be learnt by other people.

249
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,930
You aren't Shao Lin monk, I...

250
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,057
I'm willing to become a monk.

251
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,141
No killing.

252
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,213
It bite me.

253
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,412
The Temple's door is widely opened,
good man my enter.

254
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,855
He seems enjoying to kill.

255
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,585
The Temple cannot allow him.

256
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,465
Buddhist should be merciful.

257
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:51,365
Chueh Yuan wills to cut his hair,
he has been good.

258
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:01,244
Willing to do evils,
willing to achieve goodness,

259
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,714
must task to save all people.

260
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,419
Chueh Yuan, what's the matter?

261
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,329
Master, I have been a monk
for nearly three months,

262
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,925
besides gett water and cut wood bricks,
I stand here all day long,

263
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,665
when will you teach me
Shao Lin Kung-fu?

264
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,269
It's only three months,
look at your senior brothers,

265
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,738
smoke coming out from head,
holes made by foot,

266
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,504
this Vajra breaking power,

267
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,104
needs three to five years
of practicing.

268
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,808
What? Just stand like this
need three to five years.

269
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,885
Remember, practice kung-fu,
don't fear bitterness.

270
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,256
I'll remember.

271
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,465
Chueh Yuan, good!

272
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,281
Stop it!

273
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,154
Shao Lin kung-fu is for defense
and not attack.

274
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,391
You look like enjoying to kill.

275
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,291
You're punished to face the wall
for three days!

276
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,197
Oh brother!
Brother

277
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,069
Aren't you afraid of being punished again?

278
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,371
- I...
- Go back to your work!

279
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,743
Should we regard killing mosquito
as a sin?

280
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,245
If that is so,
how can I revenge my father's death?

281
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,109
Why should I be a monk
without learning kung-fu?

282
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,789
It is not that easy to be a monk.

283
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,954
I don't want to be a monk any more.

284
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,693
Master, please forgive me
for leaving you.

285
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,168
Miss Pak, I own you a life.

286
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,031
I'll repay your kindness in future.

287
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,686
She is pretty, let's bring her back.

288
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,591
She's such a wild girl.
Let's kill her!

289
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,729
Stop it!

290
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,784
Thank you.

291
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,931
General, please taste these velvet
and ram's penis.

292
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,104
No.

293
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,037
They are good for nothing
without the girl.

294
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,606
It's a sin.

295
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,339
General,
I have got some gaming food for you.

296
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,109
Gaming food?
Oh, it's good!

297
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:09,975
Good.

298
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,087
General, watch out for her wildness.

299
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,886
Her wildness?... Her wildness?

300
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,459
- General!
- What?

301
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,426
There's a kid outside the door.
He has wounded several of us.

302
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,508
How come you are not dead yet, kid?

303
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,585
That is tough for her.

304
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,563
It won't be funny
without the wildness.

305
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:52,885
Chueh Yuan!

306
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,251
It's you.

307
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,307
Oh, be careful!

308
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,678
He's drunk.

309
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,151
Drunken sword?

310
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,369
- Chueh Yuan!
- You better run quickly.

311
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,169
- How about you?
- I have to take revenge.

312
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,125
Aren't you woken yet?

313
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,492
You are looking for death, Kid.

314
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,392
Run quickly!

315
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,644
Li Shih-Min? Let's chase!

316
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,351
Oh! You are bleeding!

317
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,037
Thank you.

318
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,769
I also thank you for saving my life.

319
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,143
Miss Pak, aren't you angry with me?

320
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,084
Angry for what?

321
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,384
I owe you a life.

322
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,485
A dog's life or human life?

323
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,456
I have already got an advantage.

324
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,528
It's a pity I am unable
to kill Wang Jen-Tse.

325
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,837
He's got too many lackeys.

326
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,170
Dad is good at kung-fu,
yet has to hide in Shao Lin.

327
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,403
You better return to Shao Lin.

328
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,303
But I have sneaked out from it!

329
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,884
Oh! You are back!

330
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,596
I know you will come back.

331
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:09,926
You don't want to leave us,
don't you?

332
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,795
It is better to be a monk, isn't it?

333
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,466
Well, it took us years to achieve it.

334
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,633
You can achieve it
in only one day's time.

335
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,744
Well done, little brother!

336
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,340
Master!

337
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,685
Master, please punish me.

338
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,221
You have not grown up yet.

339
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,434
Nothing is that easy.

340
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,934
You are lucky to come back alive.

341
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,540
Are you hungry?

342
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,010
Drink it!

343
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,643
Thank you, master.

344
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,858
Learn it hard
from your senior brother in future.

345
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,703
He's got no way to go. Catch him!

346
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,369
My gracious Saviour!
Is you.

347
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,904
They've got too many men.
Don't fight with them.

348
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,479
Here is a cliff. Come with me.

349
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,583
Kill him.

350
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,627
Let's search!

351
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,549
Don't you dare to stop us
from catching the prisoner.

352
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,483
This is T'a Lin holy land.

353
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,144
No admission without permission
from our abbot.

354
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,755
Bald-head,
you are looking for death!

355
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,486
Stop it!

356
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,024
No fighting!

357
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,821
Abbot.

358
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,325
Amida Buddha.

359
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,832
General. This is a land
for burying Shao Lin monks.

360
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,272
Even King Cheng will respect this land.

361
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,606
Why do you want to fight, General?

362
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,270
A prisoner of King Cheng
is hiding here.

363
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,915
I want to have a search.

364
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,783
A little bald-head has helped
the prisoner to escape.

365
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,718
If you don't let me search,
the king will blame us.

366
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,548
Will you dare
to take the responsibility?

367
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,729
T'a Lin is our holy land.

368
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:52,096
Please dismount from horse
and go inside for search.

369
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,401
Alright!

370
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,198
Come with me.

371
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,147
Guard the road and go
for the search separately.

372
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,114
Master!

373
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,953
Chase
