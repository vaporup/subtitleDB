1
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,936
John?

2
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,942
John!

3
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,448
John!

4
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,968
Johnny?

5
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,975
Johnny, I'm coming in.

6
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,478
- Ahh!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

7
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,981
- Oh, shit!
- Ahh! Ahh! Ohh! Whoa! Whoa!

8
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:22,982
What? What?

9
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,985
What? What the fuck?
I didn't see nothing.

10
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,488
Jamie. Jamie, what-- Stop.

11
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,990
Jamie, what are you doing?
What's going on?

12
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,492
God, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,993
Oh, man.

14
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,498
I was-- I have jock itch, okay?
I was scratching my jock itch.

15
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,501
You scared the hell out of me.
I didn't see anything, okay?

16
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,002
You can't just come in.
You have to call.

17
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,006
- I did call you! I called.
- What are you doing here?

18
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,008
I'm getting married.
Tim and I are getting married.

19
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,011
I'm engaged.

20
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,023
I knew it.

21
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,527
I knew it. I could tell from the sound
of your voice on the messages.

22
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,028
I knew it. Shit.

23
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,035
John, it's been seven years.

24
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,538
I don't know what to tell you.
It still stings.

25
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,541
And it's still a surprise.

26
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,052
Listen.

27
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,055
We're going to this party
tomorrow night.

28
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,058
Tim and I are going.
Just listen.

29
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,061
It's a great party.
Very cool people.

30
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,564
People who would
stimulate you intellectually,

31
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:49,569
and I, you know-- I hear really,
really kinda great chicks.

32
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,071
I'm not going to a party.
Yeah, you are.

33
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,574
You're coming.
You gotta get out of the house.

34
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,576
Just let me do my thing.
I'll find my own way.

35
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,578
I'll find someone
or I won't,

36
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,080
and I'll be a great uncle to your kids.
Stop it.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,082
You're going to
take a shower,

38
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,085
and you're going to put some
pants on that are clean...

39
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,087
and those nice shoes.

40
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,089
And then you and Tim
will introduce me:

41
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,592
"Hey, this is the guy
that I dumped--

42
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,093
"who's my ex-husband--

43
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,095
but you'll love him!"

44
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,097
You know how pathetic
that sounds?

45
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,099
This is the perfect opportunity.
You're coming.

46
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,103
- I want you to come.
- I'm not going to a party.

47
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,194
Hey.
Hey.

48
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,696
Hey, John.
How's that going?

49
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:36,699
Good.
Good.

50
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,201
It's just, that, you know,

51
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,704
I could stare at a fire
for hours, you know?

52
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,707
It's like TV.

53
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,211
What?
This is--

54
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,715
I came. I got dressed up.
I know you did. I know.

55
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:57,720
John, drink that.
It's Red Bull and vodka.

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,723
Drink it. Get lit.

57
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,725
Ladies find you attractive.
Come on.

58
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,227
All right, all right.
I'm not messing around. I'm serious.

59
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,729
You want me to get insane?
Yeah.

60
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,230
In the membrane.

61
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,234
John, put it
inside your body.

62
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,737
Tip it. Tip it. Tip it.

63
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,739
Let's go.
Ahh.

64
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,742
Giddyap. Come on, Big John.
Go, Johnny.

65
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,744
Come on.
Lot of pretty girls here.

66
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,245
Look at her. Oh, she's--

67
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:25,748
No, you can't follow me too.

68
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,249
Just watch and learn.

69
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:32,254
They were $39,
and I'm like, "See those?"

70
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,256
And he's like,
"They're perfect." Hey.

71
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,258
Hi.
Are you waiting for the bathroom?

72
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:39,762
Uh, no. Go ahead.
No, no.

73
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,265
I was just asking.
I don't have to-- I don't have to go.

74
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,267
Oh, well, it's right there.

75
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,272
Anyway, um, so--

76
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:53,275
Where did you get those?

77
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,777
Ooh, ooh.

78
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,278
Sorry.

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,783
I think the screws
came out.

80
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,286
Anyway--
You're just gonna hold that?

81
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:11,794
Well, um, we're kind of, like,
having a conversation here, so-- Oh.

82
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:13,796
Oh. I'm--

83
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,799
I'm gonna have some
conversations too here, eventually.

84
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:22,304
Hey, can I have
a vodka Red Bull?

85
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,810
Hey.
Hey.

86
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:32,815
- Do I know you?
- No, I was just being stupid.

87
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,317
You seemed friendly.
Hey--

88
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:38,821
Uh, red, please. Thanks.

89
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,824
Red Bull?
You having Red Bull? Uh, wine.

90
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:43,826
Oh.

91
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,831
Thank you.
So-- Mmm, no.

92
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,833
No.

93
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,836
Thanks.

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,842
I'm not an architect.
I'm not a deejay.

95
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:05,347
I'm not a... marketing executive.
Listen. Marketing--

96
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:08,851
You gotta be yourself and be
vulnerable and be honest...

97
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:13,355
and just get out there and
talk to somebody who's like--

98
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,357
Who should I talk to? you know,
seems like a normal girl.

99
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:18,861
Name one person. Look at the woman
on the couch. She's totally cool.

100
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,362
Okay, her? Done.
I'll go do it. Okay.

101
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,868
Hi. Is anyone sitting here?

102
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,870
Uh, no, go ahead.

103
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,372
Ahh!

104
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:31,874
Hi. I'm John.

105
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:34,877
I'm Ashley.
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

106
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,378
Thank you.

107
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,881
Are you having a good time?

108
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,384
Not really.

109
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,887
Me, either. Uh...

110
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:49,892
Can-- Listen.
I know we just met.

111
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,394
Can I be honest with you?

112
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:55,397
I just want to level
with somebody, okay?

113
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,902
Sure.

114
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:04,406
I am in a tailspin.

115
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,909
And I'm lonely.

116
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,912
I'm depressed,

117
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,916
and I'm borderline desperate.

118
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,920
But... I don't know.
I just-- I know myself.

119
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,422
I know that
I'm a really fun person.

120
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,926
I'm not a lonely person
or a depressed person.

121
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,928
I have-- I don't know.

122
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:30,432
I just feel like if I could find
the right person to be with me--

123
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,937
I have so much to give,
you know. I have all these gifts.

124
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm like--
I'm a blast, you know?

125
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,945
I'm sorry.
I have to make a phone call.

126
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,948
Okay. That's--

127
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,788
Okay. Plan B.

128
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,293
You need to get more drunk.

129
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,321
- Nice penis.
- Ohh!

130
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,824
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
No.

131
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,827
- Go ahead, finish up.
- No, no, no.

132
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,331
Why does this keep happening to me?
It's the second time this week.

133
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:37,333
Really?
Yeah.

134
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,335
The other one was my wife.

135
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:45,841
My ex-wife. She's getting remarried,
but I'm fine with it, so--

136
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:49,845
Yeah, I overheard your-- your
conversation on the couch up there.

137
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,348
Ohh. Did you?
Yes.

138
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,350
- That was horrible.
- No, it wasn't.

139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,355
I thought it was
really raw and honest.

140
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,359
You mean that?
Yeah.

141
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,861
- You really mean it?
- I did.

142
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:10,866
'Cause, um,
I've had a lot of weird conversations tonight,

143
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,369
and if you really mean that,
I think I'm gonna start crying.

144
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,371
I mean it. I mean it.
I mean it.

145
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,375
Why am I even--
I can't talk to you.

146
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,877
What am I doing?
I'm just gonna mess this up.

147
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,880
'Cause you're a really
hot girl and I'm just--

148
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,385
I'm sorry.
You're not messing it up.

149
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,889
Are you flirting with me?

150
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:40,396
This is insane.
I'm like Shrek.

151
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,897
What-- What are you doing--
I-- I didn't say that.

152
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,400
What are you doing here
in the forest with Shrek?

153
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,402
I was gonna pee
in the bushes--

154
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,904
Really?
and you took my spot.

155
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,409
Oh! Do you hear that song?

156
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,910
What?

157
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:56,912
Wait. I'm sorry.
Wait right here.

158
00:09:56,912 --> 00:10:00,416
It's the greatest song ever recorded,
and I'm gonna go enjoy it,

159
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,918
and I'm gonna come back
and talk to you.

160
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,920
Don't worry.

161
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,924
Dance song! Come on, move out!

162
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,428
Come on, it's good stuff.
Dance party!

163
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,930
Dance party! Look out!

164
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,932
Clear the dance zone!

165
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,435
# # Don't # #

166
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,937
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

167
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,939
# # You know I can't believe you
when I say that # #

168
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,445
# # I love Red Bull and vodka!
# # Don't, don't you want me

169
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:33,949
# # Don't believe it
when you say that you don't need me # #

170
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:37,953
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

171
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:41,957
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

172
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:46,462
# # Don't you want me, baby #
# Come on!

173
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:50,466
# # Don't you want me, ohh # #

174
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,468
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

175
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:56,972
Come on, you guys!
It's a party!

176
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:03,479
I guess I'm the only one
who loves a good song.

177
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,985
# # I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar # #

178
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,487
Thank you!

179
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,989
# # That much is true # #
Yeah, baby.

180
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:18,994
# # But even then I knew I'd
find a much better place # #

181
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,497
# # Either with or without you # #

182
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,499
Thank you.
Get up, come on!

183
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:27,002
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

184
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:29,505
# # You know I can't believe it
when you say # #

185
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,507
What are you guys doing?
Come on!

186
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,010
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

187
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,515
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

188
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,017
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

189
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,020
Yes! Yes! Keep going.

190
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,523
# # Don't you want me now # #

191
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,528
How did you do that?

192
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,029
That was crazy.
Ohh.

193
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,532
Do you do exercises
or something?

194
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,536
You're amazing.

195
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,538
You're an angel.

196
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,040
You're a sex angel.

197
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,542
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,548
You want to sleep over?

199
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,569
Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:42,244
Hello?

201
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,745
Hi, Molly.

202
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,747
Hey, it's John.

203
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,750
Who?

204
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,253
John?
From last night?

205
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,257
John?

206
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:57,759
Just kidding, John. Hi.

207
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,761
Oh, okay.
I'm glad you called.

208
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,763
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm glad I called too.

209
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,266
That was really fun
last night.

210
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,769
Mm-hmm.
And thanks for the note and, um--

211
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,772
Hey, I was wondering if you
wanted to hang out tonight.

212
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,276
Sure.
Yeah?

213
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,279
Great. You want to come
over here then or--

214
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,283
Look, I have to run, but I'll
come over after work, okay?

215
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:23,285
Okay, sounds good.

216
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,287
Bye.
Bye.

217
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:36,358
Hey.
Hi.

218
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,860
How are you?
Good, good.

219
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,365
There's a whole custom-prepared plate.
I want yours.

220
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:47,869
You're a very good cook.

221
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,375
I just decided
to give it my all.

222
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,879
Which is not
the cool-guy thing to do.

223
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,881
I'm not into that anyway.

224
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:06,888
Okay? Okay.
I'll take your word for it.

225
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,894
I know I'm not supposed to say this,
but I really like you.

226
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:16,398
Is it crazy for me to say,
like, I want it to work out?

227
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:21,903
Is that too much?
Am I supposed to be cooler than that?

228
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:23,905
Oh.

229
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,909
My life is really
complicated right now.

230
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,914
But I'm definitely interested.

231
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:45,427
Hey. Where you going?

232
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:47,929
Hey, hey.

233
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,932
I-- I just have to--
I have to go.

234
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,435
Wait. Why do you have
to leave so late?

235
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:56,438
I just have to-- I have to--
Just call me tomorrow, okay?

236
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:01,443
Molly, wait. Give me one second, please.
Are you married?

237
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:04,446
Is that where you're going?
No, I'm not married.

238
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,448
What is it?
Are you a secret agent?

239
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,949
Just trust me.
What is going on?

240
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,951
Call me tomorrow, okay?

241
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,236
Oh, my God.

242
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,783
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Hey, hi.

243
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,786
Sorry.
Uh, what am I doing?

244
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:27,289
It's okay.
Hi. Uh--

245
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,291
Can I help you?

246
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,793
Uh, I'm sorry. Is this--

247
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:33,795
I think I have the wrong
address actually.

248
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:36,298
What address are you looking for?
Um...

249
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,801
Is this--
Does Molly live here?

250
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,803
Yeah. Can I ask who is asking?

251
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,306
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm John.
I'm a friend of hers.

252
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,308
I was in the neighborhood,
and I was, like,

253
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,809
"I think that's
Molly's house,"

254
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,812
but I didn't want to ring
the doorbell if it wasn't.

255
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:55,317
Um, no, it is. You can definitely ring
the doorbell. That's more conventional.

256
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,320
But, uh-- Yeah, I know.
I was just-- Whatever. I was shy. I was--

257
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,824
But I am a friend of hers,
and I'm sorry. Oh. I'm Cyrus.

258
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:04,826
Cyrus. Yeah.

259
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,331
- Her son.
- Her son. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

260
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:13,335
Um, yeah, anyway--

261
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,340
So how long you known Molly?

262
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,344
Uh, actually,
just a couple days.

263
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,346
Wow. Just a couple days.

264
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,349
Yeah, we just met, so--

265
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,353
But you could feel it
already, huh?

266
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,355
Like there's something
really special happening?

267
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:39,361
Y-Yeah.

268
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:44,866
Can I--
How old are you?

269
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,868
I'm almost 22.

270
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,870
Oh, okay. All right.

271
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,372
I'm 21.

272
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:54,876
So you-- you guys have always lived together?
You didn't--

273
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,379
You're not, like, in
from school or whatever?

274
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,881
No, I took my G.E.D.
when I was 16,

275
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:02,384
and then, um,
you know--

276
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,886
M-Molly and I are like best
friends so-- Oh, okay.

277
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,888
And my dad's not really in the picture.
Uh-huh.

278
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,891
She kinda homeschooled me
and raised me by herself.

279
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:14,896
And since then,
I've sort of been focusing on my music career.

280
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:18,400
Mm-hmm. Oh, that's--
So that's you? That's--

281
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,902
That's my studio.
That's my work space, yes. Yeah, I saw that.

282
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:24,406
You got a couple synths there.
Oh, more than a couple.

283
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,908
I think I have something
around seven pieces.

284
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,411
Yeah. Vintage
and some new stuff.

285
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,581
Would you like to hear
some of my-- my work?

286
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:35,583
Yeah, why not? I mean, yeah.

287
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:39,587
Great. Great.
Okay, great. Great.

288
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:43,591
Um, it's-it's untitled right now,
and it's an unfinished piece.

289
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,602
Slow

290
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:17,625
Sounds like Steve Miller.
You know that one Steve Miller song?

291
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,127
No, it doesn't.

292
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,169
Hi.

293
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:05,173
Hey.

294
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:11,179
It's good.

295
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,181
Ohh!

296
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,684
- Hi. Sorry.

297
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:20,688
I was in the neighborhood,
and Cyrus came out and let me in. I'm sorry.

298
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,192
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:26,194
Hi.
Hi. Hey.

300
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:28,196
Hey. Hey.

301
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:33,201
- Anyway--
- So, John, are you gonna stay for dinner?

302
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:38,706
Uh, uh--

303
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:40,208
Yes, dinner.

304
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,683
There's literally, like, 15 peppers.
- I know. Well--

305
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,186
I'm just not gonna be able to
eat it if they're on the side.

306
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:54,189
I know.

307
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:57,192
You asked for them
without peppers?

308
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:00,695
I did, but they never-- I'm not
gonna use this place anymore.

309
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,199
- There's a big red one right there.
- That's okay.

310
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,201
So, John,
I have to apologize to you.

311
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,204
What?

312
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,206
You came in
and I-I sat you down,

313
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,708
and I just started blabbing
all about my life.

314
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,711
I get overly excited sometimes,
and I apologize.

315
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:18,713
I honestly am curious
to hear about you...

316
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:23,218
and, you know,
just want to-- want to hear more about your life.

317
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,224
Well, uh, let's see.
I'm-I'm an editor.

318
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,227
I do freelance
editing work. Um--

319
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,732
I like to go to the movies.
I've got a pretty good DVD collection.

320
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,735
I mean, what--

321
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,237
what else do you
want to know?

322
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:44,239
I don't want to know
what you do.

323
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,741
I want to know what you are.
Who you are.

324
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,744
That's more what I'm--
what I'm interested in.

325
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:56,251
Are we really gonna-- You want me to?
Okay. I'm, uh-- I'm--

326
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:00,255
I'm divorced.

327
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,257
I got divorced, like,
seven years ago.

328
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:06,761
And it wasn't my idea.

329
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,264
It was--
You know, I got left.

330
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:14,269
Uh, I was kind of digging
myself into a hole with my life,

331
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:18,273
and my wife at the time
was not happy with it.

332
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:21,776
Told me so. Said to work it out.
I didn't work it out.

333
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,279
I ran away from her
emotionally...

334
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,781
and made a huge mistake...

335
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:31,786
and have been in kind of a dark,
existential place, to tell you the truth.

336
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:35,290
And then I met your mom
at a party,

337
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,292
and, I don't know.

338
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:42,297
Seems like things are looking up
for the first time in a long time.

339
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:46,301
That's--
Wow.

340
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,803
You asked. That's where I'm at.
Wow. Wow.

341
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:51,806
I like your style, John.

342
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:55,310
To John-- Our new friend.

343
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,813
You seem like a good man.

344
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:01,316
That was a lot
of information.

345
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,818
So, uh, are you gonna
stay the night?

346
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:07,822
Maybe we should ask
your mom. I don't know.

347
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,827
Um, I think that's
between me and John.

348
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,330
Fair enough.

349
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,333
I was just messing around. It's not,
uh-- It's none of my business.

350
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:23,338
It's valid. It's valid. If I was in your position,
I'd probably be a little--

351
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:26,341
I mean-- Molly?

352
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,343
Seriously, don't fuck my mom.

353
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,846
I'm just kidding.
I'm just joking around. Sorry. No.

354
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:33,848
Cy!

355
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:36,851
I know. I--
I'm sorry. Uh--

356
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:39,854
that's my attempt
at humor, John.

357
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,356
Okay.
That's, uh, just--

358
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:43,858
Enough said.

359
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,864
We did have sex.

360
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:53,868
I mean, if you want to be adults about it,
we did. That's--

361
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,870
I'm sorry if that's
weird or whatever,

362
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,373
but I'm not gonna sit here
and pretend like we didn't.

363
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:01,376
We met at a party and-- That's
not appropriate to talk about here.

364
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:05,880
Okay. I mean, I don't want to disrespect
you by treating you like a child or whatever.

365
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:09,384
You seem like you want to be
treated like an adult, and--

366
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:13,388
That's just it. That's--
That happened, so--

367
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,890
That's--

368
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,894
I accept that information.

369
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,285
- Hey, John?
- Hey.

370
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:49,290
I just want to say I thought
it was really great...

371
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,794
what you did at dinner,
opening up to me like that.

372
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:57,298
And I know it was weird,
but I thought it was great.

373
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,300
Thanks.

374
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,302
And it's great to finally
have a new dad.

375
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,811
You got to get used
to my weird sense of humor.

376
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:15,316
But I really thought that was-- that
was a great thing that you did.

377
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:18,319
Actually, your mom's
in the shower.

378
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:36,838
# # The king
falls off the throne # #

379
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:41,843
# # The king falls off
of the throne # #

380
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,859
Hi.
Hi.

381
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,861
- Night, John.
- Good night, Cyrus.

382
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:03,865
- Night, Molly.
- Good night, Cyrus.

383
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,867
Good shower?

384
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:08,870
Yeah.
Yeah?

385
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,875
You know, there's something that I've
been thinking about in the shower. And I--

386
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:20,381
I really appreciated what you were expressing
in the kitchen and throughout dinner.

387
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:24,886
And I've-- I--

388
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:27,388
I feel a little, um--

389
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:30,391
I guess a little embarrassed
and just a little, uh--

390
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,893
It's not even that.

391
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,896
I just want to say I appreciate
how open you were.

392
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,397
I love that about you,

393
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:41,903
and I'm sorry that I wasn't
as open about my boy.

394
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:43,404
No, that's fine.

395
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:45,907
It's your--

396
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:48,409
Yeah, I know.
your prerogative not to say that stuff.

397
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:52,914
It's private, we just met,
and I was fine with it. I mean--

398
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,416
He's a great kid too.
He is.

399
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,418
I'm glad you appreciate that.

400
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,420
I was going to leave,

401
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,923
and he was, like,
"No, come in, come in."

402
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:05,426
I'm happy to hear that.

403
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,429
I didn't--
I'm happy to hear that.

404
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,432
And that's the thing.
He's so--

405
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:16,437
He's very mature,
as you can see, in a lot of ways,

406
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,939
and he really pushes me.

407
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:22,944
But in other ways he's just--
he's not come into himself yet.

408
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:26,447
And-And it's coming,
and it's coming from a very deep place.

409
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:31,953
This could be a--
This is a very sudden--

410
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:34,455
You are very sudden.

411
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:38,459
And I haven't had a man over--

412
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,962
to stay overnight--

413
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,965
since Cyrus, uh, was born.

414
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,969
So it's a new thing.

415
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:51,472
Well-- But to tell you the truth,
you didn't have me over.

416
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,474
I-- I stalked you over--

417
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,476
Yeah, you gave it a little--

418
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:58,479
I get seized sometimes,
so it's okay you're here.

419
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:03,985
Molly, everything is a gift,
at this point, to me.

420
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,486
Just getting to hang out.

421
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,489
Like every moment,
from moment to moment.

422
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,994
Thanks for talking to me
about my--

423
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,497
I just feel a little--
No, I know.

424
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,511
N-N-N--

425
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,013
No, we leave the door open.

426
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,015
Oh. I was just going to
take my pants off.

427
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:37,018
We just-- We-- We just
always leave the door open.

428
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,522
Um, okay.

429
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,535
Hey.

430
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:58,539
Good morning.
You guys are early risers, huh?

431
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,541
Yep. How'd you sleep?
Good.

432
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,043
Good. How'd you sleep?
Very well.

433
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:04,545
Good.
Nice.

434
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,548
So what's-- What's, uh--

435
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,551
What's going on?
What's the plan?

436
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,553
What are you guys doing?

437
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:16,057
Um, we go to Elysian Park every
morning and eat a little breakfast...

438
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,059
and take some photos
for a few hours.

439
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,562
Yeah. Cyrus composes
to images of nature.

440
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:25,066
Sounds cool.
I am supposed to work.

441
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,572
Should I blow it off?

442
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,080
I'll just get it over with.

443
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,583
I'll get in there. Get it done.
Then I have less to do next week, so--

444
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:45,086
Anyway, all right.

445
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,592
Here you go, Mom.
Did you guys see my shoes?

446
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:54,595
- No.
- They were right here.

447
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,598
Weird.

448
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:01,102
Okay.

449
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:06,574
Yeah. I can't believe
how deep into it I am already.

450
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,576
That's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

451
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,578
Thank you.
I really am.

452
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,079
It's amazing.
Is it that obvious?

453
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,082
Am I-- Am I glowing?
You actually are.

454
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,586
You look good.
Just, you know, slow down.

455
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:21,088
Let's just be here now.
Don't worry, I'm not--

456
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:24,091
I know. I just don't want you,
you know, to obsess on this.

457
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:26,093
I was a little needy out of the gate.
Yes.

458
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,597
I'll admit that.
But it's settling in nicely now.

459
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:34,602
And other than one little
weird blip this morning,

460
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:37,104
I am not concerned
about anything.

461
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,106
What? What is it?

462
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:43,611
Um, when I woke up this morning,
my shoes were missing from their house.

463
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:46,113
Your white Adidas?
Yeah.

464
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:49,116
Your favorite shoes.
Oh, my God.

465
00:32:49,116 --> 00:32:51,118
Well, then somebody
did you a favor.

466
00:32:51,118 --> 00:32:53,621
Whatever.
It-It'll be fine.

467
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:06,133
- John?
- I definitely left my shoes in their living room.

468
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:09,637
You know what I mean?
I wore shoes into the house. Shoes-- John?

469
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:13,140
Can we not have this conversation
at 1:30 in the morning?

470
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,143
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea what time it was.

471
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:19,647
But the more I think
about the shoes,

472
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:22,149
now it's like every look the kid
gave me seems really weird.

473
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:24,151
- Like he was being friendly but--
- Yeah.

474
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:26,654
Will you please do me a favor
and meet them...

475
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:29,657
and tell me whether I'm the one
who's paranoid and crazy?

476
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,158
Sure.
Good night, John.

477
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,660
Fine. I will, okay?

478
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,664
It's got to be totally casual
and like it was an accident.

479
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,006
No.

480
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:49,009
Higher so that it takes longer and I can catch it.

481
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:50,511
Okay.

482
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,015
Yes.

483
00:33:55,516 --> 00:34:00,020
Mmm. I love the ripples.
This looks incredible.

484
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,523
There they are. There they are.
Come on. Come on.

485
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,025
It ripples out almost across the whole thing.
Molly?

486
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,027
Hey.
Hey.

487
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:09,029
Oh, my gosh, Cyrus.
How's it going? John.

488
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,531
How you doing?
Hi.

489
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:12,533
I'm Cyrus.
So nice to meet you.

490
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:15,035
I was just saying,
"I wonder if they're hanging out in the park."

491
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,037
- I'm Molly. We've met.
- This is Jamie.

492
00:34:17,037 --> 00:34:19,039
- We go jogging here all the time.
- You do?

493
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,543
Yeah. That's so weird,
because we're here literally every day.

494
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,046
Yeah, you said that,
but I didn't make the--

495
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,549
I guess, I don't know.
I guess the jogging track--

496
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:32,052
We took a little bit of a side diversion this time.
Yeah.

497
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,556
What are you doing?

498
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,058
Your hair-- The light is hitting
your hair in this great way.

499
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:41,562
It's like a crippled tree
reaching for heaven.

500
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:44,565
John, would you do me
a huge favor?

501
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,066
Yeah, what?

502
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,569
Would you mind
getting into the tree?

503
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:54,074
Try one where you get in
the tree just like a jaguar.

504
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:58,078
Like a jaguar?
Yeah, just climb up the tree like a jaguar.

505
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,081
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

506
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:03,584
You're a natural.

507
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:06,086
Now do one where you just
scream as loud as you can.

508
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:09,590
No, that's not screaming.
That's moaning.

509
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,092
You're bossy, Cyrus.

510
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:15,596
You look incredible right now.
I'm really trying to get the most of this.

511
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:17,598
All right.
Now scream as loud as you can.

512
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,631
What did you think?
Did you like them?

513
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,634
Yes! I think
they're really sweet...

514
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,136
and, uh, kind--

515
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:58,138
And the wrestling wasn't weird?
And quirky.

516
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:02,142
No, that was weird. But, you know,
in a good way. I don't know.

517
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:06,146
I don't think it was,
like, "strange" weird.

518
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:09,149
I mean, it wasn't "bad" weird.
You know?

519
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:10,651
They're really cool.
I like them.

520
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,653
They're cool, right?
They're fun.

521
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,154
They're fun.
They're great.

522
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:17,658
And I don't think
they stole your shoes.

523
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:21,161
Thank you for coming out here.
I appreciate it.

524
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:24,164
Don't worry. All right,
I'll see you at the office in a second.

525
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:26,166
Relax, okay?
All right. Okay.

526
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,167
Okay.

527
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,670
You're the best, Jamie.

528
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:39,346
Okay. That one.

529
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:41,849
That one's great.

530
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,351
No, let's skip that one.

531
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:49,356
Oh, that's perfect.

532
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:50,858
That's the perfect one.

533
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,363
Hello?

534
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:00,367
Hi.

535
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,370
No, no, no. I don't need anything.
Thanks. I'll see you in a minute.

536
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,872
Okay.

537
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,876
Who's that?

538
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,378
John.
He's gonna come by.

539
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:12,880
Cool.
Yeah.

540
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,383
I was-- I-- I was going to tell you and then--

541
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:19,887
- I don't know. We never talked about it.
- Okay.

542
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,389
Anyway,
he's coming over.

543
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,892
That was a lot.
You could have just said "John's coming over."

544
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:27,394
I know.
I guess I could have.

545
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:31,899
- I feel weird.
- You don't have to explain yourself.

546
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,901
I think it's nice that
John's coming to see you.

547
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,904
I think it's lovely,

548
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:39,406
but I still feel--

549
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:42,910
I feel really--
I feel really weird.

550
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,411
You feel weird?
Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,913
Why do you feel weird?

552
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,415
Are you okay with all of this?
Yes.

553
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:52,419
If I was 10, maybe I'd feel weird,
but I am a grown-up,

554
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,923
and you deserve somebody
who can love you--

555
00:37:56,423 --> 00:37:59,927
in a way that I can't love you,
and-- Okay. Okay.

556
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:02,429
I think it's great.
Okay.

557
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,932
I'm the weirdo.

558
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:07,434
Hey. How you doing?

559
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:08,435
Hey, Cyrus.
Hey, John.

560
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:09,937
Hi.
Hi.

561
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:12,940
Welcome.

562
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,959
Well, well, well.

563
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,961
You've closed the door.

564
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:47,474
Ohh!
What? What's going on?

565
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:50,978
No, no, no! It's okay. Stay!
Stay in here. Stay here!

566
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,486
Is everything okay?

567
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:21,008
Oh.

568
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,378
Hi, John.

569
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,382
Oh, hey.

570
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:05,886
I was just looking
for your mom.

571
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,388
I think she's asleep.

572
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:10,891
Oh, okay.

573
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:14,895
Come here.

574
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,401
Come here.

575
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,404
You hungry?

576
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:29,409
I heard you scream,

577
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,414
and your mom didn't tell me
what was going on so--

578
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,922
Night terrors.

579
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,424
I used to get them a lot
when I was younger,

580
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:47,427
and I just recently
started getting them again.

581
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,430
I'm sorry.

582
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,433
I'll get through it.
Sounds terrible.

583
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:55,435
Um, I'm glad you're up,

584
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:57,437
because I've been wanting
to talk to you man-to-man.

585
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:05,445
No. I'm-- I'm all right.

586
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:11,451
I didn't want to say anything,
'cause Molly asked me not to, but...

587
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:18,458
I think-- I think you might be
coming on a tad too strong.

588
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,462
Okay.

589
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:24,965
She said that?

590
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:28,969
She didn't say it
in those exact words but--

591
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,972
Wow. I mean--

592
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:36,977
I don't want to get into it, but
those were not the signals...

593
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:39,479
I was getting at all tonight.

594
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,983
In the past,

595
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:48,989
when she's losing interest,

596
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,994
she tends to
overcompensate sexually.

597
00:41:56,997 --> 00:42:01,001
I just think that if you
pulled back 10% to 20%,

598
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:04,004
emotionally speaking,
you'd do a lot better for yourself.

599
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:13,513
Wow.

600
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:15,015
Okay.

601
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,018
Okay, I'm gonna
go to sleep.

602
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,523
Night, John.
Good night.

603
00:42:58,558 --> 00:43:00,560
Did you see John this morning?

604
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:03,563
He actually left
last night.

605
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,566
Last night?

606
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,569
Come take a seat, Mom.

607
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:16,076
You look so serious.

608
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,082
I talked to John last night.

609
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:25,585
Uh-huh.

610
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,098
What?

611
00:43:38,598 --> 00:43:40,100
He...

612
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:45,105
feels that things
are moving really fast,

613
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:47,107
and...

614
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:51,611
I think he wants to just
slow down a little bit.

615
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:54,114
He said that?

616
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,616
Read the note.

617
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:01,621
I mean,
it's just so not like him.

618
00:44:07,627 --> 00:44:09,629
Are you saying
that I'm making this up?

619
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:12,132
No, I'm just--
I'm confused.

620
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:15,135
You're confused?
What do you mean you're confused?

621
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:18,138
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
and you're, like, attacking me?

622
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,140
- I'm just trying to help!
- Wait!

623
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,142
Where are you going?

624
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:08,464
Hello?

625
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,965
Hey.

626
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:11,967
Hey.

627
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:15,471
Can you come over?
Something's going on with Cyrus.

628
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:18,474
Is everything okay?

629
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:21,477
He's been gone all day.
He's missing.

630
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:23,479
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm on my way.

631
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,980
Thanks.
Okay, bye.

632
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:38,243
Hey.

633
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,247
You okay?
Mmm.

634
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,249
Thanks so much for coming.

635
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:53,258
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

636
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,764
Mm-mmm.
No?

637
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:01,767
I could order something
or pick something up or--

638
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,772
Mm-mmm.
You should eat something.

639
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,774
Mmm, I'm not hungry.

640
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:17,282
Hey. Hi.

641
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:19,284
Hi.

642
00:46:19,785 --> 00:46:21,787
Hello.

643
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:24,289
Hi. Come here.

644
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:26,291
What happened?

645
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:30,295
Molly, why don't you,
uh-- why don't you sit down for a sec, okay?

646
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:31,797
Sit down for a second.

647
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:33,799
Um--

648
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,301
You guys want to
talk alone or--

649
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,304
No, this concerns you.
You should stay, John.

650
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:40,806
Are you sure?
Yeah.

651
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:42,808
Okay.

652
00:46:42,808 --> 00:46:46,812
I don't want to make this emotional.
I've decided to move out.

653
00:46:48,814 --> 00:46:52,317
I'm an adult now, and I think
it's time for us to move on.

654
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:55,821
I-I--
It's pretty sudden though.

655
00:46:55,821 --> 00:46:57,322
- I rented a room.
- You rented a room?

656
00:46:57,322 --> 00:47:01,326
I found some musicians on Craigslist,
and I'm gonna rent a room in their house.

657
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:03,328
And it's gonna be
better for both of us.

658
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:05,330
And besides,
you have John now,

659
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,333
and you guys need some space
for your relationship to flourish.

660
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:10,836
It's for the best.

661
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:12,838
Yeah.

662
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,843
I think that maybe--
This is so sudden.

663
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:23,849
- Maybe you're feeling some anger or--
- I'm not angry.

664
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:26,351
Maybe you should just
take it slowly, step-by-step.

665
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:27,853
You guys are so serious.

666
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:31,356
It's not a big deal.

667
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,363
Well, I need to go,
'cause I'm gonna go paint my room tonight.

668
00:47:38,363 --> 00:47:41,867
Then I'm gonna come back with a truck
tomorrow and get the rest of my things.

669
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:43,869
Will you pack them up
for me, Mom?

670
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,871
Uh--

671
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:49,374
Please. It'll be easier.
Just give me a hug.

672
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:58,884
I love you.

673
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:04,890
It's okay. We'll take some time off
and let the dust settle a little bit,

674
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,393
and we'll all get together
for dinner or something, okay?

675
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:13,398
John, really nice
spending time with you.

676
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:15,400
Okay.

677
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:02,447
It's gonna be good.
I'm excited about the new place.

678
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,451
Tilt it sideways a little bit.

679
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,471
Thanks, John.
Yeah.

680
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:33,478
Will you thank Molly for packing
up all this stuff for me, please?

681
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,482
Actually, she had to work,
so I did most of it.

682
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:40,485
Oh.

683
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:45,490
Thanks.

684
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:47,993
No problem.

685
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:50,495
Okay.

686
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,002
See you.

687
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:09,147
That's great.
There you are.

688
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:11,650
You are not gonna believe this.
He did it.

689
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,151
He stole my shoes.

690
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,655
This means my whole friendship
with the guy is based on bullshit.

691
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:20,158
All right, let me just finish-- The first night
I was there, he was messing with me.

692
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:22,661
That means there hasn't been
an honest moment yet.

693
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,162
Jamie!
I get it. I'm sorry.

694
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:28,667
I have to do this. Then I have to go
to the flower shop for my wedding.

695
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:31,169
Can we just talk about this later, please? Yes.

696
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:33,171
I will wait.

697
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,173
It was the act of taking the
shoes that was the big deal...

698
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:38,677
and the fact that he's been lying
the whole time I've known him.

699
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:42,180
Bringing me in, acting like, "Hey, yeah,
come on in. No problem.

700
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,182
Any friend of my mom's
a friend of mine."

701
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:46,184
The whole time just
to get me to trust him,

702
00:50:46,184 --> 00:50:48,186
so he can turn around
and stab me in the back.

703
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:49,688
Oh, my God.
It's interesting.

704
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:51,189
Don't you guys see?

705
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:55,193
By saying he's leaving because of me,
he makes me the bad guy.

706
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:58,697
Right?
It's like he lit the fuse and ran away.

707
00:50:58,697 --> 00:51:01,199
Will you go look over at those flowers?
I'm sorry, you guys.

708
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,201
That's okay.
These are nice ranunculus.

709
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:06,204
Keep naming flowers, John.
Whatever you'd like.

710
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:07,706
It's just a wedding, honey.
Don't sweat it.

711
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:10,208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll leave you guys alone.

712
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:12,711
I just have to--
I feel like--

713
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:14,212
It's all right.

714
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:17,215
She's sitting there, lonely,
in this house, miserable,

715
00:51:17,215 --> 00:51:20,218
which is exactly
what he wants her to feel.

716
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:45,243
Are you all right?

717
00:51:45,243 --> 00:51:46,745
No.

718
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:48,747
Come here.

719
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:56,254
It's gonna be okay.

720
00:51:56,254 --> 00:51:57,756
No, it's not.

721
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:07,766
I know it seems just weird that it was so fast,
but it really is gonna be all right.

722
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:09,768
No, it's not okay!
Okay.

723
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:20,278
Let's just go to sleep.
Yeah.

724
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:38,296
Listen, I know you're tired
of me saying this.

725
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:39,798
So don't say it.

726
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:43,802
And it's upsetting to hear.
It is.

727
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:46,304
But it's not
gonna be all right.

728
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,807
It's gonna be terrible.

729
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:54,813
That's true.

730
00:52:54,813 --> 00:52:56,815
Things are really
not gonna be okay.

731
00:52:58,316 --> 00:53:00,318
That makes me feel better.

732
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,827
Just be honest with me.

733
00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:10,829
Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,334
Thank you.
Thank you.

735
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:19,337
You're welcome.

736
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:26,845
I like you.
I want to be with you.

737
00:53:29,848 --> 00:53:32,350
I love being with you.

738
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:47,866
I want to wake up
in the morning at your house...

739
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:50,368
instead of waking up
at my house going,

740
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:52,370
"I gotta get over to her house.
I miss her."

741
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,376
What do you think?

742
00:54:03,882 --> 00:54:05,383
Did you just ask to move in?

743
00:54:05,884 --> 00:54:07,886
Yes. I did.

744
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:16,394
So, hold on. Hold on. But...

745
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:19,898
I don't know which way the wind
is blowing with Cyrus.

746
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:22,400
And I don't know how he's feeling.
Yeah, of course.

747
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,402
I don't think that he knows
how he's feeling and--

748
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:27,405
Let's take it day by day...

749
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:30,909
for as long as we can go.

750
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:41,920
Okay.

751
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,922
Yeah, let's do this.

752
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:12,784
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

753
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:14,285
Right there.
Hmm?

754
00:55:14,285 --> 00:55:16,788
I'm taking you right there.

755
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:19,791
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?

756
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:26,297
I want to get fucked.
You're naughty.

757
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,300
Mm-hmm.

758
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,301
Hey, guys.

759
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:33,304
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

760
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:34,305
What the--

761
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,307
Hey, man.

762
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:37,308
Cy--

763
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:40,311
Sorry for interrupting you.
Good to see you.

764
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:42,313
Hi.
Yeah.

765
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:47,318
Uh, were you planning on
coming over?

766
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:48,820
We didn't get a message.

767
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,822
Just came home for a bit.

768
00:55:57,328 --> 00:56:00,832
That was, uh, bad timing
there, huh?

769
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:05,336
Can I have a hug?

770
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,340
Yeah.

771
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,342
Come here.

772
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,849
I went through something
really tough tonight.

773
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:21,853
Oh, baby.

774
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:23,354
What happened?

775
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:15,907
He wants to come back home.

776
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:18,910
Okay.

777
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:21,913
He's been having
panic attacks.

778
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:24,415
Oh, no.

779
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:27,252
Hmm.

780
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,758
The weird thing is,
it was his decision, you know?

781
00:57:33,758 --> 00:57:35,760
He is an adult and--
I mean--

782
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,262
But these
are panic attacks,

783
00:57:37,262 --> 00:57:39,764
and that doesn't have anything
to do with being an adult or not.

784
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:41,266
Yeah.
An adult, that's--

785
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,268
No. I know, I know.

786
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:45,770
Yep.

787
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:48,273
Ohh.

788
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,278
Do you mind if
I go talk to him?

789
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:09,294
Hey.

790
00:58:13,298 --> 00:58:15,300
You can relax.
It's just me.

791
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,303
I'm sorry?

792
00:58:49,334 --> 00:58:51,336
We should talk.

793
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:04,349
What the fuck are you doing
with all your shit in my room?

794
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:09,354
Oh, you're going to stop
bullshitting now? This is good.

795
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:12,357
You know,
I was gonna come back.

796
00:59:12,857 --> 00:59:15,360
I was gonna apologize
to you both.

797
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,863
But after this shit you just pulled?
You just fucked yourself, John.

798
00:59:19,364 --> 00:59:21,366
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hide my belt now?

799
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:24,369
You gonna light a bag of shit
on fire in front of my door?

800
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:25,870
You are out of your league.

801
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,872
I will do whatever it takes.
Listen to yourself.

802
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:30,375
What do you think your mom would
say if she could hear you right now?

803
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,377
Who's going to
tell her? You?

804
00:59:32,877 --> 00:59:34,379
Who do you think
she's gonna believe?

805
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:37,882
Her son, who needs her now more than
ever after his battle with panic and anxiety,

806
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:41,386
or this new guy who clearly
wants her kid out of the way?

807
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,888
You listen to me,
you little weirdo.

808
00:59:43,888 --> 00:59:47,392
If you want to mess with me,
I'm gonna mess with you right back.

809
00:59:48,393 --> 00:59:49,394
Oh, buddy.

810
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:55,099
Everything okay?

811
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,601
Yeah.

812
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,102
I was feeling
a little panicky.

813
00:59:58,603 --> 01:00:03,107
I was talking to John about how happy
I am to be around you guys right now.

814
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:07,111
The thought of going back
to that house...

815
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:10,615
makes me all...

816
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:12,116
fluttery and nauseous.

817
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:15,620
You don't have to
go back there, sweetie.

818
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:21,125
You know, um,

819
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:26,130
I've never told anybody
this before, but, uh,

820
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:29,634
I used to get
anxiety attacks.

821
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:31,636
You did?
Yeah.

822
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:33,638
So I know how scary
they can be.

823
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:37,141
Wow. Did you have a good
family to help you get through it?

824
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:38,643
You know, I didn't.

825
01:00:38,643 --> 01:00:40,645
I couldn't imagine
going through this alone.

826
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:42,146
Yeah, but I did.

827
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:45,650
It was terrifying.
I didn't know what was going on.

828
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,652
They didn't even call them
anxiety attacks back then.

829
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:50,154
I just thought
I was going crazy.

830
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:52,156
I almost left college.

831
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:54,659
But I decided to tough it out.

832
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:57,662
And that decision
made me who I am.

833
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:01,666
This could be that
moment in your life.

834
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:04,168
Where you go from
being a boy to being a man,

835
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:07,672
and you say, "You know what?
You're not gonna beat me."

836
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:14,679
- Do you guys not want me to come home?
- No.

837
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,684
'Cause if so, just say so,
and I'll totally find another place.

838
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:23,187
I'll figure something out.
That's not what he's saying, Cyrus.

839
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:27,191
No. Not at all.
I'm not saying that.

840
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:29,193
Look.

841
01:01:29,193 --> 01:01:31,195
You know what
the right decision is.

842
01:01:33,698 --> 01:01:37,201
You know in your heart
what the right thing to do is.

843
01:01:39,203 --> 01:01:40,705
When I looked in my heart,

844
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:43,708
I decided that it--

845
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,711
I decided that
coming back here...

846
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:49,714
was not defeat,

847
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:52,717
but, in a way,
like a weird victory.

848
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:55,720
And if it's okay
with you, John,

849
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,222
I'd really like
to come back home.

850
01:02:07,732 --> 01:02:08,733
Okay.

851
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,235
Thank you, John.

852
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:13,738
You're an amazingly
selfless guy.

853
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,741
Thanks, buddy.

854
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:29,253
It's halftime.
Are you hungry, hon?

855
01:02:29,253 --> 01:02:31,756
I am so fucked.

856
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:33,257
Honey?

857
01:02:38,763 --> 01:02:41,265
I think it's time you just had a
conversation with these people--

858
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:42,767
You know,
all three of you.

859
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:45,770
I can't.
I can't do that. Why?

860
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,271
Because if I do,

861
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:50,274
it's just gonna be between me and him,
and she's gonna pick him, and that's it.

862
01:02:50,274 --> 01:02:52,777
I lose. I can't do that.

863
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:56,280
But you tell me
she's supersensitive,

864
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,284
and if you really love her,
then have the conversation with her.

865
01:03:00,284 --> 01:03:04,288
It doesn't, you know--
Just let the truth come out.

866
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:12,797
Good night.
Okay.

867
01:03:12,797 --> 01:03:15,299
I love you.
I love you.

868
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,302
Good night.
Good night.

869
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:20,805
Oh, um,

870
01:03:20,805 --> 01:03:24,308
I forgot to ask.
John, do you have an extra tie I could borrow?

871
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:26,310
A what?

872
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:29,814
A tie. I want to try and look
nice for the wedding tomorrow.

873
01:03:31,315 --> 01:03:33,317
Uh, yeah. I think I do.

874
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:38,823
I've got a bunch of ties,
so I'll find one for you, if you need it.

875
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:40,825
Thanks.
All right, good night.

876
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:54,839
Um, wow. I didn't know that Cyrus
was coming with to the wedding.

877
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,341
Oh.

878
01:03:58,342 --> 01:04:01,345
Yeah. Yeah. I-I--

879
01:04:01,345 --> 01:04:03,347
I-I know it's a lot,

880
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:07,852
but he's going through
a lot, so--

881
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:10,354
Yeah.
Okay?

882
01:04:10,354 --> 01:04:11,355
Okay.

883
01:04:12,857 --> 01:04:14,859
Um,

884
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:16,861
I don't know
how to put this.

885
01:04:20,364 --> 01:04:21,866
Uh,

886
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:25,369
do you ever feel like...

887
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:28,372
Cyrus is not being...

888
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:34,378
a hundred percent genuine?

889
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,381
How do you mean?
I don't know.

890
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:41,385
I know he's going through a lot,
and I'm not trying to deny that.

891
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:46,891
Um,

892
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:48,392
I mean, like--

893
01:04:48,392 --> 01:04:50,394
I'm sorry.
Spit it out.

894
01:04:50,394 --> 01:04:51,395
No. Uh--
You're just--

895
01:04:51,395 --> 01:04:54,899
He's behaving in a way
that I think...

896
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,902
is--

897
01:04:57,902 --> 01:04:59,403
um--

898
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:03,407
All right,
I don't know how else to--

899
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:06,410
I wasn't gonna tell you about this, but, whatever,
I'll show you.

900
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:17,922
My shoes were
in Cyrus's closet.

901
01:05:20,424 --> 01:05:21,926
Hidden.

902
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,434
So, what--
what does that really mean?

903
01:05:31,936 --> 01:05:33,437
I don't know.

904
01:05:33,437 --> 01:05:35,439
You know,
sometimes I think--

905
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:40,444
and I want to put
this exactly right--

906
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:43,948
he might be...

907
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:45,449
acting...

908
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:49,954
out...

909
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:51,956
with this behavior.

910
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,460
How long have you
felt like this?

911
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,963
Do I feel that way?
I don't know.

912
01:05:58,963 --> 01:06:03,968
I'm just unearthing things in
my own head right now. I just--

913
01:06:03,968 --> 01:06:06,971
You know what?
This is too important.

914
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,472
We should have Cyrus come in here.
No.

915
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:10,474
Let's talk about this.
No, no, no.

916
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:13,978
Trust me.
It will really put him on the spot.

917
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:16,480
He's having panic attacks.

918
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,983
We'll have a great time at the wedding.
Are you sure?

919
01:06:18,983 --> 01:06:21,986
Yeah. Yeah.

920
01:07:02,026 --> 01:07:03,527
Cyrus.

921
01:07:03,527 --> 01:07:05,029
Shh, shh, shh.

922
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:06,530
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

923
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,032
Cyrus. Shh.
It's me.

924
01:07:08,032 --> 01:07:09,533
Are you all right?
Am I all right?

925
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,535
Yeah.
What are you doing in my room?

926
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:13,537
I want to talk to you.

927
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,542
Listen, I know why you want to
come to the wedding tomorrow.

928
01:07:20,544 --> 01:07:25,049
This wedding is really,
really important to me.

929
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:30,054
And my ex-wife's feelings are really,
really important to me.

930
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:33,557
And I know we've been messing
around with each other,

931
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:38,062
and it would be a great time for you to
mess things up for me and your mom.

932
01:07:38,062 --> 01:07:39,563
I agree.

933
01:07:39,563 --> 01:07:41,565
But here's the thing.

934
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:45,569
Do you know what it feels like
to be knocked unconscious?

935
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:50,074
Because if I sense for one second
that anything weird is going on,

936
01:07:50,074 --> 01:07:54,578
or you're even thinking of pulling some shit,
I will knock you out.

937
01:07:55,579 --> 01:07:57,081
Do you understand?

938
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:01,585
Yeah.
Good.

939
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:04,088
Then let's have a great time
at the wedding tomorrow, okay?

940
01:08:37,087 --> 01:08:39,089
How you doing, Roger?
Good. Good. You look great.

941
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:40,090
Thank you.

942
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:50,601
Um,

943
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:53,103
you know this is a big day
for John, right?

944
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:55,105
Yes.

945
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:00,110
Okay.

946
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,620
I choose you to be mine.

947
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,122
To live with you
and laugh with you.

948
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:17,628
To stand by your side
and sleep in your arms.

949
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:24,134
To be joy to your heart
and food for your soul.

950
01:09:24,134 --> 01:09:27,137
To bring out the best
in you always.

951
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:34,144
Jamie and Tim,
please join hands and repeat after me.

952
01:09:35,145 --> 01:09:38,148
I, Jamie, take you, Tim--

953
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,150
I, Jamie,
take you, Tim--

954
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:43,153
to be my lawfully
wedded husband--

955
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:45,155
to be
my lawfully wedded husband--

956
01:09:45,155 --> 01:09:47,157
to have and to hold--

957
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:49,159
to have
and to hold--

958
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:51,161
to love and to cherish--

959
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:53,163
to love
and to cherish--

960
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,189
John. John.
Yeah.

961
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:18,415
Oh, I'm in here.

962
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:24,922
What?

963
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:31,929
Cyrus, are you drunk?

964
01:11:32,429 --> 01:11:33,931
What happened?
How did you get drunk so fast?

965
01:11:34,431 --> 01:11:37,935
I saw the way you
looked at her, John.

966
01:11:37,935 --> 01:11:41,939
You can't marry her.
You'll never, ever marry her ever.

967
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,941
Listen to me.

968
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:45,943
Before you embarrass yourself,

969
01:11:45,943 --> 01:11:48,946
let me call you a cab and send you home,
'cause you're drunk.

970
01:11:48,946 --> 01:11:50,447
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay away from my mother.

971
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:52,950
What'd I warn you
about last night?

972
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,953
Don't you do this to me!
She's all I have! Don't marry her!

973
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:58,455
Knock it off!
You're not gonna take her away from me!

974
01:11:58,455 --> 01:12:00,958
Calm the fuck down!
You'll never fucking punch me, John!

975
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,460
- Get your shit together!
- Just leave us the fuck alone!

976
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,963
Fuck you!
She's all I fucking have!

977
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:08,966
Go, John!
Go! Just go away!

978
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:11,468
- Just go away and leave us the fuck alone!
- Put some water on your face!

979
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:12,970
Stop it!
Leave us alone!

980
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,471
You stop it!
Stop it!

981
01:12:14,972 --> 01:12:16,473
What are you doing? Hey!

982
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:18,475
Hey! Hey!
I'm not doing anything!

983
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:19,977
What, are you
out of your mind?

984
01:12:19,977 --> 01:12:21,979
You stop it!
He hit me.

985
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:24,481
- Did you hit him?
- He attacked me in the bathroom!

986
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:26,483
Did you hit him?

987
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:28,485
He hit me.
John!

988
01:12:42,499 --> 01:12:44,501
Open your eyes, Molly.

989
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:36,220
He went crazy in the bathroom.

990
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,222
Well, I didn't see
that part.

991
01:13:38,222 --> 01:13:41,225
I didn't even know that happened.
So, what did you think?

992
01:13:41,225 --> 01:13:43,727
Did you think that I suddenly-- I wasn't thinking.

993
01:13:44,228 --> 01:13:46,230
tackled Cyrus
and was beating him up?

994
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,733
- How could you think that about me?
- I just reacted.

995
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:53,237
I just saw my son
on the floor being hurt.

996
01:13:54,738 --> 01:13:57,741
From the moment
that I met you,

997
01:13:57,741 --> 01:14:02,746
as soon as your son became aware of it,
he made it his mission to split us up.

998
01:14:02,746 --> 01:14:05,749
Every step of the way,
every overture I made,

999
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:10,254
every time I tried to be understanding and
reach out to him, he's shut me down.

1000
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:11,755
He hates me, Molly.

1001
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:14,258
- He hates me.
- He's having a really tough time.

1002
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:15,759
He's not having a tough time.

1003
01:14:15,759 --> 01:14:17,261
Your son hates me.

1004
01:14:18,762 --> 01:14:21,765
And I gotta say,
I fucking hate him too.

1005
01:14:35,779 --> 01:14:37,781
Nothing here
between us that's...

1006
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:43,787
worth taking
another look at?

1007
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:46,290
You and I--

1008
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:48,792
We do have something.

1009
01:14:50,794 --> 01:14:52,796
And I know how rare it is,

1010
01:14:53,297 --> 01:14:55,299
because it's
been a long time...

1011
01:14:55,799 --> 01:14:59,303
since I had anyone
close to someone like you.

1012
01:15:01,305 --> 01:15:04,808
But I am not prepared...

1013
01:15:04,808 --> 01:15:08,312
to get deeper into it and
hoping it's gonna work out,

1014
01:15:08,312 --> 01:15:12,316
and then two years down the line
it's not gonna work out,

1015
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:14,818
and you guys have each other,

1016
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,323
and I'm alone again.

1017
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:23,827
I just think there's so much
here between us and--

1018
01:15:27,331 --> 01:15:30,334
He's gonna not--
He's gonna wreck it.

1019
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,842
So that's it.

1020
01:15:38,842 --> 01:15:40,344
I'm sorry.

1021
01:16:20,884 --> 01:16:23,387
I've been thinking
about us, and...

1022
01:16:25,389 --> 01:16:28,392
I feel like I've missed a few
things in our relationship.

1023
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:32,396
And I feel that
I've done you a disservice...

1024
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:36,400
with the way that I raised you,
in some aspects.

1025
01:16:42,406 --> 01:16:43,907
I'm so proud of...

1026
01:16:44,408 --> 01:16:46,410
who we are
and how close we are.

1027
01:16:48,412 --> 01:16:49,913
I don't think
there's any reason...

1028
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:52,416
to feel negatively about that.

1029
01:16:54,418 --> 01:16:56,920
The fact that you and I
have a hard time...

1030
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,922
letting another person...

1031
01:16:59,923 --> 01:17:02,426
hang out with us is...

1032
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:07,431
unhealthy for us, I feel.

1033
01:17:08,932 --> 01:17:11,435
I don't want you
to think that...

1034
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:17,441
I want you to be alone forever
or want you to be unhappy.

1035
01:17:18,942 --> 01:17:23,447
I want you to find somebody
and be with him.

1036
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:30,954
But I know in my heart
that John is not that person.

1037
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:39,463
There are things that are
happening from all sides of this.

1038
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:41,465
I-I--

1039
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:44,468
I know what happened
with the shoes.

1040
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:52,976
Who cares? It's shoes.

1041
01:17:52,976 --> 01:17:55,479
It's so stupid. It's shoes.
I don't care about shoes.

1042
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:02,986
But I care if
you're lying to me.

1043
01:18:07,991 --> 01:18:12,496
I used to feel like you and I had
a special little thing, and now...

1044
01:18:12,496 --> 01:18:14,998
I'm feeling like you...

1045
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:18,502
are letting me go away.

1046
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:26,009
No one will ever...

1047
01:18:26,009 --> 01:18:28,011
ever take your place.

1048
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:30,514
Ever.

1049
01:18:35,018 --> 01:18:37,020
Well, I'm happy he's gone.

1050
01:18:45,028 --> 01:18:47,030
I'm not happy right now.

1051
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:33,743
What do you want?

1052
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:38,748
I want you to come back
and live with us.

1053
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,752
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1054
01:19:43,753 --> 01:19:45,755
Come on,
just go home, Cyrus.

1055
01:19:45,755 --> 01:19:47,757
It's not the same anymore!
Oh, it's not the same?

1056
01:19:47,757 --> 01:19:49,259
No. She's depressed!
That's 'cause you fucked it up!

1057
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:51,761
She misses you, John!
I know you love her!

1058
01:19:51,761 --> 01:19:53,263
Yeah, I know!

1059
01:19:53,263 --> 01:19:55,765
We had a great thing,
and you fucked it up!

1060
01:19:56,266 --> 01:20:00,270
Please, John. Just hear me out and then
you can make the decision for yourself.

1061
01:20:01,271 --> 01:20:03,273
I'll move out.
I'll do whatever you want.

1062
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:05,775
Don't punish her
'cause I'm a fucked-up person.

1063
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:07,777
I-I-- It's--

1064
01:20:07,777 --> 01:20:10,280
It's not her fault.
No, it's not her fault!

1065
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,283
It's not her fault!
It's your fault!

1066
01:20:14,284 --> 01:20:18,288
So you just live with that,
you asshole!

1067
01:20:18,288 --> 01:20:22,792
It's your fault that I'm back
in a shitty apartment all alone!

1068
01:20:23,293 --> 01:20:26,296
You're a little fucking liar
and an asshole!

1069
01:20:26,296 --> 01:20:27,797
So fuck you!

1070
01:20:33,803 --> 01:20:35,305
Go away!

1071
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:45,815
Are you still out there?

1072
01:21:21,351 --> 01:21:22,852
Move over.

1073
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,872
Let me ask you something.

1074
01:21:44,874 --> 01:21:46,876
Were the panic attacks
real or fake?

1075
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,382
They were real at first,
and then...

1076
01:21:53,883 --> 01:21:56,886
sometimes I would fake them
to get sympathy from Molly.

1077
01:22:04,894 --> 01:22:06,896
I brought you something.

1078
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:11,401
It's mixed,
but it's not mastered.

1079
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:13,403
So it's not final.

1080
01:22:17,907 --> 01:22:21,911
I think I might be a really fucked-up
and dysfunctional person, John.

1081
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,422
You did some
fucked-up stuff.

1082
01:22:35,925 --> 01:22:37,927
But it's my fault too.

1083
01:22:44,934 --> 01:22:47,437
How'd you get through
all these panic attacks?

1084
01:22:52,942 --> 01:22:56,946
I'm sorry.
I never had panic attacks.

1085
01:22:57,947 --> 01:23:00,450
I made that up
to try to get rid of you.

1086
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,460
It was war at that point.

1087
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:13,463
I was desperate.
I had to come up with something.

1088
01:23:13,463 --> 01:23:15,465
You were boxing me out.

1089
01:23:23,973 --> 01:23:25,475
You're good, John.

1090
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:28,478
Well, you're good.

1091
01:23:33,983 --> 01:23:35,485
Would you mind--

1092
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:40,490
Would you mind
giving me a ride home?

1093
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:44,494
Okay. Is your mom home?

1094
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:47,497
No.

1095
01:23:47,497 --> 01:23:48,998
All right. 'Cause--

1096
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,503
I don't know. I'm just--

1097
01:23:53,503 --> 01:23:56,506
I'm really not ready
to talk to her yet.

1098
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:11,688
I'm just gonna drop you off
right here, if that's okay.

1099
01:24:11,688 --> 01:24:13,189
Yeah.

1100
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:22,198
Thanks for the ride.
No problem.

1101
01:24:49,726 --> 01:24:52,228
I have some of your stuff
in the garage that you left.

1102
01:24:52,228 --> 01:24:54,230
I'll go grab it.

1103
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,233
Right now?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

1104
01:26:16,512 --> 01:26:21,517
# # My love # #

1105
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:25,521
# # Please # #

1106
01:26:25,521 --> 01:26:30,026
# # Realize we're okay # #

1107
01:26:30,526 --> 01:26:35,531
# # Realize we're okay # #

1108
01:26:38,034 --> 01:26:43,539
# # I can't wait
to sleep tonight # #

1109
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:48,544
# # Will you be there # #

1110
01:26:48,544 --> 01:26:53,549
# # Will you be there # #

1111
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:59,555
# # My love # #

1112
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:05,061
# # Please

1113
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:37,093
# # I buried a bone # #

1114
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:41,597
# # And, darling
you don't know him # #

1115
01:27:41,597 --> 01:27:45,101
# # Darling, you don't know him #
#

1116
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:47,603
# # Darling, you don't know # #

1117
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:56,612
# # And just where you are
might be the right place # #

1118
01:27:56,612 --> 01:28:01,117
# # Might be that sweet space # #

1119
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:03,119
# # But you don't know # #

1120
01:28:05,621 --> 01:28:11,127
# # Look me in the head
I got nothin' on my mind # #

1121
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:18,634
# # I've been waitin' for you
all this time # #

1122
01:28:21,637 --> 01:28:27,643
# # And I seen a path
turn to an old road # #

1123
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:31,647
# # But the secret's too slow # #

1124
01:28:31,647 --> 01:28:34,650
# # Or we're too fast # #

1125
01:28:52,168 --> 01:28:57,173
# # Look me in the mouth
I got nothin' in my smile # #

1126
01:29:00,176 --> 01:29:04,680
# # I've been waitin' for you
You're just my style # #

1127
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:13,189
# # Look me in the gut
I got fear for my own name # #

1128
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:18,194
# # I'd dig it up for you # #

1129
01:29:19,695 --> 01:29:21,697
# # If you'd do the same # #

1130
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,702
# # I buried a bone # #

1131
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:30,706
# # And, darling
you don't know him # #

1132
01:29:31,207 --> 01:29:34,710

1133
01:29:35,211 --> 01:29:37,713
