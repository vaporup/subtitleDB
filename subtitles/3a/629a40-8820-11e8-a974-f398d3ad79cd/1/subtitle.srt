1
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,552
Quinn, Jack. Your final assignment
is classification red.

2
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,192
At 3:05 a truck with 32 kg. of
non-active plutonium was stolen -

3
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,115
- from an American installation
outside Croatia.

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,150
Stavros and his organization will
sell it to Iraq within 24 hours.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,235
Your objective is the safe return
of the plutonium to our base.

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,957
Out of the way!

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,476
Quinn's in! The XRT is mobile.

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,349
Quinn has 14 hours
to reach the border.

9
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,593
If he does make it,
his resignation is final.

10
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,516
Jack, would you get that?

11
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,994
Kathryn!
Your damn cow is in my way!

12
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,632
- It's not a cow, it's a swan.
- Whatever it is, it's in my way.

13
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,951
In your way?

14
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,032
- The swan is beautiful. So are you.
- Not for long.

15
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,033
You'll still be sexy.
A bit rounder, and a bit softer

16
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,230
- The baby, isn't it what we want?
- Of course.

17
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,950
Bonjour, Jack.

18
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,549
- You don't believe in front doors.
- You know all about back doors.

19
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,148
- How did you find me?
- We never lost you.

20
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,759
- Then you know I'm retired.
- How long can you watch the sunset?

21
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,151
You're a hunter. You miss the game.

22
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,031
You don't get it. For me, it's
personal. For you, it's politics.

23
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,116
Politics makes money, opportunity.
Everything's politics.

24
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,716
You want personal? Okay

25
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,273
Stavros is back.
We want him alive.

26
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,119
We want all his nasty information.
Names, escape routes. We need you.

27
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,717
You're the only guy who knows
how he works.

28
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,194
Come on. It's your last shot.
A Delta team is waiting in Antwerp.

29
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,115
Face it, Jack.
You can't retire until he does.

30
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:43,118
- Is Quinn coming back or not?
- If he's not, we go to plan B.

31
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,394
Move the seat up.
It's a little tight in the rear.

32
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,314
That's generally true of the CIA.

33
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,470
You bust drug cartels in Third World
countries and testify for Congress.

34
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,715
They make you a deputy director,
but you're just a minor leaguer.

35
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,228
You were only good for getting
Quinn back. It'll be challenging.

36
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,031
I left you a present.

37
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,074
Get me out! Help!

38
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
Don't tell me it's not dangerous.

39
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,832
That you're going to be back
in 36 hours.

40
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,473
I'm looking for Yaz.

41
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,832
I'm looking for Yaz.

42
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,676
I bet that hurt.

43
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,110
That hurt. These hurt.
But I like this one right here.

44
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,955
- Who are you?
- I'm the man.

45
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,353
Do you judge a person
by the way he looks? I hate that.

46
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,034
Who does your hair,
Siegfried or Roy?

47
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,354
The last who mocked my hair is still
pulling his head out of his ass.

48
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,433
I don't want to know
about your sex life.

49
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,436
- This has been fun. Who are you?
- Jack Quinn.

50
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,639
If you want to dance,
ask me nicely.

51
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,439
I just want to make sure it's you.

52
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,792
The legend walks. I heard
you dropped out of the game.

53
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,470
Santa's workshop!
Who's that, Rudolph?

54
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,795
- I have the best elves around.
- Christmas shopping for bad boys?

55
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,590
I don't play with the bad boys
any more, only the good guys.

56
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,437
What do you need? I got shit here
so new, [don't know I have it.

57
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,108
- Offence gets the glory.
- But defence wins the game.

58
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,958
I take cash, gold
Did you open that?

59
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,358
Fire in the hole!

60
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,757
But no cheques. And my rule is:
You break it, you bought it.

61
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,671
Gentlemen, this is Delta 1.
Forget you ever saw him.

62
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,996
Mr. Yamir here says Stavros will
surface tomorrow close to here.

63
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,193
An amusement park

64
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,516
- Who's my dead-eye?
- Me, sir.

65
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,439
Do you know how to use it?

66
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,835
It's rigged for tranquilizer darts.
Can you hit a man at 200 yards?

67
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,356
I can shoot
the dick off a hummingbird.

68
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,799
He's like a snake. Look in his eyes,
he'll get you in the back.

69
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,430
When we ID Stavros, move into
position. We only have one shot.

70
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,311
Two darts will kill a man.
Three, 3 rhino. We want him alive.

71
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,150
Delta 5, check the two women
by the carousel.

72
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,710
- Something's happening.
- We have Stavros. Grey Mercedes.

73
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,159
- We've got three men moving.
- Let them in.

74
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,598
2 and 5, move to Baker.
Others, hold.

75
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,152
This is way too easy.

76
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,759
He's in my sight.
Ready to fire.

77
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,717
That's not Stavros!

78
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,396
Stavros is a lefty!
It's not him!

79
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,076
- Find the driver!
- En route to ground positions.

80
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,272
- We're securing the exits.
- I got him.

81
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,233
The woman's hiding something.
It could be a bomb.

82
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,836
My God

83
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,916
- I'm locked on.
- 2 and 5 in position.

84
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,915
Ready to take him.
Why are we waiting, Delta 1?

85
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,879
Ready to move in.

86
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,360
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

87
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,477
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

88
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,515
- Clear out!
- Too late, clown boy.

89
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,749
Move to position 3.

90
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,320
His mother told me that his
favourite thing in the world -

91
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,873
- was riding his little pony
on the weekends.

92
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,594
He loved riding that pony.

93
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,553
That little horse
is going to miss my boy.

94
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,118
I'm a professional, Quinn.
I've killed. I've killed a lot.

95
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,954
But most of the bastards I killed
deserved to die.

96
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:51,071
My little boy was six years old.

97
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,274
Now that makes it personal, mister.

98
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,552
Candidate for Colony residency:

99
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,316
Quinn, Jack Paul. Born 1959.

100
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,631
Entered Foreign Service at 22.

101
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,397
Trained in demolition, tracking,
psychological countermeasures.

102
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,791
Specialty: Anti-terrorism.

103
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,839
Last assignment:
Stavros acquisition.

104
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,199
Video segment A- 19.
Antwerp interdiction.

105
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,196
Quinn achieved clear opportunity
to acquire Alpha, but Alpha escaped.

106
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,833
You went soft. But your skills
got you assigned to the Colony.

107
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,790
- No!
- You do have an alternative.

108
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,638
Nerve gas is painless and effective.
But you are already dead.

109
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:55,753
That's what your wife thinks. If you
wish to live, scan your thumbprint.

110
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,351
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, -

111
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,956
- 5, 4, 3, 2...

112
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,714
Identity confirmed.
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

113
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,839
Now, was that so bad?

114
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,636
Jack, glad you decided to join us.

115
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,156
- Alex Goldsmythe.
- The Tax Man.

116
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,350
- You were killed six years ago.
- It's been six years already?

117
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,750
Climb on.
Some friends want to meet you.

118
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,838
Gentlemen,
come and meet the famed Jack Quinn.

119
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,716
- Moishe Levant, died in Lebanon.
- Beirut.

120
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,434
- Everybody all ex-agents.
- Or ex-enemies.

121
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,832
We're too valuable to kill
and too dangerous to set free.

122
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,151
Welcome to the Colony.

123
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,278
- Quinn.
- Staal.

124
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,556
I understand.

125
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,350
This violence is not approved.

126
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,554
- I killed him in Tuzla.
- Apparently not well enough.

127
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,632
I really dislike that man.

128
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,955
You must wear this at all times.
It's part pager, part timer.

129
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,557
It tells you where to be.
When it signals, you must respond.

130
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,872
We're a think-tank. We're linked
to every law enforcement database.

131
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,114
We analyse terrorist incidents
and advise our client governments.

132
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,957
- and no one knows we exist.
What's on the menu for today?

133
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,753
A Global Air 747 en route
from San Francisco to Seoul.

134
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,191
We are interpreting signals
from the crash site.

135
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,270
Headset on.
Hand on the scanner at all times.

136
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,071
We have a feed coming in
from Washington.

137
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,238
I have a statement from the
Secretary on the Global Air tragedy.

138
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,916
Of the 176 passengers on board,
there are no survivors.

139
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,632
The CIA reports that the plane was
deliberately downed by North Korea.

140
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,716
The Secretary will brief you later
regarding the U. S. response.

141
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,637
The Koreans deny responsibility, and
the President consults his allies.

142
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,475
Jack, your worth is in your ability
to analyse data in times of crisis.

143
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,191
This is the Colony's
reason to exist.

144
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,153
The plane exploded from
internal malfunction. It's gone.

145
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,952
We've intercepted the transmission
of Global 277's voice recorder.

146
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,352
We've got unscheduled traffic
at heading 329

147
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,197
It's not a pleasant prospect,
the Koreans having that technology.

148
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,354
Anyone with an alternative?
Anyone?

149
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,470
Analysis confirms the report.
Moishe, do you buy it?

150
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,637
I'm not sure.

151
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,596
He's lying.
He's covering something up.

152
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,470
- They know something about it.
- Let's examine the images.

153
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,956
- Hold it.
- It's a shadow.

154
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,910
- Bingo. An AWACS.
- No, an F-4 Weasel.

155
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,792
- Include it in the simulation.
- It could've been hidden.

156
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,114
The Koreans pick up the F-4 on radar
but shoot down the passenger jet.

157
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,673
The U.S. used the jumbo as cover
for data recon on a weapons test.

158
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,152
They were set up so the Americans
could eavesdrop on a military base.

159
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,517
Nice call, Jack.

160
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,789
Underwater lasers.

161
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,954
One metre below the surface.
They destroy anything they contact.

162
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,795
If they don't get you,
the undertow will.

163
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,159
- No one ever escaped?
- No one.

164
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,678
A certain Bryce was the last to try.
Before the lasers were installed.

165
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,198
Poor fellow didn't survive 48 hours.
His "guardian" took care of him.

166
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,876
Each resident has a guardian,
without knowing who it is.

167
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,149
The guardian observes the resident's
attitude, behaviour and production.

168
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,359
If the resident escapes,
the guardian terminates him.

169
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:46,154
- How have you hidden this place?
- A masking device. We're invisible.

170
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,438
- Hello, Kathryn?
- Hello?

171
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,630
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No

172
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,669
This is Maria Trifioli
from the Galleria Luna in Rome.

173
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,872
We'd like to arrange an exhibition
of your sculptures. Surprised?

174
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,477
I'll send you a plane ticket
in the morning.

175
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,640
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

176
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,477
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

177
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,359
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.
Please remain in contact.

178
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,829
The lasers are disengaged.

179
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,872
Hi, I'm Maria Trifioli.
I'm glad you accepted our offer.

180
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,795
I'm very flattered.
But it would be so difficult

181
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,513
- You don't want to show your work?
- It's only four months since

182
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,390
Perhaps this will open a new chapter
in your life.

183
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,680
The problem is moving to Rome.
It's so expensive

184
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,757
Stay with us at the Regina. I'll see
that you and the baby are cared for.

185
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,037
Later you'll meet the gallery owner.
He's been waiting to meet you.

186
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,549
It's a typical Stavros operation,
and confirms our intelligence.

187
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,912
But who is paying for his talents?
We anxiously await your analysis.

188
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,592
Location: Barcelona. The Algerians
have flexed their muscles there.

189
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,595
They can't afford Stavros.
Maybe it's personal vengeance.

190
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,073
- Maybe Stavros is working alone.
- Why would he?

191
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,995
- Suppose it was a random act?
- Many groups are active in Spain.

192
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,230
- What do you think, Jack?
- No.

193
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,789
We await your comment.

194
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,880
It's not Stavros.
It's a copycat.

195
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,630
I also failed to get Stavros.
He's my last unpaid debt.

196
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,758
He's free, and I'm stuck here.

197
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,869
You were our last hope,
the last one good enough to get him.

198
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,472
- Does he know about this place?
- Maybe. That's why he's dangerous.

199
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,078
Agencies around the world
used him for difficult work.

200
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,199
When he was our ally, he was heroic.

201
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,559
Now he works for someone else, he's
a scalawag. He's out of fashion.

202
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:51,513
We've had to part with your swan.
I doubled the price.

203
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,759
My husband loved that swan.
He thought it was a cow.

204
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,992
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

205
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,514
5, 4, 3, 2

206
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,278
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

207
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,550
- Let's go!
- The lasers are down!

208
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,470
I need help with the cable.
Give me some slack. Pull!

209
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,916
- Got a parachute?
- Yes!

210
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,436
Fasten your seat belts.
We'll be landing soon.

211
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,157
Who is his guardian?

212
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,918
- Boo!
- I heard they made you disappear.

213
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,995
- I need merchandise.
- Sorry, I'm closed for the night.

214
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,076
You're open now.

215
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,391
Let's talk.

216
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,989
- I need some mean toys.
- You'll be the bad boy in the hood.

217
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:28,431
Check this out. Laser sight.
Automatic. You'll need a holster.

218
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,677
- These are nice
- Can you fly a plane?

219
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:40,155
Like a bird. But I stay on the
ground Gas grenades are on sale.

220
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,351
You paying cash ..? I just declared
a seven-day cooling-off period.

221
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,629
- You know I'm good for it.
- Dead men don't get credit.

222
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:04,398
You get three CIA account numbers.
I get the stuff, you get the codes.

223
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,876
When I look at you,
I see nothing but trouble

224
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,315
What the hell
I like trouble.

225
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,869
- A parachute?
- This is better than a parachute.

226
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:31,596
- Are you sure this works?
- Of course.

227
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,629
I'm positive it works.

228
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,351
If you die, you get a full refund.

229
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,630
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

230
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,632
What are you doing?

231
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,433
- Give me a hand.
- How about a foot?

232
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,074
- Let's try something else.
- That's love, baby.

233
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,993
Watch your hands.

234
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,516
That's what I call hang time.

235
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,197
What's wrong with you?
You're crazier than my hairstylist!

236
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,832
- Did you test it?
- I didn't need to, I built it!

237
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,676
- Maybe I'll give you the codes.
- What do you mean "maybe"?

238
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,872
- Trust me.
- Bite me!

239
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,074
Yes, Kathryn. I'm coming.

240
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,880
Your baby's due tomorrow.

241
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,474
Your baby's due tomorrow.

242
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:39,478
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

243
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,034
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

244
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,351
Your baby's due tomorrow.

245
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:56,153
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

246
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,555
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

247
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,110
Your baby's due tomorrow.

248
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,273
That's his heartbeat

249
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,911
Don't spoil the paint job.

250
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,278
Thanks.

251
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,709
I'm protecting my investment. But
this is too much. I want the codes.

252
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,155
- I need transportation to Rome.
- Transportation, you say?

253
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,517
I have some connections around here.

254
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,351
If they can make it, I can steal it.
We'll blend in, in this.

255
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,832
So that's why you're dressed
like a carrot with earrings.

256
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,913
Damn bicycles.
Get out of the way!

257
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,153
I have them. They're on
the autostrada to Rome.

258
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,472
That checks with our information.
Quin's wife is at the Regina.

259
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,757
Splendid!
We've got a game going.

260
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,231
- Anything for Jack Quinn?
- Si, signore. Right here.

261
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,831
This was waiting for you, Quinn.

262
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,714
It's not a bomb.
Maybe it's the access codes.

263
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,954
- I'd love to get paid.
- Those accounts are fronts. Empty.

264
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,597
That figures. Why are you lying?
I bet the Colony doesn't even exist!

265
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,429
- It's not about the Colony.
- What the hell is this?

266
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,799
A sonogram of my son.
Stavros has my boy.

267
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,034
You go back to Antwerp.
I'll get your money. I pay my debts.

268
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,559
Quinn. Keep your money.

269
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,879
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- What for? You always play defence.

270
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:05,473
It's time to get off the bench.
The best defence is offence, right?

271
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,552
Right.

272
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,950
If you send that e-mail, it'll be
intercepted by all the agencies.

273
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,910
- What's the plan?
- None. But Stavros doesn't know.

274
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,233
Quinn's clever.
A very sensitive man.

275
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,470
You're going to hospital.
You'll be safer there.

276
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,513
Here, sir. Look.

277
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,278
It's a circus.
Everybody's here.

278
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,958
There's the Mossad.
Some local boys, on the corner.

279
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,560
Even the carabinieri.
Holy cow, it's a full house!

280
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,759
- Pardon me!
- Keep moving, buddy!

281
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:04,078
- It seems your plan isn't working.
- Patience. He'll be here.

282
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,358
- If we need help, I have a brother.
- You have a brother?

283
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,193
Yes. In the Sancumini Chapel.

284
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,429
Quinn, no!
That's what he wants.

285
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,151
Kathryn!

286
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,279
No!

287
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,190
You know something, Jack?
I never break a promise.

288
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,596
I promise I'll send you
an invitation to the christening.

289
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,030
Actually,
I'm gonna take all three of you.

290
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,279
I got Stavros and Quinn!

291
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,677
Sniper on the roof!

292
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,992
- You're out of the game.
- You sure?

293
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,158
He's up
He's in!

294
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,637
That was a five-pointer.

295
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,872
- Where's Jack?
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

296
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,079
Who are you people?

297
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,630
Jack's coming. Take care of it.
He mustn't know what day it is.

298
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,476
Buonasera, Friar.
I'm looking for a guy named

299
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,471
- What are these walls?
- The bones of my brothers.

300
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,839
You are a friend of Brother Yaz.
He has done us many favours.

301
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,912
- What's up?
- What's up?

302
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:22,872
This is Brother Regulo and Brother
Ramulo. This is Brother Quinn.

303
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:35,357
The monks have gathered information
on Rome for 500 years. Cybermonks!

304
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,638
That prescription label you found?
He's tracing it.

305
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,793
Internet

306
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,080
27 doctors prescribed that
medication in the last few days.

307
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,078
- It's an outside signal.
- Is it going to crash?

308
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,711
Where in heaven did that come from?

309
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,718
May I?

310
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,718
Incoming message.

311
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,953
"Thanks for the blessing. Jack."

312
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,433
He's down here somewhere.

313
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,188
Man, these antiques
are worth a fortune!

314
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,591
In a spiritual sense.

315
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,676
We are now under the Tiber River,
going towards the Island of Tiberi.

316
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:07,312
- Under the bridge to the hospital.
- That's where Stavros' men will be?

317
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,996
- Good luck!
- Thank you, brothers.

318
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,550
- Catch you on the Internet!
- I'll wait for your e-mail.

319
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:26,035
Okay, push!
Like that! Push!

320
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,996
- It's stuck! But I have something.
- What do you have?

321
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,675
- What's that?
- My lucky coin, my lucky detonator.

322
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,758
- Semtex.
- That's it. Handier than duck tape.

323
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,596
Preparation, my friend!
You've got to have the right tools.

324
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:00,199
- Damn, not enough wire!
- Preparation, huh?

325
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,954
Hold on.

326
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,558
Let's find a rock.

327
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,953
You don't mind, do you?
It's for a good cause.

328
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,277
- Oops, airball!
- You need practice, man.

329
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,399
I hate practice.
But I never miss twice, brother.

330
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,917
My baby!

331
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,474
- He's on the island.
- Of course he is.

332
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:13,192
I need time. Give me 60 seconds.
Then kill both the women.

333
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,070
Up there.

334
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,278
Go, go, go!

335
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,670
Be careful.
You'll wind up in the hospital.

336
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,874
Did you hear something?
Up there!

337
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,594
- It's me! It's me.
- It's you, it's you.

338
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,673
This hospital is awfully quiet.

339
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,869
You take care of it.

340
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,197
They're over here
Go!

341
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,311
What are you doing just standing ..?

342
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,995
It's a hospital.
No running, please.

343
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,312
Quiet.

344
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,153
Let me help you down.

345
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,150
Jack?

346
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,791
What's going on?

347
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,236
No, Jack. She saved me.

348
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:43,671
- They said you were dead.
- It's okay. I'm here.

349
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,915
Stavros Where is he?

350
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,872
Where's our son?

351
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,638
- Where's my son?
- I know where they are.

352
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,672
You go get your boy.
I'll take care of her.

353
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,595
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

354
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,875
Get rid of it, or the party's over.

355
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,080
You know, Jack
I can call you Jack, can't I?

356
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:18,918
I bet there's not a night you can
close your eyes tight enough, -

357
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,676
- without seeing
my little boy's face.

358
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,230
I'll give you a chance
to save your son.

359
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,871
If you live,
you'll get to know your son.

360
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,558
And if you don't,
I'll raise him as my own.

361
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:45,068
Men are strong, Jack.
But the tiger is stronger.

362
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,109
Watch your step, Jack.

363
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:59,593
It's okay to step on a mine,
it's stepping off that counts.

364
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,314
Quinn!

365
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,713
Where did he come from?

366
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,513
Yaz!
The crosses, they're mines.

367
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,756
Don't go off and party without me.
I'll be back.

368
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,633
Got you!

369
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,272
Jack!

370
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,669
The baby's safe.
Let's get the hell out.

371
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,231
You take care of my son.
I'll take care of Stavros.

372
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,598
Lift your foot, my tall friend, and
that mine'll turn you to red paint.

373
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:53,114
You've got big feet, Mr. Quinn.
Be careful where you put them.

374
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:17,316
Looks like you're the bitch now,
Stavros. I forgot to tell you

375
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:23,316
You went to a lot of trouble
digging holes, putting up markers.

376
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:29,589
But I moved a couple of crosses.
Sorry!

377
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,833
Yaz, behind you!

378
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:51,997
- Where's my son?
- I'm looking! He was right here.

379
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,953
Is everybody okay?

380
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,079
It's me Daddy.

381
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,120
I want to remember
my Roman holiday.

382
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,070
Give me a souvenir.

383
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,712
Cut a piece of your hair.
And your shirt.

384
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,759
Quinn, you may like this.
A souvenir from me.

385
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:06,638
Maybe my coin will
be lucky for you, too.

386
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,152
I'm not giving you any of
my hair, Mr. Goldsmythe.

387
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,796
You are a magician, Mr. Yaz.

388
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:37,631
Now it's my turn to disappear.

389
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,957
They'll blame me for this.
I wonder what the fine will be?

390
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,591
