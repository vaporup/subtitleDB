1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,716
And tell Chi Hon to get me
a bowl of pigbone congee.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:06,392
Tell him to knock before he comes in.

3
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:13,193
Thief.

4
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,995
I am a thief, come catch me.

5
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:16,501
Crazy!

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,433
Tell the police to catch me...

7
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,306
What are you doing?

8
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:23,703
I want your purse.

9
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,708
Look, no one arrests me
even I robbed over ten purses.

10
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,908
What should I do?

11
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,716
Help! Rape!

12
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,621
Go to hell...

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,002
What are you looking at?

14
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,209
Sir, do you know where my master is?

15
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,609
Who is your master?

16
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:03,680
The King of Swindlers, Master Wong.

17
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:04,944
- Master Wong?
- Yes!

18
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:06,610
He just got released.

19
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:09,117
Master Wong.

20
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:11,825
I am leaving now,
take your time in there.

21
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:14,586
Come look for me again
when you are released. Take care.

22
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:17,760
No! Come save me.

23
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:21,230
Master Wong, come back.

24
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:25,697
Don't come any closer...

25
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:37,175
Master Wong... Help...

26
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,751
- Twenty thousands.
- I want it!

27
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:47,554
Aunt Six, what's the matter? Watch out!

28
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:49,123
One circle.

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,097
It should be fine.

30
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,096
I win. It's a big slam...

31
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,667
160 fold! Grandpa Sam.

32
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:58,564
Grandpa Sam...

33
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,903
Can you pay before you faint?

34
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:04,735
I need to use the bathroom.

35
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:06,105
Grandpa Sam...

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,338
So, ready?

37
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:08,981
- We are waiting for you.
- Let's go!

38
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,743
Three Kings, straight flush
in the middle and on the last row.

39
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,547
Three of a kind, full house
in the middle, four aces on the last row.

40
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:17,724
Three of a kind, full house of 4,
four sevens at the end.

41
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:24,063
One pair... Two pairs... Straight?

42
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,758
One pair, two pair and straight?

43
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,902
Yeah! You are dead!

44
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,003
Wait.

45
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,605
All straight.

46
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,870
All are straight. Pay up, 3 points each.

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,672
I am going to the bathroom.

48
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,447
Hurry. No one wants to be a dealer,
I will do it.

49
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:43,876
Hurry...

50
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,552
What should I deal first?

51
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:54,556
Wait. Pass.

52
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:57,655
Eleven.

53
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:12,912
What're you doing?

54
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:14,605
I need to use the bathroom.

55
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:18,244
Super Twins!

56
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,647
Come on...

57
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,014
- Come on...
- Come on.

58
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,497
You lose!

59
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:36,967
You don't have to win too much!

60
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,433
Sir, I just got out of jail.

61
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,836
- Let me win some money, OK.
- Honey.

62
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,802
I need to piss.

63
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,512
Honey, help Leung, he is very sad.

64
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,207
Stop wasting my time, OK?

65
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:54,313
Brother-in-law,
Leung suffered badly in jail.

66
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,015
How badly?

67
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,123
They are not human beings.

68
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:01,051
On my body,

69
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,823
they tattooed a nasty mark!

70
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,192
Did they rape you?

71
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,097
Five men held me down.
Six, seven people raped me.

72
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:10,767
Look.

73
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:12,164
Don't look, let's go.

74
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,704
Don't be like this.

75
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,304
Don't look, it's nasty.

76
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,777
Be strong. Let him see it.

77
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,581
Everybody come take a look.

78
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:22,773
Aunt Six, come on!

79
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,451
B boy, come take a look,
aunt will give you money.

80
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:26,984
Do you want to seek revenge?

81
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,453
Turn around!

82
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,387
"I love Ken Choi"

83
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,860
You like Ken Choi? What the hell?

84
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,024
So what? What's wrong with Ken Choi?

85
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,201
Nothing, he is quite handsome.

86
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:49,104
Yes, what is wrong with Ken Choi?
Nothing...

87
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:52,645
My god!

88
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,147
Honey.

89
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,947
Asshole! You hate Ferrari so much,

90
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,016
then train a student to kick his ass.

91
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:02,384
Save your breath. If I teach him,
it will at least take 20 to 30 years.

92
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,321
By then, Ferrari will be dead.

93
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:05,856
Then why don't you go challenge him?

94
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:06,651
Yes...

95
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:09,787
I'll come out from seclusion
but I need $10,000,000 as deposit.

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,397
I don't have that much.

97
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:14,125
You should have told me earlier.
Don't come any closer.

98
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:16,967
I do have some money.

99
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,096
I do have a little.

100
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,331
Show me.

101
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:28,681
Only a little.

102
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,445
You only have couple of dollars.

103
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:35,920
You lied to me, you have what it takes
to become a true swindler.

104
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,147
Really?

105
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:38,591
Am I handsome?

106
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,987
- Of course.
- What about you?

107
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,252
I am more handsome than you.

108
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,359
You lied to yourself.

109
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,465
You have to do that
to become a true swindler.

110
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:47,497
That's great.

111
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:50,363
Master Wong,
can you show me some of your skills?

112
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,130
Lick my shoe clean first.

113
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,167
Again?

114
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:10,948
I think I will teach you
a little bit then.

115
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:12,987
Thanks, Master Wong.

116
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:28,064
Yes, that kid has been in that house
for couple of days.

117
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:29,242
Who is he visiting?

118
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,478
I don't know! I heard that he's asking
a man to help him seek revenge.

119
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,882
There is a Master Wong
who is rather famous.

120
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,144
But I haven't seen him before.

121
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,810
What should I do, boss?

122
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:43,318
I don't want to see him.
Help me put him away.

123
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:52,492
You three, how can you
be representatives of Japan?

124
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:02,469
I'm predestinated to be an orphan,

125
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,103
that I will be alone for my whole life.

126
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:12,045
As a swindler, you now have
a strong force around you.

127
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,020
Faster.

128
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,526
This will do.

129
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,694
Ferrari will be scared
when he sees you like this.

130
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,022
Master,
this only can be used in the movies.

131
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:26,793
Can you teach me some practical tricks?

132
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,929
This is fast and powerful.

133
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,132
Don't get mad.

134
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:32,999
Master, please come out
from seclusion and help.

135
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:35,768
OK! $10,000,000 as deposit,
three month's prepayment.

136
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:39,139
Stop saying $10,000,000,
I only have a little money.

137
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,107
I don't think you have any money left.

138
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,441
I do before.

139
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,450
But on the way back,
you bought a pack of cigarette.

140
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,553
How do you know that?

141
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:49,349
You can't trick me.

142
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,816
So if I can trick you,

143
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,323
then I can ask you to do whatever I want?

144
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:53,686
Whatever you want!

145
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,485
- Will you come out from seclusion?
- OK!

146
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,493
You swear.

147
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,528
If you can trick me,
I will come out from seclusion.

148
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,167
OK.

149
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:22,379
Please don't...

150
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,457
Ma'am, haven't seen you for ages,
I don't know you've got big breasts.

151
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:28,692
Of course.

152
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:30,296
Kiss my nipple.

153
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,396
You kiss me too.

154
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,498
How come there is no reactions?

155
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:40,366
I think he is going to the kitchen
to get a knife to kill me.

156
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:58,825
Bastard, how dare you don't break in?

157
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,092
How come you are so calm?

158
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:08,201
Don't be silly,
you don't have big breasts.

159
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:11,826
- I do.
- You have little breast.

160
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,337
You scam!

161
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,997
I am clipped between,
please come and help.

162
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:53,673
You are so stupid!

163
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:57,610
Use your brain!

164
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:00,818
Leave, go home
and think of something better.

165
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:18,399
What? You think that you hire
couple of hitmen and it will do?

166
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:21,405
You only carry a hammer? Man,
put more money into your budget.

167
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,805
Right! At least get a toy gun!

168
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,340
It's real!

169
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:44,964
Get out.

170
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:07,115
Honey, are you OK? Honey, how are you?

171
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,685
I am OK!

172
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,552
Stop it, let's go.

173
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:11,691
Where?

174
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:15,386
Go back to Hong Kong. I'll go visit
Ferrari and seek revenge myself.

175
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:16,391
Yeah! It's great!

176
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,928
Honey, when we get to Hong Kong...

177
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,656
I will buy you a diamond ring
for your birthday.

178
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:20,924
Don't try to scare me.

179
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,865
You never buy me anything
which is worth more than $200.

180
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,834
Let's go.

181
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,439
I don't want it... Help.

182
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:31,700
Brother-in-law is right.
I want a diamond too.

183
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:34,438
Don't be so greedy, or you'll get crazy!

184
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,518
Don't get mad! It's just a joke.

185
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,445
Special news. Mr. Cheng Yat-tone,
a billionaire of Hong Kong,

186
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:45,648
and the famous merchant Mr. Ho Lin.

187
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,555
Both of them
have been missing for a week.

188
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,524
People suspect that
they might be kidnapped...

189
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:52,596
Your brother-in-law
recorded this part of the news.

190
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:53,859
He has watched it over a hundred times.

191
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,592
He wants me to watch it a hundred times
until he comes back.

192
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,396
And he wants me to tell him
what I think about this.

193
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,402
I can tell something mysterious.

194
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,540
Is there any lead to this case?

195
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,768
Confidential.

196
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,437
Did the police arrest any suspect?

197
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,513
Confidential.

198
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,978
I said, he is trying to play me.

199
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,813
Be patient.

200
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,978
May be in a couple of days,

201
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:17,955
he will teach you couple of his tricks.

202
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,158
Honey.

203
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,191
Pizza, have you seen your brother-in-law?

204
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,727
No! Isn't he with you?

205
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:26,731
Pizza, your brother-in-law
is acting stranger recently.

206
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,663
I think that he has damaged his brain
on that night.

207
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:29,962
What's wrong with him?

208
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:33,764
He bought me over ten diamond rings.

209
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:34,871
You...

210
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,010
So what, I am true to you.

211
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:41,513
While we were shopping,
he suddenly disappeared.

212
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,013
I thought he came back already.

213
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,285
Come to Ferrari's house at eight tonight.

214
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,448
It's Master Wong.

215
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,726
Mr. Lee, First Love is here.

216
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,289
Let her in.

217
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:58,257
Hello!

218
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,627
Sorry to let you wait!

219
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,564
Sit...

220
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,732
How come you have so many bodyguards?

221
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,037
Recently,
all my friends have been missing.

222
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,872
So I hired more bodyguards to protect me.

223
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,707
- Get out...
- Yes! Mr. Lee.

224
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:19,182
Have something to eat.

225
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:20,444
I am scared.

226
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:21,747
Don't worry!

227
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:25,153
After we finish singing,
we will go to my yacht.

228
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,327
Then we will go to the Lamma Island
and eat seafood, OK?

229
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,730
- I don't like seafood.
- Why?

230
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,363
I am allergic to it, look.

231
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,095
Allergy?

232
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,239
Take him back.

233
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,124
Boss.

234
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,632
So, have you finished Lee's job?

235
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,933
Done! But I met a person.

236
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,266
I wonder he's the one
Lon wasn't able to kill.

237
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,599
What does he look like?

238
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,574
Tall and thin, full of secret.

239
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:19,645
He looks nasty!

240
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:24,247
Miss, are you talking about me?

241
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,512
It's him, bring him back!

242
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,684
OK.

243
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,423
I don't think I know you.

244
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:32,386
Let me introduce myself.

245
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:34,958
I am Master Wong...

246
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:36,856
who has broken many girls' hearts.

247
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,926
Are you a bad guy or a good guy?

248
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:40,196
Bad guy!

249
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,361
If a man is not bad, girl won't like him.

250
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,630
You are right!

251
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,467
What do you want?

252
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,802
I want... to break your heart.

253
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,110
OK, get in the car then.

254
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:55,710
Your car is no good?
Why don't you get mine?

255
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,381
OK, whatever.

256
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,653
This is Master Wong, right?

257
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,099
Just by looking at you,
are you the Fat Dragon?

258
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:18,403
Thanks for flatting me.

259
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:20,868
Nice to meet you...

260
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,737
- My pleasure...
- The pleasure is all mine.

261
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,741
No, it's all mine.

262
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:27,540
Master Wong,
so what brings you to Hong Kong?

263
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,408
I came to learn from you.

264
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:31,684
You must be joking.

265
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:35,185
I am not joking.
I heard that you're great in gambling.

266
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:37,848
If you can teach me, I will be pleased.

267
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:42,953
So what do you want to learn?

268
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:44,423
Let's just play mahjong.

269
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:47,390
How do you want to play, Fat Dragon?

270
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,161
Taiwan style.

271
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:51,361
OK! $1,000,000 as ante,
$200,000 per fold.

272
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:54,931
Do you have that much money?

273
00:15:58,144 --> 00:15:59,907
A bank draft of $10,000,000.

274
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:02,341
I trust you.

275
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,543
How many rounds are we going to play? 32?

276
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:05,515
Well...

277
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:06,743
4 rounds?

278
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,252
One hand!

279
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:11,788
We only need one hand to get the winner,
OK, Fat Dragon?

280
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,190
Good, King of Swindlers, I'm amazed.

281
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,862
Go keep Master Wong company.

282
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,380
Tenth thousand.

283
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,419
Five bamboos.

284
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,229
Red Dragon.

285
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,559
Four of a kind.

286
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,371
Four of a kind again.

287
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:38,236
Four of a kind again.

288
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:48,979
Three bamboos.

289
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,258
It'll be a grand slam!

290
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,119
Don't do anything stupid.

291
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,887
Yes, I need to use the rest room,
excuse me.

292
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,905
He's a professional swindler and he'll
know that we've peeped at his dominos.

293
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:15,772
What is it?

294
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,711
Ghost!

295
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:22,944
Bitch! Did you peep at my domino?

296
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:33,456
So? Did you peep at my domino?

297
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,791
No.

298
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,598
Come...

299
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:45,239
You want this domino for sure.

300
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,370
Don't discard it if you are afraid.

301
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,546
I am afraid that
you will have no money to pay.

302
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,719
I win.

303
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:55,921
Thank you, it's a grand slam.

304
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:58,421
200 folds,
everybody pays $41,000,000 please.

305
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,952
You are the dealer,
you have to pay $200,000 more.

306
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,492
But forget it! Give it to your maids.

307
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:07,462
No wonder you are called
the King of Swindler.

308
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:11,025
Fat Dragon is really fat.

309
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:13,996
You want to mess with me?

310
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,171
Don't worry honey, I am here to save you.

311
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,840
You've got great skill...

312
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,609
How come they look like
they are very good friends?

313
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,648
Call me if you want to play again.

314
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:26,943
Don't worry, have my invitation now.

315
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:28,916
Let's just play poker this Saturday.

316
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:30,680
Really? What is the bet?

317
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:31,983
You won $120,000,000 today.

318
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,954
Then we have to go at least
$500,000,000 on Saturday.

319
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:35,060
OK.

320
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:36,695
Your brother-in-law
is hard to understand.

321
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,497
Sign this contract, if you don't come
you've to lose $500,000,000 too.

322
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,060
OK! Leung.

323
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,132
Coming.

324
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:44,736
- Sign it.
- OK.

325
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:47,568
Honey. I just won $120,000,000 tonight.

326
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,503
I will buy you couple more diamond rings.

327
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,938
I don't want it, what are you doing?

328
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:51,908
I am going to buy it.

329
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,104
Help... I don't want it.

330
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:58,009
I will never forget
what we have done tonight.

331
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:01,484
Ma'am, we didn't do anything.

332
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:05,188
Nothing? How dare you?

333
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,960
I am going to commit suicide.
I am going to jump.

334
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:10,357
You are having an affair with that woman!

335
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,690
Sister, don't be like this.

336
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:14,765
Brother-in-law,
will you say something please?

337
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,061
She wants to jump,
she really wants to jump.

338
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,636
Even a fool knows that
she is trying to mess up.

339
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,533
If she wants to believe it
then let her die.

340
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:23,199
After I won that $500,000,000,

341
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,467
I will go find some other girls.

342
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,669
No way, I am not going to jump.

343
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,477
Go get me some dessert.

344
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,343
Don't you dare have another woman.

345
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,386
You really think that
Ferrari will bet with me again?

346
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:36,918
I signed the contract already.

347
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,488
You signed it for me.

348
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:41,218
He let me do that
which means that is not real.

349
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,226
I also found out that
all the company under his name...

350
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:45,057
he sold 20,000 pieces
of dealings in future.

351
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:47,462
Three of the richest men in Hong Kong
have disappeared.

352
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,034
I think he must have kidnapped them,

353
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,227
to force the stock market to drop.

354
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:53,463
And use this advantage
to make tons of money.

355
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:55,636
He is a real good swindler.

356
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:58,006
He asked me to play on Saturday
because he wants a delay.

357
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:00,477
I will be trying to gather enough money
and thus leave him alone.

358
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,377
Then he will be making tons of money
in the stock market.

359
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:05,283
Should we call the police?

360
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:08,681
If we do,
those rich men will be in danger.

361
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,322
- What should we do?
- Yes!

362
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,125
Bill, after I put on this black suit,
pants and tie,

363
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:14,284
do I look like a gangster!

364
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,485
You are a gangster!

365
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,720
No way! I graduated
from Fukien University.

366
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,488
I can't find any work
so I came here to work.

367
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:20,529
Do you know how to read?

368
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,725
Yes! But if I dress like this,
will I get beaten up?

369
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,732
This... You can't avoid it.

370
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,031
No way?

371
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:28,574
"There is nobody behind the tree."

372
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,970
U graduate student, what does it say?

373
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,168
There is nobody behind the tree.

374
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,246
Idiot!

375
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,323
Boss, I just want to use your restroom.

376
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,549
You don't have to point
so many lazar guns at me.

377
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:53,661
Stupid! My boss told us
to burn down your house.

378
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,665
We know that you will be homeless.

379
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:58,566
So we have prepared
the presidential suite for you.

380
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,933
Take him there.

381
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,347
Uncle Lin, hello!

382
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:17,117
Brother Tone, nice to meet you.

383
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,224
Mr. Lee, long time no see.

384
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,622
How is the real estate business
doing recently?

385
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:23,955
Who are you?

386
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:26,860
I am like you guys,
I have been kidnapped.

387
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:30,059
We are not like you.

388
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:33,501
Each of us possesses
at least couple hundreds billions.

389
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:34,537
Do you have it?

390
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,837
After tomorrow night, you won't.

391
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,139
Today the stock market
dropped 3,000 points.

392
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,043
I'll sell everything
the day after tomorrow,

393
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,376
then I will gain couple hundred billions.

394
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,347
If I can get out.

395
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:48,713
I will talk so much shit about you
on my television station.

396
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:50,379
No one watches your station.

397
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:52,691
Give them their late night snacks.

398
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,124
No, we don't want it, help...

399
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,726
Why are you screaming?
You don't like late night snacks?

400
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,900
No! They gave us Viagra every meal.

401
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,764
We haven't eaten anything
for a long time.

402
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,166
What an evil man!

403
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:09,172
There're no cockroaches found in
these few days. We're starving to death.

404
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:10,400
I am very smart.

405
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,908
I caught a small crocodile
outside earlier.

406
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,137
I hide it inside my shirt.

407
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:15,473
It's a house lizard.

408
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:18,379
No, a crocodile is nutritious.

409
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:19,816
Give it to me...

410
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,510
No.

411
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:24,656
- I'll give you a million, give it to me.
- Really?

412
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:26,585
I will give you ten million.

413
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,987
Quiet! I will give you ten flats,

414
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,128
let me have it.

415
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:33,096
I'll give you ten better flats!

416
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,130
- Really?
- Yes.

417
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,131
Keep your words then.

418
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:36,633
I will give you my TV station.

419
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:38,828
I know you are very kind, right?

420
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:41,769
Right. Uncle Lin, you can have it.

421
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,880
Here comes the late night snacks.

422
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:54,117
How come it is not Viagra tonight?

423
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,152
Boss is worried about your health.

424
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,756
Very good!

425
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,555
It is better than abalone.

426
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:06,460
Forget it, you wanted it yourself.

427
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,726
You still owe me a TV station!

428
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,261
How dare you!
You will lose all your money.

429
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:13,634
Brother-in-law hasn't come home
for two days already,

430
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,434
should we go save him?

431
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,906
We have to play poker
with Ferrari tonight.

432
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:18,941
If we don't go,
we will lose $500,000,000 dollars too.

433
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,239
You signed the contract.

434
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:24,107
We are running out of time,
he must be captured.

435
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:25,581
I have to go save him.

436
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:27,214
How?

437
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,282
Gamble for your master.

438
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:30,750
No way!

439
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:32,915
Get up straight.

440
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:37,257
Brother Tone, don't cover it, come on.

441
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,564
OK, smile a little, ready.

442
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,830
Thanks,
you guys can put on your clothes now.

443
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:50,334
Mr. Lee, you lost 20 flats to me.

444
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:53,307
Mr. Tone, you lost 10 flats to me.

445
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,414
You are well known, don't try to run.

446
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:58,016
Uncle Lin, you lost in the contest of
who can pee farther.

447
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,808
No, you lost.

448
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:01,212
Sorry! I remember it wrong.

449
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:03,651
We will pay you,
you don't have to take pictures.

450
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:04,653
Are you trying to blackmail us?

451
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,951
How can you think of me that way?

452
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,118
It is faith that brought us together.

453
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,024
I just want to treasure this moment.

454
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:12,630
Please don't get me wrong.

455
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:14,299
Boss,

456
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,062
the stock market will be opened
at 3 or 4 thousand points,

457
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:19,604
you'll gain a fortune.

458
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:22,069
Why are you still going to bet with him?

459
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:25,837
Even if we don't have Master Wong
in our hands,

460
00:25:26,012 --> 00:25:28,981
just by using our secret weapon,

461
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:32,346
I will win his $500,000,000 for sure.
Why should I worry?

462
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:34,348
Boss, what is your secret weapon?

463
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:38,319
It's that DV machine and my glasses.

464
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:41,689
Fat Pig, use the DV machine
to look at my card.

465
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:43,192
Will it work from this far?

466
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,327
Wear this glasses and sit opposite to me.

467
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:46,498
Yes, boss!

468
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,146
Boss, you have a king.

469
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:03,777
It's awesome, boss!

470
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:05,083
Wearing this pair of glasses.

471
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,479
I can see any of his cards.

472
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,881
Why should I worry?

473
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,985
We have to play with him then.

474
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:12,381
Go get ready,
our guesses are almost here.

475
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:13,651
Yes! Boss!

476
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,233
Where is Master Wong?

477
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:34,634
Who?

478
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:37,538
You don't know? I come alone tonight.

479
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,037
Your hair is very pretty.

480
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,769
Stop sweet talking.

481
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:44,748
It's 7 o'clock right now.
We will play for three hours.

482
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:48,547
At 10 o'clock,
even if you lose one dollar,

483
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:49,914
you will lose all of your $500,000,000.

484
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,323
Where is the money?

485
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,923
Not your necklace. It's money, silly!

486
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,504
So much money...

487
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:08,400
I will talk to you later.

488
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,706
Master Wong's wife
and his sister-in-law is missing.

489
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,939
There must be a conspiracy,
go check it out.

490
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,341
Got you.

491
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:20,945
Can we begin?

492
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,178
I need to use the restroom.

493
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:26,719
What if I need to stool?

494
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:31,458
I think I will wait.

495
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,303
Deal it!

496
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:57,246
Damn! This house is so big,
how are we going to find him?

497
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:58,818
- You are right!
- Damn!

498
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,182
Somebody is over there.

499
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:02,091
Tonight Ferrari is gambling inside,

500
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,627
no one will stay in the garden.

501
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:06,257
Who said that?

502
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,491
Where are the rich men?

503
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:09,761
They are in the basement.

504
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:11,967
Why did you hit me?

505
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:13,638
You look like a gangster,

506
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:15,171
that's why I hit you.

507
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:16,274
Go the hell!

508
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:20,207
It'll be safe to get changed.

509
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:26,780
Let's bet small, $1,000.

510
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:29,020
Sorry! The rule state that
you must bet at least $100,000.

511
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,252
I heard that
you don't know how to gamble.

512
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:37,787
Don't try to show hand on every hand!
This won't work on me.

513
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:40,761
Don't worry,
I don't like to show hand this easily.

514
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:07,820
Up to you, let's go smaller. One million.

515
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:09,494
Quit.

516
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:12,828
What the hell? Too big for you?

517
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:22,832
Stop it!

518
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,884
Sister,
I heard the voice of brother-in-law!

519
00:30:35,788 --> 00:30:36,846
Honey.

520
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,851
- Who are you?
- A thief.

521
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,328
Honey.

522
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,797
Honey?

523
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:48,824
Honey.

524
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:50,068
What a coincidence?

525
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:51,531
Go find the key.

526
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:54,636
They are...

527
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,035
This is my wife,
this is my sister-in-law.

528
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:57,005
Interested?

529
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,270
My sister-in-law is worth ten flats of
"High Class" estates.

530
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:00,538
What about your wife?

531
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:01,408
Mr. Lee, because of you.

532
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,877
How about two flats?

533
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:05,309
One?

534
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,944
Just give me the down payment.

535
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:10,254
It's at his back.

536
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,750
Found it.

537
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,027
I've got the key.

538
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,193
You bitch!

539
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,767
Let's take care of her, sister.

540
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,145
Pick it up...

541
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,884
Bitches these days do know how to fight.

542
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:45,351
Woman, where are you from?

543
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,549
Shanghai.

544
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,423
Good, my dear sister!

545
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,259
Let's try to use the handkerchief.

546
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:55,524
Hurry.

547
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:06,706
Your Jack is bigger, go ahead.

548
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:08,642
- Pass.
- $500,000.

549
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:13,084
Quit.

550
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:17,680
Are you going to go?

551
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,848
No.

552
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,121
Are you going?

553
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:26,157
No...

554
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,169
You are not going to go?

555
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,737
No.

556
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:40,605
"No."

557
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:51,011
You didn't play every hand,
what the hell is wrong with you?

558
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,484
Do I have to play every hand?

559
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,683
I have to lose money too!

560
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,192
You know it is $100,000 a hand.

561
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:59,492
Boss, looks like
he is trying to waste time.

562
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,566
He's plenty to lose.

563
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,898
First Love has gone for too long,
go check on her.

564
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,435
If anything happens, then...

565
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:14,438
Does it hurt?

566
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:17,413
You two can't take the key from me.

567
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,948
You two can't beat me.

568
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,709
Just did a hole and die, OK?

569
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,928
Sister, hit her.

570
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,257
Let me show you my power.

571
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,331
Almost there...

572
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,175
You bitch, how dare you swallow the key?

573
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:47,878
Spit it out.

574
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:50,105
Or I will cut your stomach.

575
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,314
What do you want?

576
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:53,849
What do you want?

577
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:55,517
How did you escape?

578
00:33:55,654 --> 00:33:58,020
I can open this kind of lock
with a clipper.

579
00:33:58,223 --> 00:34:00,885
You should have told me earlier!
So I don't have to fight so hard.

580
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:01,993
Who told you to fight?

581
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:14,172
Leung is gambling for you.

582
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:20,371
India Garden, one flat, deal?

583
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,239
Two flats?

584
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:26,084
You pay the down payment,
I will pay the rest.

585
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:28,317
Smart-ass, keep fooling around.

586
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:29,420
I've had couple millions more than you.

587
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:30,748
At 10 o'clock
I will start to count your money.

588
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,550
Even you lose one dollar,
you will lose all your $500,000,000.

589
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:36,893
Don't mind me!
I have to go take a shower later.

590
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:38,860
It's still early.

591
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:41,624
It's 9:40 now.
The clock stopped by itself.

592
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:50,602
In 20 minutes you will lose
all of your $500,000,000.

593
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:58,576
Who are you? I haven't seen you before.

594
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:23,165
Every time I am in a hurry
you just have to be in my way.

595
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,244
Where are the old fools?

596
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:30,706
They left by taking a taxi.

597
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,078
You will be going home in a funeral car.

598
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:12,889
I have changed into woman's clothes,
no one will hit me.

599
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:22,660
I never seen woman this ugly before.

600
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:34,405
$10,000,000.

601
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:35,908
Mr. Leung, are you going to go?

602
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,944
Are you going to go?

603
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,050
Not big enough!

604
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:43,312
How big do you want?

605
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:47,816
At least $50,000,000.

606
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:50,788
OK, $50,000,000.

607
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:52,623
$50,000,000 then...

608
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:53,856
He will go!

609
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,067
- Master, sit down.
- Of course.

610
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:58,634
I will go with your $50,000,000. Card.

611
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,228
Master Wong, you can't play this hand.
It's him who is gambling.

612
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:03,534
Who said so?

613
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:04,700
I did!

614
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,374
Mr. Leung should go on with this game.

615
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:08,706
You're...

616
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:11,783
I'm the Chairman of the
International Gambling Association.

617
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:12,975
And...

618
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:15,619
- I've been the honored director...
- Enough!

619
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,289
Let's stop right now,
we'll gamble tomorrow.

620
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:19,219
OK.

621
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:20,620
If you leave now,

622
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,556
you will lose $500,000,000.

623
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:24,729
What the hell?

624
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:27,865
I have to play this hand?

625
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,432
Whose money is this?

626
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:33,629
Yours! I sold all your property.

627
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,097
Honey.

628
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:36,371
Master.

629
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,405
What should we do?

630
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:40,809
Play it, or I will lose my money.

631
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:44,006
Stop acting. Are you going or not?

632
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,979
Go! You can make it.

633
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,813
OK, I will go and I will show hand too.

634
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,182
It is only one hand.

635
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:52,590
Just a game, win or die.

636
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:15,008
His covered card is a King.

637
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,335
What is it?

638
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,877
My hand is bigger that yours. Card!

639
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:06,655
If you want to win,
unless you have all hearts.

640
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,197
Does he have a straight?

641
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,917
You can't make it, right?

642
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:38,358
I've got yours.

643
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:41,732
He doesn't have a straight.

644
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:44,264
You don't have a straight.

645
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:48,036
Kid, you learned from
the King of Swindlers for so long,

646
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:49,934
what have you got?

647
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,169
I have a pair of Ace,
let's see how you can beat me.

648
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:02,613
I have a pair of Ace too,

649
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:04,345
but my pair goes with a pair of queen.

650
00:40:04,422 --> 00:40:05,787
Your pair goes with a pair of 10.

651
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:07,552
Mine is bigger than yours, fat boy.

652
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:09,794
Very good...

653
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,164
No way, you cheated.

654
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:14,693
Your card is...

655
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,061
How come it is not a king?

656
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:19,636
That fat boy's eyes are very tired
after a whole night of work.

657
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,669
What he saw was not my card.

658
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,135
But my fingers.

659
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,104
Why should I go
if I don't have a pair of Ace?

660
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:27,211
You must be crazy!

661
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,851
I quit using
your technology two years ago.

662
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,048
You are out-dated.

663
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:42,489
Master, your trick worked.

664
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,087
Of course, he thought that
he would bet you for sure.

665
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:46,230
If not, why would he sit there...

666
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:47,726
and lose $500,000,000 to me?

667
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:49,628
What an idiot!

668
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:53,860
So what, I will give you $500,000,000.

669
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,973
But I will have 50 billion
early tomorrow morning.

670
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:57,503
I don't think so!

671
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:00,945
I tell you the truth! Within 25 minutes,

672
00:41:01,146 --> 00:41:03,307
the HK stocks in London
raised 10,000 points...

673
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:04,777
because the billionaires...

674
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:08,216
and the government allied to push it up.

675
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:10,116
The reading is 16,000 points now.

676
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:11,313
You are lying.

677
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,483
Your fellows betrayed you
to buy in stocks too.

678
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:18,859
I think you'll lose 10 billions instead.

679
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,930
You assholes!

680
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,634
"Kick his butt!"

681
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:27,896
Move!

682
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,155
What is he doing?

683
00:41:45,357 --> 00:41:48,918
This is the long lost kung fu,
Fat Mantis?

684
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:50,821
Fat Mantis?

685
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:53,556
Isn't this move most powerful?

686
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:55,962
- It kills without blood.
- Yes!

687
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,379
Leung, you are good!

688
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:26,029
I wish my boss the Masked-man
will see this scene.

689
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:31,902
I won't disappoint you.

690
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:34,663
Leung, you can continue
to be an undercover.

691
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,804
No way!

692
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:37,737
I have $500,000,000 dollars now,

693
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:41,367
I will buy Pizza a big diamond and... OK?

694
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:43,674
You finally want to
buy me a diamond ring?

695
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:44,612
Of course!

696
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:47,411
No matter how deep my love is to you,
only a diamond can prove.

697
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:51,451
Honey, you give
all the $500,000,000 to Leung.

698
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:53,147
Don't worry.

699
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,452
I have to naked pictures of
the three richest men in Hong Kong,

700
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:57,254
I think it is worth more than 5 billion.

701
00:42:57,529 --> 00:43:00,498
Really? What do you mean?

702
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:02,192
It's all exposed.

703
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,668
Don't we still have 5 billion?

704
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:06,770
Honey...

705
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,973
You told me that you will buy
a huge diamond hill to me.

706
00:43:12,143 --> 00:43:13,610
We have been to Diamond Hill earlier.

707
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,608
We went to Wong Tai Sin too.
Do you want to go to Lok Fu?

708
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:18,611
Leung, you are mean!

709
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:23,912
Why are you so mad?

710
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:25,549
Look at my hand.

711
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:27,858
Where did you get your nails done?
It's very pretty.

712
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,825
You promised me to buy me a diamond ring.

713
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:36,159
How can I forget.

714
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:37,494
Turn around.

715
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:39,094
What?

716
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:41,797
This diamond shop belongs to you.

717
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:45,774
Everything here belongs to you.

718
00:43:45,877 --> 00:43:48,937
Made in London of the opera to the sky
from the boys to men.

719
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:51,115
Whatever.

720
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:53,579
Go pick it!
