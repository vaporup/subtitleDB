1
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:24,450
"Macau"

2
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,985
"Secretary of Judiciary
of the coloane jail"

3
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,710
Who is he?

4
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,713
He is Master Wong, he is a swindler.

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,246
He is very popular here.

6
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,711
He is greater than the Great Four.

7
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,852
His tips on horse races are always sharp.

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,315
I don't believe it!

9
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,251
My nickname is the Judge of the Casino.

10
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,520
No one dares to cheat in front of me.

11
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,087
- Give me an autograph.
- Enough, we'll continue tomorrow.

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,027
They said that you are a famous swindler.

13
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,637
It is a rumor, that's all.

14
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,298
You are really cocky!
Let me play a hand with you.

15
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,272
If you lose,
I get to give you ten punches a day.

16
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,140
And, for a whole year.

17
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,143
If I lose, you get to smoke free
for a whole year.

18
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,409
Very risky! Please don't!

19
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,584
What did you say?

20
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,310
What are the rules?

21
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,054
If you can find the Ace, you win.

22
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,394
Which one is Ace?

23
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,539
It's gambling anyway, let's bet more.

24
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,968
If I lose,
you get to hit me with a stick...

25
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,436
hundred times a day
for the whole next year.

26
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,737
If you lose, just let me hit you once
with the stick.

27
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,574
- OK.
- We have a deal!

28
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,845
This one... No.

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,279
This one... No!

30
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,015
This one must be Ace.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,756
Very good...

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,425
Give me the stick.

33
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,825
Awesome! Master Wong is great!

34
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,394
Forget it!
Do you think I dare to hit you?

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,037
Just give me a smoke, OK?

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,340
OK... Help yourself.

37
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,078
Thanks!

38
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,482
Master Wong, you are awesome...

39
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,708
The Masked-man calling Leung Fon...

40
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,071
Leung Fon is here, over.

41
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,769
What is the situation now in school?

42
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,208
Very quiet.

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,072
We're informed that the kidnappers...

44
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,380
will come to kidnap
the Billionaire Ho's daughter.

45
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,317
You have to protect her by all means.

46
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,684
Sir, don't worry!

47
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,421
Miss Ho will be safe under my protection.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,724
There are so many kinds of people.

49
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,764
Someone thinks that
because her family is rich...

50
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,229
then she can be proud to do
whatever she wants.

51
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,402
I hope she would be
dumped acid on her face.

52
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,536
Do you see that bitch with glasses
at the front row?

53
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,642
She always challenges me!

54
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,470
Take her to the bathroom
and teach her a lesson.

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,574
I am here to protect you only.

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,341
Please take care of your own problem.

57
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,539
I am not your hitman.

58
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,947
If anything happens to me,
are you going to be responsible?

59
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,923
If I were your dad,
I would have fed you shit.

60
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,081
Good!

61
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,992
Where is she?

62
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,138
Leung Fon, what are you doing?

63
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,175
We are trying to
get to know each other better.

64
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,642
Is this the proper way?

65
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,509
We are studying kung fu.

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,647
It hurts...

67
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,092
Why don't you quit school
and go start a career in Japan.

68
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,164
I will...

69
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,429
Out.

70
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,228
"I won't harrass
the female classmates anymore."

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,138
Sir, is something happen?

72
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,904
Emergency,
go up to the roof in one minute.

73
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,876
Remember, in one minute!

74
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,061
Sir, is something wrong?

75
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,462
Hurry down to the ground floor and check
if there're any ants on the floor.

76
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,465
Yes Sir.

77
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,708
Sir, there is no ant on the floor.

78
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,816
Go up to the roof and check
if there are any grasshoppers.

79
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,917
Yes Sir.

80
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:35,196
Sir, there are
lots of grasshoppers on the roof.

81
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,459
Dismiss.

82
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,669
Gentlemen.

83
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,332
Can you tell me how you know that
I am an undercover?

84
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,244
Look, a police acting as a student
to protect rich man's daughter.

85
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,045
Reporters again.

86
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,551
I have to improve my make-up skill.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,950
Let's go.

88
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,657
What?

89
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,871
Let her go.

90
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,068
What the hell? Why are you alright?

91
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,540
I was almost exhausted. But luckily...

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,312
I used Yes!

93
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,923
I've become very energetic. Very good.

94
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,326
Let her go.

95
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,935
Hurry...

96
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,237
Don't move.

97
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,202
Go...

98
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,809
Sir, do you want some herbal oil?

99
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,584
It's OK, I have bandaid.

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,913
That's better.

101
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,531
Gas?

102
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,771
The whole room is loaded with gas.
I dare you to shoot.

103
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,980
If I shoot,

104
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,618
the gun will generate sparks
which will start an explosion.

105
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,313
The whole room will explode.
What should I do?

106
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,092
I am scared to run the 4 x 100 relay.

107
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,286
Because I don't like to finish last.

108
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,193
Do you know
what our opponents scare the most?

109
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,757
What?

110
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,335
It's you! Your armpit stinks.

111
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,471
They are afraid to get close to you.

112
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,971
Luckily I carry around with me a box
of "Silencer" lemon tea.

113
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,348
Sir, I have successfully stopped Miss Ho
from being kidnapped.

114
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,894
Please don't send me to do this kind of
low-class undercover case again.

115
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,362
I have acted as lawyer, doctor, nurse...

116
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,231
Druggy, gangster, student...

117
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,871
Jacky Chan, Andy Lau, Leon Lai...

118
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,133
Even that scary old lady
Elizabeth Taylor.

119
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,571
I don't want to do
this kind of stupid case again.

120
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,840
We will discuss it
in my office tomorrow morning.

121
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,243
Sir, I have decided
not to take on easy jobs.

122
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,210
Look at me, I am gifted.

123
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,383
I should be carrying out
some very big case.

124
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,985
Just tell me everything
you don't like about me.

125
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,348
You want my hair to go straight,
and I'll follow your order.

126
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,081
But... Sir...

127
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,425
Sir, how come you don't seem happy?

128
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,553
You bastard have got some guts.

129
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,254
I will soon put down my gun
and kick his ass.

130
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,730
Wait for it.

131
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,935
My nickname is Masked-man.

132
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,171
Don't talk shit about me again.

133
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,245
Sir, if you don't let me
do something more challenging.

134
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,204
I am going to quit.

135
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,474
We will talk again
after you put away your things first.

136
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,920
Sir, no matter what,

137
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,646
you have to let me handle this big case.

138
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,791
I will get it done.

139
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,891
Sir, talk to me.

140
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,994
Crazy!

141
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,565
I know you are the Masked-man.
You are fooling me.

142
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,127
Sir, I have been a cop for seven years.

143
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,166
I am honest and smart.

144
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,304
I only have one girlfriend
for all these years.

145
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,164
I've never slept with a hooker before.

146
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,572
The only time I went to a massage place
because I was drunk.

147
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,608
I saw brother Kai Ying!

148
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,810
I am a super, good, and nice police.

149
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,145
Damn, tell me earlier that
you're not my boss.

150
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,448
You've dragged me to deep shit.

151
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,627
You guessed it right,
but you don't trust yourself.

152
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,690
How can you go against
the Swindler Ferrari?

153
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,363
Ferrari?

154
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,470
Yes, this cheater makes money
faster than Soros.

155
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,969
This cheater lies better than Clinton.

156
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,438
He is the Handsome Dragon Ferrari.

157
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,917
Recently he helps the foreigners
to crush the stock market.

158
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,580
He has a newspaper which always
harms Hong Kong's reputation.

159
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,715
He steals money from the stock market.
And sells pirate VCD too.

160
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,656
The worst thing is that...

161
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,523
he gets all the beautiful girls.

162
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,825
And leave the ugly ones for us.

163
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,059
He should be executed for this.

164
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,929
Sir, don't worry,

165
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,500
I will go catch him for you.

166
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,028
OK! You moved me. I will send you.

167
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,472
If you are successful,
you will be promoted.

168
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,034
Thank you, Sir.

169
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,852
Guess what I've bought for you?

170
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,517
Kentucky fried chicken!

171
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,855
I haven't seen you for two weeks.

172
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,887
Don't you try to trick me,
take off your mask.

173
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,089
What are you talking about?

174
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,192
- What are you doing? It hurts.
- I am hungry, anything to eat?

175
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,997
Yes...

176
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,565
Sorry, I thought you were my boss.

177
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,040
I have been in love with you
for seven years,

178
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,438
and you can't recognize me!

179
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,839
You're not get used to it, that's all.

180
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,043
Don't get mad! What's wrong?

181
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,375
My brother-in-law will celebrate
his birthday. You've to go with me.

182
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,254
I don't know
your brother-in-law that well.

183
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,616
You should at least go meet my sister.

184
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,651
We will see!
I have accepted a very important case.

185
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,119
What case?

186
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,689
Who is she?

187
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,967
I don't know! May be my boss.

188
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,765
See you tomorrow morning at 9
at the beach.

189
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,784
God is fair to me.

190
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,249
I was born to be an undercover.
With my handsome look and wisdom.

191
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,949
I finally get to go against
tough opponent like Ferrari.

192
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,658
In this beautiful morning.

193
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,693
I came to this beautiful beach.

194
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,100
Asshole... Leave.

195
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,547
Since the person I am supposed to meet
hasn't showed up yet.

196
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,120
So, I've decided to try water cycling.

197
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,804
This girl is so cute.

198
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,848
When I saw her,
I have a very fresh feeling.

199
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,845
It's like...

200
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,319
Sir, don't you know
how to use this machine?

201
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,219
Of course! You stupid!

202
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,792
It's my fault!
Please call an ambulance for me.

203
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,452
You are a trouble to me!

204
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,126
Hello.

205
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,878
Can I have your number?

206
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,449
Go.

207
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,185
Good bye.

208
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,633
"Fuck you."

209
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,438
You are smart.

210
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,039
Giving me your name is same as a curse.

211
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,437
What is your name?

212
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,301
My name is First Love.

213
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,141
First Love?

214
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,216
The name First Love is very sweet.

215
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,878
She reminds me of the feelings I had
when I was still a teenager.

216
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,889
Every man dreams about this... First love!

217
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,470
Fat boy! Want me to kill you
and barbecue with your body fat?

218
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,206
Brother Lon, someone is picking on me.

219
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,748
Are you trying to scare me?

220
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,216
You must be Leung!

221
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,713
Brother Lon? Are you the person
I am supposed to meet?

222
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,819
So you must be Handsome Dragon
Ferrari's assistant, Brother Lon.

223
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,288
You are very smart, fat boy.

224
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,327
My boss is over there.

225
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,229
Brother Ferrari.

226
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,633
You seem to be a useful person.
I will give you a good assignment.

227
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,969
I'll try all my best.

228
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,734
Go play with my son.

229
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,323
If you lose, you will have to
face cruel punishment.

230
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,591
Please tell me
what punishment I'll receive.

231
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,259
No! Someone will get killed.

232
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,395
Let's go!

233
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,527
Very lucky! Thank you, Brother Lon.

234
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,762
No problem.

235
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,669
My boss wants you
to beat up that fat boy.

236
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,706
He didn't do anything to me.
It's hard for me to hit him.

237
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,276
Are you going to do it?

238
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,504
Of course.

239
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,015
OK.

240
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,315
You hit my boss?

241
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,552
Forget it... Just give him a beating
for one or two hours.

242
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,993
Ferrari, why does he want to hurt you?

243
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,629
Ever since I fought for the woman
in the NT. for their legal rights,

244
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,531
many people started to hate me.

245
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,830
People try to assassinate me.

246
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,701
Luckily you have many good bodyguards.

247
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,239
Now I don't have enough money,
I can't hire any more bodyguard.

248
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,573
You have no money, but I have!
Is five million enough for you?

249
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,346
How can I use your money?

250
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,982
Don't worry about it.

251
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,482
Come to my office tomorrow
and pick up the check.

252
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,092
He is Ferrari, isn't he?

253
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,164
Yes! So we have to
finish this scene together.

254
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,223
Boss, what should we do with him?

255
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,138
Sorry!

256
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,049
You must be Leung!

257
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,450
Yes, Ferrari.

258
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,857
Follow me from now on.
Fat Pig will tell you what to do.

259
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,323
Thanks, Ferrari.

260
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,293
You get the night shift tonight.

261
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,741
This must be money saving gangsters.

262
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,411
Why do they turn off all lights so early!

263
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,409
Hope you all fall and die.

264
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,492
Miss First Love.

265
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,597
Shut up.

266
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,727
You are a nice girl,

267
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,735
you shouldn't come to
this kind of scary place.

268
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,232
I will leave after I download
the criminal records of Ferrari.

269
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,510
So many people hate him.

270
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,403
He tricked all my dad's money.

271
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,915
My whole family was destroyed by him.

272
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,083
You better shut up and stand aside.

273
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,685
Or I will kill you too.

274
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,217
Don't worry, take your time,
I will watch out for you.

275
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,823
Who is there?

276
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,051
I can't stay and watch you die,

277
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,421
I am a righteous gentleman.

278
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,789
Let me be your shield.

279
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,393
Don't move... I've got her.

280
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,895
I am going to catch you.

281
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,933
I've got her.

282
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,325
Take me as your hostage.

283
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,101
Don't move! Or I am going to kill him.

284
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,105
- No... Don't come after me.
- Don't move!

285
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,506
It's very dangerous, I am going to die.

286
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,506
Don't come after me.

287
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,754
Look...

288
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,823
Blood!

289
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,985
Are you scared?

290
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,755
A little bit...
I am not scared of that little blood.

291
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,751
Have you finished looking at my body?

292
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,685
Almost.

293
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,161
What can I help you?

294
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,999
Wipe off the blood for me.

295
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,568
I will help you to my room
and get some rest, OK?

296
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,267
After I going to your room with you,
you will say...

297
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,244
Can I sleep with you for a while, right?

298
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,084
If you need any help, just tell me.

299
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,651
I am going to your room
and get some rest.

300
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,849
If you dare to come in,

301
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,490
I will put out both of your eyes.

302
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,693
You are insane!
You have so many toilets in your room.

303
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,335
Even a gentleman like me
can't hold myself down.

304
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,842
Why do you come in the midnight?

305
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,038
I called you for a whole week
and you never answered my calls.

306
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,045
I am working right now. Don't mind me.

307
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,446
Guess what have I brought you?

308
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,882
Pizza Hut only sells pizza.
You are so stupid.

309
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,717
You said that women
don't have to be smart.

310
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:38,685
I like it...

311
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,289
Good night! Go home.

312
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,357
- What's the rush?
- Go home.

313
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,123
Let me sit for a while.

314
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,958
If you don't want to go home,

315
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,464
let's make love then?

316
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,693
No...

317
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,662
You still remember that tomorrow is
my brother-in-law's birthday...

318
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,168
and we have to go to Macau, right?

319
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,100
OK! I will go to Macau with you tomorrow.

320
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,608
Let's not have bored games in future.

321
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,609
Let's try S & M from now on...

322
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,509
Like making love with animals, OK?

323
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,044
- OK.
- Let's go buy the boat tickets now.

324
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,479
Let's go.

325
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,217
Wait... I will play with you later...
Be careful.

326
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,924
- Sister.
- Pizza.

327
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,126
He is my boyfriend, Leung Fon.

328
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,731
He looks smart.

329
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,530
Thanks! Come on, sit.

330
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,971
Uncle, uncle Yee, Aunt Seven.

331
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,006
This Pizza's boyfriend.

332
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,273
His hair is ugly, he is stupid as well...

333
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,038
He is poor, he is not civilized...

334
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,839
He is weak in bed.

335
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,848
But he is nice, right?

336
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,981
I am very straight forward,
come on... Let's play.

337
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,790
Don't get mad. You are a nice fellow.

338
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,223
I know.

339
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,727
Suddenly, I felt danger.

340
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,836
I felt a very strong force
rushing in from the door.

341
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,471
The force tells me that...

342
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,197
a very important person is coming in.

343
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:08,675
Awesome...

344
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,682
La-di-da.

345
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,287
Hubby.

346
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,824
- Honey.
- Hubby.

347
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,590
No.

348
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,335
I told you,

349
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,939
when my bodyguards
are standing next to me,

350
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,837
no one is allowed to get close to me.
Your memory is very bad.

351
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,604
Sorry, honey.

352
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,339
Yeah... Congratulation...

353
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,481
Sorry! Today is not my birthday.

354
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,879
Today is my father's death day.

355
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,087
My wife made a mistake. So everyone
doesn't have to be this happy.

356
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,748
But you don't have to be sad too.

357
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,984
My dad was an asshole when he was alive.

358
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,822
He robbed, killed and raped.

359
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,497
His death is good to the society.

360
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,562
That's good.

361
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,302
But... My dad loved me a lot.

362
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,233
He robbed the bank,

363
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,304
because he wanted to buy me a toy car.

364
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,772
He killed because that person said
I was not handsome.

365
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,505
He raped because I told him
I wanted a sister.

366
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,881
My dad was a great father.

367
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,315
Your brother-in-law is something.
They are all fooled by him.

368
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,356
Of course, he is a sw...

369
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,430
What? What is he?

370
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,692
He is the supervisor
of the Millennium Celebration.

371
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,865
I really miss you! Come on,
give me a kiss.

372
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,817
You improved a lot. Your kiss
made his tongue tie a knot.

373
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,878
Of course, you punk!

374
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,514
- Where is my best friend?
- Who?

375
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,385
The one who will protect me
until his death, Brother Five.

376
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,063
Brother Five? Did he come?

377
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,062
Hey,
you have lots of white hair recently.

378
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,216
Help...

379
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,648
Go help her!

380
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,321
Why didn't you go?

381
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,654
Stop...

382
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,757
"Stop"

383
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,368
He is Brother Five? How come he won't
stop when you tell him to?

384
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,073
Of course! He is brother Deaf.

385
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,105
He is deaf and he can't hear anything.

386
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,037
Good friend...

387
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,742
"How's your wife?"

388
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,377
I told you not to
talk about my wife again. No more.

389
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,650
The truth is, couple of days ago,

390
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,755
I went to the hospital
because of cystitis.

391
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,289
I've waited for a long time
but my wife didn't show up.

392
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,155
I only saw reporters.

393
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,490
They started to talk about my past,

394
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,765
I can't believe that my wife's
acting skill is better than mine.

395
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,233
Like the old saying
"The wife is living happily,"

396
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,837
"and the husband is working poorly."

397
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,633
Today, my body is very weak
and my wife is leaving me.

398
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,040
Now everybody say my son is handsome.

399
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,705
I'm suspecting that he is not my own son.
I am very poor!

400
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,917
Is your brother-in-law armless?

401
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,319
No!

402
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,354
How come the two persons next to him
are like they are connected to him?

403
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,716
And, it is very hot right now,

404
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,121
but he is wearing cheetah skin
on his neck.

405
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,760
Why does he dress so loudly?

406
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,496
I won! It's a big slam!

407
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,534
No big deal, 113 folds.

408
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,033
Are your kidding?

409
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,599
What is your brother-in-law?

410
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,605
You know that I hate swindler.

411
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,402
Right! I am a swindler.

412
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,480
9 out of 10 persons here are swindlers.

413
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,714
You must be Pizza's boyfriend?

414
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,910
Right! I am her man.

415
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,178
Your name is?

416
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,220
Fon! And yours?

417
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,755
Master Wong.

418
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
You must be that
famous Jinx in the casino.

419
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:21,328
You will cheat on anyone,
the best swindler alive, Master Wong.

420
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,891
Thank you! It's a flattering to me,
that's all.

421
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,435
You need people
to get the domino for you.

422
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,334
Who do you think you are, a king?

423
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,708
Master Wong is still
serving his sentence in jail.

424
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,242
Today, he is the boss,

425
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,847
he applied for two hours leave.

426
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,142
After dessert,
we will have to take him back.

427
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,614
But, no one can contact him.

428
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,087
So, he is a prisoner.

429
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,684
Fon...

430
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,451
I am talking, you shut up.

431
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,286
Don't worry! Since we are happy today.

432
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,985
Let's play cards.

433
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,389
I don't like to gamble.

434
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,622
Just for fun.

435
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,893
I will be the banker,
you get to pick the cards first.

436
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,932
If you win I will give you $100,000.

437
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,263
If you lose,

438
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,066
you have to kiss my woman.

439
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,040
OK! Let me see how good you really are.

440
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,279
Are you done?

441
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,310
Three Aces in front,
I win 3 points first.

442
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,518
Straight heart flush in the middle,
I win 10 more points.

443
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,649
Straight spade flush at the end.
I will 18 points.

444
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,857
Three 8s.

445
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,729
Straight flush in the middle
and on the last row.

446
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,166
I'm the winner!

447
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,533
No! You win with three Aces in front.
You win 3 points.

448
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,868
You beat me with an ace on the last row.
Which you'll win 5 more points.

449
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,443
For the middle row, we break even.

450
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,805
Spade beats heart.

451
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,743
No, the rules of this game
don't state that.

452
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,850
I am the dealer, so I win.

453
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,382
The middle row counts double.
So I have 10 points.

454
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,487
The final is 10 to 8.
I win you by 2 points.

455
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,326
Fine! I will kiss your women then.

456
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,858
Get my women.

457
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,594
- Hi!
- Honey.

458
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,929
Kiss me.

459
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,769
Brother Leung, go ahead.

460
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,870
Can I do something else?

461
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,206
Look at them, two of them are pregnant.

462
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,173
The one in the middle is like
she is lacking of oxygen.

463
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,180
Why don't we play again?

464
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,377
OK!

465
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,784
Get down on your knees
and lick my shoes clean.

466
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,288
Brother-in-law, please!

467
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,356
Young man, you are cocky!

468
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,862
It's better for me to teach you a lesson
than being tricked by outsiders.

469
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,357
I will lick it.

470
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,162
It sucks!

471
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,435
So?

472
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,071
If you can't do it, let's forget it.

473
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,343
It's sweet?

474
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,719
Silly! The spider web is marshmallow.

475
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,920
The little dots are candies. The shit...

476
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,530
That's really shit!

477
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,331
Asshole! You tricked me too?

478
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,204
Don't get mad!
They are playing with you, that's all.

479
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,801
Playing with me?

480
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,709
Don't let me see you in Hong Kong.

481
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,145
Don't come to Macau and look for me.

482
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,016
Wipe it off for me.

483
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,116
You are pushing that
rest of them into my mouth!

484
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,356
You can't beat my brother-in-law.

485
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,395
He wanted you to lick his shoe this time.

486
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,397
I don't know what he will want you
to lick next time.

487
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,737
Let me tell you,
he is going to pay for this.

488
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,701
Does my mouth still stink?

489
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,767
Let me tell you, in my whole life,

490
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,742
I hate swindler the most.

491
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,847
My brother-in-law is the best swindler!

492
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,245
Best? He is just a small potato!

493
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,715
If I can arrest Ferrari,

494
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,443
I will at least be promoted by two ranks.

495
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,487
Ferrari? My sister said that he is great.

496
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:06,783
How can you beat him?

497
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,858
Why can't I beat him?

498
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,960
I am a cop, I can do it.

499
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,496
You don't have to get so excited.

500
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,928
I am worried about you, that's all.

501
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,629
Why don't we do something together?

502
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,639
No.

503
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,942
You promised to do it with me
after we come back from Macau.

504
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,818
Use this again?

505
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,015
If I wear that,
I will lose all the feelings.

506
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,592
Yes. But are you going to
go buy it or not?

507
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,094
It's very late.

508
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,526
You are a man, you can do it.

509
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,561
I will try.

510
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,168
Call the adult channel,
and order that movie...

511
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,395
The... Bra.

512
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,701
The one which a black guy starring in it.

513
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,614
What the hell?
All the stores are closed already.

514
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,679
In the midnight, where can I buy condom?

515
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,561
Transparent film will do.

516
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:08,673
Hello! I have told her
the things between us.

517
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,314
What did you say?

518
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,512
Asshole!

519
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,947
You are wrong.

520
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,453
You are at me for telling her
the adultery between us?

521
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,559
I am mad at you for telling her
before we have sex.

522
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,623
You will have a chance.

523
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,865
But... You have to help me
go against Ferrari.

524
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,400
I want to! But I don't have any idea.

525
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,427
I do. If you can stand a little pain.

526
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,966
Can you give me some happiness first?

527
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,534
Some other day.

528
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,075
Give me a kiss first, OK?

529
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,578
Can you let me kick your dick?

530
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,473
You can clean it up.

531
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,776
Asshole.

532
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,778
Brother Sing, it's deal, OK?

533
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,353
I am counting on you.

534
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,421
Don't go back tonight.

535
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,526
We will go play golf tomorrow.

536
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,189
OK.

537
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,629
Excuse me! Take Mr. Lee to rest.

538
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,600
Help yourself...

539
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,931
This way please.

540
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,506
Boss,
I finally captured the Spider Woman.

541
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,011
Didn't she kidnap you?

542
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:18,879
At first, yes!

543
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,982
But... She is a very stupid thief!

544
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,780
I acted like I was dead
and she believed me.

545
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,581
When she was not paying attention to me,
I pulled her hair.

546
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,557
And hit her chest hardly.
I learned monkey fist when I was a kid.

547
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,627
Trying to steal my computer files?
All you have to do is ask me.

548
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,163
Fat Pig, take her to my room.

549
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,931
Let me go...

550
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,508
Let me go...

551
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,609
Sir, I am Leung.

552
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,714
I am in Ferrari's house.
I am stealing his computer file.

553
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,387
Really?

554
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,318
I sacrificed a lot.

555
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,619
Call all the available units,

556
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,024
soldiers and whatever to come here.

557
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:05,891
If you come late,

558
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,359
my dream lover will get raped.

559
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,328
If that happens, I will be very sad.

560
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,935
I will become very Ionely.

561
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,730
OK! I will not put on my mask then.

562
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:15,770
OK.

563
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,703
First Love...

564
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,004
Don't come any closer.

565
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,944
Fat ass!
How dare you touch my First Love.

566
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,588
I have to kill you asshole!

567
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,033
Who hit me?

568
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,063
Who are you?

569
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,731
Who are you?

570
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,506
- It hurts?
- Who is she?

571
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,577
She is my wife! Who do you think she is?

572
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,072
First love?

573
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,049
Everybody treasures first love.

574
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,610
How would your First Love be in my bed?
Asshole!

575
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,480
Sorry!

576
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,420
Sorry? Go to hell.

577
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,692
First love...

578
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,328
It is very cold in this house.

579
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,839
Are you my boss?

580
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,105
I told you I don't have time
to put on my mask.

581
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,875
I can find First Love.

582
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,944
I can't find my first love too!

583
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,981
This is life. Where is the evidence?

584
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,247
Do you have any warrant?

585
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,016
Where is my First Love?

586
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,284
What the hell are you talking about?

587
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,792
Who are you?

588
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,695
Police! Hong Kong police, Leung.

589
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,163
I am an undercover
who is sent to arrest this fat boy.

590
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,130
I want to see your superior.

591
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,702
I am. But I won't be responsible
for his mistake.

592
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,603
You don't know me? I am Mr. Lee.

593
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,436
I want to complain that
he abused violence.

594
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,670
He injured my eye.

595
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,312
And he illegally broke us apart...

596
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,073
when we were having sex.

597
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,582
What are you looking for?
I don't know him.

598
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,710
You don't know me?

599
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,718
I played with your fat son.

600
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,322
Four of them picked on me.

601
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,319
My son is not a fat boy.

602
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,020
What's going on, honey?

603
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,026
Take it easy! I can handle it.

604
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,892
Are you playing me?
Your wife is a Chinese.

605
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,330
We have a marriage certificate.

606
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,595
Sir, he is lying, I am innocent!

607
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,737
What kind of disk is this?

608
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,205
It contains nothing but computer virus.

609
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,936
It erased everything
we saved in the central computer.

610
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,083
The whole system became
a giant video game station.

611
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,453
Sir, I made a mistake.

612
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,955
That fat ass Ferrari tricked me.

613
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,491
We can't catch Ferrari now,

614
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,788
we can't even catch a fool.

615
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,123
We are on vacation from now on.

616
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,393
Yes! We have been working real hard
this couple of years.

617
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,696
Let's take a rest, OK?

618
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,472
Do you know what you should do?

619
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,440
I am the king of undercover cops.

620
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,873
Now I'm the king of scapegoats.

621
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,781
It's the real me! I didn't put on a mask.

622
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,912
Put down your ID
and your gun and take a vacation.

623
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,387
Get in the car.

624
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,167
Tell me, where did you go last night?

625
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,173
Do you know
I was very worried about you?

626
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,542
Because of you, I lost my job too.

627
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,545
Don't cry, what happened?

628
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,485
You don't understand me too.

629
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't hold me so tight.
I might lose control.

630
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,761
Do you like me?

631
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,927
Isn't this a little too straight forward?

632
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,745
- You pick on me.
- No.

633
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:53,946
You think I am a hooker?

634
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,152
No!

635
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,718
I know you won't. Wait for me.

636
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,274
My God, you suddenly give me
two girls with huge breasts.

637
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,935
I really can't take it.

638
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,207
I look very strong,

639
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:28,011
but I go to the bathroom
7-8 times a night.

640
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,451
I will give you one minute.

641
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,651
When I come out, I don't want you
to be wearing anything.

642
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,100
I've got the picture.

643
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,678
Group C, start interrupting the signal
to the TV station.

644
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,218
Forget about that asshole.

645
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,790
Let's play mahjong.

646
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,921
I won!

647
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,821
What a happiness!

648
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,832
Your boyfriend is strip dancing on TV.

649
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,831
No way?

650
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,566
It's him!

651
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,239
He's got a great body.

652
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,575
Let me see his ass.

653
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,287
What? Get to work?

654
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,598
Nice body!

655
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,483
That asshole does look like me.

656
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,457
You told me to take off my clothes,
but why are you still wearing yours?

657
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,192
Because...

658
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,846
Long Hair, Ken,
we have been friends for so long.

659
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:49,083
Tell me the truth.

660
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,091
After I put on this hat and glasses,

661
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,922
can people still recognize me?

662
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,091
Long Hair.

663
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,224
No...

664
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,828
Ken.

665
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,536
No...

666
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,635
Will it be better
if I put some mustache on?

667
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,005
OK! Even Pizza
won't recognize you, right?

668
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,303
Yes!

669
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,911
I decided to commit suicide.
I don't dare to see Pizza again.

670
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,487
But before I die, I have decided...

671
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,916
I am going to kill you both!

672
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,733
Don't mind me, I am useless.

673
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,701
Are you a man?

674
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,229
I am a man.

675
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,200
Everybody in Hong Kong knows that
I am a man.

676
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,273
But, I am a shithead.

677
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,371
You are going to give up like this?

678
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,805
If you give up,

679
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,013
you will be a fool forever!

680
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,074
You have to defeat
Ferrari and First Love.

681
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,115
Then you will become a true man again.

682
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,648
I can't beat them.

683
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,687
Only one person can help you.

684
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:54,586
Who?

685
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,817
My brother-in-law, Master Wong.

686
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,357
Don't worry about it,

687
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,395
everybody will lose once or twice.

688
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,623
When my life is heading downhill.

689
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,861
It's sweet that Pizza has forgiven me.

690
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,300
She even tells me to seek revenge.

691
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,869
So I've decided to listen to her
and go to Macau.

692
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,098
And go look for her brother-in-law.

693
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,576
What? You want me to teach him?

694
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,574
OK, tell him to come look for me.

695
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,648
In tomorrow's horse race,
bet on "Super" on the 2nd race?

696
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,545
Let me think. Can you go out first?

697
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,685
Yes!

698
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,953
Pinky, cancel the meeting at 2:30 today.
