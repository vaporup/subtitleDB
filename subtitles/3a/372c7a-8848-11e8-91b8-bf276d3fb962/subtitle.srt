1
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,162
Dragon Tiger Gate was founded...

2
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,131
by 2 kungfu masters:

3
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,770
Wong Jianglong and Wong Fuhu.

4
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,266
They promoted self-strengtheni ng. ..

5
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,334
to free people from oppression.

6
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,508
They even taught manial arts...

7
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,683
to street urchins.

8
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,477
The Gate thus became
the symbol of Justice.

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,380
While every youth
was eager to join the Gate...

10
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,694
Wong Fuhu's son,

11
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,726
Dragon,

12
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,058
decided to leave.

13
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,225
He was to part

14
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,266
with his baby brother,

15
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,200
Tiger.

16
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,211
Shibumi

17
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:33,051
Rosa, Ma Kun's been doing a good job.

18
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,687
I decide to continue our collaboration.

19
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,857
Give him the Lousha Plaque.

20
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,992
Ask him to keep up his work!

21
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:46,159
Remember, the Plaque
represents Lousha Gang.

22
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,229
I've given you the Lousha Plaque.

23
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,538
Don't let anything

24
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,710
happen to it.

25
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,943
I know. I'll do my best.

26
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,219
What a coincidence!

27
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,229
Still remember me?

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,293
- Xiao... - That's right!

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,364
So you still remember me!

30
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,874
Grade 5?

31
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,674
Not Grade 5! Grade 3!

32
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,280
Almost the same.

33
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,615
Not at all. What a poor memory!

34
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,549
Remember the fatso in our class?

35
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,248
Sure, the one who bawled all the time?

36
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,553
No, the one who wetted his pants!

37
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,026
Well, he bawled after
he wetted his pants!

38
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,735
I remember he liked pulling your plait!

39
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,596
It couldn't be! I had short hair then.

40
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,878
I remember you had long hair!

41
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,347
How can I forget I had short hair?

42
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,818
Like, would you forget
you're called Chan?

43
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,685
Look who has a poor memory?

44
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,485
I'm not Chan, Xiaowei!

45
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,367
I'm not Xiaowei!

46
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,807
- I'm sorry! - I'm sorry!

47
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,481
So what's your name?

48
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,751
Tiger Wong.

49
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,389
I'm Ma Xiaoling.

50
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,114
- Hey - Hey, Tiger!

51
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,182
Why so many people?

52
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,945
Ma Kun has reserved...

53
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,315
the whole upper floor.

54
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,581
Ma Kun?

55
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,984
The biggest kingpin in Hong Kong.

56
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,424
Those dudes in black are his dogs.

57
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,963
Some dudes in white are barging in!

58
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,637
They're the White Lions.
As powerful as Kun!

59
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,141
Black or white,

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,041
they're still bad guys!

61
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,009
Kun, so you got the Plaque again.

62
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,184
You have monopoly
over all smuggling gigs.

63
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,288
It takes juice to work with Lousha Gang.

64
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,429
You gotta work harder!

65
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,359
Juice? I got much more than you!

66
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,898
To hell with your gigs.

67
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,933
I want half of your cut!

68
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,866
You kiddin' or what?

69
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,073
Whoever has the Plaque

70
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,605
can get all the cut.

71
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,006
You want half? You outta your mind?

72
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,215
Nice food! It's pay-up time!

73
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,511
Mom!

74
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,586
How dare you welsh

75
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,586
on our debts?

76
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,849
Not that I don't wanna pay.
We're the victims!

77
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,526
We've paid a lot already!

78
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,686
Let them be. They are Kun's dogs!

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,428
Stay put! Master won't like it!

80
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,303
Shibumi gave me the Plaque.

81
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,698
Come get it if you dare!

82
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,374
Even if I let you go,

83
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,315
my boss Scaly won't!

84
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,617
Enjoying your food, huh?

85
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,289
Tiger!

86
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,796
Where's the Plaque?

87
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,395
Who are you?

88
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,074
Tiger Wong!

89
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,034
Find the Plaque...

90
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,644
or you can't leave!

91
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,525
I'll take sole responsibility
for what I've done!

92
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,265
Go down!

93
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,430
Let him go!

94
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,906
Why?

95
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,852
Gosh! Scaly has gone way out of hand!

96
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,158
All crap!

97
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,892
What you starin' at, Dragon Wong?

98
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,937
You wanna fight me one on one?

99
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,634
Why you let that kid

100
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,810
gojust now, Kun?

101
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,842
None of them were able to beat him.

102
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,139
And the White Lions were watching.

103
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,282
If Kun hadn't let him go...

104
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,609
the two gangs
could have started fighting.

105
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,115
What good would that do, you crazy dog?

106
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,286
Who cares about the White Lions?

107
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,148
You're just a bodyguard.

108
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,789
I could have taken him out on my own!

109
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,221
I'm good!

110
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,119
- Scaly...
- Come fight me one on one!

111
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,491
Scram!

112
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,298
You better watch out!

113
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,237
Why didn't you

114
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,999
go all the way...

115
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,904
when fighting the kid?

116
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,688
I will get you the Plaque back.

117
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,016
Stop eating!
Look how heavy the plaque is!

118
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,215
Why is the plaque with you?

119
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,224
I snatched it when you were fighting.

120
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,623
Hey! Let me see! Look!

121
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,559
We can fence it for some dough!

122
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,755
Sure can!

123
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,265
We can donate the money for charity.

124
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,060
Charity? What a waste!

125
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,637
So who's the boss today?

126
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,707
Tiger, of course!

127
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,705
Hey you guys!

128
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,377
Me again?

129
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,670
Come! In sum...

130
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,008
Tiger is virtuous and generous.
He's perfect!

131
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,844
Indeed! Cheers!

132
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,312
- Cheers! - Thanks!

133
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,123
Just dig in!

134
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,392
Pass me the whole plate!

135
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,221
The sushi today is so good! So delicious!

136
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,327
Two more orders please!

137
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,757
Hurry up!

138
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,590
Tiger is our boss today.

139
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,461
He'll start first.

140
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,263
Tiger, that's for you!

141
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,631
And this is for me!

142
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,802
Gimme the Plaque.

143
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,006
The plaque?

144
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,142
What plaque?

145
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,012
This one?

146
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,817
The plaque is your head!

147
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,546
You want this?

148
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,452
How much can you pay?

149
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,769
You weren't all that bad last time!

150
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,170
Dragon!

151
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,873
You got lost or what?

152
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,672
I come here to give you a hand!

153
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,406
I've put drugs in their wine!

154
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,084
I already got the Plaque.

155
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,980
I hate dirty tricks!

156
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,382
The plaque is ours.
They're having fun with it.

157
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,682
We got every right to beat them up.

158
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,092
What did you say before? Me dirty?

159
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,229
You dumbhead. Let me teach you a lesson!

160
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,658
Beat him up!

161
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,295
You dare to touch me?

162
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,871
Beat him up too!

163
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,568
You guys will need
an ambulance real soon!

164
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,277
I said beat him up!
Who you fightin' with?

165
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,689
Dragon Wong!

166
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,755
Didn't you say you're a good fighter?

167
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,006
Go in!

168
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,977
Beat the crap outta anyone you see!

169
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,787
I hate to be disturbed at my meals.

170
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,678
Your nunchaku sucks.

171
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,513
Better practice more!

172
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,121
Let's practice together sometimes!

173
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,067
You're welcome. Just couldn't stand them!

174
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,731
I'm Turbo.

175
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,462
Tiger.

176
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,039
Tiger?

177
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,768
A fierce name! Gotta split now!

178
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,507
You guys okay?

179
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,845
We're fine.

180
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,745
No blood was shed.

181
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,523
Hey, is that yours? I just found it.

182
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,193
Tiger!

183
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,527
Where's Dragon Tiger Gate?

184
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,180
Baldy, you snatched the plaque.

185
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,680
You better explain
to the Master yourself.

186
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,658
Stop staring. You can touch it.

187
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,238
I got this scar when I was a kid.

188
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,582
When I was at your age,

189
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,876
I already knew kungfu well.

190
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,177
Once I passed by
someone wielding his sword.

191
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,754
And there went this scar!

192
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,855
It's such a big golden plaque.

193
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,992
I had to snatch it.

194
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,719
Then this long-haired guy
asked me for it.

195
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,794
Of course I wouldn't give it to him.

196
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,056
So he beat us up.

197
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,733
He punched me and I parried...

198
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,424
like what you taught us.

199
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,399
And the rest is history.

200
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,435
We're really not to blame!

201
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,131
Indeed, Master! We're not to blame!

202
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,209
The plaque you snatched
is called Lousha Plaque.

203
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,446
It's the transaction permit

204
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,082
between Lousha Gang and Kun.

205
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,120
Lousha Gang is a crime organization.

206
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,951
You snatched their stuff...

207
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,024
and claimed you're innocent?

208
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,185
Get out and squat for 3 hours!

209
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,668
Would someone gimme a hand? I can't see!

210
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,701
3 hours already!

211
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,978
Uncle.

212
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,974
I saw my brother again.

213
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,448
He's Kun's man now.

214
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,520
So he's tied to Lousha Gang.

215
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,555
But I don't believe he's a bad guy.

216
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,923
Bring him back to the Gate.

217
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,798
Master,

218
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,799
I'm Turbo from overseas.

219
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,030
I was invincible in Chinatown...

220
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,606
But I know...

221
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,472
you're well versed in martial arts.

222
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,668
I wanna aggregate

223
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,405
the skills of all schools...

224
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,346
to manifest the spirits
of Chinese kungfu.

225
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,453
I'd therefore like to be your disciple.

226
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,588
I'll be your disciple no matter what!

227
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,503
You still here?

228
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,964
Wait!

229
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,866
I ain't gonna give up!

230
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,174
You're great in nunchaku.

231
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,213
Can you teach me?

232
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,612
I won't teach you.
But we can practice together.

233
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,952
Great!

234
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,358
Where's your nunchaku?

235
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,262
By the way, I'm also called the Judo Kid!

236
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,632
Come on!

237
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,574
Wow, excel lent footwork!

238
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,647
By the way, how you got that scar?

239
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,085
How you got that scar?

240
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,184
I can't hear you.

241
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,354
I said your scar...

242
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,958
I got the scar while practicing.

243
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,095
But the other guy is a limp now.

244
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,794
So be careful!

245
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,382
Dragon, Come over!

246
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,594
It's for Dad's safety.

247
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,962
Let's do it together.

248
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,899
Am I not good enough...

249
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,697
to protect you?

250
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,636
Come fight me!

251
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,312
No way! I don't wanna kill you!

252
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,413
Then I'll die for sure

253
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,311
Better rely on yourself than on gods.

254
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,486
I won't let anything happen to you...

255
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,518
or your dad.

256
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,550
If Dad retired,

257
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,785
you wouldn't need to protect us.

258
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,294
We'd all be safe then.

259
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,229
Where would you go

260
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,405
if you could retire?

261
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,610
Take this one first.

262
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,406
I'll go get another one.

263
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,062
Mom, did Tiger's mom

264
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,732
take Dad away from us?

265
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,798
I hate them!

266
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,299
You shouldn't hate

267
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,563
any member of the Gate.

268
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,065
Dad and I separated

269
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,970
not because of them.

270
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,542
It's my own decision.

271
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,146
Dragon, come out! It's Tiger!

272
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,443
Go away! Don't come see me anymore!

273
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,951
I don't wanna see anyone
from the Gate ever!

274
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,214
Get lost!

275
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,532
Why you crying?

276
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,469
I'll beat you till you smile!

277
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,777
Stop! Stop!

278
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,757
Stop him. Don't let him run away.

279
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:36,950
Stop!

280
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,528
Still running, smart ass?

281
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,295
Wanna fight back?

282
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,059
What you guys want?

283
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,496
What?

284
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,795
Beat him up!

285
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,131
Take his slipper!

286
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,538
Don't come back to this park again!

287
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,542
Let's go!

288
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,759
Hurry up, Tiger!

289
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,858
Okay. I'm coming!

290
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,903
Let me give you my slipper,

291
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,539
or your mom will yell at you.

292
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,800
What about your mom?

293
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,068
It won't be a problem.

294
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,869
Thanks!

295
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,278
You don't wanna know
why I was in a fight?

296
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,622
'Cos I know Dragon is a man ofjustice.

297
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,380
Unless they're in the wrong,

298
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,922
you wouldn't have picked a fight.

299
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,857
They were bullying Tiger.

300
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,699
So I fought with them.

301
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,772
Carry this jade pendant with you.

302
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,642
You're a member of the Gate
wherever you go.

303
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,844
You'll make it big in the future.

304
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,188
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

305
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,224
Don't ever commit a crime.

306
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,149
Your life...

307
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,989
will be fraught with frustrations.

308
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,435
Never give up

309
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,696
however difficult life will become.

310
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,170
You'll know when you grow up.

311
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,980
Come!

312
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,214
When will I make it big?

313
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,623
Dragon, your mom

314
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,826
hasn't come out yet!

315
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,335
Mom never came out.

316
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,208
She was never seen again.

317
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,341
It's lucky

318
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,544
I met Kun.

319
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,777
Out of gratitude,

320
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,048
I've done reluctant things for him.

321
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,490
I know I can't leave here...

322
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,086
I'm ashamed to go back
to the Gate ever again.

323
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,541
Dragon!

324
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,355
I'm your baby brother!

325
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,922
I know. So what?

326
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,290
Am I supposed to hug you
with tears in my eyes?

327
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:04,161
And you hug me and call me Bro?

328
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,970
Uncle and I want you back to the Gate.

329
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,672
Don't work for this bad guy Kun anymore!

330
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,550
So you're a good guy and I'm a bad guy.

331
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,108
Go back to the Gate

332
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,116
and play your good guy!

333
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,819
Chan!

334
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,623
I'm Tiger Wong.

335
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,427
You're no fun!

336
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,825
You and Dragon are tight?

337
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,597
He works for my dad.
I treat him like a brother.

338
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,465
You're his baby brother?

339
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,438
You don't look alike.

340
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,374
You guys are brothers.

341
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,907
Why you act like that?

342
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,580
That's why I wanna help him.

343
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,422
Good! Gimme your phone.

344
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,713
Listen. Hurry up!

345
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,017
- Hello. - Hello.

346
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,616
This is my number. Remember to call me!

347
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,294
Aren't you gonna help me?

348
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,299
Sure, but I didn't say now.

349
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,631
I'll call you when I find him. Bye.

350
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,728
Thanks for taking care
of Scaly and his dogs.

351
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,926
They've been nothing but trouble lately.

352
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,065
You can always quit.

353
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,065
Not so simple!

354
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,210
What's so hard?

355
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,616
I've been in this biz forever.

356
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,713
Xiaoling is my only worry.

357
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,848
I've taken you for my dad,

358
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,385
and Xiaoling my sis.

359
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,592
I won't let anything
bad happen to my folks.

360
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,631
I believe you.

361
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,533
Just sleep on it.

362
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,506
And you? Will you go back to the Gate?

363
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,405
Yes,

364
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,543
but it's not the right time yet.

365
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,378
I'll wait till you've retired.

366
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,383
Wanna get rid of me?

367
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,286
Yes. Give the Plaque back to Lousha Gang.

368
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,894
Nunchaku Slippers! Watch out!

369
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,046
Playing with slippers?

370
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,081
No more slippers for a month.

371
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,775
Take them all off!

372
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,663
You don't wanna teach me.

373
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,601
At least practice with me!

374
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,504
You're best at nunchaku?

375
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,712
Yes.

376
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:22,243
Please pick a weapon, Master!

377
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,079
You're clueless.

378
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,616
Worse than the kids.

379
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,050
You know nothing about nunchaku.

380
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,915
Come back when you know...

381
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:06,255
how to grasp a nunchaku.

382
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,391
I'm Turbo,

383
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,328
invincible in Chinatown.

384
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,028
You're clueless.

385
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,305
You know nothing nunchaku.

386
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,501
Come back when you know...

387
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,169
how to grasp a nunchaku.

388
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,331
I was always bullied as I grew up abroad.

389
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,800
I didn't like that.

390
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,807
So I slashed a scar on my face.

391
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,545
I wanna scare people off.

392
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,145
I learnt nunchaku

393
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,279
'cos it's fierce and powerful.

394
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,424
But today I was totally beaten.

395
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,824
I thought I had grasped it very hard...

396
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,224
but he took it from me so easily!

397
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,333
After a long struggle,

398
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,035
I finally realized...

399
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:03,341
it's not a matter of strength...

400
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,640
but of the heart.

401
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,412
I can't scare people...

402
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,279
with a scar on my face.

403
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,289
I won't tell my scar story anymore.

404
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,560
But I'll say...

405
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:28,131
Master Wong left
a slipper mark on my face.

406
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,438
I will keep it up.

407
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,980
Thanks!

408
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,852
Turbo!

409
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,169
You know how to do household chores?

410
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,772
I don't, but I will learn!

411
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,016
Kun wants to return
the Plaque and retire?

412
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,127
That's good news for you.

413
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,569
I'll arrange for you to join Lousha Gang.

414
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,431
That way... we can be together.

415
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,341
Why you staring at me?

416
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,943
I want you to understand...

417
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,213
I can make Shibumi
let you take Kun's place.

418
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,356
You can be your own boss finally!

419
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,029
I shouldn't have rescued you that day.

420
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,450
Listen up, Dragon!

421
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,815
Whether you join the Gang or not,

422
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,593
we ain't good guys.

423
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:54,908
We cannot change our fate.

424
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,936
- Dragon, I... - Xiaoling.

425
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,098
You know Tiger?

426
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,774
Yeah.

427
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,442
Arrange a meeting for us,

428
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,675
please.

429
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,773
You know where we are?

430
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,345
You won't recall. You were just a kid.

431
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,941
It used to be a park.

432
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,741
And there was a monkey bar here.

433
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,174
After we were beaten,

434
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,046
you liked to hide here.

435
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,980
I'll learn my kungfu well.
I'll beat them up!

436
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,523
Kungfu is for protecting people,

437
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,060
not for fighting.

438
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,292
We will never be bad guys

439
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,431
no matter what.

440
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,828
Got it?

441
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,297
Got it.

442
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,002
Look! That's the direction
to the Dragon Tiger Gate.

443
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,677
Ever beaten anyone you shouldn't have?

444
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,678
No! Never!

445
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,913
But I have. Many times!

446
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,654
Many things

447
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,088
have happened to me,

448
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,258
but you won't understand.

449
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,533
I wanna tell you today...

450
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,503
I'm proud of you.

451
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,599
'Cos you can stick to your principles!

452
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,469
I also have my principles.

453
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,437
I know where I should go.

454
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,984
Let's go.

455
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,715
Hey!

456
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,252
I'll wait for you at home!

457
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,484
Cool. See you at the Gate!

458
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,930
Giving up the Plague is an insult to me!

459
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,373
Rosa.

460
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,568
Both Kun and Dragon must die!

461
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,610
Watch out!

462
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,280
Xiaoling, show us what you got!

463
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,737
Dad, how did I do?

464
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,365
Not too bad.

465
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,305
I'm the best

466
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,501
in the team.

467
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,236
And you call that "not too bad"?!

468
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,253
Your game is just kiddy stuff for me!

469
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,849
Cool!

470
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,616
If you're so good, let's play a game!

471
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,292
Okay, you arrange it.

472
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,361
But you better get changed now.
We'll go eat.

473
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,530
Dragon is on his way.

474
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,925
Cool!

475
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,535
Hello.

476
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,104
Dragon, I have to see you now.

477
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,931
But I don't feel like it.

478
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,608
You'll regret if you don't show up.

479
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:11,030
So fast! You must miss me!

480
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,151
Have you ever done it in the water?

481
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,653
I thought you had

482
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,021
something urgent to tell me.

483
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,031
Tattoo for me.

484
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,868
Why?

485
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,610
My birthday present.

486
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,144
You have birthday?

487
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,880
You saved me years ago.

488
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,490
To me, that's my birthday.

489
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,126
Forget it. I know you won't.

490
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,977
Turn around.

491
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,658
Go away!

492
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,865
You'll fall to your death!

493
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,164
None of your business. Go way!

494
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,172
Jump down and I'll catch you.

495
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,787
What's your name?

496
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,454
Dragon.

497
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,349
Yours?

498
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,957
Rosa.

499
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,885
What you staring at?

500
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,530
Can't I stare?

501
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,362
I'll be in love with you forever.

502
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,683
What have you tattooed for me?

503
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,210
I was supposed to kill you.

504
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,181
Double Devils are off to kill Kun.

505
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,479
Go to hell!

506
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,716
You bloody old man!

507
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,113
I'm good but you treat me like shit!

508
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,415
Better to work for
Lousha Gang than for you.

509
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:31,624
Retire? Not so easy!

510
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,455
Let me retire you now!

511
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,094
Don't hit me, Kun!

512
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,201
I was just kiddin'!

513
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,872
- You back-stabbing asshole!
- Let me retire with you.

514
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,303
Help! Double Devils!

515
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,242
Help!

516
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,302
Dad!

517
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,789
Watch over her!

518
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,991
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

519
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,794
You'll make it big in the future.

520
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:16,164
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

521
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,160
Never give up...

522
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,495
however difficult life will become.

523
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,712
Will he go to heaven?

524
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:53,119
He will. He loved you so much.

525
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,304
Better ask when the bad guys
will go to hell!

526
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,209
From now on, the Gate is your home.

527
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,514
Even if my limps are broken,

528
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,977
I won't let anyone harm you.

529
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,561
Double Devils were beaten
by people from the Gate.

530
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,761
The Gate is really that strong?

531
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,029
Good!

532
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,008
Master,

533
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:21,715
we haven't found Tiger yet.

534
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,681
Baldy and others are searching for him!

535
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,660
Who's the best here?

536
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,653
Watch out for...

537
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:36,855
the "Black Pagoda"!

538
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:05,872
So Dragon Tiger Gate's kungfu sucks!

539
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,281
You're not good enough
to die under my hands!

540
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,472
But you can!

541
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,124
Find your brother.

542
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,852
Guard the Gate together...

543
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,459
Xiaoling, should anything
happen to anyone...

544
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,189
bring them to Mt Baiyun...

545
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,368
and look for a guy called Qi.

546
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,277
Master!

547
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,146
Master! Master...

548
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,844
Please save my friends!

549
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,885
Their wounds are too deep for me.

550
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,526
All over Mt Baiyun,

551
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:19,326
Only Qi can help them.

552
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,033
Where can I find Qi?

553
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,196
Inside the pagoda.

554
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,636
I'll find him once I get up there?

555
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,904
No one has ever entered the pagoda!

556
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,751
Stay put!

557
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,989
Pick up the prayer beads.

558
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,166
Pick up all the prayer beads.

559
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,991
Master Qi

560
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,817
Here are all the prayer beads.

561
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,292
Please save my friends.

562
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,997
There's still one bead below the pagoda.

563
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,695
You've gone an arduous way.

564
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,534
Your friends must mean a lot to you.

565
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,239
If you can jump down the pagoda...

566
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,345
to pick up the bead...

567
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,180
then I will save them.

568
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,061
I hope you'll keep your promise.

569
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,912
Did I ever go up there?

570
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,245
Everything is an illusion
in the mundane world.

571
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:28,321
Only your conviction is real.

572
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,283
The moment you decided
to sacrifice yourself...

573
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,256
the prayer bead was already in your hand.

574
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,429
Don't worry. I will save your friends.

575
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,705
No one at the Gate is good enough
to beat Double Devils.

576
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,644
I know your relationship with Dragon.

577
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,078
He's good.

578
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,980
I wanna fight with him.

579
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,986
Take this to save him.

580
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,783
He should die under my hands.

581
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:33,118
You'll be okay after the acupuncture.

582
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:39,626
Your internal power might even increase.

583
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,736
Don't move.

584
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,405
Don't say a word.

585
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,212
I was also adopted.

586
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,722
No one ever cares how I feel.

587
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,392
I did this for you today,

588
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,492
so you'll care for me.

589
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,465
Even if you don't love me,

590
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,567
I can make you hate me!

591
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:50,160
This pill can only save one person.

592
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,226
or yourself!

593
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,219
Dragon,

594
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,061
have you ever loved me?

595
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,644
Tiger, I'll teach you
"Electric Dragon Drill."

596
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,817
Turbo, I'll teach you "Golden Mask."

597
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,557
Tiger, Turbo,

598
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,098
I'm giving you two gadgets.

599
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:50,237
They can help you fight Shibumi.

600
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,268
But whether you'll win in the end

601
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,499
depends on yourselves.

602
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,475
Wait for me at the Gate.

603
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,538
I promise I'll be back.

604
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,830
Looking for your own death?

605
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,643
Your kungfu has improved a lot!

606
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,085
Let's have a good fight!

607
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,828
That's it?

608
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,795
Anything more?

609
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,294
Your "Golden Mask" is not bad!

610
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,493
Anything else?

611
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,794
Electric Dragon Drill! Embarrassing!

612
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:41,244
On behalf of the Gate,
I'm returning the Plaque to you.

613
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,778
Dragon, I've been waiting for you!

614
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,025
Eighteen Dragon Slaying Palms?

615
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:18,311
That's all you have, Shibumi? How slow!

616
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,157
We can go back to the Gate now,

617
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,418
Little Bro!

618
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:44,411
Tiger!

619
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:45,803
Tiger is back!

620
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:46,672
Tiger!

621
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:47,905
Tiger!

622
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,015
Tiger!

623
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,323
Uncle, we're back, my brother and me.

624
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,372
Uncle said the Gate...

625
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,734
should be passed on to both of us.

626
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,711
Yo, what about me?

627
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,910
Ever think about changing

628
01:30:20,114 --> 01:30:21,775
your name to Leopard?

629
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,412
Turbo Leopard? Sounds fierce!
