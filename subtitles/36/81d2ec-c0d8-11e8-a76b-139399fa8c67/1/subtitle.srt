I was working at this, uh,
bar downtown to help pay for school,

179
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,270
and he kept coming in after work.

180
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,690
And he would just order
the most complicated drinks.

181
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,359
Things that I had no idea how to make.

182
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,570
(CHUCKLES)

183
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,655
One night, he climbed over the bar

184
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,408
and offered to teach me how to make them.

185
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,954
And he ended up staying until we closed.
Then he asked me out.

186
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,914
And you went.

187
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,295
I didn't know who he was or what he did.
He was just...

188
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,798
He was just this guy in a suit.

189
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,594
And watched me while I made drinks,

190
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,597
and that made me really nervous.

191
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,975
Then he stared at me like I was a painting.

192
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,314
He had this beautiful sailboat,
and he took me out on it.

193
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,483
Taught me how to ski.

194
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,486
He swept me off my feet.

195
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,991
Proposed to me in Maui that winter
and we were married by spring.

196
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,412
How old were you?

197
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,794
That was five years ago, so I was 23.

198
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,676
Time goes by so fast.

199
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,181
Is this ever going to go away?

200
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,976
You said you felt depressed before.

201
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,354
Did you see anyone about it last time?

202
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,274
Yeah. In Greenwich, Connecticut.
Victoria Siebert.

203
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,403
I had to stop seeing her
when they took our house away

204
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,197
and I had to move back to the city.

205
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,158
Do you mind if I contact Dr. Siebert
about your history?

206
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,868
No, of course not.

207
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,912
SIEBERT:  <i>I saw her four years ago.</i>
BANKS:  <i>Mmm.</i>

208
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,331
SIEBERT: For a little over nine months.

209
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,083
She didn't just
have the rug pulled from under her,

210
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,336
she had the rug, the home, the husband.

211
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,588
Her entire life, gone.

212
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:51,720
Even her health insurance.
She moved into the city to find work

213
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,639
and I never heard from her again.

214
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,560
I'm glad she's seeing a man this time.
I think that will help.

215
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,645
Why is that?

216
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,356
Never felt seen by her father.

217
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:07,235
Then her husband ends up in jail
and she's abandoned again.

218
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,823
I'd be happy to see her have
a different kind of experience.

219
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,076
She says you tried her on medication.

220
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,998
Oh, yes. Wellbutrin. Prozac. Effexor.

221
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,584
- Really struggled.
- Mmm.

222
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,588
I remember she had problems
with sleep and nausea. Chills...

223
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,215
I'm putting her on Zoloft,
see if she can tolerate that.

224
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,594
Oh. Well, maybe she's a candidate
for one of these newer meds.

225
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,096
Sometimes the newest thing
gives them confidence.

226
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,351
They see the ads on TV, they believe.

227
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,562
I have a patient with some similar issues.

228
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,522
I put her on Ablixa.

229
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,566
WOMAN: Welcome, everyone!
Thank you for coming.

230
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,360
We'll be starting the presentations soon,

231
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,487
so if everyone can come in and take a seat.

232
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,951
You know, I may have
some samples here. Let me see.

233
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,539
No. I must have given them all away.

234
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,584
Here! Have an Ablixa pen.

235
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,294
(CHUCKLES)

236
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,712
Had it been available back then,

237
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,091
I would have prescribed it for Emily
after she miscarried.

238
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,300
- Miscarried?
- Hmm.

239
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,344
After he went to jail.

240
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,513
She, uh, hasn't mentioned that.

241
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,889
- No?
- No.

242
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,265
Has he been released yet?

243
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,934
- A week ago.
- Oh!

244
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,811
Well, maybe that will help turn things around.

245
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:23,895
Hmm.

246
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,982
MARTIN: Look, don't mention anything
to Carl or Kayla

247
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,735
about Hellman. It'll just make things easier.

248
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,575
I still think
Carl's the one who went to the Feds.

249
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,203
He probably gave us these tickets

250
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,123
because he feels shitty about everything.

251
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,294
I hope these things work.

252
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,088
Hey.

253
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,970
Look, if you don't feel up to this,
I can go by myself.

254
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,640
I understand
if you don't want to see those people.

256
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,310
<i>But I got to get back out there at some point.</i>

257

EMILY:  <i>If I just sit here by myself,
I'm just gonna feel worse.</i>

258
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,151
<i>I have to at least try.
Dr. Banks would want me to try.</i>

260
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,751
Martin! Welcome back.

261
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,169
- MARTIN: How are you, sir?
- Hi!

262
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,795
- CARL: Emily, good to see you.
- Hi. Good to see you.

263
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,922
Kayla, you remember this beautiful lady here.

264
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,007
Hi.

265
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,134
Thank you so much for having us.

266
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,347
Oh, my, your dress is beautiful!
I love it. It's gorgeous.

267
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,432
Thank you.
We're so glad you guys could come.

268
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,517
It's our pleasure. Thanks again.

269
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,358
I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.
Does anyone want anything?

270
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,859
(WHISPERING) Is that such a good idea?

271
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,362
Yeah, it's fine. I'll be right back.

272
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,699
She looks amazing!

273
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,659
She's doing well.

274
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,996
But going away is hard,
and so is coming back, for everyone.

275
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,499
Martin, I just want to say I wish I had done

276
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,042
a better job of reaching out. I really do.

277
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,463
No. That's fine. It's the culture. It's over now.

Can I get you something?

280
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,904

I can't do this.

You know, I went through
a very bad time last year.

288
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,934
I found a lump.

289
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,854
I just fell apart. I was so depressed,

290
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,190
and, uh, my doctor prescribed
something called Effexor.

291
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,777
It really helped.

292
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,284
Can you get Martin for me?

293
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,079
Yeah.

BANKS: Where is her lawyer?

526
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:56,002
She doesn't have one.
Just kept talking about you.

527
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,672
No sign of struggle on either one of them.

528
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,048
She made the 911 call herself.

529
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,717
We had an appointment last night
that she didn't show up for.

530
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,471
When was the last time you saw her?

531
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,639
Four days ago.

532
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,391
And what was she like?

533
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,063
Any idea why the dinner table
was set for three, Dr. Banks?

534
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:19,234
She doesn't remember anything
about a guest. Kids?

535
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,612
BANKS: No, she didn't have children.

536
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,906
She was taking these.

537
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,575
For depression, right? I've seen the ads.

538
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,369
She ever talk to you
about something like this?

539
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,579
I'd like to speak to her, if that's possible.

540
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,206
You can talk to her at Rikers.

541
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,709
It's possible, you see, that she was asleep.

542
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,420
What?

543
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,587
She walks in her sleep.

544
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,214
That's maybe why she doesn't
remember anything.

545
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,216
It's a side effect of this medication.

546
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,762
She's had other episodes.

547
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,433
She kills people in her sleep, too.

548
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,733
Stand up, please. And turn around.

549
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,278
ASSISTANT D.A.:<i>
She ever tell you anything to</i>

550
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,573
make you believe she could be violent,
or that he was?

551
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,450
And before you answer that

552
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:12,871
or tell me about some kind of
patient-doctor confidentiality thing,

553
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,999
let's just think about the future here.

554
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,293
The future?

555
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,297
Well, this goes one of two ways, doesn't it?

556
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,801
See, either she's a murderer or

557
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,096
she's a victim of her medical treatment.

558
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:34,142
In which case,
you're the target of a big civil suit.

559
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:38,146
<i>Either way, someone gets punished.</i>

560
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,232
<i>Her or you.</i>

561
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:47,238
<i>The state's enjoyed working with you
in the past, Dr. Banks.</i>

562
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,784
<i>I'd like to see you
consulting with us on this one.</i>

563
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,995
This is different.

564
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,164
Is it?

565
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:03,505
I never want to see another pill again.

566
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:07,509
They want me to take something else.

567
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:10,470
Another pill to help me sleep.

568
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,477
I don't understand why this is happening.

569
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,192
Is there any way that

570
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,861
somebody else did it,

571
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:29,364
and made it look like me?

572
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:35,286
I don't think so.

573
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,622
(SOBBING)

574
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,750
That's not what the police are saying.

575
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,844
I killed the wrong person.

576
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,932
BANKS: I don't know what else
I could have done.

577
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,392
She wanted to stay on it.

578
00:41:57,475 --> 00:42:00,020
Jon. You can't follow them around

579
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:01,688
taking things out of their hands

580
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,857
they might use to hurt themselves.

581
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:07,193
We see them for an hour a day,
maybe a couple of times a week.

582
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,029
I think they're going to charge her.

583
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,447
With what?

584
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:14,576
You said she has no memory.
No criminal intent.

585
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,536
They can't do that.

586
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,581
ATTORNEY:  <i>A man in Arizona.</i>

587
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:21,666
He killed his wife, threw her in the pool,

588
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,210
took off his bloody clothes,
put them in the trunk of his car.

589
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:26,713
Woke up the next morning, no memory of it.

590
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,090
Didn't even know she was dead until
they charged him with the crime.

591
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,052
Neighbors even saw him
throw the body into the pool.

592
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:34,596
He was acquitted last year.

593
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,601
A woman bludgeoned her husband
while on vacation in Sanibel Island.

594
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:43,104
They were both asleep at the time.
Another acquittal.

595
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:46,149
I have to tell you,
I have been approached by the state

596
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:47,734
to consult for them as well.

597
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,611
I assumed as much.

598
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:54,032
I am in a rather difficult spot here.
I hope you appreciate that.

599
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,534
I know you are, but if she goes away,

600
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:57,619
this does not look good for you.

601
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,913
It just makes the whole system look bad.

602
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:04,959
She ever talk about killing her husband?

603
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:06,920
No. If she had, I would have reported it.

604
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,964
You spoken to any of the family?

605
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,342
Martin's mother. She's the one who hired me.

606
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:17,180
We need your help.

607
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,521
You want to talk about it?

608
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:28,608
(SIGHING)

609
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,320
A patient of mine was arrested.

610
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,991
For something bad?

611
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:39,661
Yeah. Pretty bad.

612
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,542
Did the person do it?

613
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,586
Are they guilty?

614
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,799
(SIGHING)

615
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:55,135
In this case,

616
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,805
those are two very different things.

617
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:43,183
I was afraid you would
never want to see me again.

618
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:50,565
I hope you know that if I could
trade places with Martin, I would.

619
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:55,028
I would give anything if there were
someone who could make that deal.

620
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,740
I just don't understand
how it happened. How?

621
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,242
I don't know.

622
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:05,747
I don't know. It doesn't fit for me. It's like...

623
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,293
It's like it never happened.

624
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:12,837
But I don't understand it.

625
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,925
You watch the commercials on TV,
people are getting better!

626
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:20,887
I was getting better.
Dr. Banks was really helping me.

627
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,807
But, he just got out

628
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,518
and now he's gone.

629
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,853
I know.

630
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:34,150
Can I give you something?

631
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:36,569
What?

632
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:38,863
I want to make a statement.

633
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,790
People need to know what can happen.

634
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,710
For Martin's sake.

635
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:53,837
MARTHA ON TV:  <i>"We go to doctors</i>

<i>Josh, it is. And that is why the FDA, in 2004,</i>

656

<i>asked that anti-depressants
come with a black box warning...</i>

<i>of suicidality in children and adolescents.</i>

00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:20,173
Did you remember? Are you excited? What?

671
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:29,683
Did you know that your husband
was treating Emily Taylor?

672
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:30,892
Take him out of here.

MALE REPORTER: What about this picture?

676
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,605
Have you seen the front page
of the  <i>Post</i> today?

677
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:36,940
You have no comment about any of this?

678

No, not at the moment.

679
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,026
Do you have any comment at all about this?

She's my patient. That's all I can say.

What's your relationship?

682
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,866
I saw some press people downstairs.

683
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,786
I think they had cameras.

684
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,372
Is that for you?

685
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,711
There's a back stairway,

686
00:47:57,752 --> 00:48:00,714

(CHUCKLES)

688
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:08,096
My wife never liked me coming here.

689
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,435
I'm worried she's going to see something.

690
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,564
It's going to be a "thing."

691
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:20,567
Was she the one with the blonde hair?

692
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:25,488
I think I saw her in the elevator.
She seemed totally normal.

693
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,158
I'd really like to focus more
on what's going on with you.

694
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:30,910
What was she taking?
It's not what I'm taking, is it?

695
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,246
No. You're taking something else.

696
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:36,750
You'd... You'd tell me, right?

697
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,878
CHILDS: As part of the Office's
medical conduct review,

698
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:42,672
we'll need to have access
to your charts and records.

699
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:45,133
Current and past patients.

700
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:51,598
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

701
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,936
You went to school in the UK, at Durham.

702
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,021
Mmm.

703
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,899
What made you decide
to practice here in the States?

704
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:05,695
Where I come from,
if anyone goes to see a psychiatrist

705
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,448
or takes medication,
the assumption is they're sick.

706
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,867
Here, the assumption is they're getting better.

707
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,118
I see.

708
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:18,124
You first came in contact with
Miss Taylor after a suicide attempt.

709
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,003
She drove her car into a wall.

710
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,964
You decided not to hospitalize her?

711
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:30,303
She described her suicide attempt
as a mistake.

712
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:34,057
And expressed a desire to get better.

713
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,893
Her husband wanted her home as well.

714
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:41,147
In addition,
she had no history of violent behavior.

715
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,651
Driving a car into a wall isn't violent?

716
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:49,155
I didn't think she posed a risk to others.

717
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,158
I saw her regularly, here in my office,

718
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,911
and consulted with
her previous doctor as well.

719
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:56,579
- Dr. Siebert.
- Hmm.

720
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,998
I've spoken to her.

721
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:04,462
You also do work at the hospital,
a number of shifts.

722
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,007
Sometimes nights.

723
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,510
And you said you're doing
pharmaceutical consulting.

724
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:13,680
That's a pretty large workload.

725
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:17,100
My wife lost her job.

726
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,354
And we have a boy,
my stepson, in private school.

727
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,358
I bought a new place downtown, too.

728
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:33,408
So, longer hours,
higher volume of patients, more stress.

729
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:37,537
(SIGHING)

730
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,674
Anything else?

731
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:55,972
I'll need to ask your partners
some questions.

732
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,515
Of course.

733
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,147
DIERDRE:  <i>They can't come after you
for any of this, right?</i>

734
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:07,442
BANKS:  <i>No, that's not going to happen.</i>

735
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,611
They don't blame me.

736
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,908
I'm just an expert witness.

737
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,745
Like I was on that case
with the kid from Uganda

738
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:21,373
who couldn't stop stealing stuff.

739
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,796
They just need me to explain things
to the jury. That's all.

740
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,591
So after the trial, it's over.

741
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,426
Absolutely.

742
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:38,932
MAN:  <i>She was sad. Very sad.</i>

743
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,350
Every day.

744
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,645
ATTORNEY: Did she say why?

745
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:47,607
No. It is just how she was.

746
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,067
OFFICER:  <i>Some people slip.</i>

747
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:53,279
Some jump. We keep an eye out.

748
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:57,951
I remember her. Right on the edge.

749
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:00,954
She worried me.

750
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:03,623
BANKS:  <i>What makes us human?</i>

751
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:06,543
What differentiates us from, let's say, insects,

752
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:08,712
is that we have consciousness.

753
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:12,966
An awareness of what we're thinking
and what we're doing.

754
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:17,971
If, for example, I'm hungry,
I am consciously aware of that.

755
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:21,891
And so, I go to the fridge
and I make myself a sandwich.

756
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:25,145
So you intend to make a sandwich.

757
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,396
BANKS: Yes.

758
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:32,277
So, what you are saying is that to have intent,

759
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:33,737
we must also have consciousness.

760
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,655
Objection, Your Honor.

761
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:39,576
The question calls for a legal conclusion,
not a medical one.

762
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:40,869
JUDGE: Overruled.

763
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:42,996
You may continue.

764
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,083
Consciousness provides a context,

765
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,085
or meaning, for our actions.

766
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,838
If that part of you doesn't exist, then,

767
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:54,924
basically, we are functioning
much like an insect,

768
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:58,261
where you just respond instinctively

769
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,847
without a thought to what your actions mean.

770
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,682
ATTORNEY: And that part...

771
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,643
That part that provides meaning to action,

772
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:07,270
does that exist when we're asleep?

773
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,938
- BANKS: No.
- No.

774
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:13,610
ATTORNEY: So, without consciousness,
how do we prove intent?

775
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,695
BANKS: I don't believe you can.

776
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,447
ATTORNEY:  <i>I think she'll take it.</i>

777
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:22,285
But she does not walk out
of the hospital next week, or next month.

778
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,120
She goes away for a while.
That's part of the deal.

779
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,372
She'll have to agree to that.

780
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,374
You think that'll work?

781
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:31,711
I can get Dr. Banks to help explain it to her.

782
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:35,131
Here's what we're prepared to live with.

783
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,133
State agrees to an NGRI.

784
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,969
We make a side agreement about
how long she's institutionalized

785
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:42,389
before there's any sort of hearing
on her release.

786
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,725
So I'm not guilty, but I'm still going away?

787
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:48,728
NGRI means
Not Guilty for Reasons of Insanity.

788
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:50,647
You're not guilty of murder.

789
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,441
You'll be moved to the Wards Island
Forensic Psychiatry Center

790
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:54,567
for a period of time.

791
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:55,735
But I can't leave.

792
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,529
No, not for a while.

793
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,447
You'll be under observation.

794
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:02,575
I'm not crazy. You know I'm not crazy.

795
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:07,497
In my opinion, you are a victim
of circumstance and biology.

796
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,001
Isn't your opinion the one that counts?

797
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,211
No, I'm just one doctor.

798
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:16,006
It may help to have you examined
by another psychiatrist.

799
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,924
We should get Dr. Siebert.

800
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:20,093
She's known me for a lot longer,
and she could testify.

801
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:23,930
Dr. Siebert's records
have already been submitted to the D.A.

802
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,975
And you weren't in her care
at the time of the murder.

803
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,772
But if I'm just a victim
of circumstance and biology...

804
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,152
It was the Ablixa.
You told me I should stay

805
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:40,363
on the Ablixa.
I would never be here if it weren't for that.

806
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:44,451
Emily, if you take this plea,
as soon as a psychiatrist says you're ready,

807
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:46,077
we'll apply for your release.

808
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,121
What if I say no?

809
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,624
ATTORNEY: Then we keep going.

810
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,295
But they have a body,
they have your prints on the murder weapon,

811
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:56,713
and they have you at the crime scene.

812
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,549
We can't argue
that you didn't do any of that, so,

813
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:02,802
one day, it goes to the jury
and maybe they acquit,

814
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,304
you walk out of here on your own.

815
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,306
Or maybe it goes the other way.

816
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,351
EMILY: Well, what do you think?

817
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:11,478
I will tell you what I know.

818
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,773
An NGRI defense
is only successful 1% of the time,

819
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:17,317
and they are giving you that today.

820
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,485
BANKS:  <i>You're fucking kidding me.</i>

821
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,988
Nobody here has ever had a bad result?
Nobody here has had

822
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,157
a client react to a side effect?

823
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,577
Your arrogance here is breathtaking.
You take no responsibility?

824
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,080
For her body's reaction to a medicine?

825
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:31,414
It only just came on the market!

826
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,875
She has come up in a number
of my sessions as well.

827
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,669
It's become a part of the environment here.

828
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,796
I have clients who are afraid
to take their medications.

829
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:40,006
We had the state board here.
It's on the nightly news.

830
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,927
Look, I spoke with her lawyer and the D.A.
We worked it out.

831
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,970
She's taking an NGRI.

832
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:48,556
She's going to hospital for observation.
It's behind us.

833
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,933
It's all gonna go away.

834
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,519
Bullshit, Jon! It is splashed all over you!

835
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,105
It's going to follow you around forever.

836
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:56,940
And us, too, if we're standing next to you.

837
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:59,943
What does that mean?
If she's not guilty, why am I?

838
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:01,653
Rational people may look at it like that,

839
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,905
but we don't see
a great many rational people here.

840
00:56:03,988 --> 00:56:04,989
You can see what I'm saying?

841
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:08,034
We shouldn't even have to ask.
You should see what's happening.

842
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,203
But that seems hard for you!

843
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:13,623
(DOOR CLOSES)

844
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:23,133
Do you think I screwed up?

845
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:25,802
I don't know.

846
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:32,017
I noticed the Taylor woman
in the waiting room.

847
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:33,601
She was very attractive.

848
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,646
A wounded bird. Fragile.

849
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:40,400
Would you have treated her differently
if she was a man?

850
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:41,735
Gene.

851
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:45,071
That's not what happened.

852
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:48,575
Maybe it's time for you to slow down.

853
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,828
Your client load is down.
Get some cheaper space.

854
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,663
Focus on what's going on with you.

855
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:55,248
Unbelievable.

856
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,501
I received a letter, Jon.

857
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:00,086
I haven't shared it with anyone,

858
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,839
but I think it will likely surface.

859
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:04,591
What kind of letter?

860
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:10,597
It's about Alison Finn.

861
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:14,893
BANKS:  <i>It was during my residency.</i>

862
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:17,812
There was a walk-in clinic at the university.

863
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:20,273
I saw her maybe three times.

864
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:22,859
She saw other people there as well,

865
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:26,196
called the suicide line every other night.

866
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,365
She was a paranoid schizophrenic

867
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:31,618
and a drug addict. Very sick girl.

868
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:33,078
She knew where you lived.

869
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,162
She stalked me.

870
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:36,831
The letter says you took her to London.

871
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,625
Never.

872
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,794
Why are they writing this?

873
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:42,879
Their daughter committed suicide

874
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:45,882
and left a very graphic note, naming me.

875
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,636
It never happened. Look.

876
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:53,807
It's not unusual for there to be
emotional transference between

877
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,725
a patient and a therapist.

878
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,728
Had her perform oral sex in your car?

879
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,523
Never! It was a fantasy!

880
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:58,496
NARRATOR:  <i>Depression can
take away your energy.</i>

881
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:03,001
<i>It can steal away your time.</i>

882
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:52,884
SIEBERT:  <i>A number of years ago,</i>

883
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,719
<i>I had a patient who was having an affair.</i>

884
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:57,764
Came in here every week
like he was going to confession.

885
00:59:57,847 --> 01:00:00,850
Cried, repented. Didn't stop.

886
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:05,271
Then one day, he comes in and says it's over.

887
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:09,693
He's finally got a handle on his issues,
like some great epiphany.

888
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,822
It was about six or seven months later

889
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:18,743
his wife turns up and says he has a whole
other family in another state.

890
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:21,996
He'd been lying to her.

891
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,457
And he was lying to me.

892
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:30,296
The kids blamed me. The wife blamed me.
Even the patient blamed me.

893
01:00:31,214 --> 01:00:33,383
At times, I blamed me.

894
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:40,140
The point is the cardiologist
can see it coming, the heart attack,

895
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:43,476
from the tests. It's in the blood.

896
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:46,896
But who can see the lies?

897
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,066
Or the past, or the sadness?

898
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:52,861
(SIGHING)

899
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:57,407
You didn't tell me you wrote the article.

900
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:02,245
We were consulting on a patient,
not comparing r茅sum茅s.

901
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,956
It would have been a little self-involved

902
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,541
for me to mention it, don't you think?

903
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,836
It wasn't about me, it was about Emily.

904
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:13,423
Why didn't you tell me
about the sleepwalking?

905
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,091
Me tell you?

906
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,010
She told you about them.

907
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:19,512
And you kept her on the Ablixa.

908
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:21,765
It was a decision you made, Jon.

909
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,143
How did you know that?

910
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,186
Know what?

911
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:32,942
That she had more than one episode.
How would you know that?

912
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:37,530
Did she have them
when she was your patient?

913
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:40,116
I know because it's in the news.

914
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,452
That's how I know.

915
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,205
Everyone knows.

916
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:48,792
Everyone knows everything, Jon.

917
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:01,513
Like that? At that speed?

918
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:03,723
- No, faster than that.
- Oh, faster than that.

919
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:07,185
Yeah, and she was carrying the seat belt.

920
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:08,812
She was wearing the seat belt? Are you sure?

921
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,146
Yeah, I saw it!

922
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:17,821
WOMAN:  <i>One moment, you're living high
on the hog, and the next moment,</i>

923
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:21,241
you're visiting your hubby in jail,
eating ramen?

924
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:23,410
Who wouldn't be depressed?

925
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,829
And then what happened...

926
01:02:25,995 --> 01:02:29,332
Oh, God, it's just so tragic.

927
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:34,254
I've suffered from my own depression,
so I understand.

928
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:36,256
I'm sorry to hear that.

929
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:42,679
"Every afternoon, around 3:00,
like a poisonous fog bank rolling in

930
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,348
"on my mind, and I'm paralyzed."

931
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:46,933
"A poisonous fog"?

932
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:49,310
- That's not me. It's William Styron. Yes.
- William Styron.

933
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,104
<i>- Darkness Visible.
- Darkness Visible.</i>

934
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,858
<i>There are times when
I feel I could have written it, but...</i>

935
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,610
<i>So is she</i>

936
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,529
doing any better?

937
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,364
I'm keeping an eye on her.

938
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:19,132
Excuse me. Are you Julia?

939
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:22,218
Julia? Are you Julia?

940
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:27,307
Sorry to disturb you. Are you Julia? No.

941
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,142
Julia? Are you Julia?

942
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:30,769
- No, I'm Joan.
- Julia.

943
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,979
- Is there a... Are you Julia?
- No, I'm Susan.

944
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,272
WOMAN: Is there something else?

945
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:37,150
I wanted to speak to her friend, Julia.

946
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,237
Julia? I don't think
we have a Julia that works here.

947
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:42,864
Really?

948
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:45,992
Hey.

949
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,578
Look at this.

950
01:03:49,412 --> 01:03:53,291
She knew all about airbags and seat belts.
Fucking commercial runs

951
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,336
on a loop in the lobby where she works.

952
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:00,965
- DIERDRE: Where were you?
- What?

953
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,094
You forgot me at school.

954
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,596
I was here. I was doing this.

955
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,224
Honey, go to your room.
Start your homework. I'll be there in a minute.

956
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:10,809
I'm sorry.

957
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:15,522
What is all this? The Delatrex thing?

958
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:17,565
No, look, I went to her office.

959
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:20,568
There is no Julia at work who takes Ablixa.

960
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:23,571
What are you talking about?

961
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,824
Why did she make up Julia?

962
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,787
I don't know. Isn't she sick?

963
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:34,624
I thought sick people
sometimes make things up.

964
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,337
BANKS:  <i>So you're feeling better.</i>

965
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:43,133
EMILY:  <i>Yeah, much better.
I've been doing a lot of, um,</i>

966
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:47,220
running on the treadmill here to try
and get in shape and stimulate serotonin.

967
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:50,390
You're not feeling
like you're in a "poisonous fog"?

968
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:52,392
No.

969
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:54,561
No, not so much anymore.

970
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:58,773
That phrase really stuck with me.

971
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:01,317
How did you come by it?

972
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:05,947
I don't know, really. Um...

973
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,533
I guess it's just...

974
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:11,578
I guess that's how I felt back then.

975
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:14,372
You know, maybe I heard it
or read it somewhere.

976
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:20,003
Back on the boat with Martin,
we used to always see the fog rolling in.

977
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,923
I'm sure a lot of depressed people
have felt that way before.

978
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:29,429
The important thing is that I think
the fog is finally lifting.

979
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,683
And I really think I'm going to be ready
to get out of here soon.

980
01:05:38,104 --> 01:05:41,399
I have to go, I'm sorry.
I have a meeting in the city.

981
01:05:42,942 --> 01:05:47,447
Do you think maybe, uh,
next time you could stay a little longer?

982
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:51,117
It's just I don't have any other visitors

983
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:54,871
and this is really all I have to look forward to.

984
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:58,792
What about your friend, Julia?

985
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:01,961
Julia?

986
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:04,964
Yes. From the ad agency.

987
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:09,636
Oh, Julia. No, I worked with Julia at the bar.

988
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:14,140
I haven't heard from her
since everything happened.

989
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:17,477
I haven't heard from most people.

990
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,149
Are you okay?

991
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:31,491
I know what it's like to have your
entire life change out from under you.

992
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:37,997
The only difference is,
you didn't do anything wrong and Martin did.

993
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:40,625
WOMAN:  <i>So, the reason I called.</i>

994
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:44,170
I mean, with all the attention in the paper
on the Taylor case,

995
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:46,297
and with the ethics probe and such,

996
01:06:46,339 --> 01:06:49,009
I wanted to tell you that, um...

997
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,804
We need to ask you to step off the study.

998
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:54,514
I'm sure it's all blown out of proportion,

999
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:56,683
but we can't have you on the payroll now.

1000
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,685
I could be anonymous.

1001
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,854
Still do the work.

1002
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:03,523
I'm real sorry.

1003
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,276
I feel horrible about this.

1004
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:12,032
Maybe you can be part of another study
when this is over.

1005
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:13,700
All right, then.

1006
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:16,411
The funny thing is,
with Sadler-Benelux in the toilet,

1007
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:18,038
we're up like 30%.

1008
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,456
What?

1009
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:24,002
The guys down on Wall Street are cashing in
because of what happened with Ablixa.

1010
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:26,212
Worked out super well for us.

1011
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:28,298
BANKS:  <i>You can bet on a stock to go down,</i>

1012
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:30,759
<i>just like you can bet on it to go up.</i>

1013
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,719
A few days before 9/11,

1014
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:37,557
there was a huge surge
in the purchase of options of airline stock.

1015
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,185
No one knows why. It's a complete mystery.

1016
01:07:40,226 --> 01:07:43,438
But United fell 40% after the planes crashed

1017
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:45,357
and people made a lot of money.

1018
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:46,608
And it isn't illegal.

1019
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:49,194
Thinking something's
going to happen isn't illegal.

1020
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:51,696
Breaking the law to make it happen
is a different story.

1021
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:54,908
Jon, I know what insider trading is.
I used to work in finance.

1022
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:57,202
Sure, you do, but, look. See!

1023
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:01,331
Hey. See what happened at Sadler-Benelux

1024
01:08:01,414 --> 01:08:03,083
right after Martin Taylor died.

1025
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,168
Down. Way down.

1026
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:09,673
AziLyle, on the other hand...up. Way up.

1027
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:12,884
She did it. She made it happen, do you see?

1028
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,427
Do you see? Ablixa was her idea!

1029
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:17,514
But you prescribed it. You did that.

1030
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:23,019
I got a job today.

1031
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,107
- Huh?
- They offered me full time.

1032
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,401
I left you a message this morning.

1033
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:32,195
I didn't hear. (STAMMERS)
My phone was off 'cause I was at the hospital.

1034
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:34,614
Hopefully with this and the consulting
money we can finally get back...

1035
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:38,368
No, the Delatrex thing is over. It's gone.

1036
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:41,037
They fired me.

1037
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:43,373
What?

1038
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,042
- When?
- Today.

1039
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,380
That's why I have
to make this thing with Emily work.

1040
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:53,299
I'm not letting another Alison Finn happen,

1041
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:54,426
so I'm fucking fighting this time!

1042
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,428
I don't want to hear about Emily or Alison.

1043
01:08:56,469 --> 01:08:57,971
But this is starting to make sense now!

1044
01:08:58,054 --> 01:08:59,973
No, it's not making sense!

1045
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:04,477
It doesn't make sense that you're
sitting here doing this all day long!

1046
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,396
The case is over.

1047
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:10,150
The photographers are gone,
your partners are gone,

1048
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:12,736
the Delatrex thing is now gone.

1049
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:17,323
You're the only one that's still here.

1050
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:19,743
I just want to know what happened.

1051
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:23,580
A woman you were treating
killed her husband.

1052
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:26,750
That's what happened.

1053
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,174
EMILY:  <i>But I already told the truth.</i>

1054
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:37,135
BANKS: That's what this test
will help to prove.

1055
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:38,762
How does it do that?

1056
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,681
It helps to show your true state of mind.

1057
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:45,769
Sodium amytal gives us a window
into someone's psyche.

1058
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:47,312
It lowers inhibitions.

1059
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:51,066
We make a video of the test
and we show it to the judge.

1060
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:55,528
It's just you know how I feel about drugs.

1061
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:58,531
Emily, this is the fastest way out of here.

1062
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,701
What does it do to me?

1063
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,537
Initially, you'll feel light-headed.

1064
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:09,459
And then you will get a sense
of well-being. Calm.

1065
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:13,546
After a few minutes,
you'll probably get drowsy and fall asleep.

1066
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,340
What do you do while that's happening?

1067
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:16,883
I ask questions.

1068
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:20,637
You answer. You say whatever you feel
about what happened.

1069
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,682
What motivated you to come
and see me in the first place?

1070
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:26,142
My motivation was to
get over my depression

1071
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,894
and to have a life with my husband.

1072
01:10:27,977 --> 01:10:29,896
Then that's what this will show.

1073
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:32,065
What if I say something else?

1074
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:35,568
What do you mean?

1075
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,407
I just mean, what if I say something
that makes my situation worse?

1076
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:46,413
You say anything you're not happy with,
I'll destroy the video.

1077
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:53,712
How old are you, Emily?

1078
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,255
Twenty-eight.

1079
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:57,716
Where are we?

1080
01:10:58,508 --> 01:11:03,179
Wards Island Psychiatric Forensic Center.

1081
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,684
What is the capital of New York?

1082
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:10,854
Albany.

1083
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:14,399
Do you know why you're here?

1084
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,194
Because my husband is dead.

1085
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:20,196
How did he die?

1086
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:24,868
They said I stabbed him, but I can't remember.

1087
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:28,955
Did you want him dead?
Did you kill Martin on purpose?

1088
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,165
No.

1089
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:35,712
I wanted us to sail away together
on the boat, all three of us.

1090
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,548
The three of you?

1091
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:41,134
Madeleine.

1092
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:43,636
What happened to Madeleine?

1093
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:47,057
I lost her because I was sad

1094
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:50,977
and she didn't want to stay inside
a sad person anymore.

1095
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:57,567
He gave me so much
and then they took him away.

1096
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,236
I wanted to give him a daughter.

1097
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:04,449
But you killed him.

1098
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:08,161
Were you angry with him? Did you hate him?

1099
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:12,040
No. I never would have hurt him.
I loved everything about him.

1100
01:12:12,123 --> 01:12:14,334
The way he smelled, (INHALES DEEPLY)

1101
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:17,629
his hands. Everything about him, I loved.

1102
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,673
Did you do it for the money?

1103
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,257
Like he did?

1104
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,428
Emily.

1105
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:29,182
I loved everything about him.

1106
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:32,018
<i>Emily, can you hear me?</i>

1107
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:33,103
<i>I can't remember.</i>

1108
01:12:33,186 --> 01:12:34,521
ASSISTANT D.A.:
That's what she said in her statement.

1109
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:35,605
She doesn't remember.

1110
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:36,773
BANKS: She's lying.

1111
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:38,608
What does her falling asleep prove?

1112
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,735
You have to destroy this.
You're torturing the poor woman.

1113
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,787
It's saline.

1114
01:12:52,288 --> 01:12:54,207
I gave her saltwater.

1115
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,333
What?

1116
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,835
There was no drug.

1117
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,629
So, why did she pass out?

1118
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:03,758
You don't put in a performance like that
on saltwater.

1119
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:07,387
Call the hospital. Order a blood test.

1120
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,473
You won't find any amytal in her system.

1121
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:13,727
She's been lying this whole time.

1122
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:24,320
Destroy that.

1123
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:27,032
No. Call the hospital.

1124
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,159
- Order a blood test.
- Not a chance.

1125
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:31,661
- We have her. Arrest her.
- Dr. Banks...

1126
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,038
I want my life back!

1127
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:34,414
Destroy it before it destroys you.

1128
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:37,083
She knew the safety features of the car...

1129
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,294
You don't want to say that to me or to anyone.

1130
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:41,588
- Another thing. Sadler-Benelux is down.
- Stop talking, Dr. Banks.

1131
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:43,089
- Stop! It's too late!
- Millions of dollars were made!

1132
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:45,925
No! You could have worked with us! I asked.

1133
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:49,346
The verdict's in. It's too fucking late
for whatever that circus is

1134
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:50,430
that you just showed me.

1135
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:52,640
You see, we can't just start over.

1136
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,893
We have double jeopardy laws in this country.

1137
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:56,603
Check her bank account.

1138
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:59,522
We did. We always do. Nothing.

1139
01:13:59,856 --> 01:14:03,401
No insurance policy, no stock holdings,
no inheritance from Martin.

1140
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:04,444
She's not depressed.

1141
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:06,696
And you didn't catch it and someone died.

1142
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:11,785
And I didn't catch it
and someone didn't go to jail.

1143
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:13,203
We failed.

1144
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:17,123
See, that's what your little stunt proves.
If it proves anything,

1145
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,209
it proves we got beat.

1146
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,961
And that you lied to a woman

1147
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:25,173
who's not guilty about what
you were putting in her arm.

1148
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,634
Now, I don't know how you feel about that,

1149
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:30,136
but I would rather it
stay between you and me.

1150
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,807
You were never here.

1151
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:35,975
BANKS:  <i>Just come out there</i>

1152
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:39,145
and see her once. Please.

1153
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:41,022
She wasn't depressed.

1154
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,274
I actually can prove it.

1155
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:45,110
Why would I examine her now?

1156
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:47,654
Is that what you wanted
to see me about? Shit, Jon!

1157
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,615
I solved it finally, on my own.
Just come see her.

1158
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:52,492
You're stuck in some old place, Jon.

1159
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,160
I think you need someone
to help pull you out.

1160
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:57,122
I can refer someone good.
Are you still seeing her?

1161
01:14:57,163 --> 01:14:59,290
I'm consulting. I'm her expert on this case.

1162
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:00,792
Well, that has to stop!

1163
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:04,004
You want to make it go away, you go out to
Wards Island and resign from the case.

1164
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,130
- Step off.
- I can't do that.

1165
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:07,340
Well, then it's not going to go away.

1166
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:09,968
- Okay, you won't come and see her with me?
- No.

1167
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,428
- Can I ask you something else?
- What?

1168
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:14,597
Some Adderall.
Just a short term, 20 milligrams.

1169
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:17,934
- That's why you called, isn't it?
- I'm struggling

1170
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:21,521
to hold focus here, Gene.
That's what it's for, to help people focus.

1171
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,689
You want to focus on something,

1172
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:24,524
focus on never seeing her again.

1173
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:31,156
BANKS:  <i>D, I've been thinking
about what you said.</i>

1174
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:34,576
Look, you're right. It's time to move on.

1175
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:37,078
I'm heading over to Wards Island right now.

1176
01:15:37,245 --> 01:15:39,372
<i>I'm not gonna see her again.</i>

1177
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,895
You went to see Emily.

1178
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:03,605
Damn right, I did.

1179
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:06,107
You could have called me first.

1180
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,567
She called me.

1181
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,361
She was very upset.

1182
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:12,030
It was kind of a dramatic stunt
to pull on a woman

1183
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:15,200
who's already in a great deal
of emotional pain.

1184
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,411
I don't understand your thinking.

1185
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,583
I'm trying to determine her state of mind

1186
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,670
so I can chart the best course of treatment.

1187
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,129
"Treatment"?

1188
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,799
You gave an amytal interview to a woman

1189
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,093
who's been declared not guilty.

1190
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,428
I hope you learned something.

1191
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,805
Oh, I did.

1192
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,265
Quite a lot, actually.

1193
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,853
I think she requires more observation.

1194
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:45,605
And she'll need more medication as well.

1195
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:08,086
SIEBERT: This is Dr. Siebert on Bridge Street.

1196
01:17:08,294 --> 01:17:11,131
I'd like an envelope delivered to Manhattan.

1197
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:18,972
Hey.

1198
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,602
Where's the little guy?

1199
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,313
Fuck!

1200
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,482
I'm not going to go to the police,

1201
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:31,568
or whomever one goes to in this situation.

1202
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,778
I'm just going to go away.

1203
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,781
What? Wait! Hey, wait!

1204
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:37,991
Wait?

1205
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,369
Wait for this to happen again?

1206
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:44,330
Another Alison or Emily?

1207
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,335
Oh, wow. See?

1208
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:51,338
Okay, these prove everything.

<i>She taught me how to be depressed.</i>

1378
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:59,065
<i>What drugs had which side effects.</i>

1379
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:02,569
<i>What symptoms went with what diagnosis.</i>

1380
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,988
<i>And I taught her everything Martin</i>

1381
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:07,824
<i>ever told me about derivatives and deals.</i>

1382
01:30:09,075 --> 01:30:11,578
<i>The trades were in her name.
So I forgave Martin.</i>

1383
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,122
<i>I went to visit on the weekends</i>

1384
01:30:14,205 --> 01:30:16,583
<i>and told him that I would wait for him.</i>

1385
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,435
<i>What do you doctors call faking?</i>

1386
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:36,728
<i>"Malingering"?</i>

1387
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:39,606
<i>Such a funny word.</i>

1388
01:30:40,857 --> 01:30:43,818
<i>Girls learn to fake things at a very early age.</i>

1389
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:47,364
<i>Probably around the same time
that boys are learning to lie.</i>

1390
01:30:52,702 --> 01:30:56,623
<i>We needed everyone to see
how much I wanted it to work out with us.</i>

1391
01:30:56,706 --> 01:30:58,708
<i>How much I loved my husband.</i>

1392
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:01,961
<i>And how terribly depressed I was.</i>

1393
01:31:04,964 --> 01:31:07,300
BANKS:  <i>When did you decide to kill him?</i>

1394
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:10,303
EMILY:  <i>It's not a decision you make just once.</i>

1395
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:13,264
<i>You make it over and over again,</i>

1396
01:31:13,306 --> 01:31:15,684
<i>every time you look at your life</i>

1397
01:31:15,767 --> 01:31:18,937
<i>and you see the position you're in
and who put you there.</i>

1398
01:31:18,978 --> 01:31:20,814
<i>And it all leads back to him.</i>

1399
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:24,150
<i>Each and every fucking problem,
every disappointment.</i>

1400
01:31:24,984 --> 01:31:26,861
<i>And you think to yourself,</i>

1401
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:30,990
<i>"Maybe if he just goes away,
it'll all get better."</i>

1402
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:49,634
<i>Everything would have worked out perfectly</i>

1403
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,178
<i>if you had just disappeared after the trial</i>

1404
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:54,681
<i>like you were supposed to.</i>

1405
01:31:55,056 --> 01:31:56,391
BANKS:  <i>Why me?</i>

1406
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,269
Was it because of Alison Finn?

1407
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,190
That was just a happy coincidence.

1408
01:32:04,607 --> 01:32:06,860
A convenient distraction.

1409
01:32:07,527 --> 01:32:08,528
It didn't have to be you.

1410
01:32:08,611 --> 01:32:10,155
It could have been you or anyone else

1411
01:32:10,196 --> 01:32:12,282
who walked into my room
with a prescription pad.

1412
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:16,411
We didn't go looking for you,
we just looked at the world.

1413
01:32:23,376 --> 01:32:25,337
<i>I read somewhere that there's a difference</i>

1414
01:32:25,378 --> 01:32:27,505
<i>between tears of joy and tears of rage.</i>

1415
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:28,965
<i>Is that true?</i>

1416
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:31,885
<i>It's in the chemistry,
but you can't tell by looking</i>

1417
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:34,387
<i>they all just look like tears.</i>

1418
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:37,307
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

1419
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,480
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1420
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,151
Hello? Hello, I think I need help! I think my...

1421
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:52,155
My husband's bleeding and I think he's...
I think he's been stabbed

1422
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:55,992
and he's dead. He's dead, I think he's dead.

1423
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:59,329
I think he's dead! You need to send someone!

1424
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:00,997
Please!

1425
01:33:09,839 --> 01:33:12,676
You never did take the Paxil, did you?

1426
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:15,178
No.

1427
01:33:15,428 --> 01:33:16,763
Or the Zoloft.

1428
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,348
No.

1429
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:20,350
Only the Ablixa.

1430
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:23,311
Didn't really do anything for me.

1431
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:29,442
So, when did she start paying you?

1432
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:40,370
She always knew you'd turn on her someday

1433
01:33:43,873 --> 01:33:45,709
like you did with Martin.

1434
01:33:48,294 --> 01:33:51,798
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future behavior.

1435
01:33:53,299 --> 01:33:55,135
That's what she said about you.

1436
01:33:57,387 --> 01:34:00,640
And how long do you two
plan on keeping me here?

1437
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:08,648
Why would we ever let you leave?

1438
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:12,068
Because

1439
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,739
maybe there's a better deal.

1440
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,670
BANKS:  <i>Over the course of her confinement,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

1441
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:33,465
<i>with a reasonable degree of medical certainty</i>

1442
01:34:33,506 --> 01:34:37,594
<i>that Emily Taylor
is neither mentally ill or dangerous</i>

1443
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,015
at this time.
I believe with the proper treatment

1444
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:46,394
she is not a threat to herself or others.

1445
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:48,980
In my opinion, she's ready to move onto

1446
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:51,024
the next phase of rehabilitation

1447
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,234
with ongoing supervision, as outlined

1448
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,863
in the outpatient order of conditions.

1449
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:02,035
The risk of relapse back into
a dangerous mental state is low.

1450
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:07,123
I've submitted to the court
the conditions under which I believe

1451
01:35:07,207 --> 01:35:10,919
the order of confinement may be rescinded.

1452
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,714
And do you, Ms. Taylor, understand

1453
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,509
that if you violate the terms of your release,

1454
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:20,387
I will have to issue
a new order of confinement?

1455
01:35:20,428 --> 01:35:21,888
Yes, Your Honor.

1456
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:48,081
MAN: I text her like 20 times a day.

1457
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:51,751
SIEBERT: Zach, you're beginning
to see a pattern, right?

1458
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:56,423
Everyone leaves. It's not a pattern, it's a fact.

1459
01:35:56,756 --> 01:35:59,634
And how does this connect
to you being adopted?

1460
01:35:59,926 --> 01:36:01,720
I think it started there.

1461
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:04,014
And now I'm making it happen.

1462
01:36:04,097 --> 01:36:06,891
You know, I get scared that people
will leave and then

1463
01:36:07,767 --> 01:36:12,397
I, uh, (CLEARS THROAT)
end up making them leave.

1464
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:15,191
Excuse me, Dr. Siebert,
I think someone wants you.

1465
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:22,949
Uh, I'm sorry, Zach, this is an emergency.

1466
01:36:23,658 --> 01:36:25,410
We're gonna have to pick this up next time.

1467
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:27,287
You didn't tell Banks anything, did you?

1468
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:28,997
Of course not.

1469
01:36:29,956 --> 01:36:32,625
How much did you have to pay him
to get me out?

1470
01:36:32,959 --> 01:36:36,129
It doesn't matter. You're out. It's taken care of.

1471
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:38,715
You didn't leave me much choice.

1472
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,926
What did you do with the rest of the money?

1473
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:43,803
Two accounts.

1474
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:46,806
Mine's in Dubai, yours is in Grand Cayman.

1475
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,312
(MOANING) God.

1476
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,899
Are you sure
you didn't tell him anything else?

1477
01:36:55,982 --> 01:36:57,317
Yes, I'm sure.

1478
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,738
Because there are SEC violations.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

1479
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:03,573
I'm exposed here.

1480
01:37:03,823 --> 01:37:05,033
Yes, you are.

1481
01:37:05,116 --> 01:37:06,701
And I'm vulnerable.

1482
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:08,203
(CHUCKLES)

1483
01:37:10,497 --> 01:37:12,499
Oh, God, I missed you.

1484
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,173
You taught me to be such a sad, sad girl.

1485
01:37:22,008 --> 01:37:24,177
Do I look sad now?

1486
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:30,642
Do you remember the first time?

1487
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:31,810
Yeah.

1488
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:33,561
Do you remember how wet I made you?

1489
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:34,646
Oh, yeah.

1490
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:36,523
Do you want to do that again?

1491
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:38,608
Yeah.

1492
01:37:59,462 --> 01:38:01,297
What the fuck is that?

1493
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:03,883
You didn't leave me much choice.

1494
01:38:06,052 --> 01:38:07,721
Oh, my God.

1495
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,062
Dr. Siebert, you're under arrest.

1496
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:17,689
You're being charged with conspiracy to

1497
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:20,066
commit murder and securities fraud.

1498
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,434
BANKS: ...within the next 10 minutes.
I think she's just arrived.

1499
01:38:54,517 --> 01:38:55,977
Yeah, she's here.

1500
01:38:57,687 --> 01:38:59,189
And thank you.

1501
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:07,614
Here I am. Cured at last.

1502
01:39:07,697 --> 01:39:08,698
You're late.

1503
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:10,200
How long do I have to stay?

1504
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:13,578
(SIGHING)

1505
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:19,209
I'm going to put you on some medication.

1506
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:21,127
(LAUGHING) What?

1507
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,255
This is for Thorazine.

1508
01:39:24,798 --> 01:39:27,217
It's a tranquilizer, been around for years.

1509
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:29,260
You know the people shuffling around

1510
01:39:29,302 --> 01:39:31,930
like zombies
with vacant eyes in the prison ward?

1511
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:33,973
They were on Thorazine.

1512
01:39:35,141 --> 01:39:37,477
So this is for Depakote.

1513
01:39:38,478 --> 01:39:40,980
It'll settle your mood,

1514
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:42,649
but hair loss

1515
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:44,818
is a side effect.

1516
01:39:48,321 --> 01:39:49,489
What is this?

1517
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,658
As part of our arrangement,
I'll also be sending you

1518
01:39:51,741 --> 01:39:53,284
to the Gramercy for urine tests

1519
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:56,496
to make certain you take your meds.
And I'm seeing you again

1520
01:39:57,163 --> 01:39:59,582
tomorrow, all right? Try not to be late.

1521
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:01,501
Angry people are frequently late.

1522
01:40:01,543 --> 01:40:02,836
This is bullshit!

1523
01:40:02,877 --> 01:40:05,880
You sound angry.
Have you read the court order?

1524
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:08,425
You have to obey the terms of your release.

1525
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:10,343
Yeah, I'm here.

1526
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:14,347
Those terms mandate that if I believe
you are a danger in any way

1527
01:40:14,597 --> 01:40:17,350
I need to send you
back to hospital immediately.

1528
01:40:17,684 --> 01:40:20,020
If I don't, I'm in violation of the law.

1529
01:40:20,353 --> 01:40:23,648
I got Siebert for you.
I'm a cooperating witness.

1530
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:26,526
- "Very noncompliant..."
- The deal was I testify against her

1531
01:40:26,609 --> 01:40:28,445
- and I get out.
- "...with a history of violence."

1532
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:30,405
- This isn't out, this is fucked!
- "Dangerous."

1533
01:40:30,613 --> 01:40:33,158
I think this needs a new diagnosis.

1534
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,035
Based on what? What did I do?

1535
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:36,369
To the question,

1536
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:39,122
"There are objects and creatures
all around us only I can see,"

1537
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:40,331
you answered, "True."

1538
01:40:40,373 --> 01:40:43,001
- You filled that out!
- Schizoaffective disorder.

1539
01:40:43,043 --> 01:40:44,711
I think I need to send you back.

1540
01:40:50,383 --> 01:40:51,885
Mrs. Taylor!

1541
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:57,557
OFFICER: Emily Taylor!

1542
01:40:58,558 --> 01:41:00,226
Miss Taylor, stop!

1543
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:07,400
Central, we have a 330-20.

1544
01:41:07,734 --> 01:41:10,070
No, he's lying! He's lying!

1545
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:13,615
I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
I promise I'm not sick!

1546
01:41:13,698 --> 01:41:16,785
He's the sick one!
He just wants the money!

1547

1549
01:41:20,997 --> 01:41:23,875
I don't want to go back!
I don't want to go back!

1550
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:33,593
(INAUDIBLE)

1551
01:42:39,325 --> 01:42:41,661
