1
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,007
So, what's on your mind,
Luke?

2
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,543
Nothing.

3
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,049
I mean, I can
make something up.

4
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,552
Fine.
Make something up, then.

5
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:56,555
Okay.

6
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:01,559
Um,

7
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:07,866
- I'm having trouble getting laid.
- Common problem.

8
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,986
How old are you
again, Luke?

9
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,155
Old enough
to be getting laid.

10
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,490
And getting older every day.

11
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:19,293
Have you ever
gotten laid?

12
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:22,546
Two years ago, I fucked
Katie Randall in Battery Park.

13
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:27,417
But she had drank
like two 40-ounces,

14
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,303
and the cops came
and broke us up before we...

15
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:32,722
So, she was drunk?

16
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,557
Home girl weighs,
like, 60 pounds,

17
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:39,512
and she drank two
40-ounce bottles of Crazy Horse.

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,848
- Crazy Horse?
- Look, Dr. Squires...

19
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,351
- Call me Jeff.
- Look, Jeff...

20
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,436
Dr. Squires...

21
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,656
How much
do you need, man?

22
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,408
You're the one
who needs this, son.

23
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,245
- How much?
- A quarter.

24
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:02,500
Well, I can give you two eighths.
It's the same thing.

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,371
- That entitles you to another...
- Forty-eight minutes.

26
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:13,593
Forty-eight minutes. If you go now,
you're getting ripped off.

27
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:17,096
I'm just not feeling all this
feeling shit today, Dr. Squires.

28
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:21,017
Luke, tomorrow's a very big day
in your life. One of the biggest.

29
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,052
And I look at you
and there's...

30
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,723
There's just
no joy, you know?

31
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,728
Tell Stephanie
I say what's up.

32
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:33,812
Mmm-hmm.

33
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,035
Hey, you ever feel
kind of like a fuck up?

34
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,573
Buying weed from the same dude
that deals to your daughter?

35
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:48,910
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter. Exactly.

36
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:53,580
- Later, Mr. Squires.
- I'm a doctor, Luke.

37
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,882
Dr. Squires.

38
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:06,675
<i>I met Dr. Squires
in the spring of '94.</i>

39
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:09,562
<i>First as a client,
then as a patient.</i>

40
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:13,066
<i>At the beginning we didn't
talk about much of anything.</i>

41
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,819
<i>I don't know why I kept seeing him,
to be honest.</i>

42
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,687
<i>But sometimes it's nice
to have someone to talk to.</i>

43
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:22,774
<i>Even if you're
just talking shit.</i>

44
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:28,196
<i>He told me the drug thing was
a cry for help. Maybe he's right.</i>

45
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:32,283
<i>I am Luke Shapiro.
I'm a drug dealer.</i>

46
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,085
<i>Hear my cry.</i>

47
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:48,182
<i>My occupation takes me to
exotic places like Brooklyn and Queens.</i>

48
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:52,602
<i>Now, I like it most in the summer
when no one's around. Just me,</i>

49
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:57,690
<i>the sweaty girls in their short skirts
with their breasts and their panties,</i>

50
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,893
<i>which I like to see
when I can see them.</i>

51
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:06,481
<i>I like fly ladies. I like tank tops.
I like short skirts.</i>

52
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:11,486

Yeah, of course something's
going on at home. What?

- Sure.

Not you, specifically, but me at your age?
It doesn't get any better.

244
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:55,778
- Tell me that's not true.
- Oh, you're fucking living, Luke.

245
00:15:56,312 --> 00:16:00,282
It's great, living. Get your heart broken.
Find yourself face down in the gutter.

You're not
depressed, Luke.

- You're sad. There's a difference.
- No, I'm depressed.

suggest I deal, then?

254
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:27,256
I suggest you talk about it
with a friend.

255
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:31,562

- You have me.

267

269

- Yeah.

But, I mean he's not, like
supposed to tell you, right?

271

and what not?

272
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,858
Whatever. I don't know.
He tells me anyway.

273

I'm not kidding, a chronic masturbator.

- Yeah.

275
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:33,118
- That's crazy.
- The guy jerks off seven times a day.

276
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,620
Literally.
And when his nuts are dry,

277
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,622
he just lies in bed
with his hands down his pants,

278
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,407
like, touching himself
and shit.

279
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,326

- Oh, it's all right. It's all good.

00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:48,300
Luke, can I ask you something?
Just for a sec.

330
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,387
Why are men
so complicated?

331
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,389
Is it because
I'm intimidating?

332
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,892
Am I intimidating because
I play an instrument?

333
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:57,676
No.

334
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:01,896
- You play an instrument?
- No, I know.

335
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,482
I forgot you don't know
anything about me.

336
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:08,653
I mean, I don't really need to know
anything about you, Elanor.

337
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:13,274
I played in a band in the '80s.
Well, in '82 we were really big.

338
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,360
What about you?
Stephanie? Right?

339
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:21,281
You must have some insight
into the mind of men.

340
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:23,784
I mean, he must
be a handful.

341
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:27,037
- Oh, we're not that.
- We're not like that.

342
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,706
I think you're really beautiful
and you have really good chemistry.

343
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:35,212
Don't you think you should try it once
and just see how it feels?

344
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,299
Elanor, you know,

345
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,269
I could just sell you some weed
and we could leave it at that.

346
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,857
Oh, yeah. Okay.
A quarter of bubble gum?

347
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,278
Yeah.

348
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,731
- All right.
- We're gonna...

349
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,035
Yeah. And the door, when you shut it,
it just locks behind you.

350
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,204
Thanks, you guys.

351
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:08,209
Yo, Shapiro, you should take my number.
Okay. Call me some time.

352
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,212
- Call you?
- Yeah.

353
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:18,218
- You mean, like, for weed?
- No, man. To hang out.

354
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,921
This city can get so lonely
when there's nobody to talk to.

355
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:24,340
I think we could
be friends.

356
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:26,976
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends. You know, like,

357
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:30,513
homies, buddies, amigos.
Just take my number, okay?

358
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,402
All right, word.
I'll definitely call you.

359
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:14,221
What do you want
from me, Luke?

360
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:17,524
I don't know.

361
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:23,863
Come on, Luke,
you can tell me.

362
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,732
After all, I'm just
in your head.

363
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,817
Be honest.

364
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:31,986
Do you wanna do
dirty things to me?

365
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,539
Not, like,
especially dirty.

366
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,992
Just, like, normal dirty.

367
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:42,081
Do you want to fuck me?
On the beach? In the sun?

368
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,336
Do you wanna be my friend?

369
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:52,673
- Do you wanna be my best friend?
- Maybe.

370
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,512
Place your hand on my shoulder.
It's warm.

371
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,182
Put your hand
between my thighs.

372
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:06,185
Come to the sun, Luke.
Come.

373
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,904
- Come.
- I'm coming.

374
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,989
Come.

375
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,609
Fuck.

376
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,578
Yo!

377
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,081
What's up, Dad?

378
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:23,619
What's a seven-letter word
for a subatomic particle?

379
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,204
I don't know, Dad.
What's up?

380
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:28,006
Son, would you please
turn down the air conditioning?

381
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,624
The electric bill
is through the roof.

382
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,211
- Dad, it's like 90 degrees out.
- Please, just do it.

383
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:01,288
Such a beautiful evening.

384
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,325
- What are you doing?
- Seating.

385
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:11,831
- For that charity thing.
- Do you wanna go out?

386
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:15,467
Out?

387
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:20,588
You know, out.
Grab a drink, chill.

388
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:25,093
It's a Tuesday night.
And I'm almost 40.

389
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,095
Two.
You're 42.

390
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,769
<i>I've been thinking about your dilemma
a lot recently, Luke.</i>

391
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:16,524
- What's my dilemma?
- The girl thing.

392
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:21,027
Luke, back when I went to school,
drug dealers had no problem getting girls.

393
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:24,281
In fact, that's why
I always wanted to be one.

394
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,783
Were you popular in high school,
Dr. Squires?

395
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:31,789
Well, I wouldn't
say popular, no.

396
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,457
I wasn't one of those cool kids,
if that's what you're asking.

397
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,543
I played baseball,
I was a debater...

398
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:38,712
Did you ever
wanna kill yourself?

399
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:43,633
- Not till much later.
- Then you must have been popular.

400
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,135
I'm not.

401
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:48,638
This has got nothing to do
with being popular, Luke.

402
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:50,639
You're just not
trying hard enough.

403
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:56,595
You must think about it.
The different scenarios.

404
00:26:57,096 --> 00:27:01,099
Random sex in phone booths,
chance encounters in discos,

405
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,102
the way they smell,
the things they say,

406
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,103
even when they're saying
nothing at all.

407
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:11,491
I mean,

408
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:15,779
I'm married, so I don't contemplate
that type of thing.

409
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,082
No.
Of course not.

410
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:23,620
Surely there's
someone, Luke.

411
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,874
Yeah.

412
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:31,510
This one girl.

413
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:35,766
That's fantastic, Luke. Who is she?
Does Stephanie know her?

414
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,849
No.

415
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,854
No, she goes
to school downtown.

416
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:47,642
- So what's the problem?
- She just wants to be friends.

417
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,813
- What makes you think that?
- She said so.

418
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,565
Make her like you, Luke.
That's what I did with my wife.

419
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:57,568
How did you do that?

420
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:00,572
Be her friend.
Confide in her, earn her trust.

421
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,574
Then, when you are
least threatening to her,

422
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:06,460
grab her and stick your tongue so far down
her throat she starts to gag from pleasure.

423
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:09,545
- Can I grab her tits, too?
- Baby steps, Luke.

424
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:11,547
Right.

425
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:13,800
Pursue her, Luke.
You're the perfect age for it.

426
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:17,670
You haven't yet been systematically numbed
to the allure of romance.

427
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:18,972
You still have
your youthful...

428
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,592
I got it.

429
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:26,012
Young men need sex, Luke.
All men, actually.

430
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:30,932
I can get you a hooker,
if you like.

431
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,935
God, I was this close
to respecting you.

432
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:36,439
Big mistake, Luke.
Call your girl.

433
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,327
You don't need medication, Luke.
You just need to get laid.

434
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:47,248
<i> It's a surprise attack.
I don't want these...</i>

435
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,200
<i> What is the postmark on that?</i>

436
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,035
<i>What do you mean?
I just got it today.</i>

437
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:52,953
<i>I just wanna know
what the postmark is.</i>

438
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,423
<i>- When did you get it?
- I don't wanna talk about the postmark!</i>

439
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,472
Oh, my God!

440
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,034
Jeffrey!

441
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,321
<i> Hello?</i>

442
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:34,326
Hello?

443
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,327
Um...

444
00:29:36,328 --> 00:29:39,831
- I'm looking for...
- Luke?

445
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:45,503
- Luke, is that you?
- Dr. Squires?

446
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:47,922
It's okay, Luke.
I know why you're calling.

447
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:52,677
- You do?
- The beaver hunt.

448
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:56,179
The pussy quest.

449
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,483
I can help you, Luke.
Let's grab a drink.

450
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:02,569
<i>I got just the place.</i>

451
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,439
All right.

452
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:17,249
It's strange.
This place used to be packed.

453
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:21,336
The city's not the same anymore, Luke.
This place,

454
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:25,340
it really used to be
something down here,

455
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,460
the drugs, the girls,
the music,

456
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,463
the fucking music.

457
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,432
Speaking of which.

458
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,272
<i># "Season of The Witch"
by Donovan #</i>

459
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:49,529
What kind of music
do you like, Luke?

460
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,033
Tribe Called Quest.
Pharcyde. De La Soul.

461
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:58,538
That's rap, right?
I don't know much about that stuff.

462
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,043
- I'll make you a mixtape.
- I'd like that.

463
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:07,796
Maybe I'll make
you one, too.

464
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:10,967
Some Bowie, maybe
a little Pink Floyd.

465
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:15,554
Some classical.
Brahms, Haydn.

466
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,510
Haydn?
Yeah, Haydn's dope.

467
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,680
- You serious?
- No, Dr. Squires.

468
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,900
Hey, Luke.

469
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:35,105
Why couldn't Mozart find his teacher?
Because he was Haydn.

470
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:38,993
That's not funny.

471
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:42,196
Yo, order me
another drink, please?

472
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,782
Another Bud,
right here.

473
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:51,421
<i># Must be the season
of the witch #</i>

474
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:54,924
Lucas, I hate my wife.

475
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:59,678
<i># Must be the season
of the witch #</i>

476
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:03,765
- I hate my parents.
- I need to get laid.

477
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,468
We both need to get laid.

478
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,023
Lust.

479
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:16,610
Luke, I've never cheated
on my wife before, ever.

480
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,111
But I want to now,
it is my mission.

481
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:21,064
You have no idea
how much I want to.

482
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,901
Sometimes it's right
to do the wrong thing,

483
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,787
and right now
is one of those times.

484
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:32,659
But we need to
fix ourselves first.

485
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:37,047
- You need fixing?
- Lucas, I need a whole lot of fixing.

486
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:44,836
- Union?
- Luke, hi.

487
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,422
<i>I can't believe
you're here!</i>

488
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,892
We came in to check out
all the old weird people.

489
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,097
Oh, wait.

490
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:00,017
- Don't even think about it.
- Is this the mystery girl?

491
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,737
No, but it doesn't mean
she's fair game.

492
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:10,078
This is Gruden. My date to the Midsummer
Night Cancer Ball. It's for charity.

493
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:15,081
He's an exchange student
from Rotterdam. He's a joke.

494
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:19,919
Yo, what up? What happened to
home boy you were with in the park?

495
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,089
Albert?
Oh, he's so amateur.

496
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:26,509
Gruden, I'm Haydn.

497
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,795
- Like the classical guy?
- Yes.

498
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:30,962
I was named after him.

499
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:35,800
- That's so awesome.
- Do you like the Grateful Dead?

500
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:38,471
Followed them for four years
after college.

501
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,224
Whoa!

Oh, what do you
call that thing?

509
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:59,907
- It's a blunt.
- It's a blunt. I like that.

510
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:02,492
<i> - Where was I?
- The second set.</i>

511
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:05,295
Oh, yeah.

512
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:09,800
They opened up
with Casey Jones.

513
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:11,801
# Driving that train #

514
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,805
And that's right
when the acid kicked in.

515
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:16,723
Amazing!

516
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:22,311
- Your dad's mad cool.
- He's not my dad.

517
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:28,151
Luke is very into the rap of The Soul Tribe
and many of their other songs.

518
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,652
- Tell her, Luke.
- Tell me.

519
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,606
Tell her. Go ahead, talk.
Talk to her.

520
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:40,911
- I'm gonna go get another beer.
- Gruden, yo!

Goldilocks.

525
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,124
I am one of the three bears.
Guess which one.

526
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,627
- Which one?
- Baby bear.

527
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:48,058
The game's not called
Four Minutes in Heaven, Luke.

528
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:49,643
We have like
three minutes.

529
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:52,678
All right, that's enough, kids.
You are all too young to be in here anyway.

530
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:55,682
Oh, come on.
They're all 18.

531
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,154
Since when is
the drinking age 21?

532
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:03,656
<i>
Bye, Haydn!</i>

533
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:07,159
- Since forever.
- Fucking Giuliani.

534
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:12,498
Look around you, Luke,
is this what you want for your mind?

535
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,833
For your life? You want it to be
like this city?

536
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:20,337
Sweep all the nasty bits under the rug?
Make everything okay?

537
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:26,176
He puts the homeless people in prison, you know?
These people are sick, mentally.

538
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:30,097
They're being put in jail.
What do you think about that, Luke?

539
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,049
- Doesn't seem right.
- No.

540
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,635
No, it doesn't. That's why
I don't want you on medication, Luke.

541
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:38,471
You may as well open up a Starbucks
in your brain. You follow me?

542
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:41,475
Don't jump for the quick fix.
This whole fucking city wants a quick fix.

543
00:36:41,975 --> 00:36:43,861
Embrace your pain.
Make it a part of you.

544
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:47,314
You don't want to be like them.
I don't want you to be like them.

545
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,816
So, you've never taken
any of that stuff?

546
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:54,954
Jesus, Luke, I'm on all of it.
I don't want you to be like me, either.

547
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:57,657
Sex is a drug too,
you know?

548
00:36:58,157 --> 00:37:00,376
More powerful than any
synthetic pharmaceutical.

549
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,995
Yeah? Is that why you go around
trying to fuck little girls?

550
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:05,412
That was just
second base.

551
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:08,500
Oh, second base, huh?
Hey, what happened to getting fixed first?

552
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,002
Sometimes getting laid
is getting fixed, you know?

553
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:15,006
Except for dogs.
Now break out that blunt.

554
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:18,510
- This is a joint.
- Joint. I know that.

555
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:29,102
- Why'd you do that, Luke?
- Tag this wall?

556
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:32,939
I'm just kind of putting my stamp on it,
fucking let people know I was here.

557
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,325
- It's illegal, isn't it?
- It is.

558
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:39,027
- May I?
- You may.

559
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:41,614
- Just be careful.
- Careful.

560
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:52,758
M.D.

561
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:01,549
- Excellent penmanship, Dr. Squires.
- Why, thank you.

562
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,218
- Oh, no, I thank you.
- No, no, no, I thank you.

563
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,854
- Oh, you're welcome.
- M.D.

564
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:13,026
- Hey! You two!
- Fuck!

565
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,028
Stop right there!

566
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,616
Forrest Gump, Luke.

567
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:22,369
- What are you talking about?
- Running.

568
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:34,998
Oh!

569
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:49,978
Who put you up to this, boys? Giuliani?
You got some kind of quota to fill?

570
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,480
Used to be,
you could lick a sheet of acid,

571
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,481
hold up a bank,
fuck a whore in Times Square

572
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:57,484
without any of you batting an eyelash.
Now, one blunt, we're in the clink.

573
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,987
This whole city's fucked.
We give you character!

574
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,823
Hey, shut the hell up!

575
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,075
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, now, brother.
Join the revolution!

576
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,110
- What are you in here for?
- I stabbed my wife in the pussy.

577
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,081
Oh, wow!

578
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,083
Yo, Squires, maybe we should
keep this on the DL, all right?

579
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,085
- Yo, DL!
- Quiet!

580
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,955
- Hey, shut up!
- Please, come on!

581
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:27,762
Shapiro!
Squires!

582
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,514
You made bail.

583
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,468
Bail.

584
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:39,640
- Hi there, Stepdaddy.
- Hi, precious.

585
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,859
- Hey, Steph.
- Shapiro.

586
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,445
Thanks a lot for getting
my stepdad thrown in prison.

587
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:47,314
You know, you're really
a great influence on him.

588
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,868
- But it wasn't my fault.
- It was my fault.

589
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:53,071
I know. I was kidding.
Anyway...

590
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:56,823
- What are you doing today?
- Shapiro's busy.

591
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:58,825
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

592
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:03,047
Okay, well, look, Squires, why don't you
just take the car back to the garage,

593
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:07,133
and I won't tell my mom
about this whole prison thing

594
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:09,636
and Shapiro's
coming with me.

595
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:13,472
Don't touch
my daughter, Luke.

596
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:14,641
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter.

597
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:20,763
So, what's the deal
with you and my stepdad?

598
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:23,683
Are you guys,
like, gay together?

599
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,187
- We're friends, I guess.
- Weird.

600
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,190
Not really.

601
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,610
- He's very immature.
- I know.

602
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:39,696
Him and my mom fight about that
all the time.

603
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,198
I know.

604
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,586
We got more in common
than you think, Steph.

00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,473
Don't you wanna know
where I was last night?

609
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:10,025
Do you want to tell me?

610
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:13,445
- I was having an affair.
- Good for you.

611
00:41:14,897 --> 00:41:17,148
I was in prison.
I went to jail.

612

I mean, not like a loser-loser,
you know, but

Yo, Mom.

678
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:13,954
Hello.

679
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,013
Can I make you
a sandwich?

680
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,549
Absolutely.

681
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:34,889
- Where have you been?
- I think I'm in love.

682
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,279
Well, that's wonderful.
Who's the lucky girl?

683
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,281
Stephanie Squires.

684
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,881
- You're up late.
- Oh, hi. So are you.

685
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:05,385
You have a nice day
with Luke?

686
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:09,839
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

687
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,762
Do you like him?

688
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:20,348
I don't know.
What do you care?

689
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:23,768
Do you like-like him?

690
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:25,820
Maybe, yeah.

691
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:30,741
- He's a drug dealer.
- Yeah, I know. Thank you.

692
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:36,613
Look, I'm really not in the mood for a
father daughter moment right now, Dr. Squires.

693
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:40,034
Well, may I watch TV
with you?

694
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:43,788
- Whatever.
- Cool.

695
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,293
So, fill me in.

696
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:56,800
Well, basically there's been, like,
this big misunderstanding,

697
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:03,305
- and Mr. Furley thinks Jack's gay.
- I think I've seen this one.

698
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:09,144
Oh, good morning, Luke.
You're up early.

699
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:13,148
Couldn't sleep.
It's mad hot.

700
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:19,954
What's that?

701
00:47:26,828 --> 00:47:29,796
- We're getting evicted?
- Keep your voice down.

702
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:33,300
I'll take care of it.
I've got a very big deal coming through.

703
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:34,834
It's not a problem.

704
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:37,838
- Where will we go?
- I don't know. Downtown, maybe? Jersey?

705
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:40,840
Not everyone has to live
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

706
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,341
Well, I can't live
in Jersey.

707
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:44,845
Look, I messed up,
and I'm trying to fix it.

708
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:49,347
- Then fix it.
- All I can do is try.

709
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,734
Be a man, Dad.
Fix it.

710
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:55,938
What can I do, Luke?
Deal pot?

711
00:47:57,523 --> 00:47:59,942
I don't think you'd be
very good at that.

She's not for you.

What's so bad
about me?

720
00:48:44,484 --> 00:48:48,036
She'll break your heart, Luke.
She's just bored.

721
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:53,041
- That's not true.
- Fine. Ignore my advice.

722
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,128
What? You think she's hot?
You want to fuck her?

723
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:58,629

you've wasted your entire life

724
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,050

in common with, Luke.

725
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:07,053

Remember living?

727
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,514
And who said anything
about my entire life?

728
00:49:17,064 --> 00:49:21,733
This is it, Luke. This is your life.
The choices you make.

729
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:25,237
And I guess you've chosen
to be a hoodlum drug dealer,

730
00:49:25,238 --> 00:49:27,657
who latches onto the only girl
who'll pay attention to him,

731
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:30,527
simply because he's scared
of being alone.

732
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,030
And what about you?

733
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:39,034
Telling me not
to take medication.

734
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:44,038
Your "You don't want me to be like
Times Square" fucking metaphor.

735
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,041
What the fuck was that?

736
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:52,046

You're on half that shit.

737

hanging out with me, anyway?

your own age?

Right.

791
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:57,159
So, what are you doing
this weekend?

792
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,160
- Nothing.
- Good.

793
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:03,163
My mom and Squires are going to
Barbados or something,

794
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:05,165
so my house in
Fire Island is free.

795
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:09,169

to join me for some beachcombing.

00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,672

797
00:54:13,674 --> 00:54:15,676

a honeymoon.

798
00:54:17,177 --> 00:54:19,178
What'll I do?

799
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:22,182
You know what people do
on honeymoons, right?

800
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:25,686
I think so.

801
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:00,717
It's nice.

802
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:04,672
- You want some wine?
- Got anything stronger?

803
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:10,727
- Whiskey?
- Yeah, I'll try.

804
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:14,230
- Very well.
- You got anything to mix it with?

805
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:19,235
- Uh, there's some juice boxes.
- Yeah, that's good.

806

Yo, I made this for you.

807
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:49,130
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

808
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,691
This whiskey's
a lot of drunk.

809
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,694
No shit.

810
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,698
So, let me
ask you something.

811
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,700
Uh-oh.

812
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,204
What's going on here?

813
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,205
What do you mean?

814
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:20,709
I've never been
in this situation before.

815
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,413
And what situation
is that?

816
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:26,966
Chilling

817

you know,

820
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,432
what happens?

821
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,570
What happens when
everybody comes back?

822
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,073
What do you mean?
Like, do I turn into a pumpkin?

823
00:56:54,274 --> 00:56:55,776
Basically, yeah.

824
00:56:57,277 --> 00:56:58,779
I don't know.

825
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:03,282
It doesn't matter.

826
00:57:04,283 --> 00:57:05,785
It doesn't matter?

827
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:08,371
Why not?

828
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:13,876
Because how could anything
possibly matter right now?

829
00:57:18,096 --> 00:57:20,598
You know what
your problem is, Shapiro?

830
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:26,604
It's that you just have this really shitty
way of looking at things, you know?

831
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:27,605
I don't have
that problem.

832
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:30,107
I just look
at the dopeness.

833
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:34,612
But, you, it's like you just look
at the wackness, you know?

834
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:37,615
- I do?
- Yeah.

835
00:57:39,617 --> 00:57:43,120
Well, all you gotta do
is just look at me.

836
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:47,123
- All right.
- And kiss me.

837
00:57:47,124 --> 00:57:48,124
Kiss you.

838
00:57:57,133 --> 00:57:58,133
Oh...

839
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,932
Take these off.

840
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:34,918
- Condom? Condom?
- That's what the pill's for.

841
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:48,965
- You're not really hard.
- No?

842
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:53,469
Oh, man. Fuck!

843
00:58:57,773 --> 00:58:59,274
Here.

844
00:59:04,479 --> 00:59:06,980
You know, I never
drank coffee before.

845
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:11,401
Really? I drink it all the time.
It's like Ritalin.

846
00:59:11,402 --> 00:59:16,656
Yo, Steph, you know, I'm not
trying to be a bitch or nothing, but...

847
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:20,460
- What?
- I've kind of never had sex before.

848
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,747
- You're a virgin?
- No!

849
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:25,248
Nah!

850
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:31,171
- I just never officially had sex.
- Okay.

851
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:34,224
I think that's why
I'm nervous, you know?

852
00:59:36,225 --> 00:59:38,176
That's why the thing
with my dick.

853
00:59:38,177 --> 00:59:43,098
Oh, Shapiro, don't worry about it.
It's okay.

854
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:45,600
I've done it, like,
a hundred times.

855
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:49,405
- I can teach you.
- I'm down.

857
00:59:53,992 --> 00:59:57,911
- Probably.
- Okay.

858
00:59:57,912 --> 01:00:00,749

- Uneventful.
- You got a nice tan there, Steph.

Yeah?

909
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,615
Anyway, I'm going to bed.
I just wanted to say hey.

It's, uh,
it's me, Luke.

916

Uh...

917
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:14,798
I know you said
you'd call me this week,

918
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,300
and, uh,

919
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:19,803
it's a week from
when you said that, so...

920
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:24,807
I mean, I guess there's still time
in the week, technically.

921
01:09:24,808 --> 01:09:26,810
I mean, technically,
there's a couple of hours left.

922
01:09:28,812 --> 01:09:30,780
I hope you're
aware of that.

923
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:34,867
Look, are you not calling me back
'cause I said I love you?

924
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:39,372
'Cause that's stupid.
I mean...

925
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:46,378
I didn't mean it really,
and, you know, even if I did,

926
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:50,882
I'm going to college in three weeks,
so it's not like it matters.

927
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:57,589
You know what?

928
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:00,592
Fuck it.

929
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:03,395
I meant it.

930
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:06,146
I do love you.

931
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:08,182
All right?
I'm not scared to say it.

932
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:13,186
I fucking love you, okay?
And if that scares you,

933
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:16,690
well, then fuck you.
Huh? You know what?

934
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:20,694
Fuck off, all right?
You're a fucking bitch. Peace out forever!

935
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,008

01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:41,930

937
01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:44,850

01:10:47,269 --> 01:10:51,772

Luke, fuck her. Fuck them all.

01:11:25,671 --> 01:11:28,174
- or something?
- No.

946
01:11:29,592 --> 01:11:31,677
Well, I need
your help.

947
01:11:34,513 --> 01:11:37,398
What is it, Lucas?

948
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:40,402
You know anybody
who could use some weed?

949
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:44,272

I need to unload this month.

950
01:11:48,193 --> 01:11:52,196

work something out.

<i># "Long Shot Kick De Bucket"

952
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:03,039
All right, if we're gonna do this,
Dr. Squires, we're gonna do it right.

953
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,208
- All right? You gotta be more careful.
- Don't worry, Luke.

954
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:08,293
- I'm not going back to prison.
- Good.

955
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:12,131
Let's establish a few ground rules.
Number one, we use pagers.

956
01:12:12,715 --> 01:12:14,684
Someone pages us, we call them back
from a payphone.

957
01:12:15,134 --> 01:12:17,270
We never use home phones
for this type of stuff. Never.

958
01:12:17,854 --> 01:12:21,356
That's great, Luke. I already have
a pager for my medical practice.

959
01:12:21,357 --> 01:12:22,857
All right, good.

960
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:27,728
Number two, we sell weed by the gram,
by the eighth, and by the ounce.

961
01:12:27,729 --> 01:12:31,732
Gram's the highest profit margin,
but it's also the most potent,

962
01:12:31,733 --> 01:12:33,451
that's why we try to encourage people
to buy the grams.

963
01:12:33,452 --> 01:12:37,037
Principal Edwards, I can give you
two grams for 125 bucks, all right?

964
01:12:37,038 --> 01:12:40,039
Anything less than that,
I don't make a profit.

965
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,043
You always were
very good at math, Luke.

966
01:12:44,545 --> 01:12:46,546
All right,
11 grand,

967
01:12:46,547 --> 01:12:49,549

I can't believe this is
a fifth floor walk-up.

998
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,121
Oh, please behave yourself,
Dr. Squires, all right?

999
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:05,175
- This is my connect.
- Who the fuck lives in a fifth floor...

1000
01:15:05,176 --> 01:15:07,211
Hi, Luke.

1001
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:10,098
- ...walk-up. Hello.
- Hi.

1002
01:15:11,932 --> 01:15:15,719
Come on in.
I'm, uh, I'm Elanor.

1003
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:18,888
I'm, um, Haydn.

1004
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:23,393
- No need for aliases with her, Squires.
- Oh, well then, I'm Jeff.

1005
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,112
Oh, I'm still Elanor.

1006
01:15:33,202 --> 01:15:37,790
- So, how much you need?
- A quarter.

1007
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:42,960
I'm going to see that guy
in New Hampshire.

1008
01:15:42,961 --> 01:15:50,002
I was just packing and stuff and then I was
thinking I need some grass. I almost forgot.

1009
01:15:52,888 --> 01:15:54,306
So, that's how
this happened.

1010
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,891
- So, a quarter, then?
- A quarter. Yeah.

1011
01:15:56,892 --> 01:15:59,226
He doesn't
appreciate you.

1012
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:02,563
- How do you know that?
- He couldn't possibly.

1013
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:06,267
- That's a compliment, right?
- Ma'am.

1014
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:12,238
Here it is.
And I have this for you, too.

1015
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,739
Thanks.

1016
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,858
It's the
greatest hits?

1017
01:16:15,859 --> 01:16:19,361
Well, actually, it's more like
three songs, mixes...

1018
01:16:19,362 --> 01:16:22,165
Well, really it's more
like one song.

1019
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,751
You were in
Emergency Breakthrough?

1020
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:27,671
- Yeah.
- No shit.

1021
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:30,705
- I love your music.
- What?

1022
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:32,040
Oh...

1023
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,791
Mmm!

1024
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:36,878
Wow. See, Luke? I told you
I know a little about music.

1025
01:16:36,879 --> 01:16:39,380
I keep trying to
broaden his horizons,

1026
01:16:39,381 --> 01:16:41,717
you know, rap music isn't
everything. I tell him, but...

1027
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:43,800
You should listen
to this woman, Luke.

1028
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:46,803
She's as smart and talented
as she is beautiful.

1029
01:16:46,804 --> 01:16:48,305
# Wear and tear...? #

1030
01:16:48,306 --> 01:16:52,643
- He's really out of his mind, right?
- Total fucking lunatic.

1031

1032
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:04,287

ignoring me, huh?</i>

1033
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,656
<i>That's a shame,</i>

1034
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:14,246
because it would be really cool to hang
out or whatever before I go to school.

1035
01:17:16,749 --> 01:17:20,252
The school year is rapidly approaching,
as you know.

1036
01:17:22,755 --> 01:17:24,256
And...

1037
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,261
I miss you.

1038
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,480
<i> - But I love you.
- No, you don't.</i>

1039
01:17:33,481 --> 01:17:36,483
<i>Please, Kristen. Don't leave me
all alone. I can't be all alone.</i>

1040
01:17:36,484 --> 01:17:39,987
<i>Cut the crap, Jeffrey.
You asked for it.</i>

1041
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,274
Stephanie?
Are you leaving, too?

1042
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:48,779
No. Stephie will be here
for the next few weeks.

1043
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:50,697
I'll deal with all the details
when I'm back.

1044
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:52,199
Details?

1045
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,952
Please, say something
to your mother, Steph.

1046
01:17:55,953 --> 01:17:59,006
Jeffrey, leave her
out of this.

1047
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:02,958
Sweetheart,

1048
01:18:02,959 --> 01:18:04,927

- What?

1053
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:38,576
- Justin?
- Yo, why you calling me Shapiro?

1054
01:18:40,578 --> 01:18:42,046
<i>No reason.</i>

1055
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,166
How was, um, Florence?

1056
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,750
Oh, it was crazy, yo,
mad crazy.

1057
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:50,252
Yo, I'll tell you
all about it.

1058
01:18:50,253 --> 01:18:53,556
We're hitting this club
downtown tonight. You coming?

1059
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:56,309
Yeah, totally.

1060
01:18:56,676 --> 01:18:58,060
Yeah.

1061
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:01,146
- Doll your shit up.
- Okay, call me later.

1062
01:19:01,147 --> 01:19:02,648
- Peace.
- Bye.

1063
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,375
Yo, yo, yo,
what happened?

1064
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:35,879
- What happened?
- What do you think?

1065
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:38,964
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Dad. I have money!

1066
01:19:38,965 --> 01:19:41,467
- Put that down. I got money!
- Leave the guys alone.

1067
01:19:41,468 --> 01:19:44,471
- Let them do their job.
- Dad, I got $26,000,

1068
01:19:44,888 --> 01:19:46,473
that should be
more than enough.

1069
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:48,691
- Luke.
- What?

1070
01:19:50,276 --> 01:19:51,644
It's not enough.

1071
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:54,864
It's not even close.

1072
01:19:58,317 --> 01:20:02,621
You said you'd fix it.
You said you'd fix it, right?

1073
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:05,406
I need you to go upstairs
and pack up your room, okay?

1074
01:20:08,076 --> 01:20:10,794
Go on upstairs.
Pack up your room.

1075
01:20:10,795 --> 01:20:13,163
Hey, be careful with that,
would you, guys?

1076
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:15,216
Are you being careful
with my father's silver?

Nothing's okay.

1160
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,242
None of it's
gonna be okay,

1161
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,745
everything is going
to be terrible.

1162
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,332
I tried to kill myself
twice today.

1163
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:17,587
Once with pills, turns out I have
a very high tolerance for those.

1164
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:22,425
Next by hanging.
The hanging is very hard. The weight.

1165
01:26:22,426 --> 01:26:26,812
You lose too much weight,
or you put on too much weight...

1166
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:30,398
Oh, well.

1167
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:33,603
- Dr. Squires, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1168
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:37,573
I just...
I'm done.

1169
01:26:39,942 --> 01:26:44,246
This is it. Last call, Luke.
I'm glad you're here to see me off.

1170
01:26:50,535 --> 01:26:53,204
- Where you going, Dr. Squires?
- In there.

1171
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:56,124
I'm ready to die, Luke.

1172
01:26:57,508 --> 01:26:59,259
Stop fucking around, Jeff.

1173
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:03,347
I'm the weird old guy, remember?
You said so yourself.

1174
01:27:04,848 --> 01:27:08,552
Look, I didn't mean it, all right?
You're my friend.

1175
01:27:10,054 --> 01:27:11,939
You're my best friend.

1176
01:27:12,222 --> 01:27:15,274
So just, please,
would you come back for me?

1177
01:27:15,275 --> 01:27:19,361
You're not
worth it, Shapiro!

1178
01:27:19,362 --> 01:27:22,364
So that was all
bullshit, right?

1179
01:27:22,365 --> 01:27:26,703
All that stuff about embracing your pain,
making it a part of you?

1180
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:31,957
You can't do this!

1181
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:35,493
You can't just give up.

1182
01:27:35,494 --> 01:27:38,913
Life is hard and it's full of pain
and what not,

1183
01:27:38,914 --> 01:27:42,000
but we take it
'cause there's great stuff, too!

1184
01:27:43,501 --> 01:27:45,752
And we can do it
because we have friends!

1185
01:27:45,753 --> 01:27:47,838
Because we help
each other!

1186
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:51,842
Stop! Stop!

1187
01:28:58,455 --> 01:29:00,706
Luke!

1188
01:29:30,235 --> 01:29:33,737
That was really fucking cheesy,
what you said just then.

1189
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:40,744
There's enough assholes
in the world, Dr. Squires.

1190
01:29:42,746 --> 01:29:44,748
Don't be another one.

1191
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:48,251
Now you sound like me.

1192
01:29:58,261 --> 01:30:01,763
You wanna go to the city
to fill out my prescriptions?

1193
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:07,269
Sounds good.

1194
01:30:20,898 --> 01:30:22,565
Thank you, Luke.

1195
01:30:22,566 --> 01:30:23,651
How you feeling?

1196
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:31,125
Please, don't
do that again.

1197
01:30:32,909 --> 01:30:35,662
- All right? You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

1198
01:30:37,664 --> 01:30:39,883
Dr. Squires,
I gotta get back.

1199
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:43,168
To my folks.

1200
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,971
Where you living
these days, Luke?

1201
01:30:45,972 --> 01:30:48,056
We're moving in
with my grandparents.

1202
01:30:50,058 --> 01:30:53,427
- In New Jersey.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1203
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:55,514
I'm sorry to live it.

1204
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,902
I'm sorry about
Stephanie, too.

1205
01:31:05,406 --> 01:31:07,408
She would have been
a lucky girl.

1206
01:31:10,778 --> 01:31:12,613
Good luck in school.

1207
01:31:15,116 --> 01:31:19,419
Try and fuck a black girl.
I never got the chance at college.

1208
01:31:24,207 --> 01:31:26,927
Baby steps.

1209
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,847
It'll be okay.

1210
01:31:31,848 --> 01:31:34,850
- I can't answer that.
- It wasn't a question.

1211
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:40,055
- Peace, Doc.
- Peace out, Luke.

1212
01:31:54,652 --> 01:31:56,237
Luke. Hey.

1213
01:31:57,238 --> 01:31:58,789
Hey.

1214
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,910
- Look, man, I just wanted to say...
- Do me a favor, Steph.

1215
01:32:02,911 --> 01:32:05,913
Don't say nothing, okay?

1216
01:32:06,413 --> 01:32:08,498
Just stand there
till I leave.

1217
01:32:08,999 --> 01:32:11,001
I wanna remember this.

1218
01:32:12,502 --> 01:32:16,006
- I've never done it before.
- Never done what?

1219
01:32:19,059 --> 01:32:21,060
Had my heart broken.

Luke?

1224
01:33:14,143 --> 01:33:15,645
Have you had
any more thoughts

1225
01:33:16,145 --> 01:33:19,197
about what you're gonna be
as far as a profession goes?

1226
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,650
- Mom, he's got time.
- I'm just asking.

1227
01:33:22,651 --> 01:33:24,702
Actually, I'm thinking
about becoming a shrink.

1228

Psychology!

1229
01:33:26,788 --> 01:33:29,790
It's not quite the shoe business,
but it's a very interesting field.
