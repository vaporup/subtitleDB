The next lottery is tonight.

36
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,476
“The next lottery is tonight.“

37
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

38
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,790
- What about you?
- Three.

39
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,991
Three. I've been here seven.

40
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,914
If I do the math. that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

41
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,830
I'm such a loser.

42
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,671
Sir.

43
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,798
Yeah. you.

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,234
Swipe.

45
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,071
Gandu Three Echo. You've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

46
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,040
Yes. I had a very small
emotional outburst. sir.

47
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,351

Stretch.

52
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,635
One more breath in.

53
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,353
- Listen.
- I tried to do better.

54
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,116
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

55
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,517

Lincoln Six Echo. choices are fruit.

57
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,159
No bacon today?

You got a nutrition flag.
Means no bacon.

59
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,830
Then I'll have two eggs. over easy.
not too runny. and a side of sausages.

60
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,389
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

61
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,517
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip. Six Echo.

Next.

68
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,231
Jordan Two Delta.

69
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,152

So where were you the other day?
We missed you.

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,958
That's nice of you to say. sweetheart.

74
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,199
Get you anything else?

75
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,399
Maybe a little bacon.

76
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,032
- No. it says I shouldn't.
- Go ahead.

77
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,596
Four-- Five pieces. please.

78
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,429
Thank you.

79
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,074
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

80
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,593
Back on your diet. huh?

81
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,074
You kidding? I love this.

82
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,669
Better eat up.
You'll need your strength tonight.

83
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,071
- Is that a challenge?
- I promise I'll go easy on you.

84
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,677
Please separate. Find your seats now.

85
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,875
“'Who wants Sally?‘ said Dick.

86
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,156
'I do.' said Jane.

87
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,959
'I cannot find Sally.

88
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,352
Get up. Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.‘

89
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,872
'ls Sally here?'“

90
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,230
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

91
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,718
What did you do wrong this time.
tough guy?

92
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,632
Sir?

93
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,552
You wanted to see me?

94
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,393
Yes. Please.

95
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,153
Please sit down.

96
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,875
So how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

97
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,110
Not so good. I guess.

98
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,472
Why do you say that?

99
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,154
Well. if I'm here.
it means I'm not so good.

100
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,239
That's a rather negative association.

101
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,439
My only job is to see that you're happy.
that things are okay with you.

102
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,999
Right.

103
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,999
Your file shows that you've been
interacting regularly...

104
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,434
...with Jordan Two Delta.

105
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,432
There's no law against friendship.

106
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,550
No. we encourage it. but obviously.
proximity could become a concern.

107
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,478
I know the rules of proximity.

108
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,434
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

109
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,273
Proficient at work.
exercising rigorously.

110
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,750
But screening has picked up
some trace levels...

111
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,748
...changes in your metabolism.
and you've been having nightmares.

112
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,510
Are you saying there's something
wrong with me?

113
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,270
Why don't you tell me
about your dream.

114
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,033
Well. it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat. headed to The Island.

115
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,158
A boat? What kind of boat?

116
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,914
A nice boat.

117
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,479
Draw it for me. would you?

118
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,270
So you're heading toward The Island.

119
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,112
What happens then?

120
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,599
l drown.

121
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,353
ReaHy?

122
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,273
Why do you think that is?

123
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,192
ldon't know. You tell me.

124
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,794
- Are you afraid of winning?
- Why would I be afraid?

125
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,518
You tell me.

126
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,675
What's troubling you. Lincoln?

127
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,392
Well. it's--

128
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,358
It's just--

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,670
All right. Tuesday night is tofu night...

130
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,389
...and I'm asking myself. "Who decided
that everyone here likes tofu?“

131
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,198
And what is tofu. anyway?

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,159
And why can't I have bacon?

133
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,517
l line up every morning and I'm not
allowed bacon for my breakfast.

134
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,629
And tell me--
Let's talk about all the white.

135
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,552
Why is everyone
always wearing white?

136
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,159
It's impossible to keep clean.

137
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,153
I always get the gray stripe.
I never get any color.

138
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,318
And I hand it in to be cleaned.
and someone cleans it...

139
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,755
...and folds it neatly back in my drawer.
but who?

140
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,110
Who is that person? I don't know.

141
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,072
ljust-- I wanna know answers.
and I wish that there was more.

142
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,839
More?

143
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,073
Yeah. More than just waiting
to go to The Island.

144
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,553
Lincoln...

145
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,238
...it's your nature to question things.

146
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,994
But don't you realize
how lucky you are?

147
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,872
That you survived the contamination.

148
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,794
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

149
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,872
That. Lincoln. is your purpose.

150
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,635
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to The Island too?

151
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,673
No.

152
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,320
My responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate.

153
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,600
That's why people like me.
my staff and supervisors. we....

154
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,076
We can't win the lottery.

155
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,396
Let me see that.

156
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,998
You draw well.

157
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,388
“Renova tio. “

158
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,910
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It's always in my dream.

159
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,511
I'd like to run some tests
on you. Lincoln.

160
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,473
- What sort of tests?
- Nice tests.

161
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,349
Come with me.

162
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,998
Take a seat.

163
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,111
Okay. let's get you comfortable.
Swing back.

164
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,151
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

165
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,151
Totally harmless.

166
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,028
Don't worry. it's painless.

167
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,719
- It hurts.
- Not really.

168
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,433
- Yeah. it does!
- No. it doesn't.

169
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,790
Yeah. it really. really does!

170
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,718
The microsensors will move along
your optic nerve.

171
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,192
They'll be uploading readings to us
over the next 24 hours...

172
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,794
...after which you'll pass them
through your urine.

173
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,076
Now. that might hurt.

174
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,358
Six Echo. you're late.

175
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,355
- Jones. you ever get bored doing this?
- Doing what?

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,397
- This.
- I never really thought about it.

177
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,198
- I think about it a lot.
- About what?

178
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,994
This boring job.
What are we doing here. anyway?

179
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,832
We're feeding the nutrient lines.

180
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
We eat food.
food's gotta have vitamins. right?

181
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,837
- It's good for us.
- You don't ever wonder about anything?

182
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,270
Where do these tubes go?

183
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,834
They start there.
And they go...right there.

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,668
Hey. did you get a look
at the new guy?

185
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,911
Seven Foxtrot.

186
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,593
They found another survivor.

187
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,117
- They keep finding them.
- He'll probably win the lottery tomorrow.

188
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,236
Straight down. in the hole.

189
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,436
There you go. you try it.
Straight down.

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,716
- In....
- In the hole.

191
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,555
In the hole. No. no. No. No.
Put it down.

192
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,553
Did we look that stupid when
we went through decontamination?

193
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,038
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-the-Ouestions.
let me ask you this.

194
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,033
- Lottery's supposed to be random. right?
- Right.

195
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,193
What if it's not? What if it's rigged?

196
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,873
Rigged?

197
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,597
I've been working on this. Here.

198
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,559
Take a look at that.

199
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,279
lt charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on The Island.

200
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,477
Excluding. of course. the women.
picked to be breeders.

201
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,234
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,473
l assigned it a point value
based on its alphabet position.

203
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,710
Like the last. Starkweather.
S equals 15.

204
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,037
0 equals 15. S equals 19.
Do you see what I'm saying?

205
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,111
- No.
- Maybe if you would listen to me.

206
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,918
I'm trying to tell you.

207
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,913
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount--

208
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,550
You multiply it by the amount--
You divide it by the amount of peop--

209
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,478
Divide by the amount
of people here.

210
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,070
Which is 25-- A thousand plus 5-- 2500.
You know what that spells?

211
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,591
J-O-N-E-S.

212
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,114
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

213
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,954
- No.
- Gentlemen. ..

214
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,355
...l'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

215
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,511
There you go. Straight--

216
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,717
Straight down. in the hole.
There you go.

217
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,553
- He had something on his--
- Go.

218
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,398
Lima! Are you okay?

219
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,916
Code 15! We need med-techs

220
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,672
Just give her some air. okay?

221
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,269
You're gonna be okay.
Just relax and breathe.

222
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,029
Can I get a wheelchair down here.
please? It's for Lima One Alpha.

223
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,318
I think it's time.

224
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,597
Lima. You're going to The Island.

225
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,519
- We're going.
- Oh. you're so lucky.

226
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,392
I hope I see you soon.

227
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,593
Everyone. please follow her out.

228
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,439
Quickly and carefully.
Watch the glass.

229
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,035
- Good luck. Lima.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,275
That's fair. That's real fair.

231
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,632
Ladies. push back. please.
Gentlemen. thank you.

232
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,516
Everyone. back to work.

233
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,956
That is so not fair!

234
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,154
Oh. man. I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

235
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,038
Tech Services.

236
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,993
Computer's down again.

237
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,911
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

238
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,230
l have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-key.

239
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,198
- Contamination kit. Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

240
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,560
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

241
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,395
Hey. we've got live wires
all over the place here.

242
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,672
Hey. I've been looking all over for you.

243
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,912
- What?
- l've been looking all over--

244
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,594
- Can't hear you.
- l've been looking all over for you.

245
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,874
If you go and get yourself contaminated.
don't come pointing the finger at me.

246
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,674
- How you doing. Mac?
- What are you doing here?

247
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,314
My chip fried again.

248
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,356
Yeah. your chip fried. How much longer
you think that one's gonna work?

249
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,118
What are you clowns looking at?

250
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,392
Hey. got any of that stuff
on you today?

251
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,708
Oh. look. it's break time. Come on.

252
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,795
You're a bad influence on me.

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,715
Must be why I like you so much.

254
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,916
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

255
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,435
Well. it's fine. You know.
it's like any other sector. I guess.

256
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,115
I like coming out here. talking.

257
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,036
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

258
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,753
Yeah.

259
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,916
Step into my office.

260
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,639
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah. sometimes.

261
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,558
Where are their clothes?

262
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,352
Hey. what's with Dr. Merrick?

263
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,559
You mean. why does he act like he's got
a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

264
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,349
- Yeah.
- It's called a “God complex.“

265
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,795
Doctors are like that.
Think they know everything.

266
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,672
What's God?

267
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,669
You know when you want something
really bad and you wish for it?

268
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,558
God's the guy that ignores you.

269
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,759
Oh. right.

270
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,429
Tech service requested
in Product Extraction.

271
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,556
Yeah. I'll be right there.

272
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,275
Oh. hey. let me get that.

273
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,429
Where do you get that stuff. anyway?

274
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,270
It's an old stash.
You know. from before.

275
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,317
You mean from before
the contamination?

276
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,517
Yeah. Come on.
you're killing me with questions here.

277
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,472
You got a sweet deal here. you know?

278
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,632
Because you're. you know.
like. special.

279
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,432
Why? Why am I special?

280
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,798
There's another question.

281
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,315
You remember what we talked about?
You don't tell anybody about our talks?

282
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,072
- No.
- That'll get me in big trouble.

283
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,593
No. I don't.

284
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,797
Good.

285
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,193
Hey. how are you?
How's your world?

286
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,918
Okay. I'll catch you later.

287
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,916
Chinese junk locked up again. huh?

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,433
Yep.

289
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,511
What a surprise.

290
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,678
Go hot.

291
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,232
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

292
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,038
You'd think with the money they make.
they could afford decent equipment.

293
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,992
Yeah. Ready?

294
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,837
Cut the OZ.

295
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,715
Seriously. unless you wanna see me
blow chunks. can you wait till I'm gone?

296
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,871
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

297
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,759
Breathe!

298
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,994
Come on. yeah. That's it.

299
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,554
Come on. breathe.

300
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,518
Come on.

301
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,117
Come on. come on!
Breathe. breathe!

302
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,032
There we go. Now we're working.
He's healthy.

303
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,473
Welcome to the world.

304
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,597
- So how's Three Hilo?
- Good.

305
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,075
He's feisty. Light.

306
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,193
Vitals seem fine.

307
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,314
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

308
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,270
Looks like we have a fine product.

309
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,596
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

310
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,432
Little bug.

311
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,588
Next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

312
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,878
It was very sad.

313
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,794
- Hey.
- Hello.

314
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,279
Hi.

315
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,440
You just let a little girl
beat you. huh?

316
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,794
Stim units restricted.

317
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,956
Yeah. yeah. I'll have the veggie stuff.

318
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,714
Papassian petal juice. please.

319
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,279
It's good for the skin.

320
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,197
Jordan. are you sick?

321
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,079
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office.
I thought I saw your name on a file.

322
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,391
No. I'm fine.

323
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,199
Okay.

324
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,638
How are you?

325
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,399
I'm fine.

326
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,836
Lincoln. I can tell when you lie because
your mouth smiles but your eyes don't.

327
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,713
- I found something.
- What?

328
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,757
- A bug.
- A bug?

329
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,876
- A flying bug.
- Can I see it?

330
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,235
I think it came in the ventilation shaft.

331
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,516
But they went extinct
with the contamination.

332
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,154
I know. And how did it get
by the pathogen sensors?

333
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,595
- It must be too small.
- No. it's not too small.

334
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,633
How did it survive out there. anyway?
How does anyone survive?

335
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,633
They keep finding people and bringing
them here. From where?

336
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,680
It's good that they find survivors.

337
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,435
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

338
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,989
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

339
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,430
Good things do happen.

340
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,431
I wanna see that bug.

341
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,839
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

342
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,116
- What?
- “Dude. “

343
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,795
- “Dude“? What does it mean?

00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,196
Like all machines, it wears out.

519
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,393
For centuries, the idea of replenishing
the human body...

520
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,556
...has been at the forefront
of science.

521
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,280
I think we need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

522
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,829
- How?
- By selling. Sell. sell. sell.

523
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,479
You start. I finish.

524
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,237
Ladies and gentlemen...

525
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,949
...welcome to the next generation
of science:

526
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,957
The agnate.

527
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,033
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood...

528
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,713
...to match the client's age.

529
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,756
You're looking at stage one
of its development.

530
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,354
Within 12 months.
it will be harvest-ready...

531
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,593
...providing a carrier for your baby.
a second pair of lungs. fresh skin...

532
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,991
...all genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

533
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,676
And in compliance
with the eugenics laws of 2015...

534
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,789
...all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

535
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,996
They never achieve consciousness.

536
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,589
They never think...

537
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,231
...or suffer or feel pain.
joy. love. hate.

538
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,039
It's a product. ladies and gentlemen...

539
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,918
...in every way that matters.

540
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,394
Not human.

541
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,637
This is our public-relations director.
Mr. Whitman.

542
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,870
He'll be happy to answer
your questions.

543
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,951
Once again. thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

544
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,914
I wanna talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

545
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,355
And I wanna tell you how you're gonna
live 60 to 70 years longer.

546
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,796
Dr. Merrick. Albert Laurent.
Blackhawk Security.

547
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,111
You come highly recommended by
the Defense Department. Mr. Laurent.

548
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,914
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

549
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,674
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

550
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,434
l was formerly with the GlGN.
French special forces.

551
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,710
I understand you had
a corporate theft.

552
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,195
Yes. that's what I told
the Defense Department.

553
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,035
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

554
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,078
We've had a security breach.

555
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,670
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

556
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,394
Because their investment here
is sizable.

557
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,518
One hundred and twenty billion dollars.
to be exact.

558
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,353
And I can't afford for them
to reconsider.

559
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,551
What you tell them
is your business. doctor.

560
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,473
I am in the business of keeping
my clients' confidence.

561
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,679
Good.

562
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,948
Two of our products have escaped.

563
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,549
Impressive. considering
they' re vegetative.

564
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,553
Well. after several years
of trial and error...

565
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,790
...we discovered that
without consciousness...

566
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,871
...without human experience. emotion...

567
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,352
...without life...

568
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,116
...the organs failed.

569
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,672
How long have they been missing?

570
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,476
Four hours and 36 minutes.

571
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,234
- They' re on foot?
- Yes.

572
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,949
Wade. 1.2 miles an hour.
five-mile perimeter.

573
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,116
Stand by for suspect description.

574
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,470
- We're on it.
- Follow me.

575
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,077
- Come on. We gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

576
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,673
- You gotta try. Come on.
- Where?

577
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,950
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

578
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,554
Everything's dead. Lincoln.

579
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,270
What if we are contaminated?

580
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,792
Then we'd be dead.

581
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,116
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

582
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,354
What is it?

583
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,432
ldon't know. But it's alive.

584
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,793
Come on. It's mean. whatever it is.

585
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,234
Let's rest in here.

586
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,029
Jordan Two Delta sponsor. Sarah Jordan.
is in a coma after a car accident.

587
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,395
She's in need of multiple
organ transplants.

588
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,629
How long does she have?

589
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,076
Forty-eight hours.
Three days. maximum.

590
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,799
Tell me about Six Echo.

591
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,197
Well. he was really the first one
to question his environment...

592
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,679
...his whole existence here.

593
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,877
The last few months. he began
demonstrating unstable behavior...

594
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,554
...and I can't account for it.

595
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,955
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

596
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,838
What do they know
about the outside world?

597
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,318
Very little.

598
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,392
We control them with the memory
of a shared event.

599
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,993
A global contamination.

600
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,589
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

601
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,634
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope.

602
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,196
Gives them purpose.

603
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,870
Everything we expose them to...

604
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,350
...their programs. their cartoons.
books. the games they play...

605
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,870
...are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

606
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,396
To avoid obvious complications...

607
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,074
. . . they aren 't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

608
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,232
We find it simpler to eliminate
the drive altogether.

609
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,349
In a very real sense...

610
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,872
...they're like children.

611
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,474
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

612
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,072
- What was that?
- I don't know.

613
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,631
But I want one.

614
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,879
Look!

615
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,917
Route 39. Route 39.

616
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,638
Come on.

617
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,515
I got it from a friend.

618
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,957
I think that's it.

619
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,594
What's up?

620
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,751
Yeah. do you know
a guy named McCord?

621
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,431
Yeah. we know that tool.
Who's asking?

622
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,950
- I am.
- And you would be who?

623
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,998
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

624
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,958
Right.

625
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,790
Y'all some of those
desert UFO freaks?

626
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,117
- U--? What? No. I don't think so. no.
- No.

627
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,236
- McCord?
- Well. lucky day. Captain Kirk.

628
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,516
- He's in the can.
- He's in a can?

629
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,358
Taking a dump.

630
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,596
A dump? Taking it where?

631
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,510
Tell you what.
you're fixing to get on my nerves.

632
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,831
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

633
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,594
l have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

634
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,598
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes. please.

635
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,552
Straight up?

636
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,318
That is bitchen.

637
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,232
So this is Sector Five?

638
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,476
Hey! You son of a bitch!

639
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,998
You knew!

640
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,436
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why? Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

641
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,114
- They'll be looking for you.
- Tell me what's going on!

642
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,154
What's going on is if anybody sees us
together. both of us are gonna be dead.

643
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,949
So will you just take your hands off me?
Let me--

644
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,150
Let me pull my pants up.
I'll take you back to my place...

645
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,919
...so we can be alone. okay?

646
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,117
- Ed.
- Mac.

647
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,316
Give you boys a minute?

648
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,152
What? This isn't what it looks like.

649
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,357
Sure. Sure.

650
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,792
Get out of here. you stupid....
Will you stop?

651
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,037
You can't just bust in on a guy like that.
That's really rude.

652
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,670
She doesn't understand licking.

653
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,479
What are you. a knucklehead?
You brought another with you?

654
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,079
Excuse me. Listen. will you--?

655
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,674
Hey. back off. Joe. okay?
Don't push me!

656
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,479
No. that's no good.
Put it on my tab. We gotta go.

657
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,551
Friends of mine.
They're from out of town.

658
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,233
- Let's go.
- Give me your number.

659
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,676
- Two Delta.
- Hey. Don't test me.

660
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,353
Don't.

661
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,149
Well. this is nice.

662
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,994
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

663
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,230
Do y'all work with him?

664
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,478
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

665
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,631
Some fancy tracksuits.

666
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,159
Y'all exercise out in this heat. you'll get
yourself some nasty heat stroke.

667
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,594
Oh. Mac.

668
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,349
Look. they got matching bracelets.
We should do that. honey.

669
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,879
Suzie.

670
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,588
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

671
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,594
Yeah.

672
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,274
Would you run down to Red's
and pick up a sixer of Bud?

673
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,552
- We gotta talk shop.
- Okay. baby.

674
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,034
Just making friends.

675
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,071
- I know. Good. Just....
- Bye.

676
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,594
Why do they lie. Mac?

677
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,554
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

678
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,636
To keep you from knowing
what you are.

679
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,950
- What we are?
- What are we?

680
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,836
Man. why do I gotta be the guy that
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

681
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,355
Okay. look. You're....

682
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,596
Well. you're not like me.

683
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,354
I mean. you're not human.

684
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,993
I mean. you're human. but you're just....
You're not real.

685
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,032
You're not like a real person.

686
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,952
Like me.

687
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,716
You're clones.

688
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,470
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

689
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,434
- What?
- Clones?

690
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,716
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

691
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,559
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a face-lift...

692
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,912
...or one of them gets sick and they
need a new part. they take it from you.

693
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,712
But I have a mother. I remember her.

694
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,876
- Yeah. I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

695
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,516
- l have a little dog and I had a bike.
- And a bike. Right.

696
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,797
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars...

697
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,991
...and you rode it
to your grandma's house.

698
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,192
You ring a bell. She came out.
served you cookies on a hot plate.

699
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,348
- Yeah.
- No. Memory imprints.

700
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,995
I seen them. My buddy is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

701
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,277
There's only. like. 12 stories.
They change around little details.

702
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,471
But they're all pretty much the same.

703
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,913
The life you think you had
before the “contamination“?

704
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,877
It never happened.

705
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,836
Come on. don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

706
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,913
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood? Be my guest.

707
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,435
How long?

708
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,073
How long have we been alive?

709
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,040
You're Echo generation. so you're 3.

710
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,114
Delta means you're 4.

711
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,915
Three?

712
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,789
The whole reason you exist is because
everyone wants to live forever.

713
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,473
It's the new American dream.

714
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,916
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

715
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,192
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

716
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,478
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sac.

717
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,153
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

718
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,551
He doesn't want anyone knowing
the truth. Especially not your sponsors.

719
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,316
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

720
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,436
They. like. own you.

721
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,000
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

722
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,439
Just because people eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

723
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,954
Besides...

724
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,511
...do you know how many laws Merrick's
breaking to have you two hatched?

725
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,271
Your sponsors can't have
any part of that.

726
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,908
They're. like. high society.
Rich and famous.

727
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,196
If they knew.
Merrick would be out of business.

728
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,193
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the real truth.

729
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,674
- What? No.
- Yeah.

730
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,671
No. That's the worst idea
I ever heard.

731
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,229
You know how dead I would be?
Not to mention fired?

732
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,510
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

733
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,075
Stop! Fold. stop. Brakes.
No. Come on.

734
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,629
You're like the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

735
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,758
They're not gonna care.
They don't care. They're gonna care?

736
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,151
You know what I would do
if I were you?

737
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,670
I would get as far away from here
as I could. Go to the beach.

738
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,838
We're not asking
for your permission. Mac.

739
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,678
We're asking for your help.

740
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,958
Oh. God.

741
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,230
lnfrared's having a hard time getting
a heat signature on our fugitives.

742
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,152
Sand's too hot.

743
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,789
He was implanted
with microsensors yesterday.

744
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,636
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

745
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,877
- If we're within half a mile of the source.
- Do it.

746
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,834
Your sponsors' names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

747
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,752
Her sponsor lives in New York.

748
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,388
The number in your name
is a regional code.

749
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,439
Six Echo. it means
your sponsor lives in LA.

750
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,551
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state.

751
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,432
Yeah. Put this on. No. no. no.

752
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,239
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on. come on.

753
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,000
Keep going. What size?

754
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,395
These are bags. okay?
You put stuff in them.

755
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,154
Backpacks for boys. purses for girls.
Understand?

756
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,594
We're not idiots.

757
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,752
Excuse me. Miss l'm-So-Smart-
l-Can't-Wait-to-Go-to-The-lsland.

758
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,275
Yeah. Good.

759
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,751
Wait. Hold. People don't really wear
these on the outside.

760
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,992
These are mail-order. okay?
They stay here.

761
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,115
No. Mail-order. okay?
Clones don't wear these.

762
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,194
All right. Listen up.

763
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,954
This card is like stim credits.

764
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,998
It'll get you food. but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours...

765
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,312
...or else they'll know I helped you.
After that. use the cash.

766
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,113
All right. look. I know you're new to
this whole human experience and all...

767
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,157
...but there's one universal truth...

768
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,238
...and that is you never give a woman
your credit card.

769
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,913
Right.

770
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,359
I got something. It's hot.

771
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,549
Train will be here in a few minutes.
Hustle up.

772
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,036
--and Sacramento is
now boarding at platform A.

773
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,470
All right. stay. All right? Just stay.

774
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,238
Don't move.

775
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,877
Look at that.

776
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,958
Those are kids.

777
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,191
Come here. The train is nonstop to LA.
You need these to get on.

778
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,875
When you arrive. look up your sponsors
in the information directory. Got it?

779
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,271
Yeah. Yeah.
What is an information directory?

780
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,158
lt'll tell you where they live.

781
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,954
And whatever you do.
do not trust anyone.

782
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,635
One thing I can tell you about people
is that they'll do anything to survive.

783
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,633
Thank you. Mac. Thank you.

784
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,472
Thanks a lot.

785
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,791
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

786
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,116
Better not get me in trouble.

787
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,191
I think I got an ID. Two in the center.

788
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,351
Run!

789
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,553
Run!

790
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,231
Oh. God!

791
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,670
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform 0.

792
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,513
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

793
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,114
- This was supposed to be simple.
- It's never simple.

794
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,793
We got a missing credit card.

795
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,679
McCord just used it
to buy train tickets.

796
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,479
- It's not in his wallet.
- Monitor the account.

797
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,752
Have Amtrak patch you through
to the train conductor.

798
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,112
Get me a new team in LA.

799
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,395
Got here as fast as I could.

800
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,798
I finished scanning the
Defense Department troop selections...

801
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,349
- ...if you want to see them.
- Not yet. Look at that.

802
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,033
- Six Echo drew it.
- Well. it's elaborate.

803
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,595
“Renova tio. “

804
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,360
“ Ren o va tio “ ? Ren o va tio.

805
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,154
- What is that. ltalian?
- It's Latin.

806
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,151
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

807
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,430
Yes. I'm well aware of that.

808
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,112
So where did he learn it?

809
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,156
Where are the results
from his synaptic scan?

810
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,151
They'll be back from Johns Hopkins--

811
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,430
- Just speed it up.
- Yes. sir.

812
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,554
You two.

813
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,959
Over there!

814
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,510
We just arrived. but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

815
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,797
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

816
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,598
Thanks.

817
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,593
Wilshire. Fifth. Grand.

818
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,752
Spring. Grand Avenue?

819
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,359
Smile for the camera.

820
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,472
Where is Flower? You on Flower?

821
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,439
Olive?

822
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,158
Come on. come on.

823
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,517
You look familiar. Gotcha.

824
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,270
Three Black Wasps and two jet bikes.

825
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,710
Hey! We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

826
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,237
We're moving! Let's go.

827
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:00,037
We got a hit on McCord's credit card.
Location: Grand Avenue at 9830.

828
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,717
- Team. proceed immediately to 9830--
- No. L.A.P.D.'s moving in.

829
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,711
They just flagged McCord's
credit card.

830
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,388
- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.

831
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,673
No t lis ted.

832
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,279
Sarah Jordan.

833
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,874
- llello?
- Yes. I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.

834
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,676
She '5 Sick.

835
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,869
- Can I talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.

836
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,198
Mommy, is that you?

837
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,670
Jordan. let's go.

838
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,878
Freeze! Put your hands up!

839
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,230
- Get your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

840
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,192
Do as I say! Do as I say!

841
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,670
- Lincoln!
- Just do what they say.

842
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,154
Lincoln.

843
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,032
Just pull back!

844
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,631
Nail it! Quick! Move!

845
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,593
We're detaining you for
the murder of James McCord.

846
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,990
He was helping us!
He was my friend.

847
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,435
Anything you say can be used
in a court of law.

848
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,715
What's a court of law?

849
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,799
They'll run DNA.

850
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,391
If the agnates are booked. it'll implicate
your clients in a murder investigation.

851
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,398
This is a nightmare.
You cannot allow this to happen.

852
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,836
Do you understand me?
You use any force that is necessary.

853
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,395
I'm ordering you to contain
the situation.

854
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,558
One-Adam-82. We've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults. no lD.

855
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,196
Notify Forensics.
We'll need DNA typing.

856
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,595
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

857
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,752
- Could you look up my file. please?
- Sit back.

858
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,879
Dispatch. we're two minutes out.

859
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,993
Lincoln. get up!
Get up. Lincoln! Get up!

860
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,278
Let's go!

861
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,392
Go!

862
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,879
We got cops. We got cops!

863
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,474
Get down!

864
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,552
Run!

865
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,396
I see them! Let's get moving!

866
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,554
Let's go!
Come on. come on. come on!

867
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,153
Move. move!

868
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,639
Move out! Move out!

869
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,556
Go. go. go!

870
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,077
Shit! Check up here!

871
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,751
Air Two. give me status
of the targets.

872
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,152
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently take them out.

873
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,758
Go!

874
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,558
Move! Go. go!

875
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,354
- I can't fit! I can't fit!
- Move it!

876
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,912
Look out. look out. look out!

877
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,913
Right. right. right!

878
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,638
Stay on them!

879
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,434
Look out!

880
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,428
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

881
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,958
Good job.

882
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,351
We gotta bail out.
Police choppers inbound.

883
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,672
Black Wasp. take out the truck!

884
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,435
Troy. you all right? Let's go!

885
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,472
Cops! Cops!

886
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,789
He's coming back!

887
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,272
Stay down. Jordan!

888
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,473
- How do you know what you're doing?
- I don't know!

889
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,795
Hold on!

890
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,512
Look out!

891
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,873
Look out!

892
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,471
Hold on!

893
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,479
- Don't let me go. Lincoln!
- I got you!

894
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,551
- Don't let me go!
- I got you.

895
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,510
- Don't drop me. Lincoln!
- I got you!

896
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,597
- Don't drop me!
- I got you.

897
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,837
Hold on. Lincoln! Pull me!

898
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,799
Pull me!

899
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,756
Climb up!

900
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:47,430
If there's no way to get our fugitives
quietly. you need to take them out.

901
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,951
I see our targets about 70 stories up.
They're on top of the building logo.

902
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,913
Tough day.

903
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,914
Let's roll.

904
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,630
L.A.P.D.! Get away from the window!

905
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,553
Jay. you got them?

906
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,671
Right there. right there! Get them!

907
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,478
Stay there! Damn it! Stay down!

908
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,633
Come on!

909
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,116
I'm gonna swing around to get a shot.

910
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,669
He's coming back.

911
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,235
Oh. no.

912
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,315
Hang on. It's coming off the building.

913
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,832
Jesus must love you!

914
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,878
That was the craziest mess I ever seen!
Come on. girl.

915
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,515
I know Jesus loves you.

916
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,669
Can you keep a secret. doc?

917
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,319
Why. yes. of course.

918
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,630
There is something going on
around here.

919
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,917
- Something you may not even know.
- What is it?

920
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:16,955
Well. I'm not sure
that the contamination is real.

921
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,991
- Why do you think that?
- Okay.

922
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:24,678
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

923
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,230
Right. And I think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

924
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,789
Have you told anyone else about this?

925
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,629
No. But I'm gonna do some digging.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

926
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,268
And when I do.
I'll share my information with you.

927
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,998
Thank you.

928
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,679
I wanna be helpful.

929
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,035
- I like it here.
- Good.

930
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,674
But I really wanna look
into the lottery too.

931
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,479
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

932
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,398
You know...

933
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,279
...you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

934
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,993
You're very smart.

935
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,675
- Yeah.
- I remember when I first came here.

936
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,755
A survivor. just like you.

937
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,434
One of the first. in fact.

938
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,200
It's natural. even healthy.
to question the world.

939
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,634
Well. you might say it's only....
Only human.

940
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,157
That burns!

941
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,716
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

942
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,075
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

943
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,955
We'll go there when the rain stops.

944
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,677
- It'll be okay when we find him.
- Okay.

945
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,719
That little boy looked like me.

946
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,956
His mom's gonna die. isn't she?

947
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,918
I don't know.

948
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,988
You're lying.

949
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,431
It's cold.

950
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,319
- Go in.
- I can't.

951
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,679
- I'll go in.
- Jordan.

952
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,639
Jordan!

953
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,718
Hello?

954
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,318
Hello?

955
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,758
Lincoln!

956
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,116
Oh. my God.

957
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,994
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

958
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,628
I'm your insurance policy.

959
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,996
And what are you doing in my house?

960
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,118
Sir. Sir.

961
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,479
You need to see this.

962
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,596
lt's.... lt's....

963
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,669
It's beautiful.

964
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,230
This is the scan of Six Echo
three years ago...

965
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,960
...before we integrated him
into the agnate population.

966
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,395
This is his synaptic scan
from a few days ago.

967
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,198
See how much
the memory's grown.

968
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,551
It's like he's experienced 30 years.
not three. which is impossible.

969
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:23,474
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't--

970
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,553
An infection can't teach you Latin.
Nor how to fly.

971
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,918
They are memories.

972
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,918
But they're not his.

973
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,195
They belong to his sponsor.

974
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,158
I've seen you before.

975
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:50,233
- l've seen you in Maxim. Esquire--
- Maxim?

976
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,310
They're men's magazines.

977
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,191
Pictures of women with little.
tight. short--

978
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,794
Stories too.

979
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,428
Anyway. you are very popular.

980
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,558
There we are.

981
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,390
- What is that?
- Looks like some kind of thermal im--

982
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,832
Boy. your skin is so soft.

983
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,838
Did you know?

984
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,155
- I put some clothes out for you upstairs.
- Thank you.

985
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,073
No. thank you.

986
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,276
I keep expecting to wake up.

987
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,398
I thought I was taller.

988
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,516
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

989
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,994
She is unbelievable.

990
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,071
How is it you've been around
three years...

991
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,038
...and get the kind of woman
I haven't found my whole life?

992
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,428
Give me that.

993
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,831
She found me. She's my best friend.

994
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,237
- Why do we sound different?
- I'm from Scotland.

995
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,391
“I'm from Scotland.“

996
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,120
Hey. look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

997
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,633
“Without that.“

998
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,190
No. really. cut it out. That's enough.

999
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,000
Yeah. that is enough. I'm sorry.

1000
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,518
Like a freak show.

1001
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,557
Yeah. it's weird.

1002
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,719
So you build boats?

1003
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,555
Yeah. Well. I design them.
I draw them. Yeah. yeah.

1004
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,994
Here.

1005
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,431
I started off with cars. motorcycles.
experimental designs.

1006
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,637
Anything that blew my hair back.

1007
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,717
Kind of a speed freak.
Petrol-head.

1008
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,156
Motorcycles. It's weird.
I feel like I've seen these before.

1009
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,197
Yeah. it's something I've always done.

1010
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,470
I never dreamt it would make me rich.

1011
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:51,798
- What's “renovatio“?
- Renovatio in Latin means “rebirth.“

1012
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,077
Subtle. eh?

1013
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,030
Look. l have cirrhotic hepatitis...

1014
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,919
...a parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

1015
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,079
What?

1016
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,749
Lots and lots of sex.

1017
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,958
- Sex?
- Sex. With--

1018
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,512
You've ne-- You're a virgin?

1019
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,469
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

1020
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,760
Okay. I'm not gonna spoil the surprise.

1021
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,592
Boy. are you in for a treat.

1022
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,514
Look. my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

1023
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,231
I'm not good at all this shite. you know?
Confessions and regrets.

1024
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,875
Look. There are people who are
following us. trying to kill us.

1025
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,031
The reason we came is
we need your help.

1026
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,437
- Help you do what?
- To show people what the Institute does.

1027
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,879
I'm looking at you in the face.
and I don't believe it.

1028
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,230
Who is that guy? I know him.
Is he the community announcer?

1029
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,873
He's the president of America.

1030
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,709
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

1031
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,393
Yeah. I never liked him either.

1032
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,114
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

1033
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:10,309
If we can get on there together. people
will see. and they'll know the truth.

1034
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:15,349
So we both just waltz down to NBC
and see if they can slot us in?

1035
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,877
This might not mean anything to you.
but there are thousands of us.

1036
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,316
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

1037
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,039
Help us.

1038
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,712
All right. Let me just get
my shoes. okay?

1039
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,349
Tom. hurry up!

1040
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,592
Merrick Institute.

1041
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,518
Merrick Biotech. How may I help you?

1042
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,432
- This is client Tom Lincoln.
- lIi.

1043
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,195
Could you get someone
who can explain to me...

1044
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,750
...why my insurance policy is
sitting downstairs on my fucking sofa?!

1045
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,875
- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.

1046
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,594
I'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
I was getting myself organized.

1047
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,836
Okay. shall we go? Are you ready?

1048
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,992
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1049
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,151
His eyes are lying.

1050
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,912
The same as yours do.

1051
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,953
- You stay here.
- No. don't--

1052
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,479
Shall we?

1053
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,155
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay?

1054
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,233
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

1055
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,553
- Come on. we'll all go. It'll be good.
- She's gonna stay.

1056
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,955
Good luck.

1057
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1058
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,959
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

1059
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,839
- I'll drive.
- No. I'll drive.

1060
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,752
No. really.

1061
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,469
- Do you know how?
- Yeah. I taught myself.

1062
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,392
But you don't know the way.

1063
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,710
Well. then you can show me.

1064
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,118
Well. be careful.

1065
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:49,230
This is a V12 '09 Caddy.
750 horsepower. $500,000 car.

1066
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,479
Put your thumb on that.

1067
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,675
Worth every penny.
We even have the same prints.

1068
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,796
- What are you doing?
- Getting directions.

1069
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,520
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?

1070
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,752
- KNBC news studio.
- One moment, please.

1071
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,309
Thanks for doing this.

1072
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:13,234
That's all right. I'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

1073
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,352
How much did I cost?

1074
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,954
Five million dollars.

1075
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,238
- Is that a lot?
- It's a small price to pay to cheat death.

1076
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,798
That's a red.

1077
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,150
- It's a red. Red! Stop the car!
- What? Why?

1078
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,351
It's a red light! Stop the car!

1079
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,999
What's the matter?

1080
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,794
You wanker! It's a red light! Stop!
It means stop!

1081
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,190
- Sorry. I didn't know.
- You said you could drive.

1082
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,751
Well. I do know how to drive.
I just don't know what the lights mean.

1083
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,191
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to die.

1084
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,359
Me neither!

1085
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,558
Go. go. go!

1086
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,519
What are you doing? Stop!

1087
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,914
- No.
- Stop the car now!

1088
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,509
I'll shoot. Stop the car.

1089
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,477
- No!
- Yes!

1090
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,835
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

1091
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,317
They're shooting my car.

1092
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,713
They've shot the engine.
They've shot my engine!

1093
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,357
Oh. God. My nose!

1094
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,474
Where are you going. eh?

1095
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,351
- Get up. get up!
- Let go of me!

1096
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,997
- Get off me!
- Come on. get up.

1097
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,236
- Let me go!
- Get up!

1098
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,832
No. no. no. Don't shoot him.
I need him. I need him.

1099
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,997
No. don't shoot! He's my clone!

1100
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,230
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

1101
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,154
No. I'm Tom Lincoln!
He's lying. Shut up!

1102
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,471
I own you!

1103
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,715
He's the-- I'm Tom Lincoln!

1104
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,314
Don't point the gun at me.
you fricking idiot!

1105
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,798
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- I'm not a clone! I'm Tom!

1106
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,594
No. I'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

1107
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,751
- No. I'm not.
- Shut up!

1108
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,793
Shut up! You're a clone! Shut up!

1109
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,629
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't. don't--

1110
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,034
Oh. shit.

1111
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,239
Close.

1112
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,279
Do you think it's strange that
my insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1113
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,352
I find this whole operation strange.

1114
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,238
Where's the woman?

1115
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,712
She said she was going out of state...

1116
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,997
...to look for her sponsor.

1117
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:41,835
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1118
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,835
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk. talk and feel?

1119
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,195
That kind of secret?

1120
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,673
Have you talked with
anyone else about this?

1121
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,273
Who would believe it?

1122
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,272
Can I count on that?

1123
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,755
The only thing you can count on...

1124
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,117
...is that people will do
anything to survive.

1125
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,798
I just want to live. I don't care how.

1126
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,078
Thank you.

1127
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,474
Thank you very much. Job well done.

1128
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,032
Jordan? Jordan?

1129
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,918
Stop.

1130
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,157
Hey. Jordan. it's me. It's me.

1131
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,838
It's you.

1132
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:22,153
- That tongue thing is amazing.
- I know. Open your mouth again.

1133
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,192
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

1134
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,835
The Island is real.

1135
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,394
It's us.

1136
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,239
- How many are affected?
- About half.

1137
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,119
We're seeing the same neural patterns
in all the Echos...

1138
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,114
...plus every subsequent generation:
the Foxtrots. Gammas and Hilos.

1139
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,750
We predicated our entire system
on predictability.

1140
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,038
Six Echo has displayed the one trait
that undermines it:

1141
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,668
Human curiosity.

1142
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:23,595
So we're now facing
four generations...

1143
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,797
...with the potential
for defiant behavior.

1144
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,678
What are you suggesting?

1145
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,231
A recall.

1146
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,873
Wait. You mean dispose of over
$200 million worth of product?

1147
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,600
- Yes.
- Great.

1148
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,395
Cisco IP Communicator
connecting to Merrick Biotech.

1149
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,431
Mr. Lincoln, this is Charlie Whitman...

1150
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,239
. . . the public-relations director
at Merrick Bio tech.

1151
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,916
My deepest apologies for yesterday's
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

1152
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:00,198
Your defect in your policy was
by no means an isolated incident...

1153
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,920
...and it is totally correctable,
I assure you.

1154
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:08,108
We are calling other valued clients
right now to inform them of a recall.

1155
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:09,759
So please call us when you get--

1156
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,151
"Unfortuna te incon venience "?

1157
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,669
That's a bit of an understatement,
don 't you think?

1158
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,354
Mr. Lincoln. you're home.
Aren't you traumatized. sir?

1159
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,876
I had a home invasion once.
where they put the gun to my head.

1160
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,190
I never forgot that.
I shook for two days.

1161
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,550
What kind of recall
are you talking about?

1162
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,639
It's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

1163
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,439
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

1164
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,398
Starting over.

1165
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,519
- Starting over?
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

1166
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,711
We guarantee our product
100 percent.

1167
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,075
The unfortunate inconvenience for you
is we 7! have to bring you back in...

1168
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:51,312
...to rescan you so that
we can regrow your policy.

1169
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,438
Does today work for you at all?

1170
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,676
Pick you up by helicopter at 3:00?

1171
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,831
I'll call you back.

1172
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:10,156
Dr. Merrick, how do we remove the
defective products from the population...

1173
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,709
without disrupting the others?

1174
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,991
We already have
the mechanism in place.

1175
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:19,239
Dahlgren Two Foxtrot.

1176
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,314
Cooper Five Gamma.

1177
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,356
Mass winnings.

1178
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,716
He kept a journal and a lot of maps.

1179
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,790
And after I figure out how to get that
in the water. we can get on it and....

1180
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,638
We'll keep heading south.

1181
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,831
We could live like real people.

1182
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,594
Tulie Two Foxtrot.

1183
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,678
Ginsberg Two Hilo.

1184
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,039
We'll disappear.

1185
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,398
Yeah.

1186
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,277
But after.

1187
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,550
All those people we left behind.

1188
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,309
Jones Three Echo.

1189
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,555
When we were escaping,
I saw this room.

1190
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,359
If I could shut it down...

1191
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,518
...they'd see the truth.

1192
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,671
Gentlemen. there is. however. another
matter that requires board approval.

1193
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,597
The disposal of $200 million

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1202
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,309
No. No.

1203
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,631
Inbound. Jordan product.

1204
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:10,635
- Escort her to Surgery Prep 7.
- I better say hello.

1205
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,037
Mr. Lincoln. thank you for coming.
It's great seeing you again.

1206
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:25,510
And we are so. so sorry
about this entire episode.

1207
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:29,275
I wanna tell you we'll be birthing
a brand-new agnate for you...

1208
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,715
...free of charge.
Won't cost you a penny.

1209
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:36,078
After you. Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack or--?

1210
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,912
No. How long will this take?

1211
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,072
It's gonna take about an hour.
I read that you're from Scotland.

1212
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:43,959
I prefer Ireland myself.
But what part exactly in Scotland?

1213
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:47,954
I realize small talk is just part of your job.
but let's cut the shite. okay?

1214
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:51,317
Point taken. My apologies.
I'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.

1215
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:54,233
Chatty Cathy. Turn right. This way.

1216
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,718
I'll take her.

1217
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,508
This is gonna be the exact same routine
as last time.

1218
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,796
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here shortly.

1219
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,757
Look at you. so young and successful.

1220
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:23,309
I always wanted to
get into yachting myself. I--

1221
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,597
I hear they're taking your kidneys...

1222
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,917
...your lungs. your heart.

1223
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:44,757
They are gonna hack you up.

1224
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,478
Too bad.

1225
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,472
No one is touching me.

1226
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,073
Give me your Tri-key.

1227
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,593
- You shot me.
- Shut up!

1228
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,597
Give me your walkie!

1229
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,431
Get down. Get down. now!

1230
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,112
You all right?

1231
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,758
Come on.

1232
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:11,192
I've got this figured out. I kind of....

1233
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:15,069
I messed up in one area right down there.
but on the whole it doesn't matter.

1234
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:18,028
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

1235
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,074
Hello. sir.

1236
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,117
Thank you for your patience.

1237
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,316
I'm sure you're excited
to get to The Island.

1238
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:27,080
If you can grab your
personal belongings. line up...

1239
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,118
...and follow me. we'll be on our way.

1240
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,510
Take this. Go.

1241
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,832
You have to keep going. Go. Go.

1242
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,389
- Okay.
- Go shut it down.

1243
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,278
I love that Picasso.

1244
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,834
Do you like Picasso. Mr. Laurent?

1245
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:03,034
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. I'm very pleased. Thank you.

1246
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:06,516
- What about the client? Sarah Jordan?
- She's doubtful.

1247
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,517
Even if the transplants
are a success...

1248
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,672
...her brain damage may be
too severe for any real recovery.

1249
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,558
You took too long bringing her back.

1250
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:17,235
So the girl I brought in. you're going
to harvest her. kill her anyway...

1251
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,595
...even though it
won't make any difference?

1252
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,479
That's the privilege our clients
pay for. Mr. Laurent.

1253
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,114
Now. do excuse me.
I have business to attend to.

1254
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:32,589
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe rebellion?

1255
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,595
And when he was killed.
me and my brothers were branded...

1256
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,196
...so others would know
we were less than human.

1257
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,316
I've seen and done things
I'm not proud of...

1258
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:50,031
...but at some point you realize
war is a business.

1259
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,315
So when did killing
become a business for you?

1260
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:06,317
Oh. it's so much more than that.

1261
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,316
I have discovered the Holy Grail
of science. Mr. Laurent.

1262
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,919
I give life.

1263
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,152
The agnates.

1264
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:20,074
They're simply tools. instruments.
They have no souls.

1265
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,714
The possibilities are endless here.

1266
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,555
In two years' time. I will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

1267
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,792
How many people on Earth
can say that. Mr. Laurent?

1268
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,272
I guess just you and God.

1269
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,753
That's the answer
you're looking for. isn't it?

1270
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,155
Mr. Whitman has
your check downstairs.

1271
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,072
Looks like single gunshot.

1272
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,554
Oh. no.

1273
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,114
Wrong wrist.

1274
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,354
Dr. Merrick,
the body thatjust came in...

1275
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,748
. . .it's the client.

1276
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,915
Issue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

1277
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:32,353
Down. down. down!
Move. move!

1278
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:47,111
There's a disturbance
in the Hologram Room.

1279
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,554
I'm on it.

1280
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,959
I've sent censors to check
a possible attempted breach...

1281
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,872
. . . in Hologram Control.

1282
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,316
One after another. step into the room.

1283
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,994
If I'm going to The Island.
why did I leave my bag?

1284
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,718
Step right in. thank you.

1285
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,711
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1286
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,393
Is this the right way?

1287
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:48,120
Are you new here?
I don't know if this is the way!

1288
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:50,032
It's going to The Island?

1289
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,794
I'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

1290
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,833
Open the door!

1291
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,030
She said. open the door.

1292
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,351
You could have taken over his life.
but you chose to come back.

1293
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:50,074
You truly are unique. Six Echo.

1294
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,951
My name is Lincoln!

1295
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,398
I brought you into this world...

1296
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:18,272
...and I can take you out of it.
