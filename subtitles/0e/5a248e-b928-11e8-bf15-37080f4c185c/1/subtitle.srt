1
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,089
The path of life

2
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:48,854
Are dreams, like the length of the path

3
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,462
The storm on the way

4
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:57,163
Pass by as you go along

5
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:00,702
ln the world

6
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:04,639
How many ways can one dream?

7
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:09,948
Looking for dream-like love

8
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:14,848
And the path goes on

9
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,351
Life is what

10
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:22,495
Dreams and desires are made of

11
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,898
Somewhere in the dream

12
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:30,199
There are traces of tears

13
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,933
Where to go to?

14
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,870
To find where my heart wants to go

15
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:43,314
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

16
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:47,384
And the path and l go on

17
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:23,387
lt suddenly rains and suddenly shines

18
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,089
Please have a pity on us travellers!

19
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,579
Stop!

20
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:46,376
Run!

21
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,389
Have mercy, sir! Take it back!

22
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,618
How dare you steal my money? Damn you!

23
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:58,686
Stop! Stop!

24
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:00,221
ls it wanted convict?

25
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,961
Go away!...

26
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,626
Stop! Stop!

27
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,838
ls it him?

28
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:18,468
Doesn't look like him! Go.

29
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,973
Thank you!

30
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,183
Don't go!

31
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:35,721
lf you are not wanted, stay away!

32
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,850
Stay away, go!

33
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,023
Stop!

34
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:43,328
Not him!

35
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,398
Tell him to leave!

36
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,165
Stop!

37
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:51,639
Stop!

38
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:52,604
Who's screaming?

39
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:53,641
Over there!

40
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,069
Stop!

41
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,370
Stop!

42
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,538
There's a wanted convict!

43
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,177
Who told you to stop?

44
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:05,987
Pilgrimage? How hilarious!

45
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,749
You have all my money!

46
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:09,655
Don't advantage from me!

47
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,988
Don't say that, l don't need it!

48
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,561
You may need it sooner or later!

49
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,059
Thank you!

50
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,199
Want a room, Sir?

51
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,767
Get the luggage for him.

52
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:20,925
There's a nice room.

53
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:23,129
Sorry, but l'm a collector
from Tsi Pao Chu.

54
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,629
Collector?

55
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,175
Without rules!

56
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:28,943
Why is it a different man each time?

57
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,443
The ex-collector was killed
on his way home.

58
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,414
Why don't you just do me a favour.

59
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,039
Since you might get killed
with the money?

60
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,106
Stop collecting.

61
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:36,913
You must be joking.

62
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:47,789
Can't see the counterfoll?
lt's the new rules.

63
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,122
New rule? Show me!

64
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,359
Sorry, no!

65
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:52,662
What kind of a record is that?

66
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,962
lt's in such a mess.

67
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,503
l can't return without the collection.

68
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:58,666
Sorry to bother you.

69
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,108
l owe you nothing.

70
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:02,575
You book shows it.

71
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:05,510
Don't deny it or l'll take
you to court.

72
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:16,624
lnn keeper, where can l
spend a night without paying

73
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,794
Go to the Lan Ro Temple!

74
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,003
Old lady, l didn't lie to you.

75
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,834
Where's Lan Ro Temple, please?

76
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:35,634
Lan Ro Temple?! 3 1/2 miles
to the East.

77
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,974
Where there is a spocky temple!

78
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,146
Thank you!

79
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,083
Sorry! Excuse me!

80
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,523
Old lady, are you going
to buy it or not?

81
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,044
Well done!

82
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:15,143
Master, you've good taste,
make an offer!

83
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,181
l don't even have money
for travel expenses.

84
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,924
Good taste, but no means,
what's the use?

85
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:24,487
What are you doing?

86
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,823
l'm taking your measurement
for your coffin!

87
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,826
Thank you!

88
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,559
Remember, there are wolves
in the woods.

89
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,565
You may come upon them
when it's dark.

90
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:35,193
Stop...

91
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:24,676
The fire cannot go out.

92
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:25,982
lf it does, l can't get out
of the forest.

93
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,856
Lan Ro Temple.

94
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,204
Anybody in?

95
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,986
Have you finished?

96
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:11,116
Hsia-hou, we're fought for
7 years & you're always lost

97
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,387
But you're quite persevering

98
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,494
You follow me wherever l go.

99
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,497
You've been in the Temple
for a fornight

100
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,602
and you've improved your
swordsmanship!

101
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,137
But you've wasted your youth too.

102
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,369
You're ambitious, but not aggressive.

103
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:30,776
For the sake of the title,
you've become biased

104
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,581
You're petulant but not
concentrated enough.

105
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,307
Your blows are violent but
ineffective.

106
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,717
You've to cool down if not
you can win lust.

107
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,549
l'm here to duel with you,

108
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,759
not to listen to your sermon

109
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,419
Yes, he's right!

110
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,827
He's not your match. You
shouldn't have

111
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,228
said that to disgrace him.

112
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,467
He's right too.

113
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:56,797
You shouldn't have followed
him.

114
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:00,674
Lay down your swords &
touch him with love.

115
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:03,335
The universe is limitless
& love is eternal.

116
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:07,210
Love conquers the world.

117
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,281
Love is the most powerful weapon!

118
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:14,312
Because you said too much!

119
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:17,615
l'm not trying to follow you

120
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:23,562
Your clothing is torn.

121
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,631
Hell with your love!

122
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,198
The kind of love you need,

123
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,530
you should find in a
whorehouse.

124
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,060
l'm trying to find a place.

125
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:30,103
lt's not convenient!

126
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:31,770
Why not?

127
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:33,731
Are you bold or not?

128
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:34,741
Yes!

129
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:35,976
Look over there!

130
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,407
l just shout, you then hide up.

131
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:43,982
lf there's a real tiger

132
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,779
Where should you hide?

133
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:47,950
What? lt really has a tiger?

134
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:49,890
No!

135
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,355
But we've something even
more scareful than a tiger.

136
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:54,855
Do you always keep so close
while talking?

137
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,589
l've had breath, & this will
keep you away.

138
00:13:58,902 --> 00:13:59,994
Get out of here!

139
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,028
Your love can't save you.

140
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,731
Yes!

141
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,636
Me too!

142
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:36,150
Hsia-hou, you're ambitious but,

143
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:39,686
after death, you're still a nobody.

144
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,984
l won't expose your body
in the wilderness.

145
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,297
You never change, you fight
even when dead.

146
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:56,997
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

147
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,128
lt's lucky that water isn't deep.

148
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,968
Otherwise l'll get wet.

149
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,628
That monster's out again!

150
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,798
Shit! ls he still be there?

151
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,808
l meant no harm.

152
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,348
l'll throw it away if you're afraid!

153
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:36,487
What's it?

154
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,391
Where's my veil?

155
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:42,633
Veil? l'll find up for you!

156
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,036
lt's deep!

157
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,706
Come up quick!

158
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:54,872
Come up!

159
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,181
Thank you!

160
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,313
lt's too dark, l can't see.

161
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,389
l'll find it up early tomorrow.

162
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,521
This water is both deep and cold!

163
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:11,456
Your hand are colder than mine.

164
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:12,931
Because you're warmer.

165
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:19,569
You're sick, you look so pale.

166
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,575
Go to see doctor.

167
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,306
l need your warmth.

168
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:27,643
l'm not willing to push you.

169
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,741
lf not, l'll spit on you.

170
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,213
lt hurts.

171
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:36,952
l shouldn't have pushed you.

172
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,151
lt's cold.

173
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,253
l'm wet, you'll feel colder
lying on me.

174
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,062
Do you feel painful or cold?

175
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,599
Hold me and take me inside.

176
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:46,799
Holding you?

177
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:51,296
l can't, you're too heavy!

178
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:55,467
l need some help...

179
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:08,222
You look nice, but you're
in the wrong place.

180
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:11,687
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
died for nothing.

181
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,029
Why am l still in water?

182
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:29,836
Miss, you forgot your lute!

183
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:13,313
Why are you following me?

184
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:20,193
Why are you leaving?

185
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,229
A villain! l must run for my life!

186
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:24,898
Who? l can't see it!

187
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:01,935
Stepping you to death.

188
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,503
Let's go.

189
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,432
Snake!

190
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,509
Where's the snake?

191
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:17,946
Don't shout!

192
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:20,380
The villain just passes by.

193
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:22,746
Which one?

194
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:24,889
The bearded one on the East
of Lan Ro Temple.

195
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,789
lf he discovered us, we'd be killed!

196
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:29,996
The one living opposite me?

197
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,261
l could tell that he no good

198
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,703
You're too dangerous! On
your own l'll take you back.

199
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,136
No, my family won't permit this.

200
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,139
They're very strict.

201
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:44,041
Miss,

202
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:45,111
let me lure him away then!

203
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,143
Run when he tries to get
hold of me!

204
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,444
Don't let him sees you.

205
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,258
Here's you lute, Miss!

206
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:08,528
What's your name?

207
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:09,869
Ning Tsai-shen!

208
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,507
What's yours?

209
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,902
Nieh Hsiao Tsing!

210
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:17,642
Nieh Hsiao Tsing!

211
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:19,804
Tomorrow night...

212
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:23,416
Tomorrow night l'll come
to see you.

213
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,812
Stop running!

214
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:35,315
lt's dangerous.

215
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:47,927
Stop! You can't get away!

216
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:07,311
lf you think you can scream,
l can scream too!

217
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:10,948
Damn Taoist, both of us want
shelter here.

218
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,022
Actually, all the men l
killed deserve it.

219
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,262
Why have you been annoying me?

220
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:17,889
l'm not.

221
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,964
l'm hiding in this hellish place

222
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,666
to stay away from hatred
the fighting in the world.

223
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:25,265
We've the common objective
to annihilate criminals

224
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:26,499
for the good of mankind.

225
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,475
We're in fact are fellowmen.

226
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:31,945
Fellowmen? Nonsense!

227
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,809
You're hurting me too.

228
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,713
One day, you'll be in big trouble,

229
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,217
then l'll finish you off.

230
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:57,838
You're a good man. Don't
come to me anymore.

231
00:27:58,107 --> 00:27:59,005
Hsiao Tsing!

232
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,964
The big beard

233
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:20,578
Man of love,

234
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,488
Did you come upon anything
last night?

235
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,651
l've touched everything in
the house.

236
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:30,857
Did you see anything eerie?

237
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:33,693
lncluding you?

238
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:39,463
ldiot!

239
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,745
l'm serious. Why are you joking?

240
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:52,478
Who knows if you're

241
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:53,543
serious or not?

242
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:54,848
You're always joking?

243
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:57,455
Get out of this place. lt's haunted.

244
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,187
Show me the ghost if you can.

245
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:03,788
Stupid fool. Do you think
you can see a ghost that easy?

246
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:04,964
Then they must not be a ghost.

247
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,095
They won't show up in the day.

248
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,130
Big beard, don't scare me.

249
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:11,362
Tell them to come at night,
if not in the day.

250
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:17,270
Don't regret it.

251
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:20,813
Why don't you believe me?

252
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:25,952
lf l see you at night,
l'll throw you out.

253
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:29,246
Come on, do that!

254
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,687
No, l'll kill you.

255
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,262
There's no better way to help him.

256
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:39,659
Hope that can save his life.

257
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,329
Ghost? He must be kidding.

258
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:47,600
Where's my lower portion?

259
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:55,310
Damn big beard! Where have
you put it?

260
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:59,984
Your lower portion? lsn't it
connected to your upper portion?

261
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:01,385
Don't talk nonsense!

262
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:02,421
Take it!

263
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:04,488
He's incoherent. No point
in helping him.

264
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,935
lt's illegible anyway,
l'll fill it in myself.

265
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,381
Have you really lived in
Lan Ro Temple?

266
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:18,751
lt clearly shows 70 taels.

267
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:23,762
Pay up.

268
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,889
Take it.

269
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,562
Thank you.

270
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:32,504
lnn keeper!

271
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:34,738
You scared me. What do you want?

272
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:37,438
l was scared too.

273
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,075
Excuse me, excuse me...

274
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:26,788
Hsiao Tsing!

275
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:32,965
Hsiao Tsing!

276
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,195
Can you hear me?

277
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,438
Stop.

278
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:41,440
Did you hear me, stop!

279
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:43,909
Don't go!

280
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,079
Who said that? Who did?

281
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,511
Let me see who's a wanted convict.

282
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:55,853
Don't you listen l said stop?

283
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:10,827
That man of taste is here again.

284
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:16,166
Boss!

285
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:17,267
Why are you here again?

286
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,909
Boss, where's that painting
"The girl washing hair"?

287
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:25,983
l'll get it for you at once.

288
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:30,521
Boss, what are you doing?

289
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:34,625
Why's it missing? No one
has ever asked for it.

290
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:35,888
Well, come again tomorrow.

291
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,258
l promise l'll find it for you.

292
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:38,865
Well, l'll come again
tomorrow.

293
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:53,841
How could all 3 lanterns
be blown out?

294
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,909
When the wolf comes,
see how l'd cope with you.

295
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:02,522
Can't you see the Yellow River's water,

296
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,952
keeps flowing into the sea
without returning?

297
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:07,220
Can't you see the mourning of those,

298
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,624
with grey hair before the mirror?

299
00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:12,665
Don't face the moonlight
without a drink.

300
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,466
Can't you see the Yellow River's water,

301
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:16,798
keeps flowing into the sea
without returning?

302
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,395
Can't you see the mourning of those,

303
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,168
with grey hair before the mirror?

304
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,836
Don't face the moonlight without a drink.

305
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,011
Give and spend and God will send.

306
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:26,510
1,2,3,4,5,6,7

307
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:27,344
7,6,5,4,3,2,1

308
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:28,278
1,2,3,4,5,6,7

309
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,873
Understand the bible,
and you have the sword for ten years

310
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,508
Then you've the credits.
l scare to leak out

311
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,516
lf you stay, then l'll go.

312
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,413
l can hardly breath.

313
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,452
Why is there no wolf?

314
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:44,357
The wolf'ss coming!

315
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:47,488
Nieh Hsiao Tsing...

316
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:57,866
Hsiao Tsing...

317
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,143
Open the door, Hsiao Tsing!

318
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:11,416
Why are you here?

319
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,609
l came because l heard the
lute sounds.

320
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:13,652
Come in quick!

321
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:17,555
You can't come here.

322
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,592
l'm leaving tomorrow,
l must say goodbye!

323
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:20,590
Tomorrow?

324
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:22,993
Yes, but l'll try to come
to see you.

325
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:24,029
Don't!

326
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:25,725
Someone's coming!

327
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,889
She has a sharp nose.

328
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:28,832
Hide under the water, &
she can't smell you.

329
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:31,461
ln the water again?

330
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:46,647
Sister Tsing!

331
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:50,714
l know the matron's waiting
impatiently.

332
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,790
l'll go out after l've made
up.

333
00:38:58,633 --> 00:38:59,725
Tramp!

334
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,362
You're hiding a man!

335
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,866
l am not!

336
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,106
Don't deny it!

337
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,336
Here's the proof!

338
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:13,036
See for yourself.

339
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,015
Why have you written such stuff?

340
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,109
You obviously do that in
defiance of my order.

341
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:21,782
l must punish you.

342
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:23,112
You bitch!

343
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:25,658
Don't forget the ordeal
you suffered!

344
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:28,694
Do as l tell you or l'll
destroy your ashes,

345
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:30,890
and you'll evaporate like
thin air.

346
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:38,503
Tonight...

347
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:40,470
get me a living being...

348
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:42,899
to increase my vitality,

349
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:44,537
and lengthen my span of life

350
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:47,311
You'll be forgiven

351
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:48,776
for this first offence.

352
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:51,784
Bring medicine for your sister.

353
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,543
Yes.

354
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:03,026
You've been betrothed the Lord Black.

355
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:05,126
ln three days you'll be his wife!

356
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,225
He's a bit old.

357
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,333
But he's not good-natured.

358
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:11,501
When he flares up,

359
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:12,765
even we can't control him.

360
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:14,072
After you marry him,

361
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:15,198
you'll never return.

362
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:16,940
Hsiao Tsing!

363
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:17,908
Yes!

364
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,171
Try it on.

365
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,309
Your bridal dress.

366
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:27,313
Come here and have a look.

367
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:51,504
Seems there's some sort of smell.

368
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:53,610
The smell of a living man.

369
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:58,850
My dress is torn.

370
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:00,980
Why are you so careless?

371
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,248
l must wash my hand!

372
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,483
Ching, let me help you.

373
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:05,991
Thank you!

374
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,150
Don't mention it.

375
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:09,192
Why are you doing that?

376
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:10,195
Sorry.

377
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:12,698
Don't keep offending her.

378
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:13,699
l didn't mean to.

379
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,267
You haven't cleaned up yet.

380
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:18,497
You did it on purpose, l give up.

381
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,166
Take it off so l can mend it

382
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:03,077
Tsing, what are you doing?

383
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:06,819
l must take a bath before
going out!

384
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:11,586
lf not l can't get you a living.

385
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:13,993
Good girl.

386
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,224
Ching, learn from her.

387
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:21,425
l won't let you down tonight

388
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:25,804
Come!

389
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:35,571
Hurry up!

390
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:52,965
3 days later after l get married,

00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,125
this room will be yours.

392
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,607
Dress up! l won't look at you!

393
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,619
Come!

394
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:15,945
You...

395
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,182

397
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:20,521
Go to the temple first!

398
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:22,351
l'll wait you there!

399
00:43:22,564 --> 00:43:23,553
Yes!

400
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:37,609
Ning!

401
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:42,977
Why are you so speedy?

402
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:44,809
lt's faster coming down!

403
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,046
Are you alright?

404
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,390
Do you like this picture?
Give it to you.

405
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:55,489
The picture?

406
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,290
How do you get this?

407
00:43:58,466 --> 00:44:00,661
My father asked to draw
it a year ago.

408
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,664
Just found it 2 days before.

409
00:44:07,008 --> 00:44:08,305
That's me!

410
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:12,545
Keep it as seeing me.

411
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:16,072
You sound like we'll never
meet again.

412
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,547
Yes! l'll marry the old monster,

413
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:19,451
in 3 days time.

414
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:22,044
You're not willing to.

415
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,786
Go away if you want to.

416
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:29,595
Let me go. lt's dawn.

417
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:33,132
lt's better, then we can go.

418
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:37,429
Let me off.

419
00:44:38,006 --> 00:44:39,701
l won't if you don't go with me.

420
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:41,166
Release me!

421
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:44,570
Tsing!

422
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,612
You beggar, how can you save me?

423
00:44:47,415 --> 00:44:48,712
Don't day dream.

424
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:50,010
You want my money.

425
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:51,815
l see so many of your kind.

426
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:53,142
l won't be tricked.

427
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:55,549
How can you say this?

428
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:57,618
lf you don't go, l'll ask
someone to fetch you.

429
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,624
Ok, l go!

430
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:07,156
Take care!

431
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:26,651
Mister!

432
00:45:26,754 --> 00:45:29,348
l can't find the picture!

433
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,549
l saw the girl.

434
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,126
Forget her. She died a year ago!

435
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:35,887
lt's pouring, go and find a shelter!

436
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:37,863
Don't curse her.

437
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:39,591
Keep by my side.

438
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:40,497
You're totally wet!

439
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:42,000
Don't superstitions!

440
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,865
Don't go away!

441
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:49,104
Who's shouting?

442
00:45:52,413 --> 00:45:53,505
l'm not a wanted convict.

443
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:55,410
Grab the shouting one.

444
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,045
You won't get fund.

445
00:45:58,186 --> 00:45:59,676
Get him first.

446
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:03,884
The world is so cool.

447
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,859
The bearded man is a killer.

448
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:11,692
ls she dangerous?

449
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,900
Help me get on my feet.

450
00:46:15,436 --> 00:46:17,028
Beware, don't let my new
gown get wet.

451
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:18,263
You can't affort it.

452
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:21,140
l'm coming to save you.

453
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,302
My mom will punish me,
l wet my clothes.

454
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:27,212
The way of life

455
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:34,451
The way...

456
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:39,620
The spoken "way" is not "way"

457
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:43,085
Of haven and earth,

458
00:46:44,565 --> 00:46:45,657
Of humang and swards

459
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:47,860
Of evil and good,

460
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:48,958
This way, that way, every which way

461
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:50,331
Say that their way, is the only way

462
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:53,136
Bah. Tehah, hah!

463
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,508
All bullshit,

464
00:47:00,715 --> 00:47:02,615
This way, that way, is still not the way

465
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:05,017
Ha! Ha!

466
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:06,242
The way of flowers and tea, Ha!

467
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,512
Of life and death,

468
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:08,577
Of density and intensity,

469
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:09,815
Of light and heat,

470
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:10,946
Of evil spirits

471
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:12,081
Of people committing crimes

472
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,353
Of bad ones in power! Ha!

473
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:16,520
l find my own way

474
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:20,428
l seek

475
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:25,666
My way!

476
00:47:33,748 --> 00:47:35,045
Leaving?

477
00:47:54,936 --> 00:47:56,927
Tsing...!

478
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,104
Tsing...!

479
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:11,912
So windy!

480
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:16,312
Ning!

481
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:17,587
What happened to your eyes?

482
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:18,817
The fool punches on me!

483
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,756
Who?

484
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:20,825
Kneel down!

485
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:25,263
What are you doing?

486
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:27,826
lt's pouring!

487
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:31,937
lt doesn't matter, l always get wet.

488
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:33,901
Let's go on to the temple.

489
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:37,174
You are in danger.

490
00:48:37,278 --> 00:48:38,677
That bearded guy is a killer

491
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:39,905
Come in first.

492
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,144
l'm coming back to tell you.

493
00:48:47,488 --> 00:48:48,887
lt's dripping.

494
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:50,355
Come!

495
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:55,418
Are you back to rescue me?

496
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:00,823
l miss you!

497
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:06,767
The seller said the girl died already.

498
00:49:13,114 --> 00:49:14,411
Don't mention this now.

499
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:23,118
Don't forget, l'll get married in days.

500
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:40,200
Dawn, please do not come

501
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:44,577
Let the dream-like night

502
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:48,246
last forever.

503
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:52,349
Let this moment of truth

504
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:56,386
follow this moving love

505
00:49:56,824 --> 00:50:04,026
and command the soul to come in.

506
00:50:04,565 --> 00:50:13,564
Please ask dawnnot to come ever again.

507
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:17,605
This romantic feeling now,

508
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,480
puts me out of this world

509
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:25,311
The warmth in that breeze

510
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:29,586
sends love through the cold rains.

511
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:36,758
Quietly let this
fervent love break through

512
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:40,923
Do not let the red sun

513
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:44,336
put us apart

514
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:46,938
This langourous night

515
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:53,911
do not change

516
00:50:54,382 --> 00:51:02,790
Please command dawn
not to show itself again

517
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:07,288
The dream we are in now

518
00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:09,819
can never happen again

519
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:11,556
lt's also in the picture.

520
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:14,664
Give it back to me.

521
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:15,700
lt sounds beautiful.

522
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:17,602
Give it back to me.

523
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,031
You run so fast?

524
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:23,235
Go!

525
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:27,942
Why you get up set?

526
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:31,080
lt's important to you.

527
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:32,844
l don't mean this.

528
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:36,046
Tell you the truth. l'm not a human.

529
00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:41,894
Don't say that.

530
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,363
l'm not if you don't.

531
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:46,789
l'll take responsibility
for the thing we did.

532
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,732
Don't follow me!

533
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,967
Go to find the bearded guy.

534
00:51:57,645 --> 00:52:00,136
He's a murderer, l'll get killed.

535
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:02,547
You'll die!

536
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:04,809
Tsing!

537
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:07,519
Tsing!

538
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:09,419
Don't follow me.

539
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,388
You can't go!

540
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:16,621
Where's Tsing?

541
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,009
Tsing?

542
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:45,483
l'm not coming for you.

543
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:14,746
Heaven and earth are limit-less.

544
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:20,486
The bearded guy killed
your sister. Let's report.

545
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:22,493
l can't go with you.

546
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:23,993
l don't care, l must get
you out here.

547
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:48,710
Tsing!

548
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:51,814
Tsing's gone?

549
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,066
Court!

550
00:54:09,944 --> 00:54:11,241
Someone is coming to pay you money.

551
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:12,174
Yes.

552
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:13,736
Did you get money?

553
00:54:14,315 --> 00:54:15,111
Not yet!

554
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:16,080
Master not yet arrives.

555
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:20,142
Clean your teeth.

556
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:21,276
Wash your face, Master.

557
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,288
Master!

558
00:54:23,557 --> 00:54:26,754
Disturbing me at this hour!

559
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:28,360
Beat him up!

560
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:29,859
Double.

561
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:32,664
Stop, l'll forget everything

562
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,994
Did you get the money?

563
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:35,598
Yes, of course.

564
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:36,961
Nonsense?

565
00:54:37,104 --> 00:54:37,900
Beat!

566
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:40,300
l saw the murderer Liu!

567
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:41,606
Liu?

568
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:43,765
Who's he?

569
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,745
He's a wanted convict.

570
00:54:46,947 --> 00:54:49,040
But we got him 3 hours ago!

571
00:54:51,185 --> 00:54:53,676
l'm a money mind.

572
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:55,151
You're worse than me!

573
00:54:55,256 --> 00:54:58,657
Want to take my money?

574
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,157
Beat you to death.

575
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:02,091
Beat!

576
00:55:02,162 --> 00:55:02,958
l really saw him.

577
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,019
Did you?

578
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:07,430
Who's in the jail?

579
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:08,962
Yes, it's Liu?

580
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:09,967
lt's guilty.

581
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:11,296
Beat!

582
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:12,134
l think

583
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,433
you get the wrong person!

584
00:55:13,574 --> 00:55:15,269
We always get the wrong person!

585
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,238
Really?

586
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,366
Yes!

587
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:19,909
Get Liu!

588
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,878
Get Liu!

589
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,810
Get Liu!

590
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:26,713
lf he's really Liu,

591
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,716
then it's not a good business.

592
00:55:27,821 --> 00:55:29,118
Don't plead guilty. Beat!

593
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:30,154
Yes!

594
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:31,620
Beat!

595
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:35,186
Why are you still hitting?

596
00:55:35,663 --> 00:55:36,652
Stop it!

597
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:39,124
Killer!

598
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:40,663
Liu...

599
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:41,926
Liu?

600
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:44,663
No robbing. l'm poor!

601
00:55:45,939 --> 00:55:47,031
Mr. Chiu!

602
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:51,009
Yen?

603
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:52,537
Yen?

604
00:55:53,547 --> 00:55:55,538
Deduct your payroll.

605
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,310
You don't know Yen?

606
00:55:57,618 --> 00:55:59,210
He's so famous...

607
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,118
in 26 Province.

608
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:03,817
He hates greedy Master.

609
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:05,791
l'm not involved.

610
00:56:05,893 --> 00:56:08,088
Swordsman Yen, are you
coming to grab me?

611
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:11,425
l don't care the case. l'm
coming to see my brother.

612
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,258
Don't listen to him. He ain't my brother.

613
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:15,858
Hold it!... Maybe it's wrong.

614
00:56:16,937 --> 00:56:18,632
Your honour, Liu is here.

615
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:22,899
Master, Liu is in jail.

616
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:26,304
Take him away! No fund!

617
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:27,209
Go away!

618
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:28,077
Yes.

619
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,648
Go away!

620
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,210
You've to protect me. He's a murderer.

621
00:56:34,655 --> 00:56:35,553
Nonsense!

622
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:37,987
lt's so complicated.

623
00:56:38,158 --> 00:56:40,558
Triple the price.

624
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:41,525
Right!

625
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:42,491
Who's the killer?

626
00:56:42,563 --> 00:56:43,461
That's him!

627
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,622
l'm not a murderer!

628
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:50,996
l'm tired.

629
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:52,536
What's happening?

630
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:55,164
lt's serious. Add some more!

631
00:56:57,478 --> 00:57:00,072
Listen! No dead body, no case.

632
00:57:00,381 --> 00:57:02,372
We are making up.

633
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,278
You're wasting our energy!

634
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:06,478
Pay double!

635
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:08,110
Stupid fool!

636
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:11,053
Be smart and pay it.

637
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:15,117
l want to, but l don't have any.

638
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,159
You can go and rob.

639
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:19,726
Your honour, let's cancel the case.

640
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,024
He's so generous.

641
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:23,601
Quickly pay and cancel the case.

642
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:26,431
Where's the spot of the murder?

643
00:57:26,673 --> 00:57:27,469
Speak up!

644
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:28,666
Lan Ro Temple.

645
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,020
The one who died is not
a human being.

646
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:44,053
l saw you chop off that
woman's head.

647
00:57:44,258 --> 00:57:45,657
Not a woman, a ghost.

648
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:47,215
Ghost?

649
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:50,159
Anything not linked with
human is not my concern.

650
00:57:50,364 --> 00:57:51,160
Right!

651
00:57:51,265 --> 00:57:52,562
Then l don't charge you.

652
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:54,165
Let's adjourn without charge...

653
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,926
Adjourned without charge...

654
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:04,133
l know that woman.

655
00:58:05,078 --> 00:58:06,375
Her family lives behind that Temple.

656
00:58:06,513 --> 00:58:09,607
lt's now deserted.
Behind it is the grave.

657
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:12,877
Grave?

658
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:17,522
Because of the chaotic situation,

659
00:58:17,858 --> 00:58:19,257
the people in town have all left.

660
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,351
The haunted sound at night,

661
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:24,386
are made by those stray ghost.

662
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:31,599
Ghost? l don't believe it!

663
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:35,133
lf you don't believe,
l'll take you to see them.

664
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:01,793
See for yourself!

665
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:25,621
You believe it now?

666
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,360
lf she was a ghost,
why didn't she kill me?

667
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,427
May be you still have some use.

668
00:59:34,768 --> 00:59:36,167
What use?

669
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:37,729
Only a ghost can tell.

670
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:42,140
Ghosts use each other like people.

671
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:45,870
Get out of here before it gets dark.

672
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:47,736
And you?

673
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:52,911
l'm staying. The mundane
world is too complicated.

674
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:58,354
lt's simpler to get along with ghosts.

675
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:00,018
l'm staying.

676
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:01,425
Go now!

677
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:37,226
l've thought it over. You'd better stay.

678
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:40,124
Stay? Those female ghosts may hurt me.

679
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:42,899
So much the better.

680
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:44,697
l can wipe them out all.

681
01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:47,296
lf they come to you, ring this bell,

682
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,675
and l'll come to your rescue

683
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:56,609
You want to use me to kill Tsing?

684
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:59,110
Yes, they get fed up with me and...

685
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:03,385
won't to tolerate me anymore

686
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:05,649
This one is powerful.

687
01:01:06,326 --> 01:01:07,725
Can you cope with them?

688
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:12,995
Sure, evil can't conquer good.

689
01:01:18,038 --> 01:01:20,529
Hold the Sutra.

690
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,032
What language is that?

691
01:01:24,144 --> 01:01:25,236
Sanskrit.

692
01:01:25,312 --> 01:01:27,109
Remember, concentration
invites buddhism.

693
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:30,377
What's the first line?

694
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:32,710
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

695
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:35,719
You know Sanskrit?

696
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,983
No, but l know this principle.

697
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:44,395
Remember to ring the bell
when you see the evil.

698
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:52,664
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

699
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:55,504
Don't keep reciting that!

700
01:01:55,575 --> 01:01:57,770
The evil may not appear then

701
01:02:59,372 --> 01:03:00,771
Who's it?

702
01:03:02,442 --> 01:03:03,431
Say it, or l'll open the door.

703
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,284
Why are you returning?

704
01:03:18,492 --> 01:03:19,789
The old woman knows it!

705
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,549
Are you a ghost?

706
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:23,721
Yes!

707
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:26,221
Did you kill those men in that temple?

708
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:27,422
l had no choice.

709
01:03:28,902 --> 01:03:31,700
l had to do it under the circumstances.

710
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:35,601
Keep away...

711
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:36,936
Keep away, or l'll be nasty.

712
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:38,767
Did you hurt yourself?

713
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:46,751
Don't be afraid, l won't hurt you.

714
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:55,558
Why don't you believe me?

715
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:57,359
Have l ever hurt you?

716
01:03:57,798 --> 01:03:58,787
A ghost is evil.

717
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:01,926
You are a ghost. How can l trust you?

718
01:04:02,402 --> 01:04:04,700
But some men one more
scareful than ghosts.

719
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:09,003
They are more harmful.

720
01:04:09,676 --> 01:04:14,170
Some ghosts are
unable to vent their grievances

721
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:16,380
That's why l'm wondering

722
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:20,075
ln fact, some ghosts are better than men.

723
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:22,179
Why did you kill then?

724
01:04:24,658 --> 01:04:26,057
That old woman forced me to

725
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,660
She's a 1000-year old tree monster.

726
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:31,096
l'm from a good family,

727
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:34,031
but l was murdered.

728
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:38,336
My father buried me under that old tree.

729
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:41,463
He was also killed later.

730
01:04:41,975 --> 01:04:43,374
Then that old woman
controlled my body and

731
01:04:43,577 --> 01:04:45,568
used me to lure men to
absord their elements.

732
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:50,310
She's now selling me to that
old monster.

733
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:52,245
Stop!

734
01:04:54,154 --> 01:04:55,246
Hsiao Tsing!

735
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:07,225
Why don't you ring the bell?

736
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:13,931
Are you still afraid of me?

737
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:17,099
No, l must deliver you out
of that old woman.

738
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,308
Really?

739
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:19,503
After tomorrow,

740
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:23,038
take my ashes to a family
before dusk,

741
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,047
and l'll have a chance
of reincarnation.

742
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:26,644
Rest assured.

743
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:29,554
l'll unearth it early tomorrow,

744
01:05:30,724 --> 01:05:33,420
and deliver it.

745
01:05:37,097 --> 01:05:38,086
Bad! Go quick!

746
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:40,765
That Taoist will fix you!

747
01:05:43,637 --> 01:05:45,730
That old woman told me to hurt you!

748
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:47,930
He may come to kill you. Go now!

749
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:53,873
Don't worry! We are blessed.

750
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,676
l have magic.

751
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:59,977
Damn Taoist, you fooled me...

752
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:01,745
lt won't work.

753
01:06:02,122 --> 01:06:03,817
Why doesn't it work?

754
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:07,422
What's this?

755
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:08,619
That old woman's tongue.

756
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,362
Ning Tsai-shen!

757
01:06:18,471 --> 01:06:19,563
Tsing!

758
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,030
Ning Tsai-shen!

759
01:06:26,046 --> 01:06:27,035
What's this?

760
01:06:29,883 --> 01:06:31,180
Tsing!

761
01:07:19,432 --> 01:07:21,730
Shut your mouth or the
tongue may get in!

762
01:07:36,683 --> 01:07:37,672
This way!

763
01:07:44,224 --> 01:07:45,122
Tsing!

764
01:07:45,225 --> 01:07:46,317
Leave me alone.

765
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:50,051
Ning Tsai-shen!

766
01:07:56,236 --> 01:07:58,329
Follow the cloth, don't ever look back.

767
01:08:00,507 --> 01:08:01,303
Tsing! l...

768
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:02,463
Go?

769
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:12,446
Ning Tsai-shen...

770
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,379
Tsing!

771
01:08:24,964 --> 01:08:25,953
Ning Tsai-shen!

772
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:27,722
Tsing!

773
01:08:30,637 --> 01:08:31,626
Old woman!

774
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:53,657
lt's you?

775
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,954
Who else, if not me?

776
01:08:56,563 --> 01:08:58,155
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come?

777
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:01,062
Why didn't you ring the bell

778
01:09:01,835 --> 01:09:04,133
How dare you take away my meat?

779
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,940
l don't mind your killing those bad ones.

780
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:13,175
But this scholar who is so pure,

781
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,278
but weak and good for nothing.

782
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:17,939
What else of goodness do you have?

783
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:20,082
Don't compliment me!

784
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:22,484
l can't convince her without bluffing.

785
01:09:23,923 --> 01:09:26,118
Killing him means not giving
me any face.

786
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:27,818
What about your killing my maid?

787
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,293
That's not giving me any face either?

788
01:09:31,931 --> 01:09:34,229
Damn old woman,
let's not talk about face.

789
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,059
Well, let's fight it out!

790
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:38,102
Let's see who is stronger.

791
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:43,434
Her tongue is longer than yours.

792
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:44,474
Go away!

793
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,117
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

794
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,654
Blessing sword!

795
01:10:12,872 --> 01:10:14,772
No scruples in Heaven or on earth.

796
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:23,445
Tsing!

797
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:24,605
Ning Tsai-shen!

798
01:10:26,686 --> 01:10:27,675
Keep away!

799
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:30,249
Hit!

800
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,158
Don't kill her, Tsing!

801
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:36,551
Bastard! Come back quick!

802
01:10:55,982 --> 01:10:57,279
Help that Taoist fight
with the old woman.

803
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,279
Where?

804
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:05,155
Anywhere will do!

805
01:11:05,225 --> 01:11:06,021
What if l hit?

806
01:11:08,761 --> 01:11:09,955
My bottom!

807
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,129
She's coming again!

808
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:38,384
Run! Don't mope over there!

809
01:11:42,295 --> 01:11:43,387
Tsing!

810
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:52,960
Watch out!

811
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:02,906
l want you lives.

812
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:05,978
l chop!

813
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:16,384
Tsing!

814
01:12:16,562 --> 01:12:20,555
Tsing...

815
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,167
Are you mad? You know she's harmful.

816
01:12:23,403 --> 01:12:24,392
Why do you follow her?

817
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:26,437
She was forced. Don't misunderstand.

818
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:30,131
There's a boundary between
men and ghosts.

819
01:12:31,544 --> 01:12:32,738
Men should keep away from
ghost's affairs.

820
01:12:32,912 --> 01:12:34,209
We shouldn't get involved.

821
01:12:34,714 --> 01:12:36,909
l've broken her century-old magic.

822
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:39,814
She's powerful,

823
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:41,886
but can only wreak havoc in a century.

824
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:43,280
lf there's nothing happened.

825
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:47,222
Don't interfere her matters.

826
01:12:52,865 --> 01:12:54,457
l've to keep my promise.

827
01:12:55,468 --> 01:12:56,765
l must bring her ashes back
to her birth place,

828
01:12:56,903 --> 01:12:58,700
so that she can be reincarnated.

829
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:05,069
Swordsman, l know you don't
want to get involved.

830
01:13:05,278 --> 01:13:06,973
There's lots of high landers
on the way to the town.

831
01:13:07,146 --> 01:13:08,943
l can't make it without your help.

832
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:15,613
Swordsman Yen, l beg you.

833
01:13:16,122 --> 01:13:17,419
Help me bringing her ashes back.

834
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:19,056
Give her a chance.

835
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:20,352
Please!

836
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:21,787
On your feet!

837
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:28,759
l hide up,

838
01:13:29,869 --> 01:13:32,167
because l hate to go with
those face & mean person.

839
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:34,471
So l hide in this temple.

840
01:13:34,841 --> 01:13:36,331
l pretend to be a ghost in
front of a man,

841
01:13:37,243 --> 01:13:38,938
and a human in front of a ghost,

842
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,870
and now l don't know if l'm
a man or a ghost.

843
01:13:42,682 --> 01:13:44,673
l'm not a swordsman.

844
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:47,110
Ridiculous!

845
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,412
What so funny!

846
01:13:48,788 --> 01:13:50,278
l don't want to be a man.

847
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,590
But Tsing wants to reincarnation.

848
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,149
Don't say that!

849
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:57,091
The most important is to
get out here.

850
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:02,967
l don't understand all those
nonsense!

851
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:04,794
Alright, l promise you!

852
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:24,748
l find it!

853
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:35,029
Why so much?

854
01:14:35,168 --> 01:14:36,066
How strange!

855
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:37,224
Which one?

856
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:39,396
No time to sort out now.
Take them away!

857
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,099
Where should we put the Sutra?

858
01:14:46,112 --> 01:14:46,908
ln the satchel!

859
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:48,979
No, keep it to make the
spirits follow us.

860
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:04,223
Follow me closely!

861
01:15:04,363 --> 01:15:05,762
l can't, you're riding too fast!

862
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:07,829
We're in rush.

863
01:15:16,943 --> 01:15:17,739
Swordsman Yen, something wrong!

864
01:15:17,877 --> 01:15:19,174
Why are we still at the same old place?

865
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:20,276
Must have to do with those evil spirits.

866
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:21,344
What then?

867
01:15:21,547 --> 01:15:23,538
We must get out of the
before it's dark.

868
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:41,893
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi!

869
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,634
Follow me.

870
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:13,125
Someone's celebrating!

871
01:16:13,266 --> 01:16:14,255
lnn keeper!

872
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:16,023
Why is it deserted?

873
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:17,291
All gone to hell!

874
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:19,296
What?

875
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:20,794
What are you doing?

876
01:16:20,973 --> 01:16:22,065
We want to stay the night.

877
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,302
Follow me!

878
01:16:30,616 --> 01:16:31,913
You can go!

879
01:16:32,685 --> 01:16:33,879
Don't come out!

880
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:51,101
Tsing, come out if you're
among them.

881
01:16:55,141 --> 01:17:00,238
Master, looking for me?

882
01:17:00,947 --> 01:17:05,941
Master, looking for us?

883
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:09,686
No sign of Tsing.
Maybe the wrong ashes!

884
01:17:09,822 --> 01:17:12,620
Get back your things and vanish.

885
01:17:12,892 --> 01:17:13,984
Don't wreak havoc anymore.

886
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:16,720
Thank you!

887
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:18,655
Vanish.

888
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,892
Last chance.

889
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,364
Now this is the last.

890
01:17:25,471 --> 01:17:27,769
Tsing, come out, if it's you!

891
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:31,542
Come out!...

892
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:34,736
Master, looking for me?

893
01:17:38,017 --> 01:17:41,111
A male! No chance!

894
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:46,187
Why do you keep calling me?

895
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:47,751
lt's the waiter.

896
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:50,921
You scare me!

897
01:17:51,063 --> 01:17:53,657
Damn! Why did you appear
so abruptly?

898
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:54,922
Get out!

899
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:06,674
Tsing!

900
01:18:06,746 --> 01:18:07,940
Ning Tsai-shen!

901
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:09,940
Tsing!

902
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:17,848
Thank you for serving my life!

903
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:22,052
Well...! Stand up!...

904
01:18:23,062 --> 01:18:25,257
Don't be formal. We're friends.

905
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,657
You're wasting the time!

906
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:32,167
l'll replace 2 horses for
the journey tomorrow.

907
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,206
What a pair of lovers!

908
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:43,604
That's his style!

909
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:02,361
lt's frosty all over the lake.

910
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:12,236
Time flies like which goes grey.

911
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,280
Facing the moon alone,
l need companion.

912
01:19:19,418 --> 01:19:23,013
Lovebirds fare better than fairies.

913
01:19:24,824 --> 01:19:27,019
This picture will be the
only thing l left.

914
01:19:27,326 --> 01:19:28,725
l'll keep it forever.

915
01:19:29,862 --> 01:19:32,763
We must at the town
tomorrow evening,

916
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:35,465
if not l couldn't reincarnation.

917
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:38,263
You should be happy for me.

918
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:40,762
What a chance for you.

919
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,177
But we must part before dawn,

920
01:19:50,316 --> 01:19:51,715
and forever.

921
01:19:54,153 --> 01:19:55,347
Heavens! Don't ever get dark

922
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:00,585
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

923
01:20:05,197 --> 01:20:06,186
Evil in the air!

924
01:20:11,237 --> 01:20:12,431
Blood bun?

925
01:20:19,912 --> 01:20:20,810
A ghost wedding.

926
01:20:22,515 --> 01:20:25,313
Stop moping! This inn is haunted.

927
01:20:25,484 --> 01:20:26,974
Pack up and get out of here.

928
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:30,144
l go and get the golden pagoda.

929
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:32,479
Hurry up!

930
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:36,824
Oh, l forgot the painting!

931
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:37,860
Get it when day breaks.

932
01:20:38,898 --> 01:20:40,092
Ning Tsai-shen!

933
01:20:41,267 --> 01:20:42,461
Today's a good day in hell.

934
01:20:42,735 --> 01:20:44,134
They must've got Tsing back.

935
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:45,292
Old Evil is coming to
collect the bride.

936
01:20:45,504 --> 01:20:47,995
Scholar, it seems we've
to storm hell!

937
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:50,264
We must rescue Tsing.

938
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,809
Hold it! We must rescue
her before the incense burns out.

939
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,070
We can't go back when
the day breaks.

940
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:56,336
Remember, close your eyes!

941
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,447
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

942
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:13,763
Can l open my eyes now?

943
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,027
You must, if you want to find her.

944
01:21:37,723 --> 01:21:38,815
Tsing's inside.

945
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:40,189
Tsing!

946
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:42,216
Ning Tsai-shen!

947
01:21:42,828 --> 01:21:43,920
Tsing!

948
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,994
Why can't l get hold of her?

949
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:50,293
Ning Tsai-shen!

950
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:52,161
Tsing...

951
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:53,234
ln the mundane world men
can't see ghosts.

952
01:21:53,405 --> 01:21:54,599
ln hell ghosts can't see men.

953
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:55,865
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

954
01:21:56,575 --> 01:21:58,566
Tsing can see you now. Go now.

955
01:22:08,287 --> 01:22:10,881
They're going to hell!

956
01:22:12,024 --> 01:22:13,218
Go!

957
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:14,853
Tsing!

958
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,254
What now?

959
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:17,260
Go into hiding

960
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:24,667
Go and rescue Tsing at once.

961
01:22:24,837 --> 01:22:25,633
Me?

962
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:26,500
Let's go!

963
01:22:27,306 --> 01:22:28,295
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

964
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:32,006
Heaven and earth are limitless.

965
01:22:45,124 --> 01:22:46,022
Here l am!

966
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:47,385
Don't mind, run!

967
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:48,782
l'm here to help you.

968
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:50,459
l cut it for you.

969
01:22:59,038 --> 01:23:00,027
Run!

970
01:23:07,746 --> 01:23:08,838
The magic powers!

971
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:13,545
Swordsman Yen, watch out!

972
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:30,665
You go first, l'll stay behind.

973
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,133
Find another exit.

974
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:36,895
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Mi.

975
01:24:43,242 --> 01:24:44,038
Swordsman Yen!

976
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,005
Why have you come back?

977
01:24:45,177 --> 01:24:45,973
We can't get out of here!

978
01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:46,974
Old Evil has blocked the exit.

979
01:24:49,148 --> 01:24:51,946
You can't get out of here.

980
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:53,643
Help me get an arrow.

981
01:24:54,353 --> 01:24:55,445
Full the bow.

982
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:57,749
Let loose!

983
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,052
Bad, we're not his match.

984
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:14,563
Pull at him. This is
1000-year old Evil.

985
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,037
He may drain your soul away.

986
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:19,132
Swordsman Yen!

987
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,752
Concentrate!

988
01:25:36,095 --> 01:25:38,495
Recite! Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi.

989
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:42,665
Lord Black, please let them go.

990
01:25:43,802 --> 01:25:49,399
Break the golden pagoda and
be my companion.

991
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:51,970
Tsing, don't be taken in.

992
01:25:53,245 --> 01:25:54,940
Concentrate! Recite!

993
01:25:55,848 --> 01:25:59,045
Pao-Yeh-Pao-Lo-Mi...

994
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,814
Don't!

995
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:10,055
l'll rescue you!

996
01:26:30,182 --> 01:26:31,376
Tsing!

997
01:26:37,789 --> 01:26:41,987
Yen Che-hsia, Ning Tsai-shen
l'll take your lives.

998
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,489
Don't!

999
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:56,201
What's this? The sutra?

1000
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:00,667
You'd enough.

1001
01:27:00,746 --> 01:27:01,940
l've to get rid of your damn evil.

1002
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:23,026
Damn old Evil!

1003
01:27:23,936 --> 01:27:25,028
Swordsman Yen!

1004
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:27,665
The way's clear! Help
Swordsman Yen out!

1005
01:27:33,478 --> 01:27:34,570
Swordsman Yen!

1006
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,697
Swordsman Yen, we're back to earth.

1007
01:27:58,136 --> 01:27:59,535
Bad, it's dawn.

1008
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:00,830
Tsing's not yet here.

1009
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,137
Help her out.

1010
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:12,082
Swordsman Yen, lead a hand!

1011
01:28:21,126 --> 01:28:22,115
Tsing!

1012
01:28:22,828 --> 01:28:24,022
Keep her from the sunshine,

1013
01:28:24,363 --> 01:28:26,957
or she may evaporate and
can't be reincarnated.

1014
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:34,669
Tsing, come back to the
golden pagoda!

1015
01:28:40,846 --> 01:28:44,043
The sun is rising, l've to go!

1016
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:49,550
Tsing, be a good human being.

1017
01:28:51,423 --> 01:28:53,118
l'll remember you always.

1018
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:56,526
Can't see you once before we apart.

1019
01:28:57,396 --> 01:28:58,385
Take care!

1020
01:29:04,503 --> 01:29:05,993
She's gone!

1021
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:17,348
l want to be together,

1022
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:27,249
till eternity.

1023
01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:34,729
Tsing, l'll take you back.

1024
01:30:00,392 --> 01:30:01,791
Wonder if she has been reincarnated.

1025
01:30:02,327 --> 01:30:06,627
ln there times, an unlucky man may
fare worse than a ghost.

1026
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,565
Ahead.

1027
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:14,831
Let's go.

1028
01:30:18,577 --> 01:30:21,671
The path of life

1029
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,642
Are dreams, like the length of the path

1030
01:30:26,618 --> 01:30:29,519
The storm on the way

1031
01:30:29,654 --> 01:30:34,353
Pass by as you go along

1032
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:38,127
ln the world

1033
01:30:38,196 --> 01:30:42,189
How many ways can one dream?

1034
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:47,661
Looking for dream-like love

1035
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:52,276
And the path goes on

1036
01:30:53,078 --> 01:31:00,177
Life is what dreams and
desires are made of

1037
01:31:00,986 --> 01:31:03,978
Somewhere in the dream

1038
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:08,492
There are traces of tears

1039
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:12,324
Where to go to?

1040
01:31:12,564 --> 01:31:16,364
To find where my heart wants to go

1041
01:31:16,968 --> 01:31:21,962
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

1042
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:26,668
And the path and l go on
