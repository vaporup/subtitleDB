1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,405
There are 666 portals that
connect this world to the other side.

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,571
These are concealed
from all human beings.

3
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,671
But there are some
who notice their existence.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,081
And some are willing to open the door
and try to gain the power of darkness...

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,949
Somewhere in Japan exists
the 444th portal, known as...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,511
The Forest of Resurrection.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,057
It was a long time ago when the
evil soul uncovered its existence...

8
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,830
This way.

9
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,004
You better be right.

10
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,476
It's okay.

11
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,805
Just trust me.

12
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,227
Where are they?

13
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't worry, they're coming.

14
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,773
I'm not worried.

15
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,808
I just don't trust you.

16
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,538
Do as you please then.

17
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,539
It's quite a big deal for a pick-up, isn't it?

18
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,064
Where's the other car?

19
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,947
We gotta wait for him.

20
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,483
Then we'll leave.

21
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,910
Are you serious?

22
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,954
It's not safe here.

23
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,980
It doesn't matter.

24
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,592
We have specific orders from him.

25
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:13,689
Look, the roads
could be blocked by now.

26
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,691
We gotta go!

27
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,030
What about roadblocks?

28
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,502
That's not our concern.

29
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,105
Hey, you...

30
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,405
Shut up, what the hell
are we doing here anyway?

31
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,239
No, you shut up.

32
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,170
An order is an order, stop whining.

33
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,410
To hell with those orders!

34
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,718
Do you know what we
had to go through for this?

35
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,324
Besides, this place
gives me the creeps.

36
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,786
Don't bother.

37
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,823
These assholes can't do
anything but follow orders.

38
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,234
What?

39
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,970
On your way to a party?

40
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,196
Or are you trying to
promote hoodlums?

41
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,137
You...

42
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,676
Better watch your mouth.

43
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,969
After all this running around...

44
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,113
...all we get is a
useless bunch of punks.

45
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,543
Count me out.

46
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,550
I see.

47
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,220
So, shall I give you some time to rest?

48
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,891
Like forever?

49
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,253
Stop!

50
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,859
We were also ordered
to keep this guy alive.

51
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,261
Shut up, come on, come on, come on!

52
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,903
I don't understand
why this one is so special.

53
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,264
But you have to
follow orders, too, right?

54
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,703
Don't be so nosy.

55
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,300
Wait a minute!

56
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,412
Calm down, all right?

57
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,338
You'd better be quiet, too.

58
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,208
Don't be so tense.

59
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,254
Fighting wouldn't do
any good here, right?

60
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,254
That goes for you, too.

61
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,088
We'll let you get out of here
when he comes, so be patient.

62
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,456
You know what?

63
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,924
I really hate waiting.

64
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,060
Stop it for now, it's not a good time.

65
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,607
That's right...

66
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,270
There's still...

67
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,276
After he gets here...

68
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,621
We'd better get out of here quick.

69
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,514
No matter how many times
we come here, I hate this place.

70
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,454
It's ominous.

71
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,353
A forest to the southwest
is an ominous feng shui sign.

72
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,290
Oh, really?

73
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,261
Meeting with you
guys is ominous enough.

74
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,667
I told you to shut up.

75
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,935
Don't start again!

76
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:37,968
Hey!

77
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,243
Bring the girl.

78
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,674
Hey, what's with this girl?

79
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,446
Who knows?

80
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,220
The order was to kidnap
her and bring her here with us.

81
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,218
One stupid girl and one asshole...

82
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,783
What the hell is he
planning to do with those two?

83
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,593
I don't have the slightest
idea what he is thinking!

84
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,032
Hey, come on.

85
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,066
He must have some plan.

86
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,331
Hey, wait.

87
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,241
I'm taking no part in kidnapping.

88
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,435
What?

89
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,874
What did you say?

90
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,308
Five men on one girl,
you must be proud of yourself.

91
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,052
Hey, let her go and take off your toupee.

92
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,818
Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,414
Do you know who you're talking to?

94
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,551
Perhaps you're misunderstanding
the situation, hmm?

95
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,926
A crook like you could be spending the
rest of your life in jail if we weren't here.

96
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,465
So just shut your smart ass mouth up!

97
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,764
Here's the thing, I'm a feminist.

98
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,005
What're you gonna do about it?

99
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,515
Hey you, let her go now.

100
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,049
Watch it.

101
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,715
I'm telling you,
you should just let her go now.

102
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,626
Hey, are you crazy or what?

103
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,762
Don't make me tell you again.

104
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,024
Let her go right now,
or you'll pay for it later.

105
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,506
So what are you going
to do now, tough guy?

106
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,192
Where did they go?

107
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,032
It's scary here.

108
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,737
I'll kill that guy.

109
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,006
No, you shouldn't do that.

110
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,612
If you do, he'll become
a monster like them.

111
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,117
I don't get it...

112
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,914
You know what?

113
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,487
Then I can kill the bastard twice.

114
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,116
That's nonsense.

115
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,120
This is not good, let's get out of here.

116
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,824
Don't be stupid,
we can't let them get away!

117
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,768
We have bigger problems, don't we?

118
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,498
Look, this is your fault, isn't it?

119
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,368
It's not just that, think about it.

120
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,841
Thinking isn't going to do a bit of good.

121
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,144
They were not dead...

122
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,740
This can't be happening.

123
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,785
We'd better catch
them before he gets here.

124
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,849
Yeah...

125
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,923
You're right.

126
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,870
Why did you do that?

127
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,405
You didn't have to kill that man.

128
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,838
What's your problem?

129
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,908
If you did something like that,
you're no different from those men.

130
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,410
They're bastards, I'm not.

131
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,853
I'm sorry...

132
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,394
Thanks for helping me.

133
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,197
I didn't mean to help you.

134
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,297
They just piss me off.

135
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,431
So, what are we gonna do?

136
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,812
Didn't you have a plan?

137
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,184
Plans always change.

138
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,853
What are you talking about?

139
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,319
They're going to kill us!

140
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,665
But they were...

141
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,170
...definitely dead.

142
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,676
Hey.

143
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,556
So, why were you in jail?

144
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,861
Shut up, let's go.

145
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,113
Something's not right with this forest.

146
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,186
Like what?

147
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,988
People are everywhere...

148
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,686
...but you can't hear a thing.

149
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,896
Nobody's here.

150
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,202
Yes, they are.

151
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,146
What makes you think that?

152
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,973
I've had a strong sixth
sense ever since I was little.

153
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,976
Hey.

154
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:57,947
Hey...

155
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,781
Wait.

156
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,420
What's wrong with you?

157
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,057
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

158
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,634
Stay back.

159
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,104
This man...

160
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,402
What are you doing?

161
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,737
Hey, stop!

162
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,446
Don't do that!

163
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,149
Hey, wait!

164
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,214
Let that man rest in peace!

165
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,185
I don't believe this...

166
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,388
You're crazy.

167
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,237
Let's go.

168
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,035
We'll take their car.

169
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,534
Stop it!

170
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,405
Let's just go.

171
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,284
They must still be around here.

172
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,291
Something's wrong here.

173
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:41,855
That again?

174
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,423
I can feel it!

175
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,102
Those guys back there...

176
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,370
There is something here!

177
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,076
Hey...

178
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,547
What?

179
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,647
They were...

180
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,210
...definitely dead...

181
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,353
...but they came back to life.

182
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,753
So what?

183
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,188
The dead can come back to life here.

184
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,227
So, what are you saying?

185
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,360
We've...

186
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,926
...been here over and over...

187
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,299
And...

188
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,465
The ones we killed...

189
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,534
We buried them!

190
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,574
They are supposed
to be buried right here!

191
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:36,049
Where the fuck are they now?

192
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,359
Where are they?

193
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,180
I didn't mean to...

194
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,415
I just...

195
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,351
Come!

196
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,554
Let go of me!

197
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,352
The game is over.

198
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,890
What are those monsters?

199
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,057
I thought they were your playmates.

200
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,790
So, do you want me to kill you?

201
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,361
Then you can be my next playmate!

202
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,367
Don't kill this one!

203
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,691
You have orders!

204
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,037
Hey, you've got the wrong man.

205
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,175
I don't care.

206
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,973
Just let the guy go.

207
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,440
That's why you're
nothing more than a punk.

208
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,255
Wow.

209
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,028
This is getting complicated.

210
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,022
Hey, she's been taken away.

211
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:24,930
Huh?

212
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,333
What are you talking about?

213
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,270
That runt shot my arm and took the girl.

214
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,304
Jesus, the both of you!

215
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,243
You're both crazy!

216
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,947
Are you turning back now?

217
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,314
I'll play with you later.

218
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,815
So, just wait here.

219
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,761
You just let him go?

220
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,702
I'm disappointed in you.

221
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,769
Don't you get it?

222
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,903
Lt'll be easier if we let
that guy find the girl for us.

223
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:08,971
Huh?

224
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,381
We'll get them both
after they're together.

225
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,714
Now I see!

226
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,123
You're using your brain!

227
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,482
Keep both of them alive...

228
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,957
Those were his orders exactly.

229
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,197
Oh, too bad.

230
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,667
It doesn't matter anymore.

231
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,180
He's going to die anyway.

232
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,512
I'll be in charge from now on.

233
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,016
What?

234
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,284
It's all been planned,
he's just coming here to die.

235
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,517
Don't fool with me!

236
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,429
What was that?

237
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,389
Lt'd be a pain in the ass
if you became a monster...

238
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,319
...so die slowly.

239
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,987
Are you okay?

240
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,062
Yeah...

241
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,058
But this place is fucked up.

242
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,337
Nothing can stop me...

243
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,807
Not even those monsters...

244
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,037
Don't worry.

245
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,089
Come on, run faster!

246
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,194
Bastards...

247
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:17,801
Are you okay?

248
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,103
It hurts...

249
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,508
Hey...

250
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,103
Your hand!

251
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,847
They took it...

252
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,751
Those bastards!

253
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,911
Damn it!

254
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,217
We'll make them pay for this.

255
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,154
Shouldn't we report back?

256
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,214
No...

257
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,958
We'll search for them...

258
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,853
...and destroy them!

259
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,692
But...

260
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,356
We don't know where they are.

261
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,125
I know what they're thinking.

262
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,871
They must have taken the mountain
paths instead of going down the highway.

263
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,142
I was trained at FBI
headquarters in Langley.

264
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,372
I'm an expert at profiling.

265
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,641
An expert?

266
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,708
So, Expert, where in the mountains?

267
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,451
Don't worry.

268
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,712
I'll track them down.

269
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,317
I grew up at Yellowstone
National Park in Canada.

270
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:10,890
A natural born hunter!

271
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,053
A hunter?

272
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,058
Which way?

273
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:16,599
No!

274
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,725
Shut the fuck up!

275
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,295
What's wrong with this place?

276
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,632
He'll come after us.

277
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,297
Let me go!

278
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,533
This is so insane.

279
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,670
You...

280
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,042
You did all this?

281
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,385
It's all your fault!

282
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:37,953
Stop...

283
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,087
You're crazy...

284
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:41,887
Hey.

285
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:47,754
No!

286
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,825
What do you want?

287
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,067
You don't have to kill this one.

288
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,206
Shut up, don't preach at me.

289
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,143
You can't hurt people for no reason.

290
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,675
In the world these days, a lot
of people are better off dead.

291
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,611
That's not for you to judge.

292
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,552
What are you, a preacher?

293
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:16,554
Okay, fine.

294
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,491
Let's go.

295
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,619
Look, no more killing, okay?

296
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,609
We've been waiting.

297
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,477
Since you three are here...

298
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,217
...it'll all be over soon, right?

299
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,604
M-My gun...

300
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,772
Hey, who the hell are you?

301
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,869
How did you get here?

302
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,837
I was kidnapped...

303
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,384
What?

304
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,520
I can't remember.

305
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:55,754
Huh?

306
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,456
I can't remember
anything about what happened...

307
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,697
...before I got here.

308
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,796
What the hell are you talking about?

309
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,995
How about you?

310
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,236
Why were you in prison?

311
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,170
I was...

312
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,612
What?

313
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,510
You don't remember either?

314
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,448
I forget things easily.

315
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,381
So, you too...

316
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,440
When did you get here?

317
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,674
Just now.

318
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,814
What the hell was with those
two idiots and all the monsters?

319
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,020
What are you up to?

320
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,956
Something bad.

321
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,228
Where are the others?

322
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,900
They're all dead except us.

323
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,202
I see.

324
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,269
And why are you alive?

325
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,401
Got a problem?

326
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,071
Yeah, you.

327
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,900
A scumbag like you should be dead.

328
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:41,081
Well, well, well,
who are these scary people?

329
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,218
What's going on?

330
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,059
You're dead.

331
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,408
No, let's get away from here.

332
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,441
That was pretty good, boys and girls.

333
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,386
But not good enough.

334
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,706
Hey, baby.

335
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:31,856
You...

336
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,397
What are you?

337
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,897
If you want to kill me...

338
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,808
...you'll need to bring an army.

339
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,235
Bastard!

340
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,412
I'll give you power...

341
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,010
...in death!

342
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,436
It's him!

343
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,251
No, we have to go!

344
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,951
No, he is...

345
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,287
Please, let's go!

346
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,155
Hurry!

347
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,728
Hurts?

348
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,689
Human life is only an instant.

349
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,692
Your body will eventually rot.

350
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,468
Do you want to be dead?

351
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,748
Or eternal life?

352
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,928
Eternal...

353
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,307
Any trouble?

354
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,179
Yes, a little accident.

355
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,718
Are you okay, officer?

356
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,823
Don't call me officer.

357
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,936
Did you do it again?

358
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,999
You better behave yourself.

359
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,612
Or, you'll be joining
those idiots on the mountain...

360
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,139
...officer.

361
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,417
You want to fight me?

362
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,310
The master of all martial arts?

363
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,217
The Fighter?

364
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,756
Okay, Fighter.

365
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:48,955
Fighter?

366
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,960
We don't have time for this crap.

367
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,959
Those criminal bastards!

368
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,924
Let's kill them all!

369
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,789
Right, Fighter.

370
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,298
Hey, your heart!

371
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,988
I'll give you this...

372
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,560
Help yourself!

373
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,134
H-Hot, hot, hot!

374
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,078
Mother fucker!
