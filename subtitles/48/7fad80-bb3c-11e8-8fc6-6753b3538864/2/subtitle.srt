1
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:08,977
What's wrong?

2
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:11,680
We should hurry!

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,352
What's going on?

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,489
Come on, let's go.

5
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,348
I'll tell you something...

6
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,324
I hate to turn my back.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,794
We don't have time for this.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,757
That man is dangerous...

9
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,428
Who the hell is he?

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,593
You know him, right?

11
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,829
He's...

12
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:31,673
Cut the crap already!

13
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,066
I don't know him at all!

14
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:35,842
Who the hell is he?

15
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,276
And who are you?

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,480
What does this have to do with me?

17
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,050
Because...

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,177
Say it!

19
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:54,223
It is your...

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,129
...destiny.

21
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,392
What?

22
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,798
You two are...

23
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,069
...destined to fight each other.

24
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,871
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,739
I've never even met him before.

26
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,345
You have...

27
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:16,917
What?

28
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:38,665
The Resurrection...

29
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,330
Stay back.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,134
We'll talk later.

31
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,161
It's time.

32
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,557
You said something
about Resurrection...

33
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,027
What were you talking about?

34
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,799
The power of returning the
dead soul back to the body.

35
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,836
It can be used only in
the Forest of Resurrection.

36
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,575
Now what?

37
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,680
The Forest of Resurrection...

38
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,314
Is where we are.

39
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,983
I don't understand.

40
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:50,985
It's him...

41
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,788
...he is resurrecting the dead...

42
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,793
...with the Power.

43
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,902
What are you talking about?

44
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,563
What Resurrection?

45
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,676
I was able to kill them.

46
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,106
That's because...

47
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:14,506
Who's that?

48
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:21,853
Is this one dead too?

49
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,425
No, that girl's alive.

50
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,940
Hey, what are you?

51
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:50,344
Hey!

52
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,563
Please, no killing!

53
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,794
Because...

54
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:44,936
I thought you were going to lose.

55
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:48,668
You know what?

56
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,437
I never lose.

57
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:00,443
Hot, hot!

58
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:11,792
What the hell?

59
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:26,948
Stop.

60
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,953
Huh?

61
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,376
They're around here...

62
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:36,322
What?

63
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,119
I can smell...

64
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,190
Smell?

65
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,588
I can smell like a dog...

66
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,327
Like a top dog breeder.

67
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,296
Like a dog breeder?

68
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,267
I smell...

69
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:58,980
Look.

70
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,342
An escapee.

71
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,280
We have your death warrant!

72
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:05,954
Go!

73
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,284
Die!

74
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:30,242
What?

75
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,046
Dammit...

76
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,915
T-This way!

77
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,779
No, this way...

78
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,110
Wait, this way!

79
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,029
Bitch!

80
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,266
W-Wait a minute!

81
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,972
You're not a monster...

82
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,106
You are not a monster...

83
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,305
Let me talk, bitch!

84
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:06,278
Speak.

85
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,581
You're not a monster yet, right?

86
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,579
Neither are you, right?

87
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,922
W-Wait a minute!

88
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,290
Don't misunderstand me!

89
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,654
I was just taken here...

90
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,992
Bitch!

91
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,228
It seems like...

92
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,267
...we are the only survivors...

93
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,136
...Baby.

94
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:39,680
What's going on?

95
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:41,404
I don't know...

96
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,508
But we need to get
out of here, that's for sure.

97
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,152
Hey, you want to come with me?

98
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:48,916
Why would I?

99
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:52,386
I know this forest very well.

100
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,158
I'd be a big help.

101
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,628
That's a good point.

102
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,161
However...

103
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,397
One wrong move...

104
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:04,803
...and you're dead.

105
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:07,234
I know that.

106
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,370
You...

107
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,631
You've changed.

108
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,872
Get up.

109
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:44,409
Hey...

110
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,175
You really don't remember anything?

111
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,118
What the hell are you talking about?

112
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,681
About me...

113
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,486
Don't you remember?

114
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,526
I've never seen you before.

115
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:01,520
Why...

116
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,427
Why did you help me then?

117
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,164
I told you.

118
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,167
I didn't mean to help.

119
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,267
You came after me...

120
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,164
...and you saved me.

121
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:15,541
You said
something about my destiny...

122
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,842
What is going on?

123
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,705
I will tell you.

124
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,077
It's you...

125
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,722
You're still alive.

126
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,848
Impressive.

127
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:33,153
So, you caused all of this.

128
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,794
I knew you could
survive no matter what.

129
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,566
I don't know you at all.

130
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,363
What do you want?

131
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,731
It's fine that you don't know
me, because your soul does...

132
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,767
You're making things complicated.

133
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,236
What are you up to?

134
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,573
It's time.

135
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,141
Give me the girl and come with me.

136
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:55,505
Don't be stupid.

137
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,851
Hey, hey, what are
you two talking about?

138
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,412
I don't like this at all.

139
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,222
This guy doesn't remember anything?

140
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,322
Really?

141
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:08,354
Leave us alone.

142
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,430
I can't do that.

143
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,859
I've waited...

144
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:16,499
Are you going to tell
me what you're up to?

145
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,767
He wants me dead.

146
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:24,473
What?

147
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,446
I'll grant you power.

148
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,012
Why don't you come with me?

149
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:55,132
I'll take care of her later.

150
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:57,669
Let's talk now.

151
00:13:58,146 --> 00:13:59,841
What's going on?

152
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,948
The girl's blood gives me power.

153
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:14,121
This is the Forest of Resurrection.

154
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:16,689
A Gate...

155
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,297
A portal to the other side...

156
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:23,896
Where the dead become zombies...

157
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:28,235
That was a joke.

158
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,509
That was nothing
compared to the real power.

159
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,844
A great power is hidden in this forest.

160
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,120
The darkness on the other side...

161
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,460
You need two keys
to open the gate there...

162
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,558
One is a human sacrifice.

163
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,464
And the other key is...

164
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,905
...the one with blood of Resurrection.

165
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:04,037
I found them...

166
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,077
Five hundred years ago.

167
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,447
You're totally insane.

168
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,684
Just shut up and come with me.

169
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,056
I'll show you...

170
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,485
...the power of darkness.

171
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:19,458
You know what?

172
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:22,057
I hate being told what to do.

173
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,609
It's no use.

174
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,434
You can't kill me.

175
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,241
So just shut up and
listen to what I have to say.

176
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,974
I don't want to listen.

177
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,984
Because you interrupted me...

178
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,315
...I had to wait five hundred
years for her to reincarnate.

179
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,791
It's been a long time.

180
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,090
But it's okay.

181
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,090
I forgive you.

182
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:15,474
I've waited for her to
reincarnate and mature.

183
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,148
I've been waiting for today.

184
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:21,611
The power of the Forest of
Resurrection and her matured blood...

185
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,154
...will open the gate to the other side.

186
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,468
I finally found you, but you were in jail.

187
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,500
I never expected you to be in jail.

188
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,935
And what's more...

189
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,836
You were serving a life term as a serious
criminal who committed disturbing crimes.

190
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:47,307
Why...

191
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:49,040
Did you make me come here?

192
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:51,816
I like you better as a criminal now.

193
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,784
You used to be an awful man...

194
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:59,555
You believed in this stupid idea of
justice, and you really made me suffer.

195
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,491
In the end, you did
something really stupid.

196
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,150
But you've changed quite a bit.

197
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:34,024
That's why I brought you here.

198
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,559
I'll forgive what you've done in the past.

199
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,963
Don't let me down this time.

200
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,070
Why don't you get lost?

201
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,533
You now have the
heart of a serious criminal.

202
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,645
How many people
have you killed so far?

203
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:54,941
Forty three people as of today...

204
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,307
That's my little brother.

205
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:59,414
Brother?

206
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:01,850
Do you feel that?

207
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:05,058
The power of this forest...

208
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,389
People are born...

209
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,663
...live...

210
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:16,829
...and die.

211
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,032
The darkness after death...

212
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,974
...is what's real...

213
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,984
I'm going to open that door.

214
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,847
Come with me.

215
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,562
Follow your instincts.

216
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,359
What your heart really wants...

217
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,503
...is darkness.

218
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,051
I'd rather die than live with you.

219
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,226
Then die.

220
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,536
As I planned...

221
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,844
Get the girl.

222
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:05,858
I'd rather die than let you touch me.

223
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:10,653
I'd rather die!

224
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,697
Still a bitch...

225
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,074
That man could never save you.

226
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:30,814
Not the last time.

227
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:34,815
And not this time.

228
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:39,021
You've finished playing your role.

229
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,594
It looks like you'll never grow up.

230
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,164
I've waited...

231
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:55,860
The Forest of Resurrection...

232
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:00,904
I've returned here after so many years...

233
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,605
...so open the gate in
exchange for her blood.

234
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,113
And grant me power...

235
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,287
Grant me the power!

236
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:44,618
Why?

237
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,249
How come nothing is happening?

238
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,762
Why is nothing happening?

239
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,551
My blood of Resurrection...

240
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,393
...only works once.

241
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,898
I've already used it.

242
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,367
Can you wait until I reincarnate...

243
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,374
...again?

244
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:47,077
You...

245
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:48,946
I'll kill you!

246
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:02,962
You wanted me to kill you
in a moment of anger, right?

247
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:08,300
However, you can't fool me.

248
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,070
I won't let you interfere with my plan.

249
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,534
Your blood is not good enough.

250
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:23,145
Your blood cannot open the gate.

251
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,445
Your blood is not enough!

252
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,919
You know why?

253
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,319
Figured it out yet?

254
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,860
Do you know why
I brought that man here?

255
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:43,293
That's right...

256
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,704
He was able to
resurrect with your blood.

257
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,768
That man's
resurrected blood is the true key.

258
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,192
I wanted to see that
expression on your face.

259
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:16,429
That face...

260
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:19,336
Hey.

261
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,679
You talk too much.

262
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,516
Here he comes...

263
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,516
...the last key.

264
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:46,260
It took me a while to remember.

265
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,336
I'm the one you want, right?

266
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,580
Don't touch my girl, fucking asshole!

267
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,558
You want to do it now?

268
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:15,991
Or...

269
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:19,691
Do you want to play?

270
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,620
Wait for me...

271
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:20,658
Don't worry.

272
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:22,956
I never lose.

273
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,364
Stay there.

274
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:16,303
Wait here.

275
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:19,502
This is between him and me.

276
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,313
One of us will return.

277
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:28,787
He's different now.

278
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,785
You might lose this time.

279
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:35,891
Maybe...

280
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,732
We'll see what happens...

281
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,111
You have to work
for what you really want.

282
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:57,181
Right?

283
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:15,859
Freeze...

284
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,366
Freeze...

285
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,300
I said, freeze!

286
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,173
Leave the car.

287
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,707
What was that?

288
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,317
What did you say,
what did you say, you runt?

289
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:35,354
I said, we're taking your car!

290
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:37,652
We are looking for escapees!

291
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:38,588
Out of my way!

292
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,620
So you are a Fighter.

293
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,060
I can tell.

294
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,461
Give me the car, that's all I'm saying!

295
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,365
Shut up, you asshole!

296
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,795
I'm sick of this place.

297
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,563
I'm really sorry.

298
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,130
You short-ass bitch!

299
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:08,484
Come on, get in the car!

300
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,929
T-That hurt!

301
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:33,579
Hey, let's go!

302
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,036
That was your partner!

303
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,702
That was not my fault!

304
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:16,267
Hey!

305
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,071
I've found you!

306
00:43:28,615 --> 00:43:31,345
Prisoner number KSC2-303!

307
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,876
Give me my right hand back!

308
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:57,905
Hey, I'd have two left hands!

309
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,848
You can't hit me with your slow bullets!

310
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,227
My reflexes are...

311
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,329
...five hundred times
faster than Mike Tyson's!

312
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:20,831
Come on!

313
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:25,137
Oops!

314
00:48:57,276 --> 00:48:58,743
Just like last time...

315
00:49:01,247 --> 00:49:03,807
No matter how much power
you've gained, you can't beat me.

316
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,288
The darkside has chosen me.

317
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:13,152
I won't let you stand in my way.

318
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:40,812
I told you...

319
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:43,587
I never lose.

320
00:56:21,787 --> 00:56:22,685
Listen...

321
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:24,654
What?

322
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,352
You came back...

323
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:35,433
...because of the forest and my blood.

324
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:41,770
If you leave this forest...

325
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,140
You might die.

326
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,911
Maybe...

327
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:54,244
But that's fine...

328
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:56,552
We'll see what happens.

329
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,222
I hate to be locked up in one place.

330
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:06,309
I should have been on your side.

331
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:19,259
There's nothing left
to destroy in this world.

332
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:25,169
Hurry up and take
me to the other side...

333
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,503
...brother.
