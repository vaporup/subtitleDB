362
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,159
We're just going to have to just...

363
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,839
I guess time, you know...

364
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
I'm not going to be able to stop
thinking about this, Ethan.

365
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,959
Well, what else can we do?

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,303
I mean what are we, what are
we going to do, you know?

367
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,981
Well, I mean, there's the...

368
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,959
There's the crazy thing
to do which is...

369
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,507
What?

370
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,791
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

371
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,599
Explore it further?

372
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,199
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

373
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,879
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

374
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,999
I know. And I, but I
had a whole evening...

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,639
In that house, and I have to say,

376
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,119
I know I sound like a
crazy person right now,

377
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,359
but I have to say it
was kind of magical.

378
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,639
- Well...
- It was...

379
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,439
But don't go overboard
with the whole magic

380
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,679
of what happened there

381
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,199
because I know what
you did in there, okay?

382
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,799
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

383
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,319
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

384
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,799
There was a rush.

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,959
It was exciting. I felt happy.

386
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,119
And it wasn't just that.

387
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,599
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

388
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,439
We had a great time
in the main house.

389
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,239
Yes, we did. We had a good time.

390
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
It wasn't just the weed.

391
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,759
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

392
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,599
we were happy, we were... Happy.

393
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,759
Yes.

394
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,359
We also had a fantastic time when
we did ecstasy at Lalapalooza,

395
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,319
but we're not going to do that every
day of our lives because you die...

396
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,479
- Right.
- Okay?

397
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,959
There's a question
of our safety here.

398
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,759
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

399
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,467
I didn't feel... I felt safe.

400
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,279
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

401
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,559
I felt like I was with you.

402
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,519
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

403
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,719
Exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

404
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,959
Not going back to the past

405
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,239
and re-creating old
things that happened

406
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,079
but starting with new things.

407
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,559
Yeah. Point taken.

408
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,679
I know that this is...

409
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,119
I didn't imagine this sort of...

410
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,319
- ...extreme.
- ...new thing.

411
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,439
Absolutely, but...

412
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,599
I imagined like horseback riding

413
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,439
with a little satchel
of wine, you know?

414
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,159
Not exploring other dimensions

415
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,999
in some weird version of
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,821
What if this is something
that I want to do?

417
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,479
You want to go back?

418
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,221
I want to help our relationship.

419
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,719
So... A little weird to say this,

420
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,559
but I'm struggling a
little bit with the fact

421
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,906
that you slept with the
other me last night.

422
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,599
Yeah, but I thought it was you.

423
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,239
I know. I'm not mad or blaming you.

424
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,599
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

425
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,639
didn't say I was a
little jealous, I guess.

426
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,319
All right. I understand,

427
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,222
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

428
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,719
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

429
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,839
Correct.

430
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,025
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

431
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,108
SOPHIE:
I'll be out in a minute, sweetheart.

432
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,946
Okay, I'm here.

433
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,701
That's good.

434
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,799
Hey, is that bacon okay?

435
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,999
It's been sitting out for awhile.

436
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,661
It's good.

437
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,039
Good.

438
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,429
Where have you been all morning?

439
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,541
Hanging out, you know.

440
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,786
Cool.

441
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,981
I missed you.

442
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,159
You missed me?

443
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,821
Of course.

444
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,466
Come sit with me.

445
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,350
Okay.

446
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,746
So...

447
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,879
So...

448
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,279
Isn't it crazy to think that
we're actually married?

449
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,079
[GIGGLES]

450
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,706
I guess so.

451
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,839
We are husband and wife.

452
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,079
- I know.
- Yeah.

453
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,820
I love it.

454
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,279
How long have you been
here, by the way?

455
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,799
Since we came yesterday, silly.

456
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,599
No, I mean, in the guest house.

457
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,909
Since we slept here last night.

458
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,439
Uh-oh. Someone's in detective mode.

459
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,719
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

460
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,063
That's okay. I don't mind.

461
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,559
Have you explored the
grounds very much?

462
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,903
I think I have a pretty
good sense of it.

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,879
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

464
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,399
It is. Would you like to
go on a walk with me?

465
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,399
Not really right now, but you're
welcome to go on a walk.

466
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,470
It's your vacation, too.

467
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,341
Okay.

468
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,279
I'll see you in a little bit, Sophie.

469
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,862
Okay, Ethan.

470
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,941
Whoa!

471
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,919
- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

472
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,399
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

473
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,559
- She is?
- Yeah.

474
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,119
I threw out some soft challenges.

475
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,759
She is unflappable.

476
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,839
I think when you go in there...

477
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,959
God, it's crazy.

478
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,839
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

479
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,519
from our past and see how he reacts.

480
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,599
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

481
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,319
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

482
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,279
What if they disappear
or something, you know?

483
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,359
What if they freak out?
I'm just saying what's the harm

484
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,999
in letting them think
that they're us?

485
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,519
Yeah, I mean, I... All right.

486
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,079
There's no harm in it.

487
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,879
I just thought part
of the fun of this

488
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,159
was like the investigation
and trying to...

489
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,519
I know. Of course you thought

490
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,119
the fun was in the investigation.

491
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,359
Wait, hold on.

492
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,199
It's like at the magic show in Vegas
when you told me how the magician

493
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,479
did every single trick

494
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,599
and you ruined the entire show
for me and everyone around us.

495
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,719
Okay. You remember we
talked about the magic show

496
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,719
was three years ago and
we're moving past that?

497
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,319
- Okay.
- Yeah.

498
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,799
Let's go inside.

499
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,359
We'll make up some
ground rules together.

500
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,919
That way neither of us
feels like, you know,

501
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,199
there's any kind of...

502
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,279
Confusion.

503
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,119
- Or just being on the same page.
- Okay.

504
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,719
While we are in the guest house

505
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,159
with the weird people,
no intimacy, no sex.

506
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,919
Yes. Absolutely agreed.

507
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,239
- No sex.
- Good.

508
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,319
What else?

509
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,159
Well, I would say that
would lead me to,

510
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,159
you know, no spying and there
has to be trust involved,

511
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,119
and we'll be honest with each
other about what happens

512
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,439
in the guest house and...

513
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,719
Right. It's like a...

514
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,279
It's like a therapy
exercise in trust almost.

515
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,599
- It's a trust exercise.
- Okay, great.

516
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,839
- That's why we're here.
- Good.

517
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,341
Um...

518
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,239
Let's see.

519
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,599
I guess if there's anything else...

520
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,559
Actually this is kind
of really important

521
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,999
now that I think about it.

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,719
We can have fun with this,
but if at any point either of us

523
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,079
becomes uncomfortable
and wants to stop,

524
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,439
we just cut it off, pack our bags...

525
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,559
Absolutely.

526
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,919
Absolutely. Agreed.

527
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,479
That's a good one,
that's a really good one.

528
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,061
Yeah.

529
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,261
Anything else?

530
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,759
I think that's it.

531
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,199
Then we are done. Those are good.

532
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,999
So since we're just kind of
like dipping our toes in here,

533
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,039
I think maybe we shouldn't
spend too much time in there

534
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,119
the first go-around.

535
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,668
Okay. How does 15 minutes sound?

536
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,919

01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,708
and you don't need any further
explanation than that?

1066
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,159
Sometimes these things just happen.

1067
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,742
Yeah, that's right. They do.

1068
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,706
I don't buy it.

1069
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,919
ETHAN 2: All right.

1070
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,719
One time I read this article
on cosmic occurrences.

1071
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,839
I wish I still had it...
You would love it.

1072
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,559
And it basically says
that aberrations happen.

1073
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,559
You can drive yourself nuts
trying to derive meaning

1074
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,381
from things that have no
meaning to begin with.

1075
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,879
That's so interesting.

1076
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,506
ETHAN 2: It is, isn't it?

1077
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,239
It's not that interesting.

1078
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,679
Let me think of an
little example for you,

1079
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:16,159
something right up your alley.

1080
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,879
Um...

1081
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,679
Let's say you buy a gorilla.

1082
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,227
Excuse me?

1083
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,439
Let's say you buy a gorilla, Ethan.

1084
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,679
You can't buy a gorilla.

1085
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,639
I know that, it was for the story.

1086
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,825
But fine, let's say you
buy an aardvark, okay?

1087
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,119
You take that aardvark,
you put him in a dark room.

1088
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,799
A minute later you flip that
switch, the lights come on.

1089
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,399
Now we all know how
electricity works,

1090
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,519
but for him it's a miracle.

1091
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,879
Magic happened...

1092
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,839
That previously dark
room is now illuminated

1093
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,229
with possibilities he's
never seen before...

1094
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,519
And what does he do?

1095
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,227
Does he ruin it by
questioning how or why?

1096
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,311
No. He enjoys it.

1097
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,599
Huh.

1098
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,909
Well, I'm not an aardvark.

1099
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,509
And I am not a gorilla.

1100
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,425
Don't worry about it. I got it.

Hmm.

1103
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,266
There's a little bit left.

1104
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,107
Should we finish it?

1105
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,359
[SIGHS] This is quite the situation.

1106
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,146
You can say that again.

Has Ethan... I mean your Ethan...

1108
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,599
Have you guys talked about anything

1109
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,039
or has he said anything
to you at all?

1110
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,587
Like What?

1111
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,879
Well, Ethan... My Ethan
and I, we've discussed it.

1112
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,679
Like he knew when I was
going to go in the house

1113
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,399
and I knew when he
was going to and...

1114
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,629
You shared your experiences.

1115
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,719
Yeah, for the most part.

1116
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,827
And you want to know if we
shared our experiences also.

1117
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,990
Guess I'm just curious.

1118
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,826
I can see that.

1119
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,743
You know what I'm curious about?

1120
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,119
Are you more concerned
with the experiences

1121
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,599
that me and your Ethan shared

1122
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,879
or are you more concerned
with what I know

1123
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,860
about the experiences that
you and my Ethan shared?

1124
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,879
Seems to me you care a lot more

1125
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,508
about one of those
scenarios than the other.

1126
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,505
Are you going to give that back?

[SIGHS]

1128
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,799
I say for the sake of
the super fun evening

1129
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,839
we're about to have,
let's keep it simple

1130
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,119
and keep our cheery dispositions

1131
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,679
and I'll keep
complimenting your shoes.

1132
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,799
And you can keep pretending

1133
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,679
that you like the way
I pin my hair back,

1134
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,911
and we'll just have a good
time and see what happens.

1135
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,987
On second thought, do you mind
taking care of those dishes?

1136
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,064
You still haven't told
me where you're from.

1137
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,879
Are we still doing this?

1138
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,839
Are we going to compare
lists of women, too?

1139
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,679
You know, I'm starting
to piece this all together

1140
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,466
and see it for what it is.

1141
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,149
You're trying to sabotage
my relationship.

1142
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,039
Ethan, from what I understand
about your relationships,

1143
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,749
you should be well versed
in the art of self-sabotage.

1144
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,159
The purpose of tonight
is not to engage

Yeah? Why is that?

01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,705

ETHAN 2: It's kings.

1151
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,879
It's kings or it's aces

we're continuing right now.

I basically know every
card you're holding.

1156
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,359
Are you saying that I have a tell?

1157
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,919
You have big tells.

01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,799

Sophie shoulder shrug that
looks a little bit like this.

Oh! Do you do the shrug?

Uh, excuse me. Don't talk to her.

01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,599
She's dead. She folded.

It's just you and me now.

1167
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,199
You did the shoulder shrug.

01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,599
You obviously have a good hand.

1169
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,079
It's like a high pair or
maybe even three of a kind.

01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,759
I have a shit hand.

01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,039
I'm folding. Look at that.

- You're right.

01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,679
I knew you had the aces.

very good at this game...

01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,079
Almost too good.

You're not being very
fun to play with.

The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

Ethan, if you want to win the game,

1191
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,999
you've got to play some hands, okay?

1192
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,626
That's just how it works.

1193
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,070

How many cards do you want?

01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,359
I'm fine with what I have.

1204
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,146
Thank you very much.

1205
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,679
Sticking with what you have.

1206
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,199
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

1207
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,781
What's your move?

1208
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,301
I'm all in.

01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,999
Oh!

1210
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,239
All in, bold move!

sometimes. I really like it.

01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,142
and now I've got to figure
out what is your tell.

1214
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,919
You've got that restless
leg thing going on

1215
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,639
but I think it's just nerves.

1216
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,399
You've been chewing on
the lower lip a little bit,

1217
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,679
but I get ulcers in there, too,

1218
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,919
so maybe that's just what that is.

to call you on this one.

01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,701
What you got?

1225
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,340
Whatever.

1226
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,381
You have nothing and I
win with an ace high.

1227
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,879
Sorry about that, man.

1228
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,190
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

1229
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,879
You win.

1230
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,359
You're an amazing liar.

1231
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,559
Congratulations on being a shithead.

01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,119
- Whoa!
- Ethan, Jesus. Calm down.

1233
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,919
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1234
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,399
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

1235
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,346
You're a pretty decent
liar yourself, right?

1236
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,119

Is this necessary?

1239
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,959
I think it's important that
Sophie knows what's going on.

me what we're talking about?

ETHAN 2: All right, look,

1245
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,639
Ethan was a little suspicious that
something was going on between us,

1246
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,479
so he decided to try and
figure it out for himself.

1247
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,359
It was actually kind
of a brilliant move.

1248
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,839
He didn't go to the grocery store.

1249
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,439
He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,

1250
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,479
and in a strange twist of events,

1251
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,079
he pretended to be me,

1252
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,759
so you actually slept
with Ethan instead of me.

1253
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,039
I can't fucking pretend
to be you... I am me.

are you talking about?

you by sleeping with someone else

1260
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,908

you by sleeping with you.
