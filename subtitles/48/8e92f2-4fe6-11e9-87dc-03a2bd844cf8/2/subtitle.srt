1
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:13,150
This lighter's ancient.

2
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:24,161
Can we hold hands?

3
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:31,168
Go ahead.

4
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:38,175
Holding hands like this,
my anxiety goes away.

5
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:19,216
Go.

6
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,231
It's toppled.

7
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:26,234
Oh, is it.

8
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,235
You can eat it.

9
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:28,236
Let me.

10
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,237
No, it's dangerous.

11
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:31,239
Hey, watch out.

12
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,240
It's really dangerous.

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,233
Sorry.

14
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:46,254
The thin one is definitely better.

15
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:50,258
No, the thick one is better.

16
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,261
Single means many pulls.

17
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:57,265
Even with double,
you must pull many times.

18
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,266
Cheapskate.

19
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,268
What a dummy.

20
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:03,271
Shut up.

21
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,274
No, really. Raise your hands like this.

22
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,276
Then, everybody'll do the same.

23
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:10,278
It's amazing.

24
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:11,279
Like this.

25
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:15,272
That's it.

26
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,290
Embarrassed?

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,291
I'm not.

28
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,293
You are.

29
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,294
No.

30
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:32,290
You're so starchy.

31
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:19,335
What's the matter?

32
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:29,346
Can I stay here?

33
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,352
I'll be mad.

34
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:41,358
I'll be mad, if you don't stay.

35
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:19,456
Was thinking you're so warm.

36
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,490
You surprised me.

37
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,491
The leeks.

38
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,494
The leeks? You'll break them.

39
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:50,498
Don't worry.

40
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,501
Toshi, your hand is cold.

41
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,504
I have poor blood circulation.

42
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,506
I'll buy you gloves.

43
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:02,499
No, I don't need any gloves.

44
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:11,508
Hey... hey...

45
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:23,520
Ai, they want to
shoot your second film

46
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,534
around next Monday.

47
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:30,527
All right.

48
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,544
You should say what's in your mind.

49
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:39,547
But that's a different issue.

50
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:42,550
Ouch. Damn.

51
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,552
Mr. Nakao, I'm right, huh?

52
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:47,555
It's a different issue.

53
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:48,556
Mr. Nakao.

54
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,558
AI MIZUKI

55
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:53,561
I'm coming.

56
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:57,554
Come on, Ai.

57
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:17,634
"From Silence."

58
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,660
A-i...

59
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:48,676
Okay, camera, close in.

60
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:52,669
Ah... Please stay in that position.

61
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:58,686
That's an okay. Thank you.

62
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:01,689
That was good, Ai. Miya, thanks.

63
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:05,693
Let's check it.

64
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:09,686
Miss Ai...?

65
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,701
Tell me... Who's the real Ai?

66
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:32,720
There's a picture
on the record jacket.

67
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,722
You saw it?

68
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,724
Toshi, what are you doing?

69
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:40,728
Who are you talking to? hurry.

70
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:44,732
Where are you?

71
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:48,725
There's no time to explain. Sorry.

72
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:08,745
Kanai, come right now. If you don't...

73
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:17,754
I'll kill myself.

74
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,767
How much would it cost...
to quit being in pornflicks?

75
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,784
5 million.

76
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:40,777
It says so in the contract.

77
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:49,786
Was that
what you were thinking of?

78
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:47,844
Your body temperature's high.

79
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:52,849
Please go.

80
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,873
See you.

81
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,902
What happened?

82
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,905
I lost the key.

83
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:41,909
I don't mean that.

84
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,912
Toshi...?

85
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:48,905
Can't you quit the porn?

86
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,928
Quit it.

87
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:04,921
I want to, but to quit I need money.

88
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:12,929
It'll cost me 5 million to quit.

89
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:16,944
So what?

90
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,937
Are you satisfied now?

91
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,943
You're hopeless.

92
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,958
Wait.

93
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,951
Toshi.

94
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:48,976
My, my. You've done some good work.

95
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:52,980
A volunteer for unfortunate men.

96
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,973
ental for 7 nights and 8 days - 380.

97
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:02,990
I wonder why...

98
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,993
Why do I have to lend you money

99
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,996
to make you and your pimp's
future a bright one?

100
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:12,989
It's totally beyond my comprehension.

101
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,994
Mr. Ishikawa,
have you ever been in love?

102
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,009
In my case

103
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:26,002
I love people who love me.

104
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,021
I'lll lend you money

105
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:38,014
but you have to have collateral.

106
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:43,019
How about your life?

107
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,042
It was terrific tonight.

108
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,043
Wasn't it?

109
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,044
Please come again.

110
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:59,046
Yes, we will.

111
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,049
Toshi.

112
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,042
I need to talk to you.

113
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:10,057
Sorry, I 'm busy.

114
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,058
Come on.

115
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,060
Who is that?

116
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,062
The girl he Iives with.

117
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:19,055
So... That's who she is.

118
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,069
Who the hell are you?

119
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:24,071
Just a grown-up.

120
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:28,075
What the...?

121
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:32,068
So sorry.
She seems to be drunk.

122
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:41,088
You're impossible.

123
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:45,092
I'm working.

124
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,085
I'm just someone you live with?

125
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:54,090
I quit the porn flick business today.

126
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:02,109
I did it for you.

127
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:06,113
You don't answer the cell phone.

128
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:09,116
You don't come home.

129
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:13,120
You don't understand me.

130
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,113
Where did you get the money?
Did you borrow it from someone?

131
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:25,121
From a friend.

132
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:30,126
Think of a better lie.

133
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:50,146
Toshi, forgive me. I'm so sorry.

134
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:55,151
Excuse me.

135
00:16:56,163 --> 00:17:00,156
Toshi...

136
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,162
Toshi...

137
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:32,188
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,193
Don't worry. I won't have the baby.

139
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:42,209
That's not the point.

140
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:45,212
You want me to have the baby?

141
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:49,205
This is no place to...

142
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:52,219
You're always conscious of others.

143
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:55,222
What do you mean?

144
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:59,215
Think of the place.

145
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:16,243
Hold on.

146
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:18,245
No thanks.

147
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:22,238
Your body's not yours alone.

148
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:52,268
Hey... Hey.
How come you're quitting?

149
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:59,286
You never mentioned
a word about it.

150
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:03,279
You're dumping it all?

151
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:10,286
So you're ignoring me. That's nice.

152
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,316
Hey, use your hips. Harder.

153
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:33,309
I'll try.

154
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:51,327
My God.

155
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:32,368
Well? How do you Iike it?

156
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:39,375
I'll eat, too.

157
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:46,382
Do you know a Mr. Ishikawa?

158
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:53,389
5 million? What's
your relationship to him?

159
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:59,395
He's just a friend.

160
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:04,400
Sleep with him?

161
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:12,408
Lends you 5 million, because
he's just a friend? Don't lie to me.

162
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:22,429
Don't believe me?

163
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,422
How can I?

164
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:34,430
Did you get me the money?

165
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:39,435
The 5 million?

166
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:45,452
Say it: "have an abortion."

167
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:48,455
You won't do anything.

168
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:52,448
Just a pose.

169
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,484
I'll pay back the money.

170
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:21,477
I don't have it now,
but please give me time.

171
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:29,496
Don't have it now, but will pay back?

172
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:32,499
You expect me to believe that?

173
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,492
You're wet behind your ears.

174
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:42,498
Toshi, you're such
an amazing narcissist.

175
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,503
The only one in pain.
Does it feel good?

176
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:52,508
Being with you,
she seems to sink deeper and deeper.

177
00:22:57,524 --> 00:23:01,517
Some housewives take part in
citizens movement, but donate nothing.

178
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,535
Friends of yours?

179
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:12,528
Let's go.

180
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,533
Hey.

181
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:24,551
Shut up.

182
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,555
Go ahead.

183
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:32,548
Give me a break.

184
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:39,555
I wholeheartedly hate your kind.

185
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:44,560
Whoever gets my car gets 500,000.

186
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:13,600
Oh, sorry.

187
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,593
All right.

188
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:24,600
Sometimes I get this urge
to really strangle him.

189
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:29,616
Come here.

190
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:33,620
Ah... Your husband...?

191
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,623
He's hooked on a girl in his office.

192
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:39,626
Hasn't come home for 2 months.

193
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,627
Revealed his true colors.

194
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:43,630
I wasn't smart enough to detect it.

195
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,623
Won't pay alimony and
refuses to accept he's the father.

196
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:50,637
It's almost like a soap drama.

197
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:54,641
Hmmm... This is Ai.

198
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:58,645
This is Yutaro.

199
00:24:58,645 --> 00:25:02,638
Huh? Has he...?
Oh, yes. He's pooped again.

200
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:07,654
I'm constantly changing diapers.

201
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:11,658
What're you going to do about work?

202
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:15,651
Well, something should come up.

203
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:21,657
Why don't you
catch another man and remarry?

204
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:23,670
You can...

205
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,663
Sorry. Can you keep quiet for a while?

206
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:51,687
Ouch. So hot.

207
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,703
Eat it.

208
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:13,709
What could be the most
unfortunate thing in this world?

209
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:19,715
To be born, I guess.

210
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:23,730
As far as life is concerned

211
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,723
you and the sweet potato
are equally meaningless.

212
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:33,729
It's absolute nonsense.

213
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:42,738
It's such a hassle... to live.

214
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:28,784
Doctor, she's ready.

215
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,804
Now, let's count together.

216
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:41,797
1... 2...3... 4...5...

217
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:24,851
"Dear Ai,
You may realize"

218
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:28,844
"what is most precious to you
when it is no longer there.""

219
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,893
She was my sister.

220
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:10,897
Your sister?

221
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:14,890
If she were alive, she'd be 17,
but she committed suicide.

222
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:38,914
For a long time,
she was bullied in school.

223
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm the only one who knows that.

224
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,926
She phoned me. If I had answered,
she probably wouldn't have died.

225
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:01,937
My sister's name was... Ai.

226
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:11,947
I was seriously going to
kill the ones who bullied her.

227
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:21,957
Then, strangely, someone
responded to the maill addressed

228
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,963
to my dead sister.

229
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:42,978
I wanted that person to be happy.

230
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,994
Let's have a good life... with the baby.

231
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:10,005
Why tell me that now?

232
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:20,015
I had... an abortion.

233
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:27,022
You're kidding.

234
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:35,030
Would have been better, if I weren't Ai.

235
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:43,038
Then, you could've been
much, much happier.

236
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:03,058
It can't be true.

237
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:22,077
It's so strange...
I was lonelier, when I was with you.

238
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,093
We should never have met.

239
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:07,122
I'm sorry.

240
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:39,165
Why?

241
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:43,158
Why does it end up like this?

242
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:19,194
3 MONTHS LATER

243
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:10,245
Dear Toshi,
Where are you?

244
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:20,266
I'm alone again.

245
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:22,268
I've seen your video.

246
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:26,272
You know. You know. That...
Was it real? Was it really real?

247
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:28,274
Your autograph here.

248
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:30,276
"Where are you? I'm alone again.""

249
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:34,269
"DELETED""

250
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:44,279
Remember he had a fight?

251
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,284
At a video store, he took away
your video from a complete stranger

252
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:55,290
and told him not to rent it.

253
00:35:56,302 --> 00:36:00,295
He was dangerously angry.

254
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:06,301
I had never seen him so angry.

255
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:13,308
Don't records make sounds

256
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:19,314
by touching the grooves with a needle?

257
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:26,321
Sounds so painful.

258
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:50,356
Well? Got the swing of it?

259
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:52,358
Yes, sir.

260
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,361
Can you be in more often?

261
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:57,363
I kinda like your style.

262
00:36:57,363 --> 00:36:59,365
Thank you.

263
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:02,368
What do you think?

264
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:04,370
It's great.

265
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,371
Groovy.

266
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:08,374
Yes.

267
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:12,378
Well?

268
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:16,371
Yes, sir.

269
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:33,448
Your turn.

270
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:41,467
Oh, c'mon. Don't cry.
Your mommy's here.

271
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,469
All right. All right.

272
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:47,462
Don't cry.
All right. All right.

273
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:54,469
You know, he stops crying
when I hold his hand.

274
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:09,484
What's the matter?

275
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:25,500
I think I did something
absolutely horrendous.

276
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:36,511
I destroyed everything.

277
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:43,518
I ruined every bit of
what was precious to him.

278
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:53,528
The best punishment for you

279
00:39:57,543 --> 00:40:01,536
is to face the person
you inflicted pain on.

280
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,552
Huh? Did you poop? Did you poop?

281
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:22,568
God, you stink.

282
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:25,571
Akemi.

283
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:29,564
You're really beautiful.

284
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:46,641
"O-ni-i-chan (brother)..."

285
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,661
"Onii-chan.""

286
00:41:55,661 --> 00:41:58,664
"Onii-chan."

287
00:41:58,664 --> 00:42:02,657
"Yo-wa-i-ko-de (l'm so weak)."

288
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:12,678
"Gomenne (Forgive me)."

289
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:16,671
I'm sorry I couldn't
return anything to you.

290
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:23,678
Please grant my last wish.

291
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:29,684
Please become
the happiest person in the world.

292
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:37,692
I hope what your hands grab

293
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:42,697
will, I sincerely hope, be

294
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:47,702
somebody's warm hands.

295
00:42:50,716 --> 00:42:54,709
"Thank you. - Love, Ai""

296
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:11,726
"Love, Ai."

297
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,769
Let's cross the pedestrian walk.

298
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,771
Masashi, hold hands.

299
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:46,772
No.

300
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:49,775
I don't want anyone Jumping out.

301
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:53,768
Understand?

302
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:17,792
"Dear Ai""

303
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:31,806
"To my most precious person.""

304
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:51,826
"Dear Toshi""

305
00:44:57,843 --> 00:44:59,845
Hello? Is that you, Toshi?

306
00:44:59,845 --> 00:45:02,848
This is the Motohama Police Station.

307
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,850
are you Miss Kadokura?

308
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:08,843
We have some bad news
concerning Mr. Toshimi Iwasaki.

309
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,873
Can't you quit the porn?

310
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,883
Your body's not yours alone.

311
00:47:10,976 --> 00:47:14,969
TO AOI

312
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,993
Your hand's so cold, Toshi.

313
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,014
Your poor blood circulation.

314
00:47:49,014 --> 00:47:53,007
I wanted to treasure you

315
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:03,017
but instead, I destroyed you.

316
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:30,055
Mr. Ishikawa.

317
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:33,058
No money for you.

318
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:36,061
It's not that.

319
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:38,063
Then, return it.

320
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:42,056
Why don't you prostitute
and pay back my 5 million?

321
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:48,062
Pay back all your life.

322
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:57,071
Don't you get it?
Your body's not yours alone.

323
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:54,128
"YOU'VE GOT MAIL"

324
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,133
"FROM TOSHI""

325
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,143
To my most precious person.

326
00:50:11,156 --> 00:50:15,160
Happy Birthday.

327
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,153
Knowing that you're alive...
this alone makes me happy.

328
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:26,171
Even if we meet again

329
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:30,164
it'll probably be the same.

330
00:50:31,176 --> 00:50:35,169
We'll inflict pain on each other.

331
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:40,174
We'll be angry, cry and laugh.

332
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:47,181
Still, I want to
hold hands with you once again.

333
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:56,201
I'm no good without you.

334
00:50:56,201 --> 00:51:00,194
Thank you for being born.

335
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:08,202
Toshi.

336
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:55,249
You got me!

337
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Saki Kagami
