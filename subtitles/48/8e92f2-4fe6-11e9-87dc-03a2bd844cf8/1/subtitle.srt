Do you know what day today is?

10
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,595
Do you remember?

11
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,611
Of course you don't.

"MESSAGE CANNOT BE SENT"

16
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,675
What am I doing?

17
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,730
"Dear Ai,
Happy Birthday."

18
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,739
"Isn't it cold there? - Toshi"

19
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,746
Ai...? Who's she?
It must be the wrong address.

20
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,754
Where shall we go?

21
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,785
Let's go.

22
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,778
Can't go home.

23
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,795
"I became 17 years old today."

24
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,811
"There 's a birthday cake.
and everybody's here."

25
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,804
"It's quite warm here."

26
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,831
"Dear Ai,
Thanks for answering my message."

27
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,838
"Knowing that you're alive...
this alone makes me happy."

28
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,846
"Thank you for being born. - Toshi"

29
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,898
Can I stay over tonight?

30
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,901
What? Tonight?

31
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,894
My friends are coming over.
Sorry. Some other time.

32
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
Hello?

33
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
Aoi? Is that you?

34
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
Hi. What's up?

35
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,919
Listen. I'm really in a fix.

36
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,922
Well. what about your home?

37
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,925
Hell, I haven't been home.

38
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
What? Are you in trouble?

39
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,930
Well, this and that.

40
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
Say, can I stay over?

41
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,925
Sorry. My boyfriend's
coming over tonight.

42
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,945
Damn.

43
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,938
I'm starving.

44
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,947
Give me a break.

45
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,966
Have some time?

46
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
Hop in.

47
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,969
Let's go.

48
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,962
To the beach.

49
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
Aoi.

50
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
What's up?

51
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,991
Tatsuya, what're you doing?

52
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Free now?

53
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
A ride?

54
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,995
Come with us.

55
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,998
You've had enough to drink,
but should have some more.

56
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
Go buy booze.

57
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,002
Go buy booze? It's dangerous.

58
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm kinda sick.

59
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
Tatsuya, drive.

60
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
Let's go.

61
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,013
Huh? on.

62
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,015
Hey, what're you doing?

63
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,018
Damn. I'm losing my reason.

64
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
What're you doing?

65
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,012
Stop it. Aren't we friends?

66
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
Stop it.

67
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
Stop it.

68
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,032
- Okay, hold her.
- I'm next, right?

69
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,025
Stop it.

70
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,057
Don't look up.

71
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,073
Do you like sex that much?

72
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,066
Took care of transferring you
to another school.

73
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,071
Hello?... Yes... What's the matter?

74
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,086
Satoshi, go upstairs.

75
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,089
No, nothing's wrong.

76
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,093
The neighbors know about it now.

77
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,096
It's best for you.

78
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,099
Best for you two.

79
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,092
Sorry. It's nothing.

80
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
Give it back.

81
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,108
You little slut...

82
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,101
Remember? I'm the victim.

83
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:26,114
What are you doing?

84
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,142
Seems I shouldn't have
been born in the first place.

85
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,162
- C'mon, let's go.
- Come on.

86
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
- Hop in.
- Come on.

87
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
Let's go to karaoke.

88
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
- Let's go to karaoke.
- Let's go.

89
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
You're coming? Really coming?

90
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,172
What?

91
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
What's wrong?

92
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,166
Poor sport.

93
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,185
But, manager.

94
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,178
A transfer is... What I'm trying to say...

95
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,192
Damn the transfer.

96
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,185
I don't want to go to that dept.

97
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,196
Do you understand "transfer"?

98
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,201
Wasn't my error, but they blamed me.

99
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,219
I guess you wouldn't understand.

100
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
Office workers...

101
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,213
Hurry up and do
what you came here for.

102
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,218
Isn't it a waste of time?

103
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,239
WHAT'S YOUR PRICE?

104
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,255
"Thank you for being born. - Toshi"

105
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,262
Dear Toshi

106
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,267
We all seem to have a price. don't we?

107
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,274
Seems my price is 20,000.

108
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,279
"Aoi"

109
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,286
A-i.

110
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,292
Ai...

111
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,311
What're you doing? Are you alone?

112
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,319
Would you, by any chance, be interested
in becoming a model or an actress?

113
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,325
Sorry, too close.

114
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,358
Kanai, are you at it again?

115
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
C'mon, have some pity.

116
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
She has nowhere to go.

117
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,363
That's not the issue.

118
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
Sorry. A phone call.

119
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
Kanai.

120
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
'Morning.

121
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,373
Good morning.

122
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
Brought a girl again.

123
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,379
Hey, forget the phone. Can't you...

124
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,380
Oh, come on.

125
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
It's a business.

126
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
As I told you...

127
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,385
So what? Hire her.

128
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,387
You, too?

129
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,390
Listen to her.

130
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,383
Look at those sneakers...
Maybe it's a fad, but they have to go.

131
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,401
Here... To the newcomer.

132
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,405
If there's anything
you need, call me.

133
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,406
See you.

134
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
She's all yours.

135
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
Good morning.

136
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,413
Good morning.

137
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,417
Oh, yeah, what's your name?

138
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,421
Ah... It's Ai.

139
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,414
Ai? I see. How do you do?

140
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,437
Hi, I'm Yuki. How do you do?

141
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,439
Miss Akemi to Table 3.

142
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,442
You take me for a hick?

143
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm from Miyamae, Kanagawa.

144
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,446
I'm 45.

145
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,450
Really? I thought you were in your 30s.

146
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,452
You're flattering me.

147
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
You believe that?

148
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
People all say that.

149
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,459
I'm sure they do.

150
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,452
Ai, the lighter.

151
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,461
You're not enthusiastic. Be nice,
or you won't have any custOmers.

152
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,475
Leave her alone.

153
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,468
Don't your parents complain
about working in such a place?

154
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,483
Let's forget the serious talk.

155
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
And you come to such a place.

156
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,488
What? What did you say?

157
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,481
You tell me to work hard
then not to work in such a place?

158
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,489
That old man has super bad breath.
He should shut up and just smile.

159
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,506
They're not so bad.

160
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,509
Money.

161
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,512
Okay. Let's go.

162
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,505
Hey, wait.

163
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,514
My lashes are precious.

164
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,520
That old man gave me this.
It's 2.8 million.

165
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,539
Be nice and you'll get lucky.

166
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,532
In this business, whatever
you earn becomes your price.

167
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,561
Dear Toshi.
What is most precious to you?

168
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,593
"E-mail pal?"

169
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,597
They're great, but don't meet them.

170
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
I did. So disappointing.

171
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
What's your real age?

172
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,603
I don't mean you.

173
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,596
It's not that.

174
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
Keigo is so terrific.

175
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,628
So heart throbbing.

176
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,621
Say, when do you think
we'll be able to enter the booth?

177
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,650
Hey, can you two go there?

178
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,652
Clean up the table.

179
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,645
Yes, sir.

180
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,756
Dear Ai

181
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,749
You may realize

182
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,754
what is most precious to you
when it is no longer there.

183
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,764
What is most precious to you?

184
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783
Here. For you.

185
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,786
Thank you. It's so cute.

186
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,788
How about after work tonight?

187
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,790
You mean it?

188
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
Excuse me.

189
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,794
These are also for Miss Ai.

190
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
Wow.

191
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,789
Dear Toshi.
Money is most precious to me.

192
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,797
People talk about things
money can't buy

193
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,802
but it would be miserable,
not even to have things money can buy.

194
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
Huh? Akemi?

195
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
Hi.

196
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,823
They're so expensive.

197
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,826
But, they say
this is only available this year.

198
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,829
And this... only one more left.

199
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,831
So I bought them.

200
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,834
Look. Isn't it super cute?

201
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,837
Shall I go for it?

202
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,841
What're you going to do with it?

203
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,843
What do you think about me?

204
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,846
You must tell me tonight.

205
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm serious about you.

206
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,843
But Mr. Yamazaki,
you have a wife and children.

207
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,857
I don't think it's proper to...

208
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,850
Sir... Ah, please, sir... Ah...

209
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,866
Sorry.

210
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,867
Any request, sir?

211
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,860
Yes, the most wretched girl.

212
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,867
So you were gang raped, forsaken
by your parents and became a runaway.

213
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,886
My father beat me up.

214
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,889
I see.

215
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,882
Like over here.
I still have a scar.

216
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,897
Anything else?

217
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,890
Don't you have some other sales-point?

218
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,895
I have a debt... 3.2 million.

219
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,910
Got hooked on some man?

220
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,914
No, got hooked on designer brands.

221
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,907
Seems I couldn't stop shopping.

222
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,912
50 points.

223
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,918
50 points at most for your misery.

224
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,923
Ah... What do you do?

225
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
H. Ishikawa, benefactor...
What's a benefactor?

226
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,944
A god-like person who offers
the greatest grace to the poor souls.

227
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
An angel.

228
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,951
An angel...

229
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,965
10,000 per point.

230
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,995
This is Wako Finance.

231
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,988
We haven't yet received
your payment this month.

232
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,004
Hello?

233
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,006
Mr. Kanai?

234
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,008
Ai. what's the matter?

235
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,011
I'm so tired. Pick me up now.

236
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:17,015
You're tired? Hang on a while.

237
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,017
I can't go right now.

238
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,020
If you don't come

239
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,013
I'll kill myself.

240
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,020
You're such a bastard.

241
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,039
What did you do?

242
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,032
Asked me what I thought of her
so told her she had no eye brows.

243
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,050
You're such a heartless person.

244
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,052
Nakao...

245
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:58,045
your nostril hairs.

246
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,063
Dear Ai

247
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:09,056
Someone told me I was heartless.

248
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,074
Perhaps, because I am heartless

249
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,067
there is nothing precious to me.

250
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,084
You're the most popular at the joint

251
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,086
because you're cute.

252
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,090
You say the same thing to everybody?

253
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,094
Dumped everything else and came.

254
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:40,087
I wonder how much a heart costs.

255
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,093
Here. A celebration for 2 months.

256
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,111
Exactly 2 months today, right?

257
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,104
Working there?

258
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,109
No, since we met.

259
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,134
Dear Toshi

260
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,127
I think you can buy a heart
for only about 100.

261
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,144
A hard drinker?

262
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:30,137
Make the drinks.

263
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,151
Some ice, please.

264
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,155
Mr. Ishikawa, how much
does that watch cost?

265
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
10 million.

266
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,157
You're joking...

267
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,159
Let me see.

268
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,152
It's marvelous.

269
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,167
I told you it's a sure thing.

270
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,169
Give me a call.

271
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,172
Okay, see you later. Bye.

272
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,175
This is for the 3 remaining months.

273
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,177
This is Ai's, right?

274
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,170
Yes... Goodbye.

275
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,176
Thank you very much for coming.

276
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,185
So that's how you take a cut.

277
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:28,195
From Ai?

278
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,215
From whom?

279
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,218
My debt increases day by day.

280
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,220
It's sad to be young.

281
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,224
Pretty soon, it'll be hell.
You poor thing.

282
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,227
Well, I'm not scared of anything.

283
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,220
It's cool. It's cool.
The Californian blue... dummy.

284
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,261
So she's forgotten me.

285
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,281
There's nobody booked for Monday.

286
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,274
Want to try the booth?

287
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,288
Yes, sir.

288
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,281
Okay, you're in.

289
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,338
Is Miss Kadokura home?

290
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,331
Is Miss Kadokura home? Miss Kadokura.

291
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,348
Miss Kadokura. Miss Kadokura.

292
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,351
Miss Kadokura, aren't you home?

293
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,354
I know you're home.

294
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,358
Miss Kadokura.

295
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,351
Can't be real.

296
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,358
"Carnage hell..."

297
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,364
"Carnage hell..."

298
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,371
You want to talk to me about something?

299
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,376
It was a popular song
in the 70s. Know it?

300
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,392
This song really puts me off.

301
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,396
Really? I think it's so hot.

302
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,398
Where are we going?

303
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,391
To no man's land.

304
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,412
LITTLE LAMB ORPHANAGE

305
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,405
It's uncle.

306
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,420
Uncle. Uncle.

307
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,424
Over here... I'm pretty respected.

308
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,426
I'm popular.

309
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,428
Hey, don't open it.

310
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,429
Damn noisy kids.

311
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,422
Go on. Go on. Scram.

312
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,438
It's the summer bonus.

313
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,431
Can you guess why
they're so attached to me?

314
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,447
Money. Because of
the money I donate here.

315
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,440
Hey, you kids can't survive without me.

316
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,446
Really cool kids.
Ass lickers. So obvious.

317
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,461
Misery is so radiant.

318
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,464
Your misery is a full score, too.

319
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,468
Here's your bonus. Go away. Go on.

320
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,469
Okay. Go away.

321
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,462
I guess I 'm like
these kids, Mr. Ishikawa.

322
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,468
Please lend me money...
Lend me 5 million.

323
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,485
I won't.

324
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,487
How come?

325
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,480
I don't feel Iike it.
My intuition says "NO"

326
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,497
Even if I sleep with you?

327
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,499
Sleep? You mean sex?

328
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,502
Even animals do it. Why me?

329
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,506
Why should I lend you
my precious money?

330
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,510
Don't get it. It's nonsense.

331
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,503
Come on... Here.

332
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,517
Come on. ouch. ouch.

333
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,510
Do you think I'm in love
with you or something?

334
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,517
Dummy.

335
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,540
There won't be a better offer.

336
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,544
I'm serious. You'll get 5 million.

337
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,548
You'll be an actress. An actress.

338
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,551
It's porn.

339
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,544
You don't understand.
Not everyone can do it.

340
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,549
I negotiated and recommended you.

341
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,555
Do you understand?
You're now worth 5 million.

342
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,577
If parents find out?

343
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,580
None of their business.

344
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,584
I'll be classified as an actress.

345
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,587
It's one entrance to showbiz.

346
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,590
Higher level than the sex industry.

347
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,583
You'll be doing the same thing.

348
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,588
It's about someone
telling me I'm worth 5 million.

349
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,595
Then, what's the problem?

350
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,605
Akemi... are you getting married?

351
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,610
When I got pregnant, I was sure
he'd tell me to have an abortion.

352
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,626
But he was overjoyed.

353
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,619
So I thought it wouldn't
be bad to have a baby.

354
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,632
Besides, I'm fed up with this job.

355
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,650
Ai, it's your choice.

356
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,643
It's your own life.

357
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,666
Dear Toshi

358
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,659
The only definite thing in this world

359
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,675
may perhaps be
that human beings are all alone.

360
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,677
Say, what about this?

361
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,670
It's not bad,
but it'll overlap with Keigo's.

362
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,675
Even if... even if I die now

363
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,683
no one may notice it.

364
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,697
"Even if I die now,
no one may notice it. - Ai"

365
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,741
"First Party shall pay 1 million
performance fee per film to Second."

366
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,760
"5 million for 5 films
shall be paid at the beginning."

367
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,753
It means: appear in 5 films.

368
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,758
"If Second Party fails to fulfill
the terms of this contract"

369
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,775
"Second Party must pay
the above as penalty."

370
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,768
If you take off, you pay him.

371
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,773
I hope you understand the terms.

372
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,779
Your seal here.

373
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,800
All right.

374
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,803
No career yet, but records pile up.

375
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,807
Sorry. Can you go on ahead?

376
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm sorry.

377
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,811
Since she'll be 18 years old
on the 1st, don't schedule

378
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,826
the shooting before that.

379
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,829
Birthday? That sounds great.

380
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,822
Can you schedule
the shooting on Nov. 1st?

381
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,827
"Even if I die now,
no one may notice it. - Ai"

382
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,889
All right. Cut. Okay.

383
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,892
Well done.

384
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,896
All right? Are you nervous?

385
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,899
Not really.

386
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,892
Miss Ai, the next shoot.

387
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,901
Here... Happy Birthday.

388
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,908
Good luck.

389
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,940
Ai.

390
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,956
Ai, you smell good.

391
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,957
Stop it, Masao.

392
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,960
C'mon, Ai.

393
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,964
You said you'd let me,
because it's your birthday.

394
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,968
All right. Cut. Cut.

395
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,971
If you have trouble with the lines

396
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,973
say "don't" or something.

397
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,976
And your leg... raise it a bit.

398
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,978
Like this? Relax.

399
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Yes, a bit more.

400
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,981
Okay?

401
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,983
Yes, that's good. Okay.

402
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,986
Let's try again.

403
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,990
Ai, I love you.

404
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,993
Ai, let me do it.

405
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,986
Please, Ai.

406
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,015
I told you it's all true.

407
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,018
I never lie.

408
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,021
Call me again. See you.

409
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,025
Good work.

410
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:12,018
Shall we go eat?

411
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,034
How much kickback?

412
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,027
What kickback?

413
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,032
I'm walking home.

414
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,065
Dear Ai

415
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,069
Happy Birthday.

416
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:56,062
There's a song
I want you to listen to.

417
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:02,068
It's NOT AT ALL 's "From Silence."
- Toshi

418
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,152
Dear Toshi.
Thank you for the present.

419
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,205
Boy, it was another tough day.

420
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,207
Who wants after-work dates?

421
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:14,200
Doesn't that old man get it?

422
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,205
Ai.

423
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,244
This song...

424
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,248
Well? From that beat to this song

425
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,251
may be a bit unorthodox.

426
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,244
Not bad. It's definitely his style.

427
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,265
That D.J....

428
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,269
You mean Toshi?

429
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,271
Toshi?

430
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,273
What's wrong?

431
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,266
Just that...

432
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:01,307
"Dear Toshi.
Thank you for the present. - Ai"

433
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,372
I love records and...

434
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,365
The grooves on a record
are basically just scars

435
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,372
and sounds come out
by touching them with a needle.

436
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,378
It's like they're alive.

437
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,394
Sounds painful.

438
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,387
For the record.

439
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,398
Wow. You live in a terrific place.

440
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,409
See you.

441
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,415
Ah...

442
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,431
I lost my key.

443
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,424
You're kidding.

444
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,438
Cold?

445
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,431
I'm okay.
